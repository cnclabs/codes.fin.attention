item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
you should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations with the consolidated and combined financial statements and the accompanying notes to the consolidated and combined financial statements included elsewhere in this document 
this discussion contains forward looking statements and involves numerous risks and uncertainties  including  but not limited to  those described in the risk factors section of this item our actual results may differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statements 
overview this overview is not a complete discussion of our financial condition  changes in financial condition and results of operations  it is intended merely to facilitate an understanding of the most salient aspects of our financial condition and operating performance and to provide a context for the discussion that follows 
the detailed discussion and analysis that follows must be read in its entirety in order to fully understand our financial condition and results of operations 
we are a worldwide developer  manufacturer and supplier of liquid and gas delivery systems  components and consumables used to precisely measure  deliver  control and purify the process liquids  gases and chemicals that are used in the semiconductor manufacturing process 
prior to march  our business was operated as a fully integrated business unit of millipore corporation 
we became an independent company through a spin off by millipore  which was completed in february of since  our focus has been to complete our separation from millipore and to restructure our operations to be appropriate for a stand alone company and to respond to the severe downturn faced by the semiconductor industry since during the second half of  as business conditions improved  we were able to pursue other initiatives and to complete our first acquisition 
the principal market we serve is the global semiconductor industry  a highly cyclical business 
since early  this industry has faced a severe downturn  and as a result  we have experienced significant deterioration in net sales and results of operations since this downturn had the greatest impact on our sales of liquid and gas equipment products  as new semiconductor plant construction and upgrades declined 
net sales of our consumable products tend to be driven by capacity utilization so that the recovery of the volume of semiconductor wafers being built in benefited these products 
during the fourth quarter of  we experienced strong revenue growth and improved profitability 
we expect this improvement in the semiconductor industry to continue into with a positive impact on our sales growth and profitability 
as the depth of the semiconductor downturn continued from into  product demand deteriorated causing lower overhead absorption due to the reduced production volumes and a resulting decrease in gross profit margins from to 
as business activity started to recover and we started to benefit from our manufacturing consolidation and restructuring programs  during  gross margins increased to 
while we maintained our research and development expenditures during the period at million in  million in and million in  cost savings from our restructuring programs in and and reductions in discretionary spending throughout the period caused our selling  general and administrative expenses to decline from million in to million in to million in despite our operating losses  our operations generated positive cash flows of million in  million in and million in by effectively managing working capital 
capital expenditures for property  plant and equipment were million in  million in and million in capital expenditures during this period were primarily used for the purchase of production and research and development equipment and the transfer of manufacturing operations from millipore facilities 
most of our separation related programs have now been completed 
during  we also used approximately million to acquire certain assets of privately held aeronex  inc a manufacturer of gas purifiers and as a deposit for certain assets of another privately held company 
during  we expect to invest between to million on capital expenditures primarily related to the purchase of manufacturing and r d equipment 
we believe that our cash  investments and expected future cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital  capital expenditure  and research and development investment requirements for the next months 
however  in order to take advantage of growth opportunities  we may elect to raise capital through equity or debt financing 
to that end  we filed a shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission  which became effective on november  our separation from millipore corporation in connection with our separation from millipore  we entered into agreements with millipore under which millipore agreed to provide services to us during a transition period after the separation date 
the agreements related to facilities services  information technology services  distribution  accounting  finance and other services and arrangements 
under these agreements  we reimbursed millipore for the cost of these services 
the duration of the different transition service agreements varied depending on the anticipated time it would take for us to replace the service  generally for a one year period 
the last major step in our separation from millipore was terminating the use of millipore s information technology data center  which was completed during the first half of in accordance with our original transition service agreement 
as these transition service agreements expired without renewal  we were able to provide these services ourselves or negotiate new agreements with various third parties at costs at least as favorable as those paid to millipore for these services 
upon separation  we also entered into agreements with millipore for membrane manufacturing and supply  research and development  product distribution and contract manufacturing  generally for a five year period 
the foregoing transition agreements may not necessarily reflect the costs of obtaining the services from unrelated third parties or of our providing the applicable services ourselves 
however  we believe that purchasing these products and services from millipore provides us with an efficient means of obtaining these products and services during the transition period 
in addition  we agreed to provide transition services to millipore  for which we have been reimbursed at our cost 
during  millipore decided to discontinue usage of our distribution and research and development services in japan and notified us of its plans to vacate our japanese manufacturing site by late basis of presentation our combined financial statements for periods prior to march  include amounts that have been derived from the consolidated financial statements and accounting records of millipore using the historical results of operations and historical basis of assets and liabilities of our business 
we believe the assumptions underlying the combined financial statements are reasonable 
however  the combined financial information included herein may not necessarily reflect our operating results  financial position and cash flows in the future or what they would have been had we been a separate  stand alone entity during the periods presented 
because a direct ownership relationship did not exist among all our various units  millipore s net investment in us is shown in lieu of shareholders equity in the combined financial statements prior to the separation of the companies on march  we began accumulating retained earnings accumulated deficit on april   following the effective date of the separation agreement with millipore  pursuant to which our assets and liabilities were transferred to us 
beginning april   our consolidated financial statements include all our wholly owned subsidiaries and our assets and liabilities 
all material intercompany transactions and balances between and among our subsidiaries have been eliminated 
prior to march  millipore allocated certain corporate expenses  including centralized research and development  legal  accounting  employee benefits  officers salaries  facilities  insurance  information technology services  distribution  treasury and other millipore corporate and infrastructure costs 
these expense allocations were determined on a basis that millipore and we considered to be a reasonable assessment of the utilization of services provided or the benefit received by us 
at the time of separation from millipore  we entered into transition service agreements with millipore for millipore to provide specified functions and for us to reimburse millipore for the cost of these functions 
these agreements did not necessarily reflect the costs of obtaining the services from unrelated third parties or of our providing the applicable services ourselves 
however  we believe that purchasing these services from millipore provided us with an efficient means of obtaining these services during the transition period 
in and  we purchased and million  respectively  of services from millipore under these transition service agreements 
in  we purchased services of million and were allocated costs from millipore of million 
costs allocated and services purchased from millipore included in the accompanying consolidated and combined statements of operations are as follows year ended december  in millions cost of sales selling  general and administrative expenses research and development expenses total in addition  we have agreed to provide transition services to millipore  for which we have been reimbursed at our cost 
these amounts totaled million  million and million in  and respectively  related to manufacturing  distribution  research and development services that have been recorded as reductions to our cost of sales  research and development expenses 
during  we entered into a royalty agreement with nihon millipore  which provides nihon millipore the right to use certain intellectual property that was developed by mykrolis in connection with the bioscience business 
as a result of this agreement  million  million and million in royalty income from millipore was recognized and recorded in other income expense  net for the years ended december   and  respectively 
because of millipore s decision to discontinue most of these services  we expect to substantially lose all benefits relating to these transition service arrangements including the related intellectual property royalty income in late we expect to partially offset this loss by additional cost reductions in japan 
changes in millipore s net investment include our net earnings plus net cash transfers to or from millipore 
after the separation but prior to our initial public offering ipo of common stock  cash deposits were netted against amounts outstanding under our separation revolving credit agreement with millipore 
from the ipo until february   the date millipore distributed its remaining holdings of our stock to its shareholders  amounts due to millipore were netted against amounts due from millipore and reported as accounts payable millipore in our consolidated and combined financial statements 
after that date  these transactions were reported as accounts payable and accounts receivable 
in  and we purchased products from millipore for inclusion in our products sold to third parties totaling million  million and million  respectively 
for  and  products sold to millipore by us totaled million  million and million  respectively 
critical accounting policies and significant judgements and accounting estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated and combined financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates  including those related to net sales  accounts receivable  inventories  long lived assets and goodwill  deferred tax assets  income tax contingencies  warranty obligations  restructuring charges  pension and other post retirement benefit obligations  and litigation contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated and combined financial statements 
the company has reviewed these policies with its audit and finance committee 
net sales our net sales consist of revenue from sales of products net of trade discounts and allowances 
we recognize revenue when evidence of an arrangement exists  contractual obligations have been satisfied  title and risk of loss have been transferred to the customer and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
in the event significant post shipment obligations or uncertainties remain  revenue is deferred and recognized when such obligations are fulfilled by us or the uncertainties are resolved 
we provide for estimated product returns under limited contractual obligations 
amounts billed to customers that relate to shipping costs are included in net sales and in cost of sales 
revenue from services is recognized when the services are provided 
revenue from services  which is less than approximately of total net sales for each of the three years ended december  and  is recognized when the services are provided and is included in our consumable product net sales 
accounts receivable we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments based upon specific identification  by customer 
if the financial condition of our customers was to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventories we adjust the cost basis of inventory that has been written down to reflect its net realizable value 
we provide reserves for estimated excess and obsolete inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated net realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
we fully reserve for inventories deemed obsolete 
we perform quarterly reviews of all inventory items to identify excess and obsolete inventories on hand by comparing on hand balances to recent historical usage as well as anticipated or forecasted demand  based upon input from sales  r d and marketing functions 
if estimates of demand diminish further or actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected  additional inventory write downs may be required 
long lived assets and goodwill we periodically evaluate the recoverability of long lived assets whenever events and changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset or class of assets may not be fully recoverable and exceeds its fair value 
for long lived assets we intend to hold and use  if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the sum of undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset over its useful life  an impairment loss will be recorded 
the amount of the impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the long lived asset exceeds its fair value 
assets held for sale are valued at fair value less costs to sell the asset 
for goodwill  we assess fair value by measuring discounted cash flows and comparable company analysis for the applicable underlying reporting unit and test for impairment as the difference between the resulting implied fair value of goodwill compared to its recorded carrying value 
goodwill impairment is tested annually or whenever events and changes in circumstances occur 
the estimates of useful lives and expected cash flows require us to make significant judgments regarding future periods that are subject to some factors outside our control 
changes in these estimates can result in significant revisions to the carrying value of these assets and may result in material charges to the results of operations 
deferred tax assets our valuation allowance against the us deferred tax assets are based on our assessment of historical pre tax income and projected pre tax income for early future periods 
in addition  there is no valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets in foreign subsidiaries based on our assessment of historical pre tax income and projected pre tax income for early future periods 
in the event the foreign subsidiaries do not generate sufficient pre tax income as planned during  we will need to re evaluate whether it is more likely than not that certain deferred tax assets in the foreign subsidiaries will be realized 
we have undertaken tax planning initiatives designed to generate future us taxable income 
as we generate future taxable income in the us against which these tax assets may be applied  some portion or all of the valuation allowance would be reversed and an increase in net income would consequently be reported in future years 
income tax contingencies tax contingencies are recorded to address probable exposures involving tax positions we have taken that could be challenged by taxing authorities 
these probable exposures result from the varying application of statutes  rules  regulations and interpretations 
our estimate of the value of our tax contingencies contains assumptions based on past experiences and judgments about potential actions by taxing jurisdictions 
it is reasonably likely that the ultimate resolution of these matters may be greater or less than the amount that we have accrued 
warranty obligations at the time revenue is recognized  we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties as provided for under our contractual arrangements 
our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should such failure rates or costs differ from these estimates  accrued warranty costs would be adjusted in the period that such events or costs become known 
restructuring charges during  and  we recorded significant charges to operations in connection with our restructuring programs 
the related reserves reflect estimates  including those pertaining to severance costs and facility exit costs 
we reassess the reserve requirements to complete each restructuring program at the end of every reporting period and record adjustments to reflect changes in prior estimates 
actual experience may be different from these estimates 
pension and post retirement benefit obligations we have significant pension and post retirement benefit costs and credits  which are developed from actuarial valuations 
inherent in these valuations are key assumptions  including discount rates  compensation increases  healthcare costs and expected return on plan assets  which are usually updated on an annual basis at the beginning of each fiscal year 
we are required to consider current market conditions in making these key assumptions 
changes in the related pension and post retirement benefit costs or credits may occur in the future due to changes in assumptions 
litigation contingencies we are subject to proceedings  lawsuits and other claims  including proceedings under laws and government regulations related to securities  environmental  labor  product and other matters 
we are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters  as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of reserves required  if any  for these contingencies is based on a careful analysis of each individual issue with the assistance of outside legal counsel 
the required reserves may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters 
results of operations operating trends and recent developments we operate in one reportable business segment that develops  manufactures and sells consumables and capital equipment products to semiconductor fabrication companies and other companies using similar manufacturing processes  as well as oem suppliers to those companies 
the principal market we serve is the global semiconductor industry  a highly cyclical business 
since early  this industry has faced a severe downturn  and as a result  we have experienced significant variations in net sales and results of operations in the periods presented 
our liquid and gas equipment products were impacted the most by the industry downturn and we have experienced weak demand for these products since  as new semiconductor fabrication plant constructions and upgrades declined 
the semiconductor and related industry capacity utilization started to improve in late and this trend has continued through  which primarily benefited our consumable products 
during  as the business environment remained uncertain  we continued to take actions to reduce capital expenditures as well as operating costs and expenses 
however  after this severe downturn  the fourth quarter of showed strong revenue growth and improved profitability 
we expect to see a continuation of these business trends into  lead by increased capacity utilization and capacity additions 
these improved business conditions should have a positive impact on our revenue growth and profitability levels in during the fourth quarter of  we acquired the business and certain assets and liabilities of aeronex  inc  a privately held company that developed  manufactured and marketed gas purification components and systems 
the aeronex products complement our line of gas purifiers 
aeronex s results of operations are included in our consolidated financial statements since october   the date of purchase 
as part of our business strategy  we expect to continue to address gaps in our product offerings  diversify into complementary markets or pursue additional technology and customers through acquisitions  joint ventures or other types of collaborations 
our results of operations for the years ended december   and dollars and as a percentage of total net sales were as follows in millions as a percent of net sales net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses research and development expenses restructuring and other charges operating loss other income expense  net loss before income taxes income tax expense net loss year ended december  compared to years ended december  and net sales 
net sales were million in  which represented a  or million  increase from the increase was primarily attributable to the favorable impact of stronger japanese yen  asian and euro foreign exchange rates which contributed approximately million in the period compared to the period 
the strong recovery in net sales in asia  driven by increased consumable sales  was offset by the sharp decline in our north american equipment business 
during  net sales were million  which represented a  or a million decrease when compared to this decrease was a result of the severe downturn in the semiconductor industry  which began in the first quarter of the decline in sales was significant in most geographic regions and across nearly all product families 
sales of microelectronics hardware declined as new semiconductor fabrication plant construction and upgrades declined due to industry over capacity 
in addition  sales of consumable purification products also declined in  although to a lesser extent  as semiconductor fabrication plants experienced lower manufacturing volumes and focused on achieving manufacturing efficiencies and reducing material costs 
net sales and percent change in net sales in comparison to the prior year from years  by geography  are summarized in the table below 
net sales in us dollars net sales by geographic region in millions as a percentage of net sales north america japan taiwan asia  other europe total net sales net sales change in us dollars net sales change in local currencies north america japan taiwan asia  other europe total net sales the primary currencies impacting the difference between us dollar results and local currency results  during compared with  were the japanese yen  the euro and the south korean won 
during  versus  average exchange rates for the japanese yen strengthened by approximately  the euro by and the south korean won by 
this positively impacted us dollar sales growth in during compared to  the japanese yen was essentially flat against the us dollar while the south korean won strengthened by approximately and the euro by 
gross profit margins 
gross profit margins were in  in and in during  we recorded net benefits of approximately million relating to the sale of products previously deemed excess and obsolete and written down to net realizable value  compared to a charge of million for inventory write offs and reserve additions during which resulted in a year over year improvement of approximately percentage points of gross margin 
efficiency gains related to cost reductions and the consolidation and reorganization of our manufacturing operations as well as reduced warranty expense resulted in an additional gain of approximately percentage points of gross margin 
improvement in was also driven by a positive foreign currency impact of approximately million 
the gross profit margin decrease in over was primarily due to reductions in product demand and production volume resulting in lower overhead absorption 
we did respond to this lower demand by consolidating our manufacturing operations 
gross profit margins in also reflected million of separation related charges to operations including million of redundant facility and labor expenses in order to ensure a smooth transfer from millipore facilities into our new billerica facility and million of impairment charges associated with surplus manufacturing machinery  which was ultimately sold 
gross profit margins in reflected million of separation related  non recurring charges 
operating expenses research and development expenses 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expense for personnel engaged in research and development  fees paid to consultants  material cost for test units and other expense related to the design  development  testing and enhancement of our products 
we expense all our research and development costs as they are incurred 
research and development expenses decreased in to million mostly due to the timing of spending on key research and development project materials and the delay in staffing open positions 
research and development expenses of million in were essentially flat from  which were million 
we intend to continue to fund key research and development programs despite the uncertain business condition 
key elements of our and research development expenses were related to the development of the new product platforms to meet the manufacturing needs for and nanometer semiconductor devices 
in order to respond to the proliferation of new materials and chemicals in the manufacturing processes  and increased needs for tighter process control for mm wafers  investments were made for new contamination control products in area of copper interconnects  deep ultra violet duv photolithography  and chemical and gas management technologies for advanced wafer cleans  deposition and etch equipments 
additional investments were made in area of advanced process control  monitoring and diagnostics capabilities for future generations of semiconductor manufacturing processes 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation for personnel engaged in sales and marketing  finance and accounting  information technology  facilities and human resources  costs associated with marketing programs which include costs associated with trade shows  public relations  product marketing costs  web site enhancements and product evaluation costs and travel  professional services  which include legal  accounting audit and tax fees and directors and officers insurance  administrative expenses associated with operating as a public company and bad debt expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased or from million in to million in this decrease was primarily attributable to cost savings resulting from the and restructuring programs as well as additional actions to reduce discretionary spending 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to million in from million in the decrease in from levels was attributable to results of the restructuring programs initiated in  as well as a series of actions to reduce discretionary spending in response to the industry downturn 
restructuring and other charges 
we took several restructuring actions in  and to better align our cost structure with prevailing market conditions due to the prolonged industry downturn 
these actions  which were necessary as a result of reduced business volume  primarily focused on reducing our workforce and consolidating global facilities 
our operating results in included a total of million of restructuring and other charges 
we recorded charges of million related to employee severance costs  million related to facility exit costs at the swindon service facility and million related to changes in estimates for prior year restructuring programs associated with the closing of manufacturing and service facilities in the united states and england 
our operating results in included a total of million of restructuring and other charges 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded charges of million related to the decision to close our san clemente  ca manufacturing plant  severance costs of million  and recorded additional facilities exit costs of million related to our bedford  ma and swindon  england sites 
our operating results in included a total of million of restructuring and other charges 
during the first quarter of  we recorded restructuring and other charges of million in connection with our separation from millipore to improve our manufacturing asset utilization and resize our overall cost structure 
the restructuring and other charges included million of employee severance costs  a million write off of equipment and leasehold improvements and million of lease cancellation costs 
during the third quarter of  we recorded an additional restructuring charge of million in response to the prolonged duration and severity of the semiconductor industry downturn 
this restructuring charge included million of employee severance costs  a million write off of equipment and leasehold improvements  and million of exit costs on leased property 
as of december   our total accrued restructuring costs amount to million 
of this amount  the majority of the million in severance costs for terminated employees will be paid by the first quarter of the facilities related costs of million will be substantially paid by the fourth quarter of these combined restructuring initiatives are expected to generate annual savings of approximately million through reduced payroll costs  facility related costs and depreciation expense 
the savings will be reflected in costs of sales  selling  general and administrative expenses and research and development expenses 
for further details  see note of the accompanying notes to the consolidated and combined financial statements included elsewhere in this document 
other income expense  net 
during  other income expense  net included foreign currency transaction exchange gains of million  interest income of million  royalty income from millipore of million and million income on investments in entities accounted for under the equity method 
in  other income expense  net included foreign currency transaction exchange gains of million primarily related to intercompany loans denominated in foreign currencies  interest income of million  royalty income from millipore of million and million of other income 
in  other income expense  net included foreign currency transaction exchange losses of million and a million loss on investments in entities accounted for under the equity method offset by interest income of million  royalty income from millipore of million and million of other income 
income tax expense 
in  we recorded income tax expense of million on a pre tax loss of million 
the income tax expense is related to our foreign operations and results from our overall geographic mix of income and includes no tax benefit for net operating losses in the united states 
in  we recorded income tax expense of million on a pre tax loss of million 
the income tax expense included settlements from foreign tax audits for which we are responsible under our tax sharing agreement with millipore and other income tax expense in our foreign operations 
in  we recorded income tax expense of million on a pre tax loss of million 
this expense is primarily attributable to a valuation allowance against foreign tax credits on unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries of approximately million and other us deferred tax assets of approximately million 
sfas  accounting for income tax  requires that we establish a valuation allowance or reserve when  based on an evaluation of objective verifiable evidence  we believe there is a likelihood that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
in  we recorded a valuation allowance for the majority of these tax assets based on our assessment of historical pre tax income and the significant deterioration in our projected pre tax income for early future periods given the significant uncertainty surrounding the prolonged cyclical downturn in the semiconductor industry 
prior to the completion of the spin off by millipore  our operating results were included in millipore s consolidated us and state income tax returns and in tax returns of certain millipore foreign subsidiaries 
accordingly  income taxes were calculated on a separate return basis as if we filed tax returns separately from millipore 
at december   we had a million income tax receivable related to net operating loss carrybacks determined on a separate return basis 
in accordance with the tax sharing agreement  during  millipore decided not to allow us to carry back these net operating losses 
as a result  the receivable was transferred to millipore during and is reflected in the consolidated financial statements as a reduction to additional paid in capital included in shareholders equity 
millipore managed its consolidated tax position for the benefit of its entire portfolio of businesses  and its tax strategies were not necessarily reflective of the tax strategies that we would have followed as a stand alone company 
we continuously evaluate our tax position and our effective tax rate depending on changes in the geographic mix of our earnings and the continued development of our tax strategies 
liquidity and capital resources cash provided by operating activities was million during the year ended december  compared to million during  and million during the increase in net cash from operations during is primarily attributable to a reduced net loss 
in  cash provided by operating activities resulted primarily from inventory reductions of million 
this increase to cash was offset by our net loss of million  after adjusting for the non cash charges of million for depreciation and amortization  million related to restructuring and other charges and million arising from impaired assets 
in  cash provided by operating activities resulted from a series of initiatives aimed at optimizing our working capital 
cash flow used in investing activities consisted of capital expenditures for property  plant and equipment of million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
over the past three years  cash flows used in investing activities were primarily for the construction and purchase of production and research and development equipment  and the transfer of manufacturing operations from millipore facilities pursuant to our separation agreements 
during  we also used million to acquire certain net assets of privately held aeronex inc  a manufacturer of gas purification products and million as a deposit for the acquisition of certain assets of another company 
most of our separation related programs have now been completed 
during  we expect to spend between to million on capital expenditures primarily related to the purchase of manufacturing and research and development equipment 
in addition  during we used million for the purchase of long term marketable securities to invest in longer term high grade instruments that allow us to achieve a higher rate of return 
in  cash flows provided by financing activities were primarily derived from million from the issuance of  shares common stock under our employee stock purchase and stock option plans 
cash flows provided by financing activities for the year ended december  were million and resulted from net transfers of million from millipore in accordance with the transition service agreements entered into in conjunction with our separation from millipore  million generated by the issuance of  shares of common stock under our employee stock purchase and stock option plans 
this was offset by million in cash collateratization related to a security deposit under the lease for our corporate headquarters  research and development and manufacturing facility and other security deposits 
at december   this cash collateral was invested in us federal agency securities and money market funds 
cash flows from financing activities of million for the year ended december  resulted from the receipt of million of net proceeds from the sale of our stock in our initial public offering completed in august and net transfers from millipore of million offset by the payment of a million separation note to millipore 
from april  through the consummation of our initial public offering  millipore provided a line of credit to us pursuant to a separation revolving credit agreement to support our cash requirements 
we borrowed million under this separation revolving credit agreement with millipore that was repaid from the proceeds of our initial public offering 
the amount of the separation note represented amounts determined by agreement between us and millipore to ensure that all net proceeds of our initial public offering in excess of million would be payable to millipore 
we believe that our cash  cash equivalents  long term marketable securities and expected future cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital  capital expenditure  and research and development investment requirements for the next months 
however  in order to take advantage of growth opportunities  including potential acquisitions  facility expansion  joint ventures  alliances or other business arrangements  we may seek to raise capital through equity or debt financing 
to that effect  during we filed a shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission with respect to million of securities  which was declared effective on november  the timing  size and terms of any offering will depend on a number of factors  including market conditions 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes the payments due for specific contractual obligations 
these amounts are as of december  payments due by period total less than year years years more than years in millions operating leases capital leases purchase obligations pension obligations total purchase obligations are defined as agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable pricing provisions  and the approximate timing of the transactions 
the amounts are based on our contractual commitments  however  it is possible we may be able to negotiate lower payments if we choose to exit these contracts earlier 
we do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as such  we are not exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
pursuant to the terms of the lease for our vacated bedford  massachusetts facility  the landlord has an option to sell the facility to us at any time prior to november  the end of the lease term  at of the then current market value  excluding the value of the lease 
we estimate that the current fair market value of the facility is between million and million 
qualitative and quantitative disclosure relating to market risks our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk is managed on an enterprise wide basis 
we do not currently hold any derivative financial instruments and continue to evaluate our future hedging strategy 
we sell our products in many countries and a substantial portion of our net sales and a portion of our costs and expenses are denominated in foreign currencies 
approximately of our net sales in the year ended december  were derived from customers located outside of the us  principally in asia including japan  where we also manufacture some of our products 
this exposes us to risks associated with changes in foreign currencies that can adversely impact revenues  net income and cash flow 
in addition  we are potentially subject to concentrations of credit risk  principally in accounts receivable  as historically we have relied on a limited number of customers for a substantial portion of our net sales 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and we generally do not require collateral 
our major customers are large  well established microelectronics companies that have historically paid their accounts receivable balances with us 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in november  the financial accounting standards board the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin 
fin clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
the initial recognition and initial measurement provisions of fin are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  the disclosure requirements of fin are applicable for financial statements of interim periods ending after december  we adopted fin in the fourth quarter of and have included the new disclosure requirements in the notes to the consolidated financial statements see note and note of the accompanying notes to the consolidated and combined financial statement 
in november  the eitf issued no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
eitf no 
addresses certain aspects of the accounting by a vendor for arrangements under which it will perform multiple revenue generating activities 
eitf no 
establishes three principles revenue should be recognized separately for separate units of accounting  revenue for a separate unit of accounting should be recognized only when the arrangement consideration is reliably measurable and the earnings process is substantially complete  and consideration should be allocated among the separate units of accounting in an arrangement based on their fair values 
eitf no 
is effective for all revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june  the adoption of this pronouncement did not have any material impact on our consolidated results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
in april  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
this statement amends sfas to provide clarification on the financial accounting and reporting of derivative instruments and hedging activities and requires contracts with similar characteristics to be accounted for on a comparable basis 
the adoption of sfas  which became effective for contracts entered into or modified after june   did not have any impact on our consolidated results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity sfas 
sfas establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
it requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability or an asset in some circumstances 
sfas is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  the adoption of sfas did not have any impact on our consolidated results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  employers disclosures about pensions and other post retirement benefits  sfas that expands financial statement disclosures for defined benefit plans 
the change replaces existing sfas disclosure requirements for pensions and other post retirement benefits and revises employers disclosures about pension plans and other post retirement benefit plans 
it does not change the measurement of recognition of those plans required by sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions or sfas no 
 employers accounting for settlements and curtailments of defined benefit pension plans and for termination benefits 
sfas revised retains the disclosure requirements contained in the original sfas  but requires additional disclosures about the plan assets  obligations  cash flows  and net periodic benefit cost of defined benefit pension plans and other defined benefit post retirement plans 
sfas revised is effective for annual and interim periods with fiscal years ending after december  we have adopted the revised disclosure provisions 
in december  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
r fin r a revised interpretation of fasb interpretation no fin 
fin r requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
the provisions of fin r are effective immediately for all arrangements entered into after january  for all arrangements entered into after january   we are required to continue to apply fin r through the end of the first quarter of fiscal we do not have any equity interests that would change its current reporting or require additional disclosures outlined in fin r 
for arrangements entered into prior to february   we are required to adopt the provisions of fin r in the first quarter of fiscal we do not have any equity interests that would change its current reporting or require additional disclosures outlined in fin r 
in december  the medicare prescription drug  improvement  and modernization act of the act was passed by the united states congress 
the act will be effective january  and provides medicare government subsidies for employers that sponsor retiree medical programs for prescriptions 
the fasb issued a staff position paper fsp in january in response to the act 
fsp allows an employer a one time election to defer recognition of the act in an employers financial statements until the fasb issues authoritative guidance on the matter 
we have elected to defer recognition of the accounting changes until such time 
sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition  which supersedes a portion of sab  revenue recognition in financial statements was issued in december the primary purpose of sab is to rescind accounting guidance contained in sab related to multiple element revenue arrangements  which was superseded as a result of the issuance of eitf  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
while the wording of sab has changed to reflect the issuance of eitf  the revenue recognition principles of sab remain largely unchanged by the issuance of sab the adoption of sab did not have any impact on our consolidated results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
factors and uncertainties that may affect future results the matters discussed in this annual report on form k  include forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of these forward looking statements include but are not limited to statements about our strategy  our revenues  sufficiency of our cash resources  product development  our research and development and other expenses  and our operations and legal risks 
discussions containing these forward looking statements may be found  among other places  in business and in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  as well as any amendments thereto reflected in subsequent filings with the sec 
these statements are based on current management expectations and are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from the results expressed in  or implied by  these forward looking statements 
when used herein or in such statements  the words anticipate  believe  estimate  expect  may  will  should or the negative thereof and similar expressions as they relate to mykrolis or its management are intended to identify such forward looking statements 
we undertake no obligation to publicly release any revisions to the forward looking statements or reflect events or circumstances after the date of this annual report on form k except as required by law 
potential risks and uncertainties that could affect our future operating results include the risk factors described elsewhere in this annual report on form k as well as the following risks relating to our business and industry our business depends substantially on semiconductor industry capital spending and production levels  which are characterized by periodic fluctuations that may cause a reduction in demand for our products 
our business depends substantially upon the capital expenditures of semiconductor device manufacturers  which in turn depend upon the demand for semiconductors and other products utilizing semiconductors 
we estimate that approximately of our sales during  and were to semiconductor capital equipment manufacturers  semiconductor device manufacturers and semiconductor material manufacturers and we expect that sales to such customers will continue to account for a substantial majority of our sales 
reductions in demand for the products manufactured by semiconductor capital equipment manufacturers and semiconductor device manufacturers will restrict our ability to grow our business and cause our sales and profitability to decline 
historically  the semiconductor market has been highly cyclical and has experienced periods of over capacity  resulting in significantly reduced demand for capital equipment used to make semiconductors 
during fiscal  and the semiconductor industry has experienced a significant decline  which has caused a number of our customers to reduce their orders 
our net sales for were million slightly up from sales of million  but representing a decline of million  or from our net sales in our net sales for were million  representing a million  or  decline from our net sales in we also experienced downturns in and during the downturn  our annual net sales declined approximately million  or from the prior year 
there is typically a three to six month lag between a change in capital expenditures within the semiconductor industry and the related impact on the demand for our products 
any future downturn could inhibit our growth  decrease our profitability or cause us to incur a loss 
the semiconductor industry is subject to rapid demand shifts which are difficult to predict 
as a result  our inability to meet demand in response to these rapid shifts may cause a reduction in our market share 
our ability to increase sales of our products  particularly our capital equipment products  depends in part upon our ability to ramp up the use of our manufacturing capacity for such products in a timely manner and to mobilize our supply chain 
in order to meet the demands of our customers  we may be required to ramp up our manufacturing capacity in as little as a few months 
if we are unable to expand our manufacturing capacity on a timely basis or manage such expansion effectively  our customers could seek such products from other suppliers  and our market share could be reduced 
because demand shifts in the semiconductor industry are rapid and difficult to foresee  we may not be able to increase capacity quickly enough to respond to such an increase in demand 
our annual and quarterly operating results are subject to fluctuations as a result of rapid demand shifts and our low level of backlog and if we fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors  the market price of our securities may decrease significantly 
our sales and operating results can vary significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year 
because our expense levels are relatively fixed in the short term  an unanticipated decline in revenue in a particular quarter could disproportionately affect our net income in that quarter 
in addition  we make a substantial portion of our shipments shortly after we receive the order  and therefore we operate with a low level of backlog 
as a consequence of the just in time nature of shipments and the low level of backlog  our results of operations may decline quickly and significantly in response to changes in order patterns or rapid decreases in demand for our products 
we anticipate that fluctuations in operating results will continue in the future 
such fluctuations in our results could cause us to fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors  which could cause the market price of our securities to decline substantially 
we believe that period to period comparisons of our results of operations may not be meaningful  and you should not rely upon them as indicators of our future performance 
we may not be able to accurately forecast demand for our products 
as noted above  we typically operate our business on a just in time shipment basis with a low level of backlog and we order supplies and plan production based on internal forecasts of demand 
due to these factors  we have  in the past  and may again in the future  fail to accurately forecast demand for our products  in terms of both volume and specific products for which there will be demand 
this has lead to  and may in the future lead to  delays in product shipments  disappointment of customer expectations  or  alternatively  an increased risk of excess inventory and of inventory obsolescence 
if we fail to accurately forecast demand for our products  our business  financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely affected 
as the semiconductor industry rebounds  it may not rebound to historic levels but instead may reflect a lower rate of long term growth  similar to the electronics industry 
notwithstanding the recent severe and prolonged downturn in the semiconductor industry and the related reduction in manufacturing operations  there may still be excess manufacturing capacity 
in addition  there is no new application to drive growth in the semiconductor industry  as was the case in with telecommunications and internet applications 
accordingly  some analysts have predicted that the semiconductor industry may experience lower growth rates during a recovery cycle than has historically been the case and that its longer term performance may reflect this lower growth rate  which would be similar to the growth rate of the electronics industry 
if we are unable to maintain our technological expertise in design and manufacturing processes  we will not be able to successfully compete 
we believe that our future success will depend upon our ability to develop and provide products that meet the changing needs of our customers  including the transition from the use of millimeter wafers to millimeter wafers  the shrinking of semiconductor device line widths and the use of new classes of materials  such as copper  titanium nitride and organic and inorganic dielectric materials  which are materials that have either a low or high resistance to the flow of electricity 
this requires that we successfully anticipate and respond to technological changes in manufacturing processes in a cost effective and timely manner 
any inability to develop the technical specifications for any of our new products or enhancements to our existing products or to manufacture and ship these products or enhancements in volume in a timely manner could harm our business prospects and significantly reduce our sales 
in addition  if new products have reliability or quality problems  we may experience reduced orders  higher manufacturing costs  delays in acceptance and payment  additional service and warranty expense and damage to our reputation 
our competitive position will be weakened if semiconductor device manufacturers do not require semiconductor capital equipment manufacturers to design our products into new generations of their equipment 
new products designed by semiconductor capital equipment manufacturers typically have a lifespan of five to ten years 
our competitive success depends on our products being designed into new generations of equipment for the semiconductor industry 
in some cases  semiconductor device manufacturers may direct semiconductor capital equipment manufacturers to use a specified supplier s product in their equipment 
accordingly  our success will depend in part on our ability to have semiconductor device manufacturers specify that our products be used at their semiconductor fabrication facilities 
if our products are not specified by semiconductor equipment manufacturers  our net sales may be reduced during the lifespan of our customers products 
because our sales are concentrated on a small number of key customers  our revenue and profitability may materially decline if one or more of our key customers do not continue to purchase our existing and new products in significant quantities 
we depend and expect to continue to depend on a limited number of customers for a large portion of our business  and changes in several customers orders could have had a significant impact on our operating results 
in  and  our top customer accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of our net sales 
in those same periods  net sales to our ten largest customers accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of our net sales 
in addition  we sell products to systems integrators who then sell components  which include our products  to some of our major customers 
if any one of our key customers decides to purchase significantly less from us or to terminate its relationship with us  our revenue and profitability may decline significantly 
we could also lose our key customers or significant sales to our key customers because of factors beyond our control  such as a significant disruption in our customers businesses generally or in a specific product line 
for example  we are currently experiencing softening demand for our products as a result of the downturn in the semiconductor industry 
these customers may stop incorporating our products into their products with limited notice to us and suffer little or no penalty for doing so 
in addition  if any of our customers merge  we may experience lower overall sales from the merged companies 
because one of our strategies has been to develop long term relationships with a few key customers in the product areas in which we focus and because we have a long product design and development cycle for most of our products and prospective customers typically require lengthy product qualification periods prior to placing volume orders  we may be unable to replace these customers quickly or at all 
because we are subject to order and shipment uncertainties and many of our costs are fixed  any significant changes  cancellations or deferrals of orders or shipments could cause our revenue and profitability to decline or fluctuate 
as is typical in the microelectronics industry  we do not usually obtain long term purchase orders or commitments from our customers 
instead  we work closely with our customers to develop non binding forecasts of the future volume of orders 
customers may cancel their orders  change production quantities from forecasted volumes or delay production for reasons beyond our control 
order cancellations or deferrals could cause us to hold inventory for longer than anticipated  which could reduce our profitability  restrict our ability to fund our operations and cause us to incur unanticipated reductions or delays in our revenue 
our customers often change their orders multiple times between initial order and delivery 
such changes usually relate to quantities or delivery dates  but sometimes relate to the specifications of the products we are supplying 
if a customer does not timely pay for these products  we could incur significant charges against our income 
in addition  our profitability may be affected by the generally fixed nature of our costs 
because a substantial portion of our costs are fixed  we may experience deterioration in gross margins when volumes decline 
from time to time  we make capital investments in anticipation of future business opportunities 
if we are unable to obtain the anticipated business  our revenue and profitability may decline 
competition from existing or new companies in the microelectronics industry could cause us to experience downward pressure on prices  fewer customer orders  reduced margins  the inability to take advantage of new business opportunities and the loss of market share 
we operate in a highly competitive industry 
we compete against many domestic and foreign companies that have substantially greater manufacturing  financial  research and development and marketing resources than we do 
in addition  some of our competitors may have more developed relationships with our existing customers than we do  which may enable them to have their products specified for use more frequently by these customers 
we also face competition from the manufacturing operations of our current and potential customers  who continually evaluate the benefits of internal manufacturing versus outsourcing 
as more original equipment manufacturers dispose of their manufacturing operations and increase the outsourcing of their products to liquid and gas delivery system and other component companies  we may face increasing competitive pressures to grow our business in order to maintain our market share 
if we are unable to maintain our competitive position  we could experience downward pressure on prices  fewer customer orders  reduced margins  the inability to take advantage of new business opportunities and a loss of market share 
if we are unable to successfully adjust our business strategy for some of our product lines to reflect the increasing price sensitivity on the part of our customers  our business and financial condition could be harmed 
our business strategy for many of our product lines has been focused on product performance  technological innovations that provide enhanced efficiencies  and customer service  rather than simply price 
as a result of current economic conditions and changes in various markets that we serve  our customers have experienced significant cost pressures and  as a result  we have observed increased price sensitivity on the part of our customers 
if competition for any of our product lines should come to focus solely on price rather than on product performance  technological innovations and customer service  we will need to adjust our business strategy and or product offerings accordingly and  if we are unable to do so  our business  financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely affected 
we conduct a significant amount of our sales activity and manufacturing efforts outside the united states  which subjects us to additional business risks and may cause our profitability to decline due to increased costs 
sales by our international subsidiaries to customers outside the united states accounted for approximately of our net sales in  of our net sales in  and of our net sales in we anticipate that international sales will continue to account for a majority of our net sales 
in addition  a number of our key domestic customers derive a significant portion of their revenues from sales in international markets 
we also manufacture a significant portion of our products outside the united states and are dependent on international suppliers for many of our parts 
we intend to continue to pursue opportunities in both sales and manufacturing internationally 
our international operations are subject to a number of risks and potential costs that could adversely affect our revenue and profitability  including unexpected changes in regulatory requirements that could impose additional costs on our operations or limit our ability to operate our business  greater difficulty in collecting our accounts receivable and longer payment cycles than is typical in domestic operations  changes in labor conditions and difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  liability for foreign taxes assessed at rates higher than those applicable to our domestic operations  and political and economic instability 
in the past  we have incurred costs or experienced disruptions due to the factors described above and expect to do so in the future 
for example  our operations in asia  and particularly korea  taiwan and japan  have been negatively impacted in the past as a result of regional economic instability  most recently in in addition  taiwan and korea account for a growing portion of the world s semiconductor manufacturing 
there are currently strained relations between china and taiwan and there are growing tensions between north korea and south korea and the united states 
any adverse developments in those relations could significantly disrupt the worldwide production of semiconductors  which would lead to reduced sales of our products 
fluctuations in the value of the us dollar in relation to other currencies may lead to lower net income or may cause us to raise prices  which could result in reduced net sales 
foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations could have an adverse effect on our net sales and results of operations 
approximately of our net sales in  of our net sales in  and of our net sales in were denominated in foreign currencies 
unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations against the us dollar could require us to increase prices to foreign customers  which could result in lower net sales by us to such customers 
alternatively  if we do not adjust the prices for our products in response to unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations  our profitability could decline 
in addition  sales made by our foreign subsidiaries are denominated in the currency of the country in which these products are sold  and the currency we receive in payment for such sales could be less valuable at the time of receipt versus the time of sale as a result of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
we incur significant cash outlays over long term periods in order to research  develop  manufacture and market new products  which may never reach market or may have limited market acceptance 
we make significant cash expenditures to research  develop and market new products 
for example  we incurred million of research and development expense in  million in and million in the development period for a product can be as long as five years 
following development  it may take an additional two to three years for the market size of that product to reach a substantial level 
we cannot be certain of the success of a new product 
a product concept may never progress beyond the development stage or may only achieve limited acceptance in the marketplace 
if this occurs  we do not receive a direct return on our expenditures and may not even realize any indirect benefits 
additionally  capacity expansion may be necessary in order to manufacture a new product 
if sales levels do not increase to offset the additional fixed operating expenses associated with any such expansion  our revenue and profitability could decline and our prospects could be harmed 
we depend on our suppliers for our raw materials and components  and our production would be substantially curtailed if these suppliers are not able to meet our demands and alternative sources are not available 
we purchase raw materials and components from third parties to complete our customers orders  and some of these raw materials and components may  in the future  need to be ordered from sole source suppliers 
although we work with our customers and suppliers to minimize the impact of shortages in raw materials and components  we sometimes experience short term adverse effects due to price fluctuations and delayed shipments 
in the past  there have been industry wide shortages of electronic components  particularly memory and logic devices 
if a significant shortage of raw materials or components were to occur  we may have to delay shipment 
supply shortages of particular components will likely substantially curtail production of products using these components 
in addition  while many of our significant customer contracts permit periodic reviews of pricing based on decreases and increases in the prices of raw materials and components  we are not always able to pass on price increases to our customers and significant price increases from our suppliers could cause our profitability to decline 
the loss of any of these or other significant suppliers  delays in shipments  the inability of a supplier to meet performance and quality specifications or delivery schedules or our inability to pass along price increases could cause our revenue and profitability to decline significantly 
we may acquire other businesses or form joint ventures that could negatively affect our profitability  increase our debt and dilute your ownership of our company 
as part of our business strategy  we have  and we expect to continue to address gaps in our product offerings  diversify into complementary product markets or pursue additional technology and customers through acquisitions  joint ventures or other types of collaborations 
as a result  we may enter markets in which we have no or limited prior experience 
competition for acquiring attractive businesses in our industry is substantial 
in executing this part of our business strategy  we may experience difficulty in identifying suitable acquisition candidates or in completing selected transactions at appropriate valuations 
we intend to pay for these acquisitions with cash and or our common stock which could impair our liquidity and dilute your ownership of our company 
further  we may not be able to successfully integrate any acquisitions that we do make into our existing business operations and we could assume unknown or contingent liabilities or experience negative effects on our reported results of operations from dilutive results from operations and or from future potential impairment of acquired assets including goodwill related to future acquisitions 
we may experience difficulties in operating in foreign countries or over significant geographical distances and in retaining key employees or customers of an acquired business  and our management s attention could be diverted from other business issues 
we may not identify or complete these transactions in a timely manner  on a cost effective basis or at all  and we may not realize the benefits of any acquisition or joint venture 
we may not be able to obtain financing to fund our future capital requirements  including strategic acquisitions  on favorable terms or at all  and the amount of equity that we can issue may likewise be limited 
if our cash flows from operations are less than we expect  we may need to issue additional equity or incur debt 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain necessary short term or other financing on favorable terms or at all 
if we are unable to obtain necessary financing  we may not be able to address gaps in our product offerings  improve our technology or increase our manufacturing capacity and we may not have sufficient cash to operate our business 
in particular  we may fund future acquisitions in whole or in part by issuing additional equity 
any equity issued would be dilutive to existing stockholders 
if the price of our equity is low or volatile  we may not be able to issue equity to acquire other companies and our acquisition strategy could require us to incur substantial amounts of indebtedness 
while we currently have no debt outstanding  potential future levels of indebtedness could have consequences for our business  including greater vulnerability to the cyclical nature of our industry and the effects of rapid demand shifts affecting our business  dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to repayment of debt  limiting the availability of cash for working capital  capital expenditures or acquisitions which may be attractive to us  and reduced flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and industry 
furthermore  if we raise funds through the issuance of debt  the debt securities issued will likely have rights  preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock in the event of a liquidation or otherwise  and the terms of the debt securities may impose restrictions on our operations 
we cannot assure you that financing for acquisitions will be available on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
loss of any of our key personnel could hurt our business because of their experience in the microelectronics industry and their technological expertise 
similarly  our inability to attract and retain new qualified personnel could inhibit our ability to operate and grow our business successfully 
we depend on the services of our key senior executives and other technological experts because of their experience in the microelectronics industry and their technical expertise 
the loss of the services of one or several of our key employees or an inability to attract  train and retain qualified and skilled employees  specifically research and development and engineering personnel  could result in the loss of customers or otherwise inhibit our ability to operate and grow our business successfully 
during the recent extended downturn in the semiconductor industry we had to impose salary reductions on our senior employees and freeze merit increases in an effort to maintain our financial position 
these actions may have an adverse effect on employee loyalty and may make it more difficult for us to attract and retain key personnel 
in addition  our ability to successfully integrate acquired facilities or businesses depends  in part  on our ability to retain and motivate key management and employees hired by us in connection with the acquisition 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights  our business and prospects could be harmed 
our future success and competitive position depend in part upon our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary technology used in our principal product families 
we rely  in part  on patent  trade secret and trademark law to protect that technology 
we routinely enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees 
however  there can be no assurance that these agreements will not be breached  that we will have adequate remedies for any breach or that our confidential and proprietary information and technology will not be independently developed by or become otherwise known to third parties 
we have obtained a number of patents relating to our products and have filed applications for additional patents 
we cannot assure you that any of our pending patent applications will be approved  that we will develop additional proprietary technology that is patentable  that any patents owned by or issued to us will provide us with competitive advantages or that these patents will not be challenged by third parties 
patent filings by third parties  whether made before or after the date of our filings  could render our intellectual property less valuable 
competitors may misappropriate our intellectual property  and disputes as to ownership of intellectual property may arise 
in addition  if we do not obtain sufficient international protection for our intellectual property  our competitiveness in international markets could be significantly impaired  which would limit our growth and future revenue 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that third parties will not design around our patents 
protection of our intellectual property rights has and may continue to result in costly litigation 
we may from time to time be required to institute litigation in order to enforce our patents  copyrights or other intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets  to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or to defend against claims of infringement 
such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could negatively affect our sales  profitability and prospects regardless of whether we are able to successfully enforce our rights 
for example  in  we settled a patent lawsuit in which each party claimed infringement of a patent by the other 
in connection with the settlement  we incurred a charge of approximately million and agreed to a cross license of the two patents at issue 
more recently  on march  we filed a lawsuit against pall corporation in the united states district court for the district of massachusetts alleging infringement of two of our us patents 
our lawsuit also seeks a preliminary injunction preventing pall corporation from manufacturing  using  selling  offering for sale or importing into the united states the infringing product 
as of the date of filing this annual report on form k  the court has not issued a ruling on these matters 
see  item legal proceedings above 
we expect that this litigation will continue for an extended period and that we will incur substantial costs in pursuing this litigation 
our ability to manufacture and sell our products and develop new products in response to competitive pressures could be restricted or delayed  and we could incur significant expenses  if we are unable to obtain necessary licenses to the proprietary technology of others 
we license and will continue to license technology used in the manufacture and distribution of our products from third parties 
our inability to acquire any third party licenses  or integrate the related third party technologies into our products  could result in delays in our product developments and enhancements until equivalent technologies can be identified  licensed or integrated 
we may also require new licenses in the future as our business grows and technology evolves 
we cannot assure you that these licenses will be available to us on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
if we infringe on the proprietary technology of others  our business and prospects could be harmed 
our commercial success will depend  in part  on our ability to avoid infringing or misappropriating any patents or other proprietary rights owned by third parties 
if we are found to infringe or misappropriate a third party s patent or other proprietary rights  we could be required to pay damages to such third party  alter our products or processes  obtain a license from the third party or cease activities utilizing such proprietary rights  including making or selling products utilizing such proprietary rights 
if we are required to obtain a license from a third party  there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so on commercially favorable terms  if at all 
we are subject to a variety of environmental laws which could cause us to incur significant expenses 
in addition to other regulatory requirements affecting our business  we are subject to a variety of federal  state  local and foreign regulatory requirements relating to the use  disposal  clean up of  and human exposure to  hazardous chemicals 
we generate and handle materials that are considered hazardous waste under applicable law 
if we fail to comply with any present or future regulations  we could be subject to future liabilities or the suspension of production 
in addition  compliance with these or future laws could restrict our ability to expand our facilities or build new facilities or require us to acquire costly equipment  incur other significant expenses or modify our manufacturing processes 
we are currently consolidating certain manufacturing operations from our yonezawa  japan facility into our billerica  massachusetts headquarters  research and development and manufacturing facility 
if we are unable to successfully manage this consolidation  our ability to deliver product to our customers could be disrupted and our business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
in order to enhance the efficiency and cost effectiveness of our manufacturing operations we are moving several product lines from our yonezawa  japan plant to our billerica facility 
these product lines involve technically complex manufacturing processes that require considerable expertise to operate 
if we are unable to complete this transfer in a systematic manner within established schedules or if we are unable to successfully operate these manufacturing processes in billerica  production may be disrupted and we may not be able to deliver these products to meet customer orders in a timely manner  which could harm our business 
terrorist attacks  such as the attacks that occurred in new york and washington  dc on september   and other acts of violence or war may affect the markets in which we operate and hurt our profitability 
terrorist attacks may negatively affect our operations and your investment 
there can be no assurance that there will not be further terrorist attacks against the united states or united states businesses 
these attacks or armed conflicts may directly impact our physical facilities or those of our suppliers or customers 
our primary facilities include headquarters  research and development and manufacturing facilities in the united states  sales  research and development and manufacturing facilities in japan and sales and service facilities in europe and asia 
also these attacks have disrupted the global insurance and reinsurance industries with the result that we may not be able to obtain insurance at historical terms and levels for our facilities 
furthermore  these attacks may make travel and the transportation of our supplies and products more difficult and more expensive and may ultimately affect the sales of our products in the united states and overseas 
as a result of terrorism the united states may enter into an armed conflict  which could have a further impact on our domestic and international sales  our supply chain  our production capacity and our ability to deliver products to our customers 
the consequences of these armed conflicts and instability are unpredictable and we may not be able to foresee events that could have an adverse effect on our business and your investment 
risks related to the securities markets and ownership of our securities our stock price may fluctuate significantly 
our stock price has in the past fluctuated and will fluctuate in the future in response to a variety of factors 
for example  since august   the closing price of our common stock has reached a high of and a low of 
factors which cause our stock prices to fluctuate include the following quarterly variations in our operating results  announcements of new products by us or our competitors  change in revenue or earnings estimates or publication of research reports by analysts  speculation in the press or investment community  strategic actions by us or our competitors  such as acquisitions or restructurings  actions by institutional stockholders  additions or departures of senior management  general market conditions  including conditions or trends in the semiconductor manufacturing industry  and domestic and international economic factors unrelated to our performance 
the stock markets in general  and the markets for high technology stocks in particular  have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
these broad market fluctuations may cause the trading price of our common stock to decrease 
recently enacted changes in the securities laws and regulations are likely to increase our costs 
the sarbanes oxley act of that became law in july has required changes in some of our corporate governance  securities disclosure and compliance practices 
in response to the requirements of that act  the securities and exchange commission and the new york stock exchange have promulgated new rules and listing standards covering a variety of subjects 
compliance with these new rules and listing standards has increased our legal and financial and accounting costs  and we expect these increased costs to continue indefinitely 
we also expect these developments to make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance  and we may be forced to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage 
likewise  these developments may make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors  particularly independent directors  or qualified executive officers 
if our independent auditors are unable to provide us with an unqualified report as to of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting as of december  and future year ends as required by section of the sarbanes oxley act of  investors could lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements  which could result in a decrease in the value of your shares 
as directed by section of the sarbanes oxley act of  the securities and exchange commission adopted rules requiring public companies to include a report of management on the company s internal controls over financial reporting in their annual reports on form k that contains an assessment by management of the effectiveness of the company s internal controls over financial reporting 
in addition  the public accounting firm auditing the company s financial statements must attest to and report on management s assessment of the effectiveness of the company s internal controls over financial reporting 
this requirement will first apply to our annual report on form k for our fiscal year ending december  while we intend to conduct a rigorous review of our internal controls over financial reporting in order to assure compliance with the section requirements  if our independent auditors interpret the section requirements and the related rules and regulations differently from us or if our independent auditors are not satisfied with our internal controls over financial reporting or with the level at which these controls are documented  operated or reviewed  they may decline to attest to management s assessment or may issue a qualified report 
this could result in an adverse reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of confidence in the reliability of our financial statements  which could cause the market price of our shares to decline 
changes to financial accounting standards may affect our reported results of operations and could result in a decrease in the value of your shares 
there has been an ongoing public debate as to whether employee stock option and employee stock purchase plan shares should be treated as a compensation expense and  if so  how to properly value such charges 
if we are required to record an expense for our stock based compensation plans using the fair value method  we would incur significant compensation charges 
although we are currently not required to record any compensation expense using the fair value method in connection with option grants that have an exercise price at or above fair market value of our common stock and for shares issued under our employee stock purchase plan  if future laws and regulations require us to treat all stock based compensation as a compensation expense using the fair value method our results of operations could be adversely affected 
provisions in our charter documents  delaware law and our shareholder rights plan may delay or prevent an acquisition of us  which could decrease the value of your shares 
our certificate of incorporation and by laws  delaware law and our shareholder rights plan contain provisions that could make it harder for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our board of directors 
these provisions include a classified board of directors and limitations on actions by our stockholders by written consent 
in addition  subject to applicable new york stock exchange listing standards  our board of directors has the right to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval  which could be used to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer 
our shareholder rights plan will permit our stockholders to purchase shares of our common stock at a discount upon the occurrence of specified events  including the acquisition by anyone of or more of our common stock  unless such event is approved by our board of directors 
delaware law also imposes restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of or more of our outstanding common stock 
although we believe these provisions provide for an opportunity to receive a higher bid by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors  these provisions apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by stockholders 
if a change of control or change in management is delayed or prevented  the market price of our common stock could suffer 
your percentage ownership in us may be diluted by future issuances of capital stock  which could reduce your influence over matters on which stockholders vote 
subject to applicable new york stock exchange listing standards  our board of directors has the authority  without action or vote of our stockholders  to issue all or any part of our authorized but unissued shares 
issuances of common stock or the exercise of employee and director stock options would dilute your percentage ownership interest  which will have the effect of reducing your influence over matters on which our stockholders vote 
in addition  if the issuances are made at prices that reflect a discount from the then current trading price of our common stock  your interest in the book value of our common stock might be diluted 
risks related to our separation from millipore our pre separation historical financial information may not be representative of our results as a stand alone company and  therefore  may not be reliable as an indicator of our historical or future results 
we have only a limited operating history as an independent company 
prior to our separation from millipore  millipore did not account for us  and we were not operated  as a stand alone entity 
the historical combined financial information incorporated into this report were derived in part from millipore s consolidated financial statements and may not be indicative of our financial position  results of operations or cash flows in the future nor is it necessarily indicative of what our financial position  results of operations or cash flows would have been had we been a stand alone entity for all of the periods presented 
this is primarily a result of the following factors our historical combined financial statements reflect allocations for periods prior to our separation from millipore  primarily with respect to general corporate and research expenses  these allocations may be less than the general corporate and research expenses we will incur in the future as a stand alone company  and our historical combined financial statements do not fully reflect the significant changes that have occurred and that we expect to occur in the future as a result of our separation from millipore  including changes in how we fund our operations  conduct research and tax planning and manage employee matters 
following our separation from millipore  we have incurred incremental non recurring operating costs and expenses associated with increased marketing expenses related to establishing a new brand identity  legal fees  retention bonuses  increased depreciation due to decreases in the estimated useful lives of fixed assets and leasehold improvements and other separation related costs 
we currently use millipore s membrane manufacturing infrastructure  and our ability to meet our customer s demands will suffer if we do not successfully extend these arrangements or transition our membrane manufacturing requirements to other facilities 
we have entered into transition agreements with millipore relating to the manufacture and distribution of specified products for limited periods of time 
the manufacture of our membrane products is highly complex and requires sophisticated and costly equipment 
while we are entitled to continue to manufacture membrane in millipore s plant until march of  we might not be able to extend these arrangements or successfully transition the membrane production to a different facility after that date 
as a result  any prolonged disruption in the operations of any of our manufacturing facilities or any unforeseen delays in shifting membrane manufacturing operations to a new facility  whether due to technical or labor difficulties  destruction or damage to the facility or other reasons  could result in increased costs and reduced revenues and profitability and could harm our prospects 
following our separation from millipore  we do not have access to the membrane research and development resources that were previously available to us  which could limit our research and development activities  thereby inhibiting our ability to develop new membrane products in response to competitive pressures and harming our business and prospects 
prior to our separation from millipore  many research and development projects were conducted through the centralized millipore research group 
following our separation from millipore  while our research and development personnel have been transferred to us in accordance with the terms of the separation agreements  we do not have access to any other resources or personnel in millipore s research group other than in specific limited circumstances outlined in our research agreement with millipore 
as a result  we will not have access to all of the research and development facilities and resources  including membrane research resources  that were previously available to us  and we may not be able to manage projects as successfully as we had in the past 
if we are unable to continue to successfully develop new membrane products and technology through internal research and development activities  we may not be able to maintain our market position or successfully grow our business and our business and prospects may be harmed 
our agreements with millipore limit our ability to use millipore s technology to fields of use in the microelectronics industry and may prevent us from expanding our business beyond the microelectronics industry 
our use of millipore s technology is governed by the agreements governing our separation from millipore  such as the master patent license agreement and the master trade secret and know how agreement 
the licenses granted by these agreements prohibit our use of millipore s technology in fields of use outside of the microelectronics industry 
in general  where technology is used both by millipore in the manufacture of its products and by us in the manufacture of our products  millipore retained ownership of the technology and granted us a license to use the technology limited to fields of use in the microelectronics industry 
in some cases  millipore transferred ownership of the technology to us and retained an exclusive license to the technology in its fields of use in the biopharmaceutical and related industries 
under the master patent license agreement and the master trade secret and know how agreement  we may sell products using millipore s technology only to customers in the microelectronics industry  as defined in the agreements  and we may not transfer the technology except in limited circumstances 
these restrictions could limit our ability to expand our business into markets outside the microelectronics industry  which could limit our growth 
we may have potential business conflicts of interest with millipore with respect to our past and ongoing relationships 
conflicts of interest may arise between millipore and us in a number of areas relating to our past and ongoing relationships  including labor  tax  employee benefit  intellectual property  indemnification and other matters arising from our separation from millipore  employee retention and recruiting  the nature  quality and pricing of membrane manufacturing services millipore has agreed to provide us  business opportunities that may be attractive to both millipore and us  and the terms of the non competition provisions contained in the separation agreements between millipore and us  which govern millipore s ability to compete with us 
competition between millipore and us in areas outside of our separation agreements  especially if millipore chooses to reestablish a microelectronics business unit  or work with third party to establish a competitive capability 
we may not be able to resolve any potential conflicts  and even if we do  the resolution may be less favorable because of our prior affiliation with millipore and our continuing reliance on millipore to provide transitional manufacturing services 
in addition  millipore may terminate transitional arrangements that currently generate income for us 
we may be responsible for certain income tax liabilities arising out of the tax sharing agreement entered into with millipore in connection with our separation from millipore 
millipore has received a tax ruling from the internal revenue service to the effect that the distribution will qualify as a tax free distribution for us federal income tax purposes 
the tax ruling is binding on the irs  and can be relied upon by millipore provided that the factual representations and assumptions made in millipore s request are true 
we are not aware of any facts or circumstances that would cause such representations and assumptions to be untrue 
our tax sharing agreement with millipore provides that we will be responsible for certain taxes imposed on millipore  us or our respective subsidiaries if we or one or more of our shareholders are responsible for the distribution s failure to qualify for tax free treatment 
in addition  under the tax sharing agreement that we entered into with millipore  we are responsible for tax liabilities and adjustments to tax liabilities with respect to those millipore foreign subsidiaries which we acquired pursuant to our separation from millipore for periods prior to that separation 
as we operate independently of millipore we may adopt tax strategies different from those millipore has followed which could impact our tax liability 
further  under the tax sharing agreement millipore is entitled to use net operating losses generated by our business during periods prior to the spin off  if it should elect to use any of these losses  the company would be indemnified for loss of these tax attributes
