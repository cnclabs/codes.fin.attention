item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to intangible assets and contingencies and litigation 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we identified our most critical accounting policies to be those related to revenue recognition for our software contracts with multiple elements  contracts accounted for using the percentage of completion method  and capitalized software 
we describe these accounting policies in relevant sections of this discussion and analysis 
this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
overview and recent developments as discussed above  on january   we consummated the purchase of the enterprise mobility solutions business unit of aether systems  inc this unit brings to tcs a substantial base of  enterprise customers  more than  wireless data subscribers  applications for logistics  financial services and the mobile office  and employees 
prior to the january acquisition  we managed our business in three operating segments network software  service bureau and network solutions 
subsequent to the acquisition  we realigned our operating segments to better manage the business we now operate 
our operating segments now include i our wireless carrier segment  which consists principally of the previous network software and service bureau segments  ii our government segment  which consists principally of the previous network solutions segment  and iii our enterprise segment  which comprises the operations we acquired from aether systems  inc the information in this section is historical in nature and is presented based on the operating segments through which we managed our business prior to this acquisition 
this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations provides information that our management believes to be necessary to achieve a clear understanding of our financial statements and results of operations 
our management monitors and analyzes a number of key performance indicators in order to manage our business and evaluate our financial and operating performance 
those indicators include revenue 
we derive revenue from products and services including software license fees relating to our products and monthly recurring service fees related to our service bureau segment 
we manage our business across three segments network software  service bureau and network solutions 
our network software segment consists of the development and licensing of software products and of related services 
our service bureau segment includes our e and hosted software application offerings 
our network solutions segment includes the design  development and deployment of information processing and communication systems and related services 
cost of revenue 
we strive to control our cost of revenue required to deliver and support our products and services while maintaining and delivering the quality of service expected by our customers 
the major items impacting our cost of revenue are compensation and benefits as well as third party hardware and software and overhead expenses 
hardware and third party software costs are primarily associated with the delivery of product within our network solutions segment while also  to a lesser extent  may be attributed to the delivery of services within our network software segment 
these costs tend to fluctuate as a result of the relative volume  mix of projects  level of service support required and the complexity of customized products and services delivered in a period 
operating expenses 
operating expenses are substantially driven by compensation and benefits  travel costs  professional fees  facility costs  specific marketing and sales related expenses as well as certain non cash expenses such as non cash stock compensation expenses  depreciation and amortization of property and equipment  of software development costs  and of acquired intangible assets 
operating expenses are incurred in connection with the development and marketing of new software applications as well as general corporate overhead expenses 
liquidity and cash flows 
the primary driver of our cash flows is our net income 
important sources of our liquidity have been cash raised at the time of our initial public offering in  our january private investment in public equity financing  and borrowing and lease financings secured for the purchase of equipment 
balance sheet 
we view cash  working capital  accounts receivable balances and days revenues outstanding as important indicators of our financial health 
results of operations revenue and cost of revenue the following discussion addresses the relative revenue and direct cost for each segment of our business network software revenue and related direct cost the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  year over year comparison of the key components of network software revenue and related direct cost 
vs 
vs 
in millions network software segment revenue network software licenses network software services network software total revenue direct cost of network software segment gross profit percent of revenue see discussion of segment reporting in note to the accompanying audited financial statements 
we market our network software products and services by responding to requests for proposals  through our direct sales force and through channel partners 
we generate network software revenue from licensing of our software products  and providing related maintenance and deployment services 
we also sell custom software applications 
the wireless internet gateway wig  tcs xypoint location platform products  short message service center smsc  as well as alerting and message notification applications are the principal generators of software license fees 
we sell our software products directly to wireless carriers 
initial licensing fees are a function of the number of subscribers or other measure of usage of our software in the network where our software is deployed 
as a carrier s subscriber base or usage increases  the carrier must purchase additional capacity under its license agreement and we receive additional revenue 
generally  we recognize license fee revenue when each of the following has occurred evidence of an arrangement is in place  we have delivered software  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection of the fee is probable 
software projects that require significant customization are accounted for under the percentage of completion method 
we measure progress to completion using costs incurred compared to estimated total costs 
we recognize estimated losses under long term contracts in their entirety upon discovery 
if we did not accurately estimate total costs to complete a contract or do not manage our contracts within the planned budget  then future margins may be negatively affected or losses on existing contracts may need to be recognized 
software license fees billed and not recognized as revenue are included in deferred revenue 
we have also historically sold some of our network software products through our channel relationship with lucent 
this sales process typically includes participation of our engineers along with original equipment manufacturers in presenting our products to prospective customers 
lucent pays us initial license fees ranging from to of the revenue it generates from sales of the smsc application that we developed under our development agreement 
for sales of our wig  lucent pays us initial fees ranging between and of the sale value which we negotiate on a case by case basis 
in  software license revenue declined from million to million  primarily because new business was not booked to replace revenue generated in from a large contract to deliver a location platform for multiple carrier networks in europe and the pacific 
for  license revenue increased from s million primarily because of that large project 
our network software service revenue arises from annual maintenance fees for our packaged and custom software products and fees from custom development and implementation of software products 
maintenance fees on packaged software are collected in advance and recognized ratably over the maintenance period 
unrecognized maintenance fees are included in deferred revenue 
custom software development  implementation and maintenance services may be provided under time and materials or fixed fee contracts 
we also occasionally sell computer equipment as part of our packaged software sales 
in  of service revenues related to maintenance fees  while related to installation fees associated with the delivery of related software applications and the remaining related to third party hardware and software delivered as part of our packaged software sales 
in  of service revenue is related to maintenance fees  while of service revenue is associated with delivered third party hardware and software delivered as part of our packaged software sales  of service revenue is associated with installation fees  while relates to custom software applications for government agencies which  in late  we decided to no longer pursue 
in  of service revenue is related to maintenance fees  while of service revenue is associated with delivered third party hardware and software delivered as part of our packaged software sales  of service revenue is associated with installation fees  related to other software services while relates to custom software applications for government agencies 
the direct cost of our network software revenue consists primarily of compensation  benefits  purchased equipment  third party software  travel expenses and consulting fees incurred when providing our services 
in  such costs primarily included compensation  benefits  travel and consulting fees 
in  such costs primarily included compensation  benefits  travel expenses and consulting fees while of such costs related to the cost of purchased equipment and third party software delivered as part of our packaged software sales in that year

service bureau revenue and related direct cost the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  a year over year comparison of the key components of service bureau revenue and related direct cost vs 
vs 
in millions service bureau revenue direct cost of service bureau segment gross profit percent of revenues average number of psaps served see discussion of segment reporting in note to the accompanying audited financial statements 
our service bureau offerings include our e  hosted position determining entity pde and text message distribution center mdc applications 
revenue from our service bureau offerings primarily consists of monthly recurring service fees and is recognized in the month earned 
e and pde service fees are primarily dependent on the number of subscribers the carrier covers  public service answering points psaps served or cell sites that provide e services for the carrier 
as the carrier s number of subscribers  psaps  or cell sites increases  the monthly recurring service fees increase 
message distribution center revenue is priced based on message volume 
in  we expedited the deployment of psaps related to all our customers resulting in an increase in the average number of psaps served by approximately  or 
additionally  in we signed additional wireless carriers to the e service and deployed hosted pde and mdc applications to two additional carriers  each of which continue to increase in volume each month 
in  the fcc mandate resulted in significant response by wireless carriers and we added additional wireless carriers and experienced a increase in volume 
however  such volume was somewhat offset by lower average per unit pricing under new long term contracts which took effect in the first quarter of in  service bureau revenue resulted from lower volume as the business was working with carriers to develop their deployment strategy in response to the fcc mandate 
the direct cost of our service bureau revenue consists primarily of compensation  benefits  travel expenses  and consulting fees incurred when providing our services  as well as the equipment maintenance and circuit costs of our network operations centers circuits utilized for connectivity to carrier customers and local governments public safety answering points 
in  we increased headcount by to support this business while incurring costs related to temporary contract staff to support our rapid deployment effort 
this increase in headcount during was partially offset by a reduction in circuit costs that resulted from renegotiating several contracts during the year 
in  we increased headcount and increased infrastructure costs to support this business from the levels in network solutions revenue and related direct cost the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the year over year comparison of the key components of our network solutions revenue and related direct cost vs 
vs 
in millions network solutions revenue direct cost of network solutions segment gross profit percent of revenues see discussion of segment reporting in note to the accompanying audited financial statements 
we generate network solutions revenue from the design  development  assembly and deployment of information processing and communication systems  primarily for government enterprises 
representative examples of recent network solutions projects include delivery of our swiftlink product  a lightweight  secure  deployable communications systems to the us departments of state  justice  and defense and information services systems to local government agencies 
swiftlink provides secure voice  video and data communications  supports a worldwide network during trips abroad and throughout the united states and provides full network functionality and internet protocol telephony capability using landlines and satellite based technologies 
our network solutions segment also operates teleport facilities in baltimore  md and manassas  va  which support the integration of satellite communications and terrestrial wireless broadband with us broadband networks 
through our teleport facilities we offer data connectivity via satellite to and from north and south america  as well as africa and europe 
we generally provide network solutions under long term contracts 
we recognize revenue under long term contracts as billable costs are incurred and for fixed price contracts using the percentage of completion method  measured by either total labor hours or total costs incurred compared to total estimated labor hours or costs 
we recognize estimated losses on contracts in their entirety upon discovery 
if we did not accurately estimate total labor hours or costs to complete a contract or do not manage our contracts within the planned budget  then future margins may be negatively affected or losses on existing contracts may need to be recognized 
under our contracts with the us government  contract costs  including the allocated indirect expenses  are subject to audit and adjustment by the defense contract audit agency 
we record revenue under these contracts at estimated net realizable amounts 
in  approximately of network solutions revenue resulted from the sale of swiftlink and related deployable communications systems  an increase of over the amount in in  we also designed  tested and delivered products to government customers related to other satellite based communication systems and information processing systems for local government agencies 
in  of our revenue for this segment resulted from the sale of swiftlink and related deployable communication systems  while the remaining amount related to the design and development of other communication systems  and the design  testing and delivery of products for several government agencies 
in  of revenue was associated with deployable communications and integration projects including a large contract related to an african project while the remainder related to the design  testing and delivery of information processing systems and other products for several government agencies 
the direct cost of our network solutions revenue consists of compensation  benefits  travel  satellite space segment and airtime and approximately of costs are related to purchased equipment components  which we purchase as needed for customer contracts  and the costs of third party contractors that we engage 
major customers for the year ended december   customers that accounted for or more of total revenue were verizon wireless and various us government agencies 
the loss of either of these customers would have a material adverse impact on our business 
for the year ended december  customers that accounted for or more of total revenue were hutchison g  verizon wireless and various us government agencies 
lucent technologies and various us government agencies accounted for or more of total revenue for the year ended december  revenue backlog total company backlog at january  was million  of which million related to our network software segment  million related to our service bureau segment and million related to our network solutions segment plus million from our acquired assets effective january  we expect to realize approximately million of this backlog in the next twelve months 
the remaining backlog represents primarily the balance of multi year contracts for our service bureau segment 
total company backlog at january  was million 
our backlog at any given time may be affected by a number of factors  including contracts being renewed or new contracts being signed before existing contracts are completed 
some of our backlog could be canceled for causes such as late delivery  poor performance  and other factors 
accordingly  a comparison of backlog from period to period is not necessarily meaningful and may not be indicative of eventual actual revenue 
operating expenses research and development expense 
the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  a year over year comparison of our research and development expense vs 
vs 
in millions research and development expense percent of revenue our research and development expense consists of compensation  benefits  travel costs  and a proportionate share of facilities and corporate overhead 
the costs of developing software products are expensed prior to establishing technological feasibility 
for new products  technological feasibility is established when an operative version of the computer software product is completed in the same software language as the product to be ultimately marketed  performs all the major functions planned for the product  and has successfully completed initial customer testing 
technological feasibility for enhancements to an existing product is established when a detail program design is completed 
we incur research and development costs to enhance existing packaged software products as well as to create new software products including software hosted in our service bureau network operations center 
these costs primarily include compensation and benefits as well as costs associated with using third party laboratory and testing resources 
we expense research and development costs as they are incurred unless technological feasibility has been reached and marketability is certain 
in  the expenses we incurred related to software applications which are being marketed to new and existing customers on a global basis 
in  the research and development was mostly focused on expanded functionality of our location platform software while in and in  such expenditures were primarily incurred in the development of our wireless internet gateway and e applications 
management continually assesses our spending on research and development to ensure resources are focused on products that are expected to achieve the highest level of success 
we do not expect research and development expense to increase significantly in but may increase as a result of our acquisition of the enterprise division 
sales and marketing expense the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  a year over year comparison of our sales and marketing expenses vs 
vs 
in millions sales and marketing expense percent of total revenue our sales and marketing expenses include compensation and benefits  trade show expenses  travel costs  advertising and public relations costs as well as a proportionate share of facility related costs which are expensed as incurred 
our marketing efforts also include speaking engagements and attending and sponsoring industry conferences 
we sell our network software products and services through our direct sales force and through indirect channels 
we have also historically leveraged our relationship with original equipment manufacturers to market our network software products to wireless carrier customers 
we sell our network solutions primarily through direct sales professionals 
costs incurred for sales and marketing have declined in from largely due to reduced headcount and the alignment of resources with products and services to more effectively target certain markets 
in such costs were lower than  reflecting savings achieved by consolidating efforts for all three business segments 
we expect our sales and marketing expense to increase in as a result of our acquisition of the enterprise division 
such costs may fluctuate quarter to quarter depending on spending on tradeshows and variable compensation based on level of revenue 
general and administrative expense the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  a year over year comparison of our general and administrative expense vs 
vs 
in millions general and administrative expense percent of total revenue general and administrative expense consists primarily of compensation costs and other costs associated with management  finance  human resources and internal information systems 
these costs include compensation  benefits  travel  and a proportionate share of rent  utilities and other facilities costs which are expensed as incurred 
in such costs were lower than in largely due to savings realized through reduced headcount and reduced professional fees 
in such expenditures were lower than in reflecting savings achieved in combining systems and processes of acquired companies into our central operations as well as reduced headcount 
we expect general and administrative expense to increase modestly during as a result of our acquisition of the enterprise division 
non cash stock compensation expense the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  a year over year comparison of our non cash stock compensation expense vs 
vs 
in millions non cash stock compensation expense during the second and third quarters of  we granted options to purchase  shares of class a common stock to employees and directors at an exercise price less than the fair market value of our class a common stock at the date of grant 
net loss attributable to common stockholders  as reported  includes   and  of non cash stock compensation expense related to these grants for the years ended december     respectively 
we expect to record future stock compensation expense of as a result of option grants that will be recognized over the remaining vesting period of two years 
in the second quarter of  we issued restricted stock to directors and certain key executives 
the restrictions expire at the end of one year for directors and in annual increments over three years for executives  and are based on continued employment 
net loss for the year ended december   as reported  includes of non cash stock compensation expense related to such stock grants 
we expect to record future stock compensation expense of  as a result of these restricted stock grants that will be recognized over the remaining vesting period for directors and executives 
depreciation and amortization of property and equipment the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  a year over year comparison of our depreciation and amortization of property and equipment vs 
vs 
in millions depreciation and amortization of property and equipment average gross cost of property and equipment depreciation and amortization expense other than amortization of software development costs represents the period costs associated with our investment in computers  telephony equipment  software  furniture and fixtures  and leasehold improvements 
we compute depreciation and amortization using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
in expense was slightly higher than and was higher than reflecting the level of capital expenditures made each year primarily to support our network operations centers and our development efforts 
amortization of software development costs the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  a year over year comparison of our amortization of software development costs vs 
vs 
in millions amortization of software development costs amount of accelerated amortization percent of network software license revenue excluding accelerated amortization we capitalize software development costs after we establish technological feasibility  and amortize those costs over the estimated useful lives of the software beginning on the date when the software is first installed and used 
we calculate amortization of software development costs on a product by product basis using the straight line method over the remaining estimated economic life of the product  which is never greater than three years 
we also compute amortization using the ratio that current revenue for the product bears to the total of current and anticipated future revenue for that product 
if this revenue curve method results in amortization greater than the amount computed using the straight line method  we record amortization at that greater amount 
amortization as a percentage of software license fees is generally a higher percentage in the early stages of a product s life cycle 
our policies to determine when to capitalize software development costs and how much to amortize in a given period requires us to make subjective estimates and judgments 
if our software products do not achieve the level of market acceptance that we expect and our future revenue estimates for these products change  the amount of amortization that we record may increase compared to prior periods 
in these expenses were higher than in primarily due to accelerated amortization of software development costs of million recorded in june 
the accelerated amortization was considered necessary based on the assessment of the remaining value of recorded costs relative to the amount of recoverability based on decreased levels of marketability of several products 
amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets the goodwill and other intangible assets associated with our acquisitions were being amortized over their useful lives 
the valuation conducted in resulted in an impairment charge against the value of such goodwill and intangible assets  thereby reducing the amount of the expense related to the remaining value 
the cost of the xypoint trade name continued to be amortized in and based on its estimated useful life of three years using the straight line method and was fully amortized by december  interest expense the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  a year over year comparison of our components of interest expense vs

in millions interest expense incurred on capital lease obligations interest expense incurred on notes payable nm amortization of deferred commitment fees capitalized interest nm total interest expense interest expense is incurred under capital lease obligations and notes payable 
our capital lease obligations include interest at various amounts depending on the lease arrangement 
the balance of our total capital lease obligations decreased from to and  therefore  the related interest expense was also lower 
conversely  interest under the terms of our notes payable are primarily at stated interest rates of and the amount of borrowing under notes payable has increased in the same time period 
because interest rates under the terms of our notes payable are somewhat lower than those under capital leases  total interest expense incurred has decreased 
deferred financing fees relate to the up front payment of fees that were incurred to secure our notes payable and our revolving line of credit facility with silicon valley bank and are being amortized over the term of the note or in the case of the line of credit  the life of the facility which expires april in  interest expense was reduced by the amount of interest that was capitalized relating to the capitalization of software development costs

we currently believe that we have sufficient capital resources to meet our anticipated working capital and capital expenditures needs for the foreseeable future 
we may consider raising capital in the public markets as a means to meet our debt obligations or repay the amount of debt secured under the terms of the convertible subordinated debentures 
while unanticipated events and opportunities may make it necessary for us to return to the capital markets  establish new credit facilities or raise capital in private transactions in order to meet our capital requirements  we do not anticipate having to do so in the foreseeable future and we can offer no assurances that we will be able to access the capital markets on terms acceptable to us or at all 
operating cash flows improved in primarily as a result of improvements in gross profit and reduction of operating expenses 
management believes that an important measure of cash flow from operating results is a measure of adjusted operating income loss  excluding non cash charges 
adjusted operating income loss  excluding non cash charges is a non gaap financial measure which indicates the amount of cash generated from used in the operations of the business

accounts payable and accrued expenses were million lower in than in primarily related to the required timing of payments to vendors and the status of certain long term projects that remain open at the end of the period 
net cash used in investing activities increased in from while was lower than in in  the total cash used for the purchase of property and equipment and development of our software products was million while they were million in both and the decline in is primarily due to completion of certain software development projects that were under development in prior years 
property and equipment purchases include equipment and software costs required for our network operations center  our software development efforts  and our corporate administrative support 
additionally  in  such costs included the purchase of a seven acre teleport facility in virginia 
net cash provided by financing activities increased in from previous year levels as we secured financing to fund our capital expenditure needs while meeting our commitment to repay lease and long term debt obligations 
in july  we amended our agreement with silicon valley bank for a million line of credit 
we can borrow an amount equal to up to of receivables less than days old 
the line of credit is secured by accounts receivable and bears interest at prime plus for equipment loans and an interest rate of prime plus for all other loans  with a minimum prime rate of borrowing rates of and  respectively  at december  
as part of this agreement  we can borrow up to million under the terms of an equipment loan secured by purchased equipment for a term of up to three years 
the equipment loan was drawn at december  the line of credit will expire in april as of december   we had million available and unused under the revolving line of credit and as of february   there were no other borrowings outstanding under the line of credit 
on january   we consummated the purchase  with an effective date of january   of the enterprise mobility solutions division of aether systems  inc consideration for the acquisition was valued at approximately million  consisting of million in cash  million in the form of a note payable and  newly issued shares of class a common stock 
concurrent with the acquisition  we closed on million of financing with two accredited institutional investors  which included a subordinated convertible debenture with stated principal of million  bearing interest at a stated rate of per annum and due in lump sum on january  in cash or shares of our class a common stock  approximately million newly issued shares of our class a common stock and warrants to purchase  shares of our class a common stock at a strike price of per share  expiring in january the majority of the proceeds from this financing transaction was used to fund the purchase of the acquired assets 
off balance sheet arrangements we are not a party to any off balance sheet arrangements 
commitments as of december   our most significant commitments consisted of long term debt  obligations under capital leases and non cancelable operating leases 
we lease certain furniture and computer equipment under capital leases 
we lease office space and equipment under non cancelable operating leases 
as of december  our commitments consisted of the following in millions beyond total notes payable capital lease obligations operating leases related party transactions during and  we made loans to six senior executives totaling million  all of which were fully repaid with interest by december  in february  we entered into a lease with annapolis partners llc to explore the opportunity of relocating our annapolis offices to a planned new real estate development 
our president and chief executive officer owns a controlling voting and economic interest in annapolis partners llc and he also serves as a member 
the financial and many other terms of the lease have not yet been established 
the lease is subject to several contingencies and rights of termination 
for example  the lease can be terminated at the sole discretion of our board of directors if the terms and conditions of the development are unacceptable to us  including without limitation the circumstances that market conditions make the lease not favorable to us or the overall cost is not in the best interest to us or our shareholders  or any legal or regulatory restrictions apply 
our board of directors will evaluate this opportunity along with alternatives that are or may become available in the relevant time periods and there is no assurance that we will enter into a definitive lease at this new development site 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we have limited exposure to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates 
in may  we entered into an agreement with silicon valley bank for a million line of credit 
the agreement was amended in july  extending the agreement to april we can borrow an amount aggregating up to of receivables less than days old

as of february   million was outstanding under the terms of an equipment loan which was secured by purchased equipment  bearing interest at and payable monthly through december during  we borrowed approximately million primarily to fund equipment purchases 
the borrowings bear interest at a weighted average interest rate of 
at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million 
cash and cash equivalents consisted of demand deposits and money market accounts that are interest rate sensitive 
however  these investments have short maturities mitigating their sensitivity to interest rates 
a hypothetical basis point adverse movement decrease in interest rates would have increased our net loss for by approximately million  resulting in no significant impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
foreign currency risk in january  we entered into a contract for the sale of our products and services  which is denominated in british pounds sterling 
fluctuations in the value of the british pound sterling relative to the united states dollar could cause us to incur foreign currency exchange gains or losses 
under the terms of this contract  we will be paid in british pounds sterling which exposes us to foreign currency exchange risk 
in april  we entered into several foreign currency option contracts 
a portion of the option contracts notional amount of million british pound sterling was entered into to manage our exposure to changes in the foreign currency exchange rate related to the forecasted net cash receipts under our january contract for products and services 
we also entered into foreign currency options  notional amount of million british pound sterling  for speculative purposes in april the change in fair value of these options is reflected in other income on our consolidated statements of operations 
these options had various expiration dates between october and march during  we settled options with a notational value of million british pound sterling and options with a notational value of million british pound sterling expired and were not exercised 
the expense recognized for settled options was million 
as of december   all of the option contracts had expired 
the expense recognized for settled options in was  as of december  we had approximately million in accounts receivable and million in unbilled receivables that are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk 
we recorded transaction gains of  on foreign currency denominated receivables for the year ended december
