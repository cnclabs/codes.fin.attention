overview we are a hotel franchisor with franchise agreements representing  hotels open and hotels under development as of december   with  rooms and  rooms  respectively  in countries and territories 
our brand names include comfort inn  comfort suites  quality  clarion  sleep inn  econo lodge  rodeway inn  mainstay suites and flag hotels 
the company s franchises operate in states  puerto rico and additional countries and territories 
approximately of the company s revenues are derived from hotels franchised in the united states 
our company generates revenues  income and cash flows primarily from initial and continuing royalty fees attributable to our franchise agreements 
revenues are also generated from partner services endorsed vendor arrangements  hotel operations and other sources 
we are contractually required by our franchise agreements to use the marketing and reservation fees we collect for system wide marketing and reservation activities 
these expenditures  which include advertising costs and costs to maintain our central reservations system  help to enhance awareness and increase consumer preference for our brands 
greater awareness and preference promotes long term growth in business delivery to our franchisees  which ultimately increases franchise fees earned by the company 
our company articulates its mission as a commitment to provide hotel franchises that strive to generate the highest return on investment 
we have developed an operating system dedicated to our franchisees success one that focuses on delivering guests to our franchised hotels and reducing costs for our hotel owners 
more specifically  through our actions we strive every day to continuously improve our franchise offerings to create the highest return on investment of any hotel franchise 
we believe that executing our strategic priorities creates value 
our company focuses on two key value drivers profitable growth 
our success is dependent on improving the performance of our hotels and increasing our system size by selling additional hotel franchises 
we attempt to improve our franchisees revenues and overall profitability by providing a variety of products and services designed to increase business delivery to and or reduce operating and development costs for our franchisees 
these products and services include national marketing campaigns  a central reservation system  property and yield management systems  quality assurance standards and endorsed vendor relationships 
we believe that healthy brands which deliver a compelling return on investment for franchisees will enable us to sell additional hotel franchises 
we have established multiple brands that meet the needs of many types of guests  and can be developed at various price points and applied to both new and existing hotels 
this ensures that we have brands suitable for creating growth in a variety of market conditions 
improving the performance of the hotels under franchise and growing the system through additional franchise sales while maintaining a disciplined cost structure are the keys to profitable growth 

table of contents maximizing financial returns and creating value for shareholders 
our capital allocation decisions  including capital structure and uses of capital  are intended to maximize our return on invested capital and create value for our shareholders 
we believe our strong and predictable cash flows create a strong financial position that provides us a competitive advantage 
our business does not require significant capital to operate and grow  therefore  we can maintain a capital structure that generates high financial returns and use our excess cash flow to increase returns to our shareholders 
we have returned value to our shareholders in two primary ways share repurchases and dividends 
in  we instituted a share repurchase program which has generated substantial value for our shareholders 
we have repurchased million shares of common stock at a total cost of million  or an average price of per share since the program s inception 
our cash flows from operations support our ability to complete the repurchase of approximately million shares presently remaining under our current board of directors authorization 
upon completion of the current authorization we will evaluate the propriety of additional share repurchases with our board of directors 
in  we initiated a cash dividend of per share per quarter on our common stock 
the initial dividend was declared in december and paid in january we presently expect to continue to pay dividends in the future 
based on our present dividend rate and outstanding share count aggregate annual dividends would be approximately million 
we believe these value drivers  when properly implemented  will enhance our profitability  maximize our financial returns and continue to generate value for our shareholders 
the ultimate measure of our success will be reflected in the items below 
results of operations 
royalty fees  operating income  net income and diluted earnings per share represent key measurements of these value drivers 
in  royalty fees revenue totaled approximately million  a increase from operating income totaled million in  a increase from net income increased to million  an increase from diluted earnings per share were  a improvement over net income and diluted earnings per share include a million gain from the prepayment of a note receivable during these measurements will continue to be a key management focus in and beyond 
refer to md a heading operations review for additional analysis of our results 
liquidity and capital resources 
in  net cash provided by operating activities was million  a increase from since our business does not require significant reinvestment of capital  we utilize cash in ways that management believes provides the greatest returns to our shareholders which include share repurchases and dividends 
we believe the company s cash flow from operations and available financing capacity are sufficient to meet the expected future operating  investing and financing needs of the business 
refer to md a heading liquidity and capital resources for additional analysis 
the principal factors that affect the company s results are the number and relative mix of franchised hotels  growth in the number of hotels under franchise  occupancy and room rates achieved by the hotels under franchise  the effective royalty rate achieved  and our ability to manage costs 
the number of rooms at franchised properties and occupancy and room rates at those properties significantly affect the company s results because our fees are based upon room revenues at franchised hotels 
the key industry standard for measuring hotel operating performance is revenue per available room revpar  which is calculated by multiplying the percentage of occupied rooms by the average daily room rate realized 
our variable overhead costs associated with franchise system growth have historically been less than incremental royalty fees generated from new franchisees 
accordingly  continued growth of our franchise business should enable us to realize benefits from the operating leverage in place and improve operating results

critical accounting policies our accounting policies comply with principles generally accepted in the united states 
we have described below those policies that we believe are critical and require the use of complex judgment or significant estimates in their application 
additional discussion of these policies is included in note to our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we recognize continuing franchise fees  including royalty  marketing and reservations fees  when earned and receivable from our franchisees 
franchise fees are typically based on a percentage of gross room revenues of each franchisee 
our estimate of the allowance for uncollectible royalty fees is charged to selling  general and administrative expense 
initial franchise and relicensing fees are recognized  in most instances  in the period the related franchise agreement is executed because the initial franchise fee is non refundable and the company has no continuing obligations related to the franchisee 
we defer the initial franchise fee revenue related to franchise agreements which include incentives until the incentive criteria are met or the agreement is terminated  whichever occurs first 
we account for partner services revenues from endorsed vendors in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 sab revenue recognition 
sab provides guidance on the recognition  presentation and disclosure of revenue in financial statements 
pursuant to sab  the company recognizes partner services revenues when the services are performed or the product 
table of contents delivered  evidence of an arrangement exists  the fee is fixed and determinable and collectibility is probable 
we defer the recognition of partner services revenues related to certain upfront fees and recognize them over a period corresponding to the company s estimate of the life of the arrangement 
marketing and reservation revenues and expenses 
the company s franchise agreements require the payment of franchise fees  including marketing and reservation fees  which are used exclusively by the company for expenses associated with providing services such as national marketing  media advertising  central reservation systems and technology services 
the company is contractually obligated to expend the marketing and reservation fees it collects from franchisees to provide these types of services in accordance with the franchise agreements  as such  no income or loss to the company is generated 
in accordance with our contracts  we include in marketing and reservation expenses an allocation of costs for certain activities  such as human resources  legal  accounting  etc  required to carry out marketing and reservation activities 
the company records marketing and reservation revenues and expenses in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent  which requires that these revenues and expenses be recorded gross 
in addition  net advances to and repayments from the franchise system for marketing and reservation activities are presented as cash flows from operating activities 
reservation fees and marketing fees not expended in the current year are carried over to the next fiscal year and expended in accordance with the franchise agreements 
shortfall amounts are similarly recovered in subsequent years 
cumulative excess or shortfall amounts from the operation of these programs are recorded as a marketing or reservation fee payable or receivable 
under the terms of the franchise agreements  the company may advance capital as necessary for marketing and reservation activities and recover such advances through future fees 
our current assessment is that the credit risk associated with the marketing and reservation fee receivable is mitigated due to our contractual right to recover these amounts from a large geographically disperse group of franchisees 
impairment policy 
we evaluate the fair value of goodwill to assess potential impairments on an annual basis  or during the year if an event or other circumstance indicates that we may not be able to recover the carrying amount of the asset 
we evaluate impairment of goodwill by comparing the fair value of our net assets with the carrying amount of goodwill 
we evaluate the potential impairment of property and equipment and other long lived assets  including franchise rights whenever an event or other circumstance indicates that we may not be able to recover the carrying value of the asset 
our evaluation is based upon future cash flow projections 
these projections reflect management s best assumptions and estimates 
significant management judgment is involved in developing these projections  and they include inherent uncertainties 
if different projections had been used in the current period  the balances for noncurrent assets could have been materially impacted 
furthermore  if management uses different projections or if different conditions occur in future periods  future operating results could be materially impacted 
the company reviews outstanding notes receivable on a periodic basis to ensure that each is fully collectible by reviewing the financial condition of its debtors 
if the company concludes that it will be unable to collect all amounts due  the company will record an impairment charge 
stock compensation 
effective january   the company adopted  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  the fair value based method of accounting for stock option awards granted on or after january  no compensation expense related to the grant of stock options under the company s stock compensation plans was reflected in net income for any years ended on or before december  because the company accounted for grants in accordance with accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and all stock options granted in those years had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
the effect on net income and earnings per share as if the company had applied the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
to all stock compensation for the three years ended december  is set forth in note to our consolidated financial statements 
income taxes 
our income tax expense and related balance sheet amounts involve significant management estimates and judgments 
judgments regarding realization of deferred tax assets and the ultimate outcome of tax related contingencies represent key items involved in the determination of income tax expense and related balance sheet accounts 

table of contents deferred tax assets represent items to be used as a tax deduction or credit in future tax returns for which we have already properly recorded the tax benefit in our income statement 
realization of our deferred tax assets reflects our tax planning strategies 
we establish valuation allowances for deferred tax assets that we do not believe will be realized 
tax assessments and resolution of tax contingencies may arise several years after tax returns have been filed 
predicting the outcome of such tax assessments involves uncertainty  however  we believe that recorded tax liabilities adequately account for our analysis of probable outcomes 
forward looking statements certain statements in this report that are not historical facts constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act 
words such as believes  anticipates  expects  intends  estimates  projects  and other similar expressions  which are predictions of or indicate future events and trends  typically identify forward looking statements 
such statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected  including competition within each of our business segments  business strategies and their intended results  the balance between supply of and demand for hotel rooms  our ability to obtain new franchise agreements  our ability to develop and maintain positive relations with current and potential hotel owners  the effect of international  national and regional economic conditions and geopolitical events such as acts of god  acts of war  terrorism or epidemics  the availability of capital to allow potential hotel owners to fund investments in and construction of hotels  the cost and other effects of legal proceedings  and other risks described from time to time in our filings with the securities and exchange commission  including those set forth under the heading risk factors in our report on form k for the year ended december  given these uncertainties  you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such statements
