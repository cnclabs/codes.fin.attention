in evaluating the cumulative information in the following table  it should be noted that each year s amount includes the cumulative effects of all changes in amounts for prior periods 
this table does not present accident or policy year development data 
conditions and trends that have affected development of the liability in the past may not necessarily occur in the future 
accordingly  it is not appropriate to extrapolate future development based on the following table

the re estimation of reserves is made up of gross estimated liabilities and reinsurance recoverable changes that occurred 
because these components have not been tracked individually during the above referenced years  it is not feasible for us to accurately report them individually 
included in our loss reserves  are liabilities for unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses for environmental related claims such as oil spills  mold and lead paint 
we held reserves in the amount of million for lead paint related claims at december  and and million at december  we believe that these reserves are adequate 
our reserves for other environmental claims such as oil spills and mold were million and million  respectively  at december  reserves have been established to cover these claims for known losses 
because of our limited exposure to these types of claims  we believe they will not have a material impact on our financial position 
operating ratios loss and underwriting expense ratios 
loss and underwriting expense ratios are used to interpret the underwriting experience of property and casualty insurance companies 
losses and lae are stated as a percentage of premiums earned because losses may occur over the life of a policy 
underwriting expenses on a statutory basis are stated as a percentage of net premiums written rather than earned premiums because most underwriting expenses are incurred when policies are written and are not spread over the policy period 
underwriting profit margins are reflected by the extent to which the sum of the loss and underwriting expense ratios  which we refer to as the combined ratio  are less than 
the combined ratio is considered the best simple index of current underwriting performance of an insurer 
our loss and lae ratio  underwriting expense ratio and combined ratio  and the industry combined ratio  on a statutory basis  are shown in the following tab le 
our ratios include lines of insurance other than automobile  as do the industry combined ratios for all writers 
data for the property and casualty industry generally may not be directly comparable to our data 
this is because we conduct our business primarily in massachusetts  where approximately of our direct premiums were written for the year ended december   and  secondly  we primarily write personal automotive insurance

the focus of our investment objectives continues to be maximizing after tax investment income through investing in high quality diversified investments structured to maximize after tax investment income while minimizing risk

our funds are generally invested in securities with maturities intended to provide adequate funds to pay claims and meet other operating needs without the forced sale of investments 
during  we sold a significant portion of our securities with unrealized gains in order to implement a change in our investment view 
this change in view caused us to reduce the average duration of our investment portfolio during the second and third quarters and also included the sale of a number of securities which had increased in value significantly as overall credit spreads tightened 
during the third quarter as interest rates rose  we began to invest in longer term securities  ultimately resulting in year end duration being slightly higher  as compared to year end for additional information on our investment income and investment portfolio  please refer to management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note b to the audited consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
regulation general 
although the us federal government does not directly regulate the insurance industry  federal initiatives often have an impact on the industry 
congress and certain federal agencies continue to investigate the current condition of the insurance industry  encompassing both life and health and property and casualty insurance  in the united states in order to decide whether some form of federal role in the regulation of insurance companies would be appropriate 
congress conducts hearings relating  in general  to the solvency of insurers and has proposed federal legislation from time to time on this and other subjects 
the terrorism risk insurance act of was signed into law on november  the purpose of this act is to establish a temporary federal program that provides a system of shared public and private compensation for certain insured losses resulting from acts of terrorism 
the act defines a certified act of terrorism as an act that is certified by the secretary of the treasury as resulting in aggregate losses in excess of million  is a violent act or dangerous to human life  property or infrastructure  and is committed by an individual s acting on behalf of any foreign person or interest as part of an effort to coerce the civilian population of the united states or to influence the policy or affect the conduct of the united states government by coercion 
due to the types of coverage offered by us and the limited exposure we have outside of massachusetts  we believe that the financial impact upon us as a result of the act will be immaterial 
at the state level  various forms of automobile insurance reform are continuously debated 
new regulations and legislation are often proposed with the goal of reducing the need for premium increases 
for further details  see massachusetts personal automobile insurance in item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  in this form k 
our primary business is subject to extensive regulation 
in massachusetts  the commissioner is appointed by the governor of massachusetts and has broad authority 
the commissioner fixes maximum policy rates and establishes minimum agent commission levels on personal automobile insurance 
in addition  the commissioner grants and revokes licenses to write insurance  approves policy forms  sets reserve requirements  determines the form and content of statutory financial statements and establishes the type and character of portfolio investments 
the commissioner also approves company submissions regarding affinity group insurance programs and corresponding discounts along with safe driver deviations 
consequently  the policies and regulations set by the commissioner are an important element of writing insurance in massachusetts 
in states outside of massachusetts  premium rates generally must be filed with  and approved by the commissioner of insurance in that particular state 
in general  minimum commissions to agents are not set by the other state commissioners 
state insurance regulators are responsible for conducting periodic examinations of insurance companies 
massachusetts division of insurance regulations provide that insurance companies will be examined every five years or more frequently as deemed prudent by the commissioner 
california department of insurance regulations provide that insurance companies will be examined every three years 
ohio department of insurance regulations provide that insurance companies will be examined at least every five years 
both commerce and citation were last examined for the five year period ended december  commerce and citation have been notified that they will be examined in for the five year period ended december  commerce west was last examined in by the california department of insurance for the three year period ended december   and is currently being examined for the four years ended december  american commerce was examine d in by the ohio department of insurance for the five year period ended december  american commerce has been notified that it will be examined in for the five year period ended december the previously completed examinations produced no material findings 
automobile insurance regulation overview 
massachusetts has required compulsory automobile insurance coverage since states outside of massachusetts generally have varying levels of minimum compulsory insurance 
under current law  all massachusetts motorists are required to carry certain minimum coverages mandated by the state 
the commissioner fixes and establishes  among other things  the maximum rates insurers may charge for the compulsory personal automobile coverages 
with very limited exceptions  each insurer writing automobile insurance in massachusetts must accept all risks submitted to the insurer for the compulsory coverage  but is permitted to reinsure these risks including affinity group marketing insurance risks through car 
compulsory coverage 
compulsory coverage includes no fault coverage  limited bodily injury coverage  property damage coverage and coverage against uninsured or hit and run motorists 
the massachusetts no fault statute provides for personal injury protection coverage  which entitles a party to be reimbursed directly by the party s own insurer for certain medical expenses  lost wages and other defined expenses arising from an automobile accident  up to a specific amount  even if another party caused the accident 
rates and commissions 
massachusetts personal automobile insurance rates are fixed and established annually by the commissioner 
affinity group marketing insurance programs and safe driver rate deviations must be annually approved by the commissioner 
we set our voluntary massachusetts commercial automobile insurance rates competitively  subject to the commissioner s authority to disapprove such rates 
car files the rate for commercial automobile risks reinsured through car  subject to the authority of the commissioner to disapprove the rates  except for private passenger type non fleet business which is filed by insurance companies and approved by the commissioner 
for additional information  see commonwealth automobile reinsurers 
in fixing classifications of risks and establishing personal automobile rates  the commissioner must consider numerous factors  including driver and automobile characteristics and the claim rate in the state s designated geographical territories 
these factors are based upon data that are two or more years old 
premiums charged to a policyholder are adjusted based upon the safe driver rating of the operator 
moving violations and at fault accidents affect each driver s safe driver rating 
in addition  the extra risk rating regulations permit insurers to deny coverage or charge surcharged rates for physical damage coverage to both high risk vehicles and insureds with excessive prior loss or violation activity 
the commissioner sets an average minimum direct agency commission rate for personal automobile insurance 
with respect to risks reinsured through car  the maximum amount of commissions that car will reimburse  as part of their expense allowance structure  is fixed at that prescribed rate 
outside of massachusetts  rates and commissions are set competitively on a company by company and state by state basis 
mandatory underwriting 
massachusetts law specifies that all individuals holding a valid driver s license be entitled to purchase the mandatory automobile insurance coverages regardless of their driving experience or accident record 
the massachusetts legislature has also placed certain restraints on insurers discretion to refuse to renew automobile insurance policies 
policyholders are generally entitled to renew except in cases of fraud  material misrepresentation  revocation or suspension of an operator s license or nonpayment of premiums 
with very limited exceptions  insurers that participate in car in massachusetts must accept every automobile risk submitted to them 
under the massachusetts system of rate regulation  some personal automobile insurance risks are purposefully under priced by the commissioner  and therefore  absent state intervention  insurers would not ordinarily choose to write those risks 
the car reinsurance program described below is intended to mitigate the burden imposed by the massachusetts take all comers system  by allowing insurers to transfer the exposure for under priced risks to an industry pool  and by granting participation credits for certain under priced risks 
these credits are allowed by statute 
commonwealth automobile reinsurers 
car is a massachusetts state mandated reinsurance mechanism  under which all premiums  expenses and losses on ceded business are pooled and shared by all insurers 
it is similar to a joint underwriting association because a number of insurers participate in the program 
as of december   insurers participated for the personal and commercial automobile lines  including commerce 
in general  agencies licensed to issue automobile insurance policies are entitled to be assigned to at least one servicing carrier 
there are two categories of agencies those that have voluntary agreements with one or more servicing carriers  and those that do not 
the latter are assigned by car  generally to a single servicing carrier and are known as erps 
there can be erps for private passenger automobile or commercial automobile or both 
an insurer may terminate its participation in car  for example  by surrendering its license to write automobile policies in massachusetts 
termination does not discharge or otherwise affect liability of an insurer incurred prior to termination 
a withdrawing insurer is assessed a share of car s projected deficits for future years based on the insurer s prior years participation in car 
the assessment paid by the withdrawing insurer is redistributed to the remaining insurers based on their participation ratios 
an insurer can transfer its obligations for its personal insurance policies to another insurer who formally agrees to assume these obligations 
the transferring insurer is thereby relieved of future car obligations which otherwise would have arisen as a consequence of the business transferred 
insurance holding company structure 
as an insurance holding company  we are subject to regulation under the insurance holding company statutes of the states in which any of our subsidiary insurance companies is incorporated 
because our subsidiaries are members of an insurance holding company system  they are required to register with their respective divisions of insurance and to submit reports describing the capital structure  general financial condition  ownership and management of each insurer and any person or entity controlling the insurer  the identity of every member of the insurance holding company system  and  the material outstanding transactions between the insurer and its affiliates 
california and ohio have insurance holding company laws similar to those in massachusetts 
each member of the insurance holding company system must keep current the information required to be disclosed by reporting all material changes or additions within days of the end of the month in which it learns of such change or addition 
massachusetts law prohibits a party that is not a domestic insurer from acquiring control of a domestic insurer or of a company controlling a domestic insurer without prior approval of the commissioner 
control is presumed to exist if a party directly or indirectly holds  owns or controls ten percent or more of the voting stock of another party  but may be rebutted by showing that control does not exist 
california and ohio have laws similar to those in massachusetts 
in the event of the insolvency  liquidation or other reorganization of any of our insurance subsidiaries  our creditors and stockholders will have no right to proceed against the assets of those subsidiaries  or to cause the liquidation or bankruptcy of any company under federal or state bankruptcy laws 
state laws govern such liquidation or rehabilitation proceedings and the division of insurance would act as receiver for the particular company 
creditors and policyholders of the insurance subsidiaries would be entitled to payment in full from such assets before a stockholder  such as commerce holdings in our case  would be entitled to receive any distribution therefrom 
payment of dividends 
under massachusetts law  an insurer may pay cash dividends only from earnings and statutory surplus  and the insurer s remaining surplus must be both reasonable in relation to its outstanding liabilities and adequate to its financial needs 
california and ohio have similar laws 
following the declaration and payment of such dividends  the insurer must file a report with the commissioner 
a massachusetts insurance company may not pay an extraordinary dividend or distribution unless the insurer gives the commissioner at least days prior notice of the declaration and the commissioner does not disapprove of the plan of payment prior to the date of such payment 
an extraordinary dividend or distribution is one whose fair market value  together with that of other dividends or distributions within the preceding twelve month period  excluding pro rata distributions of any class of the insurer s own securities  exceeds the greater of ten percent of the insurer s surplus as regards to policyholders as of the preceding year end or the net income of such insurer for the preceding year 
california and ohio have similar laws regulating the payment of dividends by insurance companies to those in massachusetts 
the aggregate amount of dividends calculated in accordance with regulations in massachusetts  california and ohio that could have been paid in from all of our insurance subsidiaries without prior regulatory approval was approximately million  of which million was declared and paid as of december  protection against insurer insolvency 
all insurance companies are required to participate in insurance insolvency fund programs in the states in which they write

national association of insurance commissions guidelines 
the naic insurance regulatory information system  or iris  was developed by a committee of state insurance regulators and is intended primarily to assist state insurance regulators in executing their statutory mandates to oversee the financial condition of insurance companies operating in their respective states 
iris identifies eleven industry ratios and specifies usual values for each ratio 
departure from the usual values on four or more of the ratios can lead to inquiries from individual state insurance commissioners as to certain aspects of an insurer s business 
for the year ended december   our consolidated property and casualty operations had no ratios outside the usual values 
in order to enhance the regulation of insurer insolvency  the naic developed a formula and model law to provide for risk based capital  or rbc  requirements for property and casualty insurance companies 
the model law has since been adopted in all states 
rbc requirements are designed to assess capital adequacy and to raise the level of protection that statutory surplus provides for policyholder obligations 
the rbc model for property and casualty insurance companies measures three major areas of risk facing property and casualty insurers underwriting  which encompasses the risk of adverse loss development and inadequate pricing  declines in asset values arising from credit risk  and  other business risks from investments 
insurers having less statutory surplus than required by the rbc calculation will be subject to varying degrees of regulatory action  depending on the level of capital inadequacy 
the rbc model formula proposes four levels of regulatory action 
the extent of regulatory intervention and action increases as the percentage of surplus to rbc falls 
the first level  defined by the naic as the company action level  requires an insurer to submit a plan of corrective actions to the regulator if surplus falls below of the rbc amount 
the second level  defined by the naic as the regulatory action level  requires an insurer to submit a plan containing corrective actions and permits the commissioner to perform an examination or other analysis and issue a corrective order if surplus falls below of the rbc amount 
the third level  the authorized control level  allows the regulator to rehabilitate or liquidate an insurer in addition to the aforementioned ac tions if surplus falls below of the rbc amount 
the fourth and final action level  the mandatory control level  requires the regulator to rehabilitate or liquidate the insurer if surplus falls below of the rbc amount 
as indicated in the following table  the rbc level of each of our insurance subsidiaries at december  significantly exceeds the rbc level requirements 
american commerce commerce citation commerce west statutory surplus rbc company action level statutory surplus in excess of rbc company action level rbc amounts percent of surplus to rbc amounts competition the property and casualty insurance industry is highly cyclical  characterized by periods of increasing premium rates and limited underwriting capacity  followed by periods of intensive price competition and abundant underwriting capacity 
this industry also is highly competitive  with a large number of companies  many of which operate in more than one state  offering automobile  homeowners  commercial property and other lines of insurance 
some of our competitors have larger volumes of business and greater financial resources and some sell insurance directly to policyholders rather than through independent agents 
massachusetts 
because our insurance products are marketed exclusively through independent agencies  most of whom represent more than one company  we face competition within each agency 
we compete for business within independent agencies by offering a more attractively priced product to the consumer and by paying agents significant compensation in the form of commissions and profit sharing  which are based in part on the underwriting profits or losses of the agency business written with us 
we also seek to provide a consistent market  prompt servicing of policyholder claims and effective agency support services 
we believe  based upon regular surveys of our agencies  our relationships with our independent agencies are excellent 
any disruption in these relationships could adversely affect our business 
we also believe that our relationship with the four aaa clubs that sponsor the aaa affinity group marketing program is excellent 
we have agreed that we shall be the aaa clubs exclusive underwriter of massachusetts personal automobile group programs  and we have a rolling three year contract with the aaa clubs 
this contract automatically renews annually and may be terminated upon a minimum of two years written notice to us 
we believe that the massachusetts regulatory environment  which fixes maximum personal automobile insurance rates  assigns erps to servicing carriers  apportions losses incurred by car and establishes minimum agency commissions  has discouraged certain companies with more traditional underwriting and pricing approaches from establishing a presence or expanding their market share in massachusetts 
any material change in this situation could adversely affect our business 
for additional information  see massachusetts personal automobile insurance in item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  in this form k 
other states 
we compete with various regional and domestic insurers  national agency companies and direct writers 
some of these competitors have financial resources greater than ours 
any of these competitors could undertake actions that could adversely affect our profitability  such as pricing automobile insurance premiums more aggressively or offering greater compensation to independent agencies 
commerce west s principal competitors in california are mercury general  with a market share of and progressive  with a market share of 
american commerce s principal competitors for automobile insurance in its largest state  arizona  are state farm  with a market share of and allstate  with a market share of 
both american commerce and commerce west file and seek approval for premium rates with the respective divisions of insurance in the states they do business 
american commerce competes for business by utilizing aaa owned and operated independent agencies that offer competitively priced products and provide quality service 
the aaa owned independent agencies are offered compensation in the form of commission and profit sharing  based primarily on loss ratios  as well as stock options and bonuses based on the year over year increase in the volume of agency business written with american commerce 
commerce west competes for business by using independent insurance agencies and brokers that offer competitively priced products and provide quality service 
we offer compensation to agents and brokers in the form of commissions and profit sharing  which are based in part on the underwriting profits and losses of the agency business written with us 
we offer competiti vely priced products and commissions to agents in new hampshire 
profit sharing  based on loss experience  is also offered as an inducement for exceptional business

risks related to our business our success is primarily dependent upon how well we manage our business 
however  our success could be significantly affected by factors over which we have limited or no control 
for example we are primarily a personal automobile insurance carrier  and therefore our business may be adversely affected by conditions in this industry 
we write a substantial portion of our business in massachusetts  and therefore our business may be adversely affected by conditions and adverse legislative  judicial or regulatory decisions in massachusetts 
our financial performance may be adversely affected by severe weather conditions or other catastrophic losses 
if we are not able to attract and retain independent agents  it could adversely affect our business 
if our affinity relationship with the aaa clubs of massachusetts were to be terminated  we would lose a significant avenue for offering affinity discounts  and our sales of personal automobile insurance products would likely decline  which would adversely affect our business and results of operations 
if american commerce s relationship with one or more large aaa clubs terminates  then american commerce would lose a substantial portion of its business  which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
established competitors with greater resources may make it difficult for us to market our products effectively and offer our products at a profit 
we are subject to comprehensive regulation by massachusetts as well as the other states in which we operate  and our ability to earn profits may be restricted by changes to these regulations 
new claim  coverage and regulatory issues in the insurance industry may adversely affect us 
regulatory changes to enhance competition or reform car in massachusetts are being considered and  if enacted  could adversely affect our market share and profitability 
market fluctuations and changes in interest rates have had  and may continue to have  significant and negative effects on our investment portfolio 
we may not be able to alleviate risk through reinsurance arrangements successfully  which could cause us to reduce our premiums written in certain lines or could result in losses 
we rely on our information technology and telecommunication systems  and the failure of these systems could adversely affect our business 
item properties we conduct our massachusetts operations from approximately  square feet of space in several buildings that we own in webster  massachusetts  which is located approximately miles southwest of boston 
our principal administrative offices in webster are recently rehabilitated and newly constructed buildings 
our data processing and operational departments are housed in modern office buildings on a separate acre site

item legal proceedings as is common with property and casualty insurance companies  we are a defendant in various legal actions arising from the normal course of our business  including claims based on massachusetts chapter d and chapter a 
see settlement of claims 
similar provisions exist in other states where we do business 
we consider these proceedings to be ordinary to operations or without foundation in fact 
we believe that these actions will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position 
we previously disclosed that a purported class action lawsuit was pending in massachusetts state court against commerce 
the lawsuit  titled elena given  individually and as a representative of all persons similarly situated v 
the commerce insurance company  alleged damages as a result of the alleged inherent diminished value to vehicles that are involved in accidents 
in april  the trial judge in that case entered partial summary judgment for the plaintiff on the issue of whether the massachusetts automobile policy covers her claim  ruling that the plaintiff would be entitled to reimbursement under the policy if the plaintiff were able both to prove that her vehicle suffered inherent diminished value in the accident and to quantify the amount of such diminution in value 
during the third quarter of  commerce applied for direct appellate review of this issue by the supreme judicial court of massachusetts sjc  and this application was gran ted 
on october   the sjc ruled in favor of commerce  overturning the trial court s decision that the massachusetts automobile policy provides coverage for inherent diminished value 
the plaintiff has dismissed the case 
commerce had not previously established a reserve for any contingent liability related to the given litigation  therefore  there was no financial impact as a result of the conclusion of this litigation

we provide personal and commercial property and casualty insurance in massachusetts and  to a lesser extent  in other states 
casualty insurance is primarily concerned with the losses of the insured due to injuries to other persons and to the property of others  and the legal liability imposed on the insured as a consequence of such losses 
our core product lines are personal automobile  homeowners  and commercial automobile insurance 
we market our products exclusively through our network of independent agents  including agents in massachusetts  agents in new hampshire   agents in california and oregon  and agents in other states  as of december  our primary business strategy is to continue to focus on the personal automobile insurance market in massachusetts and to grow by increasing the proportion of our business in other states in which we currently have a significant presence  primarily as a result of our acquisitions of comm erce west and american commerce in and  respectively 
our ability to capitalize on our business strengths and implement our strategies entails particular risks 
for example  because we are primarily a personal automobile insurance carrier  adverse developments in this industry could adversely affect us to a greater extent as compared to insurers that are more diversified across multiple business lines 
additionally  the concentration of our business in massachusetts makes us more susceptible to any adverse development in the prevailing legislative  regulatory  economic  demographic  competitive and other conditions  including weather related events  and adverse judicial decisions in massachusetts  and could make it more costly or difficult for us to conduct our business 
regulatory changes to reform the residual market and to enhance competition in massachusetts are being considered and  if enacted  could adversely affect our market share and profitability 
also  if our affinity relationship with the aaa clubs of massachusetts were to be terminated  we would lose a significant avenue for offering our existing affinity group discounts and our sales of personal automobile insurance products in massachusetts would likely decline  if we are unable to devise and implement effective mitigation measures 
as the aaa arrangements have rolling three year terms  an aaa club may terminate upon a minimum of two years written notice 
if american commerce s relationship with one or more large aaa clubs terminates  then american commerce would lose a substantial portion of its business  which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
a significant decline in our sales of personal automobile insurance products in massachusetts would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
our revenue principally reflects earned premiums  consisting of premiums that we receive from sales by our agents of property and casualty insurance policies  primarily personal automobile  homeowners and commercial automobile  which we refer to as direct premiums written  plus premiums we receive from insurance policies that we assume  primarily from commonwealth automobile reinsurers  or car  which we refer to as assumed premiums  less the portion of our premiums that is ceded to car and other reinsurers  which we refer to as ceded premiums  less the change in the portion of premiums that will not be recognized as income for accounting purposes until a future period  which we refer to as unearned premiums  investment income that we earn on our invested assets  premium finance charges and service fee income that we earn in connection with the billing and deferral of premium payments  and realized investment gains losses 
our expenses principally reflect incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses which we sometimes refer to as lae  including estimates for losses incurred during the period but not yet reported to us and changes in estimates from prior periods related to direct and assumed business  less the portion of those incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses that are ceded to other insurers  and policy acquisition costs  including agent compensation and general and administrative costs  such as salaries and benefits  and advertising that are not deferred for accounting purposes to a future period 
measurement of results we evaluate our operations by monitoring key measures of growth and profitability 
we measure our growth by examining our direct premiums written as well as increases in exposures and policies 
we generally measure our operating results by examining our net income  return on equity  and our loss and lae  underwriting expense and combined ratios 
the following provides further explanation of the key measures that we use to evaluate our results direct premiums written 
direct premiums written is the sum of the total policy premiums  net of cancellations  associated with policies underwritten and issued by our insurance subsidiaries 
we use direct premiums written  which includes premiums that we cede to car and other reinsurers  as a measure of the underlying growth of our insurance business from period to period 
net premiums written 
net premiums written is the sum of direct premiums written for a given period  less premiums ceded to car and other reinsurers during such period  plus premiums assumed during such period 
earned premiums 
earned premiums constitute the portion of net premiums written that is equal to the expired portion of policies and recognized as income for accounting purposes during a given period 
investment income 
investment income relates to earnings on our investment portfolio 
we rely on after tax investment income as a significant source of net earnings since we generally seek to produce a combined ratio see below of slightly less than 
loss and lae ratio 
the loss and lae ratio is the ratio of losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred to premiums earned  expressed as a percentage  and measures the underwriting profitability of a company s insurance business 
this ratio is measured net of our reinsurance recoveries 
we use this ratio as a measure of the overall underwriting profitability of the insurance business we write and to assess the adequacy of our pricing 
for our insurance subsidiaries  this ratio is generally calculated using statutory accounting principles which for this purpose are essentially the same as accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
occasionally we will use the term pure loss ratio which refers to the ratio expressed as a percentage of incurred losses  excluding lae  to earned premiums 
underwriting expense ratio 
the underwriting expense ratio is the ratio of underwriting expenses to net premiums written  expressed as a percentage  determined in accordance with statutory accounting principles 
underwriting expenses are the aggregate of policy acquisition costs  including commissions  and the portion of administrative  general and other expenses attributable to underwriting operations 
combined ratio 
the combined ratio is the sum of the loss and lae ratio and the underwriting expense ratio and measures a company s overall underwriting profit 
if the combined ratio is at or above  an insurance company cannot be profitable without investment income  and may not be profitable if investment income is insufficient 
we use the statutory combined ratio in evaluating our overall underwriting profitability and as a measure for comparison of our profitability relative to the profitability of our competitors 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we consider the following accounting policies  which are especially dependent upon our judgments and estimates  to be critical to the preparation of our financial statements 
unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses 
unpaid losses and lae  by their nature  are inherently uncertain as to the ultimate outcome of the estimated amounts 
the liability for loss and loss adjustment expenses represents our best estimate of the ultimate net cost of all loss and loss adjustment expenses incurred after reinsurance and amounts estimated to be recoverable through salvage and subrogation 
the estimate for ultimate net cost of all losses incurred through the balance sheet date includes the adjusted case estimates for losses  incurred but not reported ibnr losses  salvage and subrogation recoverable and a reserve for lae 
in arriving at our best estimate  we begin with the aggregate of individual case reserves and then make adjustments to these amounts on a line of business basis 
these adjustments to the aggregate case reserves by line of business are made based on analyses performed by us as further described below 
the entire li ability for unpaid losses and lae is also separately reviewed quarterly and annually by our actuarial department 
liability estimates are continually analyzed and updated  and therefore  the ultimate liability may be more or less than the current estimate 
the effects of changes in the estimates are included in the results of operations in the period in which the estimates are revised 
the claim cycle begins when a claim is reported to us and claims personnel establish a case reserve for the estimated amount of our exposure without regard to injury causality  third party liability or potential recoveries 
the amount of the reserve is primarily based upon an evaluation of the type of claim involved  the circumstances surrounding the claim and the policy provisions relating to the loss 
this estimate reflects the informed judgment of such personnel based on the experience and knowledge of the claims personnel adjusting the claim 
during the loss adjustment period  these case basis estimates are revised as deemed necessary by our claims department personnel based on subsequent developments and periodic reviews of the claim 
in accordance with industry practice  we also maintain reserves for estimated ibnr  salvage and subrogation recoverable and lae 
these reserves are determined based on historical information and our experience 
adjustments to these reserves are made periodically to take into account changes in the volume of policies written  claims frequency  severity and payment patterns  the mix of business  claims processing and other items that can be expected to affect our liability for losses and lae over time 
when reviewing the liability for unpaid losses and lae  we analyze historical data and estimate the impact of various factors such as payment trends  loss expense per exposure  our historical loss experience and that of the industry  frequency and severity trends  and  legislative enactments  judicial decisions  legal developments in the imposition of damages  and changes and trends in general economic conditions  including the effects of inflation and recession 
this process assumes that past experience  adjusted for the effects of current developments and anticipated trends  is an appropriate basis for predicting future events 
there is no precise method  however  for subsequently evaluating the impact of any specific factor on the adequacy of reserves  because the eventual development of reserves is affected by many factors  as noted above 
by using individual estimates of reported claims adjusted for our best estimate by line of business and a review of these results by our actuarial area using generally accepted actuarial reserving techniques  we arrive at our final estimate of our net liability for losses and lae 
after taking into account all relevant factors  we believe that  based on existing information  the provision for losses and lae at december  is adequate to cover the ultimate net cost of losses and claims incurred as of that date 
the ultimate liability  however  may be greater or lower than established reserves 
if the ultimate payment is greater than or less than our estimated liability for losses and lae  we will incur additional expense or income  as appropriate  which may have a material impact on our results of operations 
we calculate our estimate independently from those amounts calculated by our actuaries  and therefore  the final results are most often not the same 
we estimate our amounts primarily by reviewing historical loss and lae data  focusing mainly on payment data 
we also review and compare the most recent loss frequency  severity  and payment data to historical trends in an attempt to determine if patterns are remaining consistent or not 
we attempt to establish our reserve estimate as close as possible to the amount required for the ultimate future payments necessary to settle all losses 
our aggregate actuarial estimate for the loss and lae reserves  on a consolidated basis and net of reinsurance recoverable  ranges from a low of million to a high of million  as of december  our financial statement loss and lae reserves net of reinsurance  based on our best estimate  was established at million for that date 
investments 
a focus of our judgments and estimates relating to investments involves the potential impairment of investments for other than temporary declines in market values 
the carrying value of investments in fixed maturities  which include taxable and non taxable bonds  and investments in common and preferred stocks  are derived from market prices supplied by our investment custodian  or in the few cases where no price is provided by the custodian  we obtain a third party valuation 
fair market value of fixed maturities and equity securities is based on quoted market prices 
for other investments  fair value equals quoted market price  if available 
unrealized investment gains and losses on common and preferred stocks and fixed maturities  to the extent that there is no other than temporary impairment of value  are credited or charged  net of any tax effect  to a separate component of stockholders equity  known as net accumulated other compre hensive income loss  until realized 
we review all security holdings on a quarterly basis for potential other than temporary declines in market value in accordance with gaap 
as part of this process  we consider any significant market declines in the context of the overall market and also in relation to the outlook for the specific issuer of the security 
each quarter  we review all securities whose market values have declined below book price 
from a quantitative standpoint  we view all securities that have declined more than below book price and have remained so for two quarters as potentially in need of a write down 
in addition  any other security that we view as impaired for a significant period of time is also a candidate for a write down  even if the percentage decline is less than 
in order to review these holdings  we look at any security that has been in a continuous unrealized loss position regardless of the amount of the loss for any period exceeding six months 
in this w ay  we are not only looking at the amount of the unrealized loss  but also at the amount of time the loss has existed 
there is a risk that we may assess an other than temporary decline in market value as being temporary and  consequently  not charge the impairment to our earnings  which could have a significant impact on our future earnings and financial position 
in conjunction with reviewing the amount a security has declined  we also assess the aging of all unrealized losses on a particular security on a quarterly basis 
that is  we look at how long a security has been at an unrealized loss position by classifying it within the following categories under months  to months  to months  to months and greater than months 
our net earnings in recent years have been significantly affected by our ownership interests in several closed end preferred stock mutual funds that we were required to account for using the equity method of accounting 
for our investment in any fund in which we own or more of the fund s shares  the equity method of accounting requires us to categorize as a realized investment gain or loss the change in the net asset value of that fund as compared to the end of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter 
our investment in these funds has had a material effect on our realized gains and losses in recent years and may have caused our net earnings to be more volatile than those of similar companies 
during  we decreased our ownership below in all but one closed end preferred stock mutual fund 
massachusetts personal automobile insurance overview 
we remain focused on personal automobile insurance and related activities in massachusetts 
we have been the largest writer of personal property and casualty insurance in massachusetts in terms of market share of direct premiums written since our estimated share of the massachusetts personal automobile market increased to during the eleven months ended november   as shown in the table below  significantly exceeding our two nearest competitors  safety insurance group  inc and arbella insurance group  who maintained an estimated and market share  respectively 
growth of massachusetts personal automobile insured vehicles commerce industry commerce market share year ended december  year ended december  year ended december  estimated by car  market share estimate is as of november  in massachusetts  private passenger automobile insurance is subject to extensive regulation 
owners of automobiles are generally required to demonstrate certain minimum automobile insurance coverages as a prerequisite to registering any automobile 
with very limited exceptions  private passenger automobile insurers are required by law to issue a policy to any applicant seeking to obtain such coverages  commonly known as the take all comers law 
based on their market shares  insurers in massachusetts are also assigned agents  known as erps  which have been unable to obtain a voluntary contract with an insurance carrier 
marketing and underwriting strategies for companies operating in massachusetts are limited by maximum premium rates and minimum agency commission levels for personal automobile insurance  both of which are mandated by the commissioner 
in massachusetts  accident rates  bodily injury claims  and medical care costs continue to be among the hi ghest in the nation 
according to the automobile insurers bureau of massachusetts  or aib  massachusetts has higher than average medical costs and liability claims involving attorneys 
according to the naic state average expenditure report  massachusetts personal automobile premium per exposure  based on premium information  was the fourth highest in the nation 
changes in premium rates 
during the three year period from to  average mandated massachusetts personal automobile insurance premium rates decreased an average of per year  primarily due to an decrease in coinciding with the rate decision  the commissioner also approved a increase in the commission agents receive for selling private passenger automobile insurance for the following table shows the state mandated average rate change  the actual average revenue change per exposure and our average revenue change per exposure as estimated for and for the three previous years in massachusetts 
actual state average commerce average state mandated average revenue change revenue change per year rate change per exposure exposure estimated for actual state and commerce average revenue change per exposure 
based on massachusetts division of insurance filings 
although mandated average personal automobile premium rates increased in  our average revenue per exposure increased 
we believe that the relative increase for as compared to the commissioner s state mandated average rate resulted primarily from several factors the fact that our mix of personal automobile coverage differs from that of the industry  and  changes to our distribution of risks by class  territory and coverage  including changes resulting from the purchase of new  more expensive automobiles  which were not factored into the commissioner s rate increase 
the actual state average revenue change per exposure represents the change in the average premium paid by drivers in massachusetts  as opposed to the state mandated average rate change 
as can be seen above  our average revenue change per exposure corresponds more closely to the actual state average revenue change 
the reason for this is that both take into account newer vehicles  as compared to the state mandated average rate change  which does not 
on january   the massachusetts attorney general the ag filed an appeal with the supreme judicial court of massachusetts arguing that the massachusetts division of insurance the doi wrongly imposed a increase in average personal automobile premiums for according to the ag  for the second consecutive year  the doi has  without justification  ruled in favor of an increase in auto insurance rates that will hurt massachusetts drivers 
we cannot predict whether the ag s appeal will be successful  and if so  whether it will have a material impact on us 
car 
our performance in our personal and commercial automobile insurance lines in massachusetts is integrally tied to our participation in car  the state mandated reinsurance mechanism 
car permits us and most other writers of automobile insurance in massachusetts to reinsure any automobile risk that the insurer perceives to be under priced at the premium level permitted by the commissioner 
all companies writing automobile insurance in massachusetts share in the underwriting results of car business for their respective product line or lines 
since car s inception  it has annually generated hundreds of millions of dollars of underwriting losses  primarily in the personal pool 
we are required to share in car s underwriting results 
under current regulations  our share of the car personal or commercial deficit is based upon our market share for automobile risks for the particular pool  adjusted by a utilization concept  such that  in general  we are disproportionately and adversely affected if our relative use of car reinsurance exceeds that of the industry  and favorably affected if our relative use of car reinsurance is less than that of the industry 
for personal automobile insurance  insurers can reduce their participation ratio by voluntarily writing credit eligible business 
companies are provided credits against their participation ratio for writing those policies that are intentionally underpriced by the commissioner in the rate setting process 
our strategy has been to maintain above average voluntary retention levels  as well as to voluntarily retain private passenger automobile risks that receive credits 
this favorably affects our participation ratio compared to our market share  but also adversely impacts our voluntary loss ratio 
we reinsured through car approximately  and of our personal automobile exposures for the years ended  and  respectively  as compared to industry averages of  and for the same periods  respectively 
see our business commonwealth automobile reinsurers 
affinity group marketing 
since  we have been a leader in affinity group marketing in massachusetts  through agreements with the four american automobile association clubs operating in massachusetts  offering discounts on private passenger automobile insurance to the clubs members who reside in massachusetts 
a discount was approved by the commissioner for policies effective january  based on information provided to us by the aaa clubs operating in massachusetts  we believe that membership in these clubs represents approximately one third of the massachusetts motoring public  and has been the primary reason for a increase in the number of personal automobile exposures written by us since year end the following table presents total direct premiums written attributable to the aaa clubs group business in massachusetts for the years ended  and for the year ended  total aaa massachusetts direct premiums written percentage of total direct premiums written percentage of massachusetts direct personal automobile premiums total aaa massachusetts exposures percentage of massachusetts exposures the decreasing percentages since is attributed to a higher rate of increase in non group business as compared to increases in the aaa program 
of the total massachusetts automobile exposures written through the aaa affinity group program by us  approximately were written through insurance agencies owned by the aaa clubs of our total massachusetts automobile exposures 
the remaining of the aaa group program were written through our network of independent agents of our total massachusetts automobile exposures 
other states direct premiums written in states other than massachusetts by american commerce and commerce west increased million  or  to million at december  from million at december  american commerce s direct premiums written increased million  or  primarily due to an increase in personal automobile premiums of million  or 
american commerce also experienced a increase in homeowners premiums written 
the increase in personal automobile and homeowners was primarily due to additional rate per policy coupled with a increase in business written  offset slightly by a decreased retention in personal automobile in force policies 
commerce west direct premiums written increased million  or 
the growth for commerce west is primarily attributable to expansion of commercial and preferred personal automobile programs 
personal automobile direct premiums written by commerce west increased million  or primarily from an increase in rates  while commercial automobile direct premiums written increased million  or  primarily due to a increase in the number of policies 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  overview our net earnings for the year ended  as compared to  were favorably affected primarily by significant increases in our realized investment gains 
we do not expect similar significant increases in our realized investment gains for  nor do we expect our realized gains in to be similar to those in our after tax net realized investment gains for the year ended increased by million compared to the increase was due to after tax net investment gains for of million compared to after tax net investment losses of million for the after tax net investment gains resulted primarily from our decision to sell a significant portion of our securities with unrealized gains in order to implement a change in our investment view  and  the favorable impact on the net asset value of closed end preferred stock mutual funds due to market conditions as well as significant sales of these funds during the year 
the after tax net investment losses were primarily caused by the decrease in net asset value  or nav  of our equity investment in closed end preferred stock mutual funds  the write down of securities for other than temporary impairment of value  and the impact of the valuation allowance on deferred taxes 
see investment gains and losses 
partially offsetting the change in after tax net investment gains losses was the effect of two one time items which increased income 
in  we had million of other income and million for the after tax cumulative effect of a change in accounting for negative goodwill 
the million of prior year other income was related to payments received from other insurance carriers under agreements to assume their massachusetts personal automobile insurance business written in massachusetts 
our losses and loss adjustment expenses increased by million  or  for the year ended compared to the increase resulted primarily from our premium growth partially offset by a decrease in our loss ratio on a statutory basis to from in the decrease was primarily driven by slightly more favorable experience in the current year personal automobile line of business due to increases in average earned premium revenue per automobile and more favorable loss reserve development compared to our policy acquisition costs increased by million  or for the year ended compared to the increase resulted primarily from our premium growth  partially offset by a decrease in our underwriting ratio on a statutory basis to for the year ended compared to for the decrease in our underwriting ratio was primarily due to lower policy year mandated massachusetts personal automobile commission rates 
see policy acquisition costs 
certain corporate expenses included in our loss adjustment expenses and policy acquisition costs do not impact the statutory loss and lae ratio or the statutory underwriting ratio because they are not expenses borne by our insurance subsidiaries 
these expenses are primarily related to stock options granted to agents of american commerce and book value awards granted to our officers 
during  corporate expenses related to the american commerce agents options increased to million  as compared to million in this increase was due to an increase in the market value of our common stock  an increase in the number of stock options outstanding  an additional year of vesting of those stock options granted in prior years and changes in estimates made to certain assumptions used in our fair value estimation 
the corporate expenses related to the book value awards amounted to million in  as compared to million in the value of b ook value awards is primarily related to the growth in our stockholders equity 
at december   our stockholders equity per share was  as compared to at december  premiums the following table and discussion compares direct premiums written  net premiums written and earned premiums for the years ended and change change direct premiums written personal automobile in massachusetts personal automobile in other states commercial automobile in massachusetts commercial automobile in other states homeowners in massachusetts homeowners in other states other lines in massachusetts other lines in all other states total direct premiums written net premiums written personal automobile in massachusetts personal automobile in other states commercial automobile in massachusetts commercial automobile in other states homeowners in massachusetts homeowners in other states other lines in massachusetts other lines in all other states assumed premiums from car assumed premiums from other than car total net premiums written earned premiums personal automobile in massachusetts personal automobile in other states commercial automobile in massachusetts commercial automobile in other states homeowners in massachusetts homeowners in other states other lines in massachusetts other lines in all other states assumed premiums from car assumed premiums from other than car total earned premiums earned premiums in massachusetts earned premiums assumed earned premiums in all other states total earned premiums the increase in massachusetts personal automobile direct premiums written during resulted primarily from a increase in average written premium per written exposure coupled with a increase in the number of exposures written 
we attribute the growth in exposures to increased penetration of our independent agents books of business as the overall number of exposures in massachusetts has had less than growth during the period 
the increase in other than massachusetts personal automobile and homeowners business was primarily due to additional rate per policy coupled with an approximate increase in business written  offset slightly by a decreased retention in personal automobile in force policies 
our increase in massachusetts commercial automobile premiums is directly related to our effort to increase writings in this line of business and from increases in the average rate per policy 
our increase in massachusetts homeowner premiums is primarily related to an increase in average premium per policy  increases in policy count due to an increased number of agents  fewer carriers writing homeowner business  our pricing position in the marketplace  and  agents writing more homeowner business to achieve a homeowner discount for their customer when we also insure the customer s automobile 
the increase in total earned premiums for was primarily attributable to increases in personal and commercial automobile business 
net investment income net investment income is affected by the composition of our investment portfolio and yields on those investments 
as depicted in the following table  net investment income for the year ended decreased million  or  compared to  principally as a result of a decrease in average yields partially offset by an increase in average invested assets at cost 
the decrease in yield is primarily due to lower short term yields coupled with an environment of lower average long term yields and higher yielding investment securities being called 
the decline in average long term yields is illustrated by a decrease in the yield on year government bonds which declined basis points from an average of at december  to an average of at december  years ended investment return average month end investments at cost net investment income before tax net investment income after tax net investment income as a percentage of average net investments at cost net investment income after tax as a percentage of average net investments at cost premium finance and service fees premium finance and service fees increased million  or  during the year ended  as a result of increased business and a service fee increase on massachusetts new and renewal business from to per installment payment  for policies with effective dates on or after july investment gains and losses net realized investment gains totaled million  or per diluted share  for the year ended as compared to net realized investment losses of million  or per diluted share  for during  we sold a significant portion of our securities with unrealized gains in order to implement a change in our investment view 
our investment strategy emphasizes investment yield while maintaining investment quality 
the focus of our investment objectives continues to be maximizing after tax investment income through investing in high quality diversified investments structured to maximize after tax investment income while minimizing risk 
a secondary objective is to achieve above average after tax total return 
our funds are generally invested in securities with maturities intended to provide adequate funds to pay claims and meet other operating needs without the forced sale of investments 
this change in view caused us to reduce the average duration of our investment portfolio during the second and third quarters  which in turn resulted in the sale of a number of securities that had increased in value significantly as overall credit spreads tigh tened 
this caused overall portfolio turnover eg volume of trades to increase beyond that of recent years 
the portfolio sales occurred in securities that had been purchased during as well as those purchased in previous years 
thus  while we did sell some higher yielding instruments  the overall after tax yield of the portfolio did not fall significantly beyond the decline in interest rates as a whole 
during the third quarter as interest rates rose  we began to invest in longer term securities  resulting in a slightly higher duration at year end 
primarily as a result of these sales  we realized net investment gains of million in those categories for the year ended  compared to a net realized investment loss of million on sales of securities in those categories during of the remaining million total of net realized gains  we recognized net gains of million for the year ended attributable to the change in the net asset value of seven closed end preferred stock mutual funds in which we owned or more through the period our ownership remained greater than 
during the third and fourth quarters of  we dropped below the ownership level and did not have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies for six funds 
therefore  as of december   the investments were reported at fair market value and the unrealized gains or losses from the point our ownership fell below to year end were reported as comprehensive income 
see critical accounting policies investments 
for the year ended  the net realized investment gains attributable to these fund investments were million  as compared to net realized investment losses of million for tha t category of investments for market conditions during caused a significant increase in the net asset value of those funds and  as a direct consequence  an increase in the net realized investment gains that we recognized for those investments for the year ended our gains on investment securities were partially offset by write downs for other than temporary declines in the market value of certain fixed maturities  preferred stocks and common stocks totaling million and million for the years ended and  respectively 
the other than temporary write downs for the period consisted of million for one municipal bond  million for three corporate bonds  million for three preferred stocks and million for five common stocks 
the other than temporary write downs for consisted of million for one municipal bond  million for three corporate bonds  million for eight preferred stocks and million for two common stocks

in addition   or million  were invested in municipal bonds  all of which were rated investment grade 
we do not believe any of these bonds warrant an other than temporary write down as their fair values were below cost primarily due to general market conditions and not due to specific credit concerns of the obligor 
the remaining  or million  consists of utility company preferred stocks rated ba bb 
the operating company of this utility is rated investment grade 
we believe these unrealized losses are temporary in nature  that the obligor will continue to meet its obligations and we intend to hold these securities to their maturity 
we will cont inue to monitor these holdings closely 
for our unrealized loss positions held between and months   or million cost  were rated aaa and generally had market values that were below amortized cost due to the effect of interest rate moves 
in addition   or million  were investment grade rated municipal bonds and preferred stocks which we feel will continue to meet their obligations 
the remaining  or million  is attributable to a b rated municipal housing issuer from which we expect to receive full payment upon the sale of assets underlying the securities 
the closing of this transaction is expected in the first quarter of for our unrealized loss positions held between and months  approximately  or million cost  were rated aaa and generally had market values below amortized cost due to interest rate moves 
in addition   or million  were invested in investment grade corporate and municipal bonds and preferred stocks 
we view the declines in these securities as temporary  as the declines were principally due to market conditions and not due to the specific credit concerns of the obligor 
lastly  about  or million  were invested in utility preferred stocks that were rated below investment grade  though the respective operating companies carry investment grade ratings 
we believe these unrealized losses are temporary in nature  that the obligor will continue to meet its obligations and we intend to hold these securities to their maturity 
we will continue to monitor these holdings closely

conditions and trends that have affected development in the past may not necessarily occur in the future 
accordingly  it may not be appropriate to extrapolate future redundancies or deficiencies based upon these developments 
the amounts we will ultimately incur from loss and loss adjustment expenses could differ materially in the near term from the amounts recorded 
approximately  in personal automobile liability redundancies developed for the year ended  with two thirds of this amount coming from the and accident years 
the remaining redundancy in this area came about evenly from the four accident years prior to this 
the primary reason for the redundancies in this area is that claim severity came in better than we anticipated 
the approximate  worse development in automobile physical damage occurred in the accident year offset by redundancies in the accident year 
the impact was mainly from higher ibnr claims as a result of a severe winter storm during the last week of  coupled with higher severity on physical damage claims 
the redundancies primarily resulted from higher than anticipated subrogation 
we also experienced deficiencies of  and  for accident years and  respectively  in in our commercial automobile liability area 
these defic iencies were primarily related to higher severity as compared to claims incurred in prior years 
various redundancies and deficiencies for the other lines of business and accident years combined for the remaining approximately  net deficiency 
the redundancies for year end primarily related to the personal automobile liability area  as claim severity mainly came in better than anticipated and was offset by worse development for the previous accident years

combined ratio for the year ended  our statutory combined ratio was  compared with for the decrease in the combined ratio was primarily the result of the factors that resulted in the lower loss and underwriting ratios previously mentioned 
income taxes our overall effective tax rate for the year ended was as compared to for in both years  our effective rate was lower than the statutory rate of primarily due to tax exempt interest and the corporate dividends received deduction 
our income tax rate for the year ended was adversely impacted by a tax valuation allowance of million related to a deferred tax asset previously established for realized investment losses 
our income tax rate for was benefited by the reversal of the tax valuation allowance from change in accounting principle due to the effect of a change in accounting principle related to goodwill  we recorded income in the first quarter of  net of taxes  of million  or per share diluted 
this amount represented the remaining unamortized negative goodwill related to closed end preferred stock mutual funds and the remaining excess of book value of subsidiary interest over cost relating to the acquisition of american commerce 
negative goodwill and the excess of book value of subsidiary interest over cost were created in these acquisitions because the underlying value of the assets purchased exceeded the purchase price 
the subsequent recognition of income that occurred as these items were eliminated was not a taxable event but instead became part of the basis of the acquired asset 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  overview our net earnings for the year ended were adversely affected primarily by a significant increase in our net realized investment losses and  to a lesser extent  by an increase in our losses and loss adjustment expenses  which together more than offset an increase in our earned premiums 
our after tax net realized investment losses increased by million for the year ended compared to the year ended the increased losses resulted primarily from the unfavorable impact of the decline in utility common stocks on the net values of various closed end preferred stock mutual funds that we must reflect in our net realized investment losses using the equity method of accounting  and  write downs for other than temporary declines in the market value of various investment securities 
see investment gains and losses 
our losses and loss adjustment expenses increased by million  or  in compared to the increase resulted primarily from our premium growth and an increase in our loss ratio on a statutory basis to for compared to for see losses and loss adjustment expenses 
our earned premiums increased by million  or  in compared to  primarily resulting from an increase of million  or  in earned premiums for personal automobile coverage in massachusetts  primarily because of our acquisition of the personal automobile business of two companies that were exiting that market  an increase of million  or  in earned premiums for personal automobile coverage outside of massachusetts  and  an increase of million  or  in earned premiums for commercial automobile coverage in massachusetts

the components of these changes for and follow coverage type rate change rate change liability bodily injury personal injury protection property damage to others physical damage collision comprehensive total represents change in our average rate per exposure from our prior year average rate for massachusetts private passenger automobile premiums 
the total rate change depicted is the result of the weighted average of premiums written for all coverages divided by liability exposures only  because all exposures are required to carry liability coverage 
the above percentage changes were primarily the result of rate modifications in the individual coverage components in the state mandated rates  changes in our safe driver rate deviations  and changes in the distribution of our business by class and territory 
the combination of these factors resulted in a increase in the average personal automobile premium per exposure in despite no change from the previous year for the state mandated average rates  our increase in the average personal automobile premium per exposure was primarily due to the above noted changes 
also having an impact  was the fact that the announced rate decision did not include the effect of future purchases of new automobiles in the year to which the rate decision applied 
in addition  our mix of personal automobile business differs from that of the industry 
in  we did not offer our customers safe driver deviations 
included in the premium increase for massachusetts personal automobile direct premiums written are premiums that were the result of appointments of new agents 
during  we had new appointments  of which were from voluntary agents resulting in an additional million in premiums 
these new appointments were primarily the result of our agreements to acquire the massachusetts personal automobile business from berkshire mutual insurance company and masswest insurance company 
see item  agreements for the transfer of massachusetts business from other companies in the remainder of the new appointments resulted from erps 
business obtained from new erps amounted to million during the aaa affinity group discount for was established at  which was unchanged from in  for drivers who qualified  our aaa affinity group discount and safe driver deviations could be combined for up to a reduction from state mandated rates 
in  we did not offer a safe driver discount 
although direct premiums written for personal automobile insurance in states other than massachusetts increased in  an overall depressed rate environment and adverse development of prior year reserves resulted in diminished underwriting profits 
personal automobile direct premiums written by american commerce increased million  or  to million in as compared to million in  due primarily to book rollovers of business from existing agents  partially offset by decreases in states where we are not actively pursuing writings 
personal automobile direct premiums written from commerce west increased million  or  to million in as compared to million in both companies primarily target preferred insurance risks and write predominantly personal automobile insurance 
commerce west s recent growth is attributable to preferred personal automobile business 
personal automobile policies for both companies are written primarily for a policy term of six months 
the increase in direct premiums written for massachusetts commercial automobile insurance in was due primarily to an increase of approximately in the number of policies written  combined with a increase in the average commercial automobile premium per policy 
the increase in premium per policy was attributable to demand for insurance exceeding supply in the commercial automobile market  as well as our own increase of volume of larger commercial automobile accounts 
in  we experienced an increase of approximately million from policies with premiums in excess of in addition  base rates for other voluntary commercial automobile policies have increased moderately  and a reduction in individual risk premium modification  or irpm  credits has occurred  favorably affecting average premiums per policy 
in addition  we experienced approximately a increase in rates for policies written through car 
the increased business was attributable to our initiative to expand writings 
the increase in direct premiums written for massachusetts homeowners insurance in was due primarily to a increase in the number of massachusetts policies written coupled with a increase in the average massachusetts premium per policy 
our increase in massachusetts homeowner premiums is primarily related to several factors an increased number of agents  fewer carriers writing homeowner business  our pricing position in the market place  and  the bundling of homeowners insurance with automobile insurance  which provides a homeowner discount to customers 
homeowners insurance written by american commerce in other states increased to million in due primarily to book rollovers of business from existing agents and the impact caused by contraction of authority to write homeowner business by competitors 
homeowner policies in all states are written primarily for a policy term of one year 
the increase in total net premiums written was primarily due to the growth in direct premiums written as described above offset by an increase in premiums ceded to car and the quota share agreement 
net premiums written for homeowners insurance in all other states increased million  with net premiums written of million in as compared to million in the increase in total earned premiums during was primarily due to increases in written premiums as described above and written premiums being earned in net investment income as depicted in the accompanying table  net investment income before taxes for decreased million  or  as compared to  principally as a result of a decreased in yield partially offset by an increase in average invested assets at cost 
the decrease in yield was primarily due to lower short term yields  coupled with an environment of lower long term yields and higher yielding investment securities being called 
during  we purchased approximately million of fannie mae fnma securities 
we believe these securities will have a duration of less than three years 
this will allow us to achieve higher yields until longer term investments are acquired 
net investment income as a percentage of total average investments was in compared to in net investment income  after tax  as a percentage of total average investments  was in and in years ended investment return average month end investments at cost net investment income before tax net investment income after tax net investment income as a percentage of average net investments at cost net investment income after tax as a percentage of average net investments at cost premium finance and service fees premium finance and service fees increased million  or  during  as a result of increased business and a service fee increase on massachusetts new and renewal business from to per installment payment  for policies with effective dates on or after july  investment gains and losses net realized investment losses totaled million during as compared to million in net realized investment losses during were primarily centered in two areas closed end preferred stock mutual funds and other than temporary impairments 
declines in the market values of utility stocks held by various closed end preferred stock mutual funds totaling million were the primary reasons for these losses 
we reflect these declines through realized losses because our significant level of ownership requires the use of the equity method of accounting for these funds 
see critical accounting policies investments above for more information on our use of the equity method of accounting for these funds 
the realized losses for also resulted from write downs for other than temporary declines in the market value of certain fixed maturities  preferred and common stocks totaling million 
our management focuses on the potential impairment of investments for other than temporary declines in market value 
during  an impairment in an investment was deemed to be other than temporary when a security s market value had diminished by more than of cost for two consecutive calendar quarters 
if the contractual terms of the security were being complied with  management performed a cash flow valuation to determine the potential impairment of the security 
if the security was deemed impaired  we adjusted the security s cost to market value by recording a realized loss based on publicly available information or  in the absence of such information  to a value based on cash flow modeling 
see critical accounting policies investments above for more info rmation about our current policy for determining whether an other than temporary decline in investment securities has occurred 
during  million in realized investment losses were also incurred related to our investments in venture capital funds 
these investments primarily provide seed capital for start up companies with emerging high technology initiatives in the financial services industry 
these investments are made in limited partnerships and our exposure to loss is limited to our actual investment 
investments in these venture capital funds are accounted for on an equity basis 
losses and loss adjustment expenses our loss and lae ratio on a statutory basis increased to in as compared to in the primary reasons for this increase were higher private passenger automobile losses from car as a result of increased participation in car and higher car loss ratios  coupled with an increase in the frequency of personal automobile bodily injury claims compared to last year 
another factor in the increase resulted from business written outside of massachusetts for which the loss ratio increased to during as compared to for these factors were somewhat offset by a lower physical damage claim frequency and a lower loss ratio in the massachusetts commercial automobile line 
the following table reconciles beginning and ending reserves for losses and loss adjustment expense  net of reinsurance deductions from all reinsurers including car  as shown in our consolidated financial statements for the years indicated

this decrease in provision was principally the result of re estimation of unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses principally on the personal automobile  commercial automobile and homeowners lines of business 
policy acquisition costs as a percentage of net premiums written  our statutory underwriting expenses decreased to in as compared to in the improvement was primarily due to a lower mandated massachusetts personal automobile commission rate in as compared to  and to lower general underwriting expenses 
another factor in the decrease resulted from business written outside of massachusetts where the underwriting expense ratio decreased to for as compared to for these factors were partially offset by higher contingent commission expenses and higher insolvency assessments 
the underwriting ratio includes a million charge  as compared to a million charge in  representing our allocation from the miif 
combined ratio our statutory combined ratio was for both and this resulted in an underwriting profit of for both and this was the result of the factors mentioned above 
income taxes our effective tax rate was and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
in  the effective tax rate was affected by the write off of deferred tax assets of million 
this amount was comprised of million from the write off of a deferred tax asset associated with realized losses on our closed end preferred stock mutual funds that were ineligible for a tax benefit and million of valuation allowance associated with our inability to claim a portion of our realized losses against prior years realized gains 
in  the effective rate was lower than the statutory rate of primarily due to tax exempt interest income and the corporate dividends received deduction 
minority interest in net loss of subsidiary effective january   the ownership interests in acic holding co  inc were recapitalized 
prior to the recapitalization at december   we maintained an common stock interest and aaa southern new england  or aaa sne  maintained a common stock interest in acic holding 
additionally  all acic holding preferred stock was owned by us 
the recapitalization resulted in the redemption of our acic holding preferred stock in exchange for  additional shares of acic holding common stock 
this resulted in an increase in our acic holding common stock interest to with aaa sne maintaining a acic holding common stock interest  with no preferred stock outstanding 
net earnings our net earnings decreased million  or  to million during as compared to million in  resulting primarily from an increase in our net realized investment losses of million and an increase in our losses and loss adjustment expenses of million  which together more than offset an increase of million in our earned premiums  all as previously described in this section 
net earnings for included income  net of taxes  of million due to the effect of a change in accounting principle related to sfas no 
change in accounting principle see item as previously stated in this report in our comparison of to restatement for employee stock option variable accounting treatment made in in  we restated for the effect of a change in accounting for employee stock options 
for employee stock options which we issued from through  we used fixed accounting treatment through september  at that time  we concluded that variable accounting treatment was more appropriate than fixed accounting treatment 
therefore  we applied variable accounting treatment in  as well as retroactively to and prior years 
accordingly  in  we restated results for and the first three quarters of the impact of the restatement for the year ended resulted in a decrease in net earnings of million  or per diluted share 
as allowed by statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 we have elected to continue to apply variable accounting for our stock options granted in and we continue to comply with accounting principles board apb opinion no 
and related interpretations in ap plying fixed accounting for the employee stock options granted in liquidity and capital resources the primary sources of our liquidity are funds generated from insurance premiums  net investment income  premium finance and service fees and the maturing and sale of investments 
the primary uses of our liquidity are payment of policy claims  operating costs and payment of dividends to our stockholders 
our operating activities provided cash of million in the year ended as compared to million during  representing an increase of million  or 
premiums collected less loss and policy acquisition cost payments were million higher for the year ended compared to the primary reason for this increase is that the increase in premiums collected outpaced the increase in losses and lae paid and the policy acquisition costs paid 
this occurs when we have significant increases in business  as claims paid tend to lag behind premiums collected 
net investment income received continued to decline  and was approximately million less than prior year  due primarily to decreased investment yields and higher yielding securities being called 
for the years ended and  net cash flows from investing activities used cash of million and million  respectively 
the majority of the difference was a billion increase in purchases of fixed securities and equity securities  partially offset by an increase in the proceeds from the sales and maturities of fixed maturities  equities and closed end preferred stock mutual funds totaling billion 
this resulted from our decision to sell a significant portion of our securities with unrealized gains in order to implement a change in our investment view 
this change in view caused us to reduce the average duration of our investment portfolio during the second and third quarters  which in turn resulted in the sale of a number of securities that had increased in value significantly as overall credit spreads tightened 
this caused overall portfolio turnover eg volume of trades to increase beyond that of recent years 
the portfolio s ales occurred in securities that had been purchased during as well as those purchased in previous years 
thus  while we did sell some higher yielding instruments  the overall after tax yield of the portfolio did not fall significantly beyond the decline in interest rates as a whole 
during the third quarter as interest rates rose  we began to invest in longer term securities  resulting in a slightly higher duration at year end 
investing activities were funded by the accumulation of cash and cash provided by operating activities 
the decrease in the carrying value of the closed end preferred stock mutual funds in was primarily the result of sales and the reclassification of six preferred stock mutual funds in which we no longer have a greater than ownership position 
we no longer use the equity method of accounting for these six funds  but instead mark them to market 
cash flows provided by financing activities totaled million during the year ended compared to million used during the increase in cash in  relative to  was primarily from the net proceeds of our bond offering of million  and from a million reduction in treasury stock purchases 
we issued million face value of senior unsecured notes which mature december  we will pay interest on these notes semi annually on june and december we are using the proceeds for general corporate purposes  including enhancement of the capital position of our operating subsidiaries in support of recent premium growth  as well as to continue our diversification efforts outside of massachusetts 
we and our subsidiaries will be able to issue or incur additional indebtedness that is senior to the notes in the future  provided the secured portion of such debt does not exceed of our consolidated tangible net worth 
cash used in financing activities totaled million during the year ended compared to million during during  cash flows used in financing activities consisted of million in dividends paid to stockholders and million used to purchase million shares of treasury stock  partially offset by million from the issuance of common stock pursuant to our stock option plan 
during  cash flows used in financing activities consisted of million in dividends paid to stockholders and million used to purchase approximately  shares of treasury stock 
we purchased a  square foot building in and renovated it during expenditures in  and were million  million and million  respectively 
the project was complete as of december  we rely upon dividends from our operating subsidiaries for our cash requirements  including payments of interest and principal on the notes 
under massachusetts law  if our subsidiaries wish to make any dividend or other distribution to us  they may  within certain limitations  pay such dividends and then file a report with the commissioner 
the aggregate amount of dividends calculated in accordance with regulations of massachusetts  california and ohio that could have been paid in from all of our insurance subsidiaries without prior regulatory approval was approximately million  of which million was declared and paid as of december investments 
our funds are generally invested in securities with maturities intended to provide adequate funds to pay claims without the forced sale of investments 
the carrying value at market and equity of total investments  including cash and cash equivalents at december  was billion 
these funds provide sufficient liquidity for the payment of claims and other short term cash needs

our fixed income portfolio s weighted average duration which includes all fixed maturities and preferred stocks as of december   was years 
at december   our fixed income portfolio had a weighted average duration of years versus years at december  the duration of a security is the time weighted present value of the security s expected cash flows and is used to measure a security s price sensitivity to changes in interest rates 
the weighted average duration is short compared to the average stated maturity of years because of our holdings in gnma  fnma and municipal housing bonds in the fixed maturity portfolio 
the duration reflects industry prepayment assumptions 
the municipal housing bonds are similar in nature to gnmas in that they pay down principal during the life of the bond 
for these types of bonds  investors are compensated primarily for reinvestment risk rather than credit quality risk 
during pe riods of significant interest rate volatility  the underlying mortgages may prepay more quickly or more slowly than anticipated 
if the repayment of principal occurs earlier than anticipated during periods of declining interest rates  investment income may decline due to the reinvestment of these funds at the lower current market rates 
the analytic systems we used to calculate the above duration data utilize optional call dates  sinking fund requirements and assume a non static prepayment pattern in deriving these averages

these investments are made in limited partnerships and our exposure to loss is limited to our actual investment 
one limited partnership investment required a commitment by us to invest up to million into the partnership 
as of december   we have invested million into the partnership 
the partnership was formed to operate as an investment fund principally for the purpose of making investments primarily in equity  equity related and other securities issued in expansion financing  start ups  buy outs and recapitalization transactions relating to companies in the areas of insurance  financial services  e commerce  healthcare  and related businesses  including  without limitation  service and technology enterprises supporting such businesses

the new program became effective july  in the event of a catastrophe  recovery is limited to of the loss with a maximum recovery estimated at million  equating to a total loss to us of million 
several limitations were added to the new contract regarding losses related to nuclear  chemical  and biological terrorist events 
our maximum loss recovery in case of these types of events is estimated at million 
our estimated total loss  before reinsurance  on our other than automobile business for and year hurricanes is approximately million and million  respectively 
we derived our estimates through the services of employers reinsurance corporation on our december  other than automobile exposures  which utilized the rms risk management solutions risk assessment system  and are based on increases in policies written in that a re subject to the quota share treaty 
we believe that most property and casualty insurance companies establish their catastrophe reinsurance programs between the year and year storm estimates 
industry and regulatory guidelines suggest that the ratio of a property and casualty insurer s annual net premiums written to statutory policyholders surplus should not exceed to 
the following table presents  on a consolidated basis  our net premiums written to statutory surplus ratio for the year ended net premiums written to statutory surplus ratio in connection with the acquisition of american commerce in january  we granted stock options to agents that had been placing business with american commerce before the acquisition 
as of december    of these options are outstanding 
each option may be exercised on or after january  the options will expire on january  each option has two components the right to exercise and a put option 
the right to exercise permits the agents to purchase a certain amount of our common stock at an exercise price of per share 
the put option allows the agent to require us to purchase the option from the agent at a price of per share 
the agents would have an incentive to exercise their put options if the price of our common stock was below on the exercise date 
all of these options  except for  options  are vested in the put option 
our accrued liability for the exercise of these options was million at december  our total liability under the put options would be million 
market risk interest rate sensitivity and equity price risk our investment strategy emphasizes investment yield while maintaining investment quality 
the focus of our investment objectives continues to be maximizing after tax investment income through investing in high quality diversified investments structured to maximize after tax investment income while minimizing risk 
a secondary objective is to achieve above average after tax total return 
our funds are generally invested in securities with maturities intended to provide adequate funds to pay claims and meet other operating needs without the forced sale of investments 
during  we sold a significant portion of our securities with unrealized gains in order to implement a change in our investment view 
this change in view caused us to reduce the average duration of our investment portfolio during the second and third quarters and included the sale of a number of securities which had increased in value significantly as overall credit spreads tightened 
this c aused overall portfolio turnover eg volume of trades to increase beyond that of recent years 
the portfolio sales occurred in securities that had been purchased during as well as those purchased in previous years 
thus  while we did sell some higher yielding instruments  the overall after tax yield of the portfolio did not fall significantly beyond the decline in interest rates as a whole 
during the third quarter as interest rates rose  we began to invest in longer term securities  resulting in a slightly higher duration at year end in conducting investing activities  we are subject to  and assume  market risk 
market risk is the risk of an adverse financial impact from changes in interest rates and market prices 
the level of risk assumed by us is a function of our overall objectives  liquidity needs and market volatility 
we manage our market risk by focusing on higher quality equity and fixed income investments  by periodically monitoring the credit strength of companies in which investments are made  by limiting exposure in any one investment and by monitoring the quality of the investment portfolio by taking into account credit ratings assigned by recognized rating organizations 
our portfolio includes six securities in default  three corporate bonds  two preferred stocks and one municipal bond with a total carrying value of million at december  of our bonds and preferred stocks  were rated in either of the two highest quality categories provided by the naic as of december   as compared to at december  this decrease primarily resulted from an increase in the market value of securities that are not rated in either of the two highest categories 
although we have significant holdings of various closed end preferred stock mutual funds  these funds are comprised primarily of preferred and common stocks traded on national stock exchanges  thus limiting exposure to any one investment 
interest rate sensitivity 
as part of our investing activities  we assume positions in fixed maturity  equity  short term and cash equivalents markets 
therefore  we are exposed to the impacts of interest rate changes in the market value of investments 
at december   our exposure to interest rate changes and equity price risk has been estimated using sensitivity analysis 
the interest rate impact is defined as the effect of a hypothetical interest rate change of plus or minus basis points on the market value of fixed maturities and preferred stocks 
changes in interest rates would result in unrealized gains or losses in the market value of the fixed maturity and preferred stock portfolio due to differences between current market rates and the stated rates for these investments 
the following table summarizes our interest rate risk  based on the results of the sensitivity analysis at december  the table also reflects the changes in market value and stockholders equity that would be attributable to realized investment gains losses that we would recognize under the equity method of accounting with respect to the change in the net asset value of any mutual fund in which we own or more of the shares outstanding

the preceding sensitivity analysis does not represent a forecast and should not be relied upon as being indicative of expected results 
these hypothetical estimates are based upon numerous assumptions such as the nature and timing of interest rate levels including the yield curve shape  prepayments on loans and securities  reinvestment and replacement of asset and liability cash flows and other assumptions 
while assumptions are developed based upon current economic conditions  we cannot provide any assurance as to the predictive nature of these assumptions 
also  as market conditions vary from those assumed in the sensitivity analysis  actual results will also differ due to prepayment and refinancing levels likely deviating from those assumed and other internal and external variables 
furthermore  the sensitivity analysis does not reflect actions that management might take in responding to or anticipating changes in interest rates 
segment information we have four reportable segments property and casualty insurance massachusetts  property and casualty insurance other than massachusetts  real estate and commercial lending  and  corporate and other 
our property and casualty insurance operations are written through commerce  citation  american commerce  and commerce west and are marketed to affinity groups  individuals  families and businesses through our relationships with professional independent insurance agencies 
our property and casualty insurance massachusetts segment also includes the operations of clark prout insurance agency  our wholly owned subsidiary 
our wholly owned subsidiary  bay finance company  inc  originates and services residential and commercial mortgages in massachusetts and connecticut 
the corporate and other segment represents the remainder of our activities  including those of commerce group 
we evaluate performance and allocate resources based primarily on the property and casualty insurance segments  which represent over of our total revenue for the past three years 
the accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as those used in the notes to the financial statements

additionally  the premium rates that we charge for personal automobile insurance in massachusetts are adjusted by the commissioner only at annual intervals 
such annual adjustments in premium rates may lag behind related cost increases 
economic recessions can have an impact upon us  primarily through the policyholder s election to decrease non compulsory coverages afforded by the policy and decreased driving  each of which tends to decrease claims 
to the extent inflation and economic recession influence yields on investments  we are also affected 
as each of these environments affect current market rates of return  previously committed investments may rise or decline in value depending on the type and maturity of investment 
inflation and recession must also be considered by us in the creation and review of loss and lae reserves since portions of these reserves are expected to be paid over extended periods of time 
the anticipated effect of economic conditions is implicitly considered when estimating liabilities for losses and lae 
the importance of continually adjusting reserves is even more pronounced in periods of changing economic circumstances
