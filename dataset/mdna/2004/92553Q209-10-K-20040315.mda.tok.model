item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies the company has identified a number of its accounting polices that it has determined to be critical 
these critical accounting policies primarily relate to financial statement assertions that are based on the estimates and assumptions of management and the effect of changing those estimates and assumptions could have a material effect on our financial statements 
the following is a summary of those critical accounting policies 
revenue recognition we derive revenues primarily from the sale of products and to a lesser extent the provision of services and rental equipment 
revenue from the sale of products is recognized when title is transferred to the customer 
where installation either is essential to functionality or is not deemed inconsequential or perfunctory  such as equipment sales under contracts that require us to install the product at the customer location  revenue is recognized when the equipment has been delivered to and installed at the customer location 
revenues for products sold where installation is not essential to functionality and is deemed inconsequential or perfunctory  such as revenue from customer installable products  is recognized upon transfer of title with estimated installation costs accrued 
our service revenues are derived from parts and supplies  in house and field repairs  service contracts and customer education 
we sell service contracts on our products when the warranty period expires 
we recognize revenues from these service contracts ratably over the terms of the contracts due to the lack of historical data available regarding the timing of when the actual services were provided 
in the future  we may compile this information which could cause us to recognize service revenue over a different period 
inventory we write down the value of our inventory by our estimate of the difference between the cost of the inventory and its net realizable value 
our estimate takes into account projected sales of the inventory on hand and the age of the inventory in stock 
in addition  we assess the value of older model products when new product introductions may reduce their net realizable value 
if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
the provision for write down of inventory is recorded in cost of revenues 
goodwill impairment we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  effective december  sfas no 
requires companies to perform a transitional test and an annual test to determine whether there was any impairment of goodwill 
these tests involve determining the estimated fair value of the company s reporting units by measuring the net present value of their future cash flows 
if the net present value of estimated cash flows is less than the book value of the reporting unit we would perform additional analysis  which could result in the write down of goodwill 
we determined our reporting units for purposes of assessing goodwill impairment under sfas no 
by evaluating our four operating segments respiratory technologies  critical care  neurocare and medical and surgical products 
each of these operating segments is comprised of several components 
while the components of respiratory technologies  critical care and neurocare have similar economic characteristics  products and services  production processes  customers and methods of distribution  the components of the medical and surgical products segment do not 
therefore  the components have been aggregated at the operating segment level for respiratory technologies  critical care and neurocare and each of these segments was treated as a reporting unit 
since the components of medical and surgical products cannot be aggregated  each component was treated as a separate reporting unit 
as part of the impairment testing  the company allocated its goodwill to its reporting units 
goodwill from an acquisition that is specifically associated with a single reporting unit is recorded on the books of that reporting unit 
however  when goodwill from a transaction is associated with multiple reporting units it is allocated to the reporting units based upon relative revenues at the time of the acquisition 
we performed the annual test in and have determined that there is no impairment of goodwill 
in performing this test  we used our internal operating and capital budgets  which are based on such assumptions as new product introductions  growth in sales of existing products  margin improvements  operating cost control  savings from past restructuring efforts  equipment replacement dates and building capacity needs 
we discounted our estimated cash flows using our estimated cost of capital 
if any of our assumptions change  such as an increase of our cost of capital  it could result in an impairment of goodwill  which would require a charge to earnings 
stock based compensation stock options are granted to key employees and non employee directors 
upon vesting  an option becomes exercisable  meaning  an employee or director can purchase a share of the company s common stock at a price that is equal to the closing share price on the day of grant 
sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  permits companies either to continue accounting for stock options under accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  or to adopt a fair value based method to measure compensation cost 
under apb no 
 which we have elected to continue using  there is no compensation cost if  on the date of grant  the option s exercise price is equal to or greater than the share price 
under sfas no 
 an option s fair value is estimated on the date of grant  and the value is expensed evenly over the vesting period 
if we had accounted for stock based compensation under the sfas no 
fair value based method  net income would have been reduced by million  million and million for  and  respectively 
in order to estimate an option s fair value under sfas no 
 we use the black scholes option valuation model 
the option valuation model requires a number of assumptions  including future stock price volatility and expected option life the amount of time until the options are exercised or expire 
expected option life is based on actual exercise activity from previous option grants 
volatility is calculated based upon stock price movements over a period of time 
additionally  our share price on the day of grant influences the option value 
the higher the share price  as compared to the grant price  the more the option is worth 
changes in the option value after the day of grant are not reflected in expense 
any change in these assumptions could significantly impact the values calculated by the option valuation model and  consequently  the pro forma effects disclosed in the nature of operations and summary of significant accounting policies note to the consolidated financial statements 
operations in september  we decided to sell certain assets of our thermedics polymer business thermedics 
the consolidated financial statements have been restated to present thermedics  which was divested in october  as well as medical data electronics mde  which was divested in april  as discontinued operations 
we derive revenues primarily from the sale of products and to a lesser extent the provision of services and rental of equipment 
when complex installation is required  revenue from products is recognized upon completion of the installation 
in all other situations  revenue is recognized when title is transferred and there is no further obligation to the customer 
our service revenues are derived from parts and supplies  in house and field repairs  service contracts and customer training 
we sell service contracts on our products that cover the products for periods after the warranty expires 
we recognize revenues from these service contracts ratably over the terms of the contracts 
we rent our products  primarily in the critical care and respiratory technologies segments  to hospitals and other customers for periods ranging from two weeks to over a year 
we recognize rental revenues ratably over the term of the rental contract 
the respiratory technologies segment develops  manufactures  markets  services and rents products for the diagnosis and treatment of respiratory  pulmonary and sleep related disorders 
the critical care segment develops  manufactures  markets  services and rents products to treat respiratory insufficiency caused by illness  injury or premature birth 
the neurocare segment develops  manufactures  markets and services a comprehensive line of neurodiagnostic  vascular diagnostic and audiology testing systems 
the medical and surgical products segment develops  manufactures and markets disposable medical products and specialty metal components for orthopedic products  medical imaging equipment and cardio vascular implants 
results of operations the following table sets forth line items from our consolidated statements of income as percentages of total revenues for the periods indicated year ended january  december  december  revenues costs and operating expenses cost of revenues selling  general and administrative expenses research and development expenses restructuring costs purchased in process research and development operating income other expenses  net provision for income taxes income from continuing operations year ended january  compared with year ended december  revenues revenues increased million  or  to million 
of this increase  million was contributed by respiratory technologies  million by critical care and million by medical and surgical products 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease of million in neurocare 
the revenue increase resulted primarily from million in sales of new products  principally in the critical care segment 
our clinical services business contributed million of increased revenue  while the weakening of the dollar against the euro contributed million 
partially offsetting these increases was a reduction in sales in our base business primarily due to the replacement of mature products by new products 
cost of revenues and gross margin cost of revenues increased million  or  over to million 
gross margin percentage decreased percentage points to from in this decrease was due to several factors  including reengineering costs related to avea 
in addition  market conditions in lead to the write off of inventory we acquired as a result of the spin off from our former parent company 
also contributing to the decrease were increased sales of lower margin products and higher installation and warranty expense 
partially offsetting the decreases in gross margin percentage were increased sales of new higher margin products 
the provision for excess and obsolete inventory was million in compared with million in reserved inventory is scrapped  sold or utilized as repair parts 
sales of reserved product and the gross margin thereon were not significant in and selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  over to million 
as a percentage of revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses were in compared with in the increase was due to negative currency impacts as a result of the weakening of the dollar against the euro  incremental investment in neurocare s sales force and marketing  higher incentive compensation and increased legal expenses  mainly due to the litigation with ino therapeutics 
selling  general and administrative expenses also increased due to the inclusion of a full year of expenses for eme and scimed  which were companies acquired in the fourth quarter of research and development expenses research and development expense was million in both and as a percentage of revenues  research and development expense was in compared with in restructuring costs we incurred million and million of restructuring costs in and  respectively 
the restructuring costs were incurred in our neurocare  critical care and respiratory technologies segments 
the restructuring plan in neurocare included the termination of employees from general and administrative  service and manufacturing 
the plan was carried out in the third and fourth quarters of and severance of million was expensed and paid 
the annual savings expected to be realized as a result of this plan are approximately million beginning in  much of which will be reinvested into more productive areas in neurocare  such as sales and research and development 
the restructuring plan in our critical care segment will eliminate redundant functions in the united kingdom through a reduction in staffing of employees across all functions 
as of january   million of retention payments have been expensed and paid for approximately employees 
severance for the remaining employees will be expensed and paid in the first quarter of we expect to realize annual savings beginning in of approximately million in personnel costs due to the reduction in force 
restructuring plans in our respiratory technologies segment include the closure of a machine shop and the reduction in the number of customer service positions in germany 
due to german labor regulations  certain positions cannot be eliminated immediately 
therefore  positions will be eliminated over the next five years 
as of january   of these positions have been eliminated and million of severance has been paid 
retention expense for the remaining employees will be recorded ratably over their remaining employment and total approximately million 
as of january   approximately million of this amount has been accrued 
the annual savings are expected to total approximately million  which will be realized ratably over the next five years as the positions are terminated 
restructuring expenses in included a non cash charge of million to write down the value of a vacated facility in our neurocare segment 
other restructuring expenses in included million for the consolidation of manufacturing facilities in new hampshire and colorado with our main neurocare manufacturing facility in wisconsin 
associated with these consolidations were employee terminations  retention bonuses  employee relocations  recruiting costs and facility closing costs  as well as inventory and asset relocations 
we also incurred restructuring costs of million related to employee terminations in our medical and surgical products segment 
additional restructuring costs included million for the cost of exiting long term leases in europe and million for the severance of former executives 
provision for income taxes our effective tax rate was in compared to in the effective tax rate in was less than the statutory federal income tax rate of primarily because of the tax benefit attributable to us export sales and us research and development tax credits 
these benefits were partially offset by the impact of state income taxes 
the effective tax rate in exceeded the statutory federal income tax rate of primarily because of the impact of state income taxes and the nondeductible purchased in process research and development iprd associated with our acquisition of eme  partially offset by the tax benefit attributable to us export sales 
the impact of iprd on our effective tax rate was percentage points 
discontinued operations on october   we sold substantially all of the assets of thermedics  which was reported in the medical and surgical products segment 
as part of the sale  we recorded a loss on disposal  including expenses  of approximately million  after taxes in discontinued operations 
discontinued operations include an after tax write down of mde of million and million in and  respectively 
segment information the following table shows revenues contributed by each of our operating segments  expressed in absolute dollars in thousands and as percentages of total revenues for the periods presented year ended operating segment january  december  december  respiratory technologies    critical care    neurocare    medical and surgical products    total revenues    respiratory technologies revenues increased million  or  over to million 
the increase is attributable to a million favorable impact from foreign currency and increased revenue of million in our clinical services business 
in addition  there were increased sales of nitric oxide and sleep therapy products 
operating income increased over due to the increased revenues  partially offset by increased legal expenses related to our litigation with ino therapeutics  an inventory write off of a discontinued product line  increased incentive compensation and higher installation and warranty expense 
critical care revenues increased million  or  over to million 
the increase resulted from the sale of new products  including avea  vela and infant flow  which totaled million 
in addition  increased sales of our earlier model t bird ventilators to asia in the second quarter due to the sars outbreak contributed million to the increase 
partially offsetting these increases were lower volume and pricing pressures on some of our mature product lines 
operating income more than doubled due to the increased volume 
neurocare revenues decreased million  or  over to million 
this decrease was a result of lower sales of our emg and eeg products  partially offset by increased sales of our audiology and peripheral vascular products 
operating income decreased primarily due to the revenue decrease  incremental investment in the sales force and marketing  and scimed expenses  a business which was acquired in partially offsetting these increases was a reduction in restructuring and research and development expenses as well as savings from efficiencies obtained in our restructuring efforts 
medical and surgical products revenues increased million  or  over to million 
this increase is a result of higher sales in our medical disposable and orthopedic implant businesses 
partially offsetting these increases were decreased sales of our medical imaging and heart device components 
operating income decreased 
the decrease was primarily due to an inventory write off for a discontinued product line and lower sales of higher margin products in our specialty metals business 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  revenues revenues increased in to million 
of this increase million was contributed by respiratory technologies  million from critical care  million from neurocare and million from medical and surgical products 
our revenue increases were driven by a number of factors including increased volume  sales of new products  the weakening of the dollar against the euro and a fourth quarter acquisition 
offsetting these increases were a higher percentage of products sold to lower price markets  primarily homecare and international  and decreased sales to latin america caused by the economic climate in that region 
cost of revenues and gross margin cost of revenues increased over to million 
gross margin percentage decreased percentage points to from in our decrease in gross margin percentage points was due to a combination of factors including a higher percentage of total sales to lower price channels  and the consolidation of some our manufacturing operations in which temporarily resulted in duplicate labor costs 
we also recorded additional write downs of inventory in based on our projections of a higher percentage of our future sales coming from new products  which in some cases will displace sales of older products 
increases in property and earthquake insurance  which are included in manufacturing overhead  also had an impact on gross margin 
in addition  a larger percentage of our total labor costs were attributable to health insurance benefits in and we expect the increase in health insurance premiums to continue 
offsetting these decreases were synergies achieved in our manufacturing operations  partially due to the consolidations of our manufacturing operations in  a weakening of the dollar against the euro and the impact of the licensing revenue related to pulmonetics 
the provision for excess and obsolete inventory was million in compared with million in reserved inventory is scrapped  sold or utilized as repair parts 
sales of reserved product and the gross margin thereon were not significant in selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased over to million 
as a percentage of revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses were in compared with in increases in selling  general and administrative expenses were due to the inclusion of eme expenses from their acquisition in october and the impact of the first full year of being an independent public company 
this included the establishment of a separate and independent corporate function and all the associated costs such as a management team  a board of directors  annual report preparation  printing and mailing  as well as legal  audit and listing fees 
in addition  increases in all insurance expenses  including our first full year of directors and officers liability insurance  contributed to the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses 
we expect this increase in insurance expense to continue in the near term 
offsetting these increases were the absence of goodwill amortization  reduced expenses from the termination of the corporate services arrangement with thermo electron and lower incentive compensation expense 
research and development expenses research and development expense decreased to million 
as a percentage of revenues  research and development expense was in compared with in the decrease can be attributed to the movement of several large projects from the development stage into commercialization and a reimbursement from the european union for a completed research and development project at erich jaeger 
in addition  a large payment to a third party contract research organization in did not recur in restructuring costs we incurred million in restructuring costs in both and restructuring expenses in included a non cash charge of million to write down the value of a vacated facility in our neurocare segment 
other restructuring expenses in included million for the consolidation of manufacturing facilities in new hampshire and colorado with our main neurocare manufacturing facility in wisconsin 
associated with these consolidations were employee terminations  retention bonuses  employee relocations  recruiting costs  facility closing costs  as well as inventory and asset relocations 
we also incurred restructuring costs of million related to employee terminations in our medical and surgical products segment 
additional restructuring costs included million for the cost of exiting long term leases in europe and million for the severance of former executives 
in  restructuring expenses were primarily employee severance costs connected with the consolidation of our european facilities and expense reduction programs in the us also included in these expenses was a retention program put in place by our former parent company and the termination of former executives 
purchased in process research and development the company recorded million in expense for purchased in process research and development iprd related to the acquisition of eme and engaged an internationally recognized independent appraiser in order to determine the fair value of in process technology 
the approach used to identify iprd distinguishes iprd from developed technology based upon whether technological feasibility has been achieved 
the technological feasibility of a product is established when the enterprise has completed all planning  designing  testing  and sampling activities that are necessary to establish that the product can be produced to meet its design specifications including functions  applications  and technical performance requirements 
the value assigned to these projects was determined using a discounted cash flow approach 
as of the acquisition date  significant development efforts were underway related to developing two new technologies 
both projects were finalized by the end of the additional cost to complete these projects totaled approximately million 
provision for income taxes our effective tax rate was in compared to in the reduction in tax rate is attributable to the adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  on december  the adoption eliminates goodwill amortization in calculating pre tax income 
because most of our goodwill amortization is nondeductible  the impact of implementing sfas no 
is a reduction in our effective tax rate 
the effective tax rate in exceeded the statutory federal income tax rate of primarily because of the impact of state income taxes and the nondeductible purchased iprd associated with our acquisition of eme  partially offset by the tax benefit attributable to export sales 
the impact of iprd on our effective tax rate was percentage points 
the effective tax rate in exceeded the statutory federal income tax rate primarily because of the impact of state income taxes and nondeductible amortization of goodwill  partially offset by the tax benefit attributable to export sales 
discontinued operations in the third quarter of  we decided to exit the patient monitoring business and divest our mde business unit 
we recorded a million million after tax charge to write down the value of mde 
mde  which was previously reported in the medical and surgical products segment  is now recorded as a discontinued operation in all years presented 
segment information respiratory technologies revenues increased to million 
this increase was a result of increased volume across all product lines as well as a weakening of the dollar against the euro 
also increasing revenues were sales of new products such as the vmax spectra  which was launched in late  and the orion cpap and hiox  both launched in in addition  viasys clinical services vcs  our clinical service business  had significant revenue gains 
operating income increased to million primarily due to increased gross profits on higher sales 
also contributing to the increase  were lower research and development expenses due to the movement of several large research projects  such as the vmax spectra  into commercialization in  and lower restructuring costs in offsetting these increases in operating income were increased selling  general and administrative expenses due to additional commissions on increased sales  higher insurance expense  and an increase in the provision for bad debts offset by the absence of goodwill amortization and lower incentive compensation expense 
critical care revenues increased to million 
this increase was driven by the acquisition of eme in the fourth quarter of and by sales of our new products  avea and vela  in the second half of in the case of avea  the sales were primarily to international distributors for use as demonstration equipment to solicit new orders 
in addition  we shipped a higher percentage of sales to lower price markets 
operating income decreased to million 
the decrease was due primarily to a larger percentage of our sales being made to lower price channels and write downs on excess and obsolete inventory 
these write downs were based on lower sales projections for certain older model products 
the decrease in operating income was also due to higher selling  general and administrative expenses due to the inclusion of eme expenses in the fourth quarter  increased insurance expense  and an increased provision for bad debts offset by the absence of goodwill amortization and lower incentive compensation in also contributing to the decrease in operating income were increased research and development expenses in the first three quarters of due to avea and vela 
neurocare revenues increased to million due to the introduction of several new products during including audera and audioscreener 
offsetting this increase was a decrease in sales to latin america  traditionally a strong market for the segment and a decrease in the sales of older product lines being replaced by audera and audioscreener 
operating income more than doubled in to million primarily due to lower selling  general and administrative expenses resulting from our restructuring efforts and the absence of goodwill amortization in in addition  our research and development expense decreased due to lower overhead expense attributable to the consolidation of research facilities in wisconsin 
in addition  we licensed technologies from third parties for two of our new products  as opposed to internally developing the technology 
medical and surgical products revenue from continuing operations decreased to million 
the decrease was due to a number of factors including lower sales of clean suits to a large semiconductor manufacturer 
the decrease was partially offset by increases in sales of enteral feeding tubes  other disposable medical products and orthopedic implants 
operating income increased to million as a result of restructuring efforts  as well as the absence of goodwill amortization in offsetting these factors were higher selling  general and administrative expenses due to increased insurance 
liquidity and capital resources cash generated from operating activities was million for our primary source of cash was net income of million and non cash charges totaling million 
also contributing to the increased cash was a reduction in inventory of million as a result of a reduction in our build to ship time  therefore requiring less inventory to be held 
cash flow was also positively impacted by increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses  which was offset by an increase in accounts receivable resulting from high december sales 
cash provided by investing activities was million for the cash provided was primarily attributable to the disposition of mde and thermedics 
cash expended for acquisitions in was million 
the payments made in included the installment payment for scimed of million and million for the working capital settlement and additional expenses for eme 
expenditures for the purchase of property  plant and equipment totaled million 
in addition  we purchased million of licenses and custom software used in our products 
net cash provided by financing activities consists primarily of million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock under the follow on offering completed in june and our stock option plans  partially offset by repayments of million under our revolving credit facility 
our consolidated working capital was million at january   compared to million at december  our cash and cash equivalents totaled million at january  and million at december  we currently have a three year  million revolving credit facility the facility with a syndicate of seven banks  which expires in may under the facility  there are options under which we can borrow funds that determine the interest rate charged 
these options include borrowings at libor plus a spread or at the prime rate plus a spread 
under the libor option  the interest rate depends on the term selected which can be no more than one year  and is fixed for that term 
under the prime rate option  the interest rate fluctuates based on the prime rate during the period which any amount is outstanding under that option 
in july  we repaid the full amount outstanding under the facility and no amount was outstanding at january  our ability to access the credit facility is dependent on complying with the debt covenants that are part of that agreement 
the covenants include a maximum ratio of debt to earnings before interest taxes and depreciation and amortization ebitda of  a minimum ratio of ebitda to interest expense of  maximum annual capital expenditures of million and a minimum level of stockholders equity 
we believe that the credit facility and cash flow from operations will generate capital resources sufficient to meet the capital requirements of our business for at least the next twelve months 
while we are currently in compliance with the debt covenants under the credit facility and expect to be able to meet the requirements in the future  failure to satisfy any of the conditions would require us to renegotiate the facility on terms that may not be as favorable and could require us to repay any outstanding principal balance 
our ability to maintain the existing credit facility or to obtain other debt or equity financing will depend on a number of factors  including market conditions  our operating performance and investor interest 
as a result  we cannot assure that we will have sufficient capital resources and we may be required to revise our business plan to reduce expenditures  including curtailment of our growth strategies  product development strategies and acquisition strategies 
beyond the next twelve months  our capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the rate of our sales growth  market acceptance of our new products  research and development spending  the success of our product development efforts  capital spending policies of our customers  government spending policies and general economic conditions 
our expected capital expenditures in are million 
although we are not a party to any binding agreement or letter of intent with respect to a potential material acquisition transaction  we may enter into acquisitions or strategic arrangements in the future that may require us to seek additional debt or equity financing 
contractual obligations the table below sets forth amounts due under the credit facility which expires in may  as well as purchase obligations and future minimum annual rentals attributable to noncancellable operating leases payment due dates thereafter total millions of dollars short term credit facility purchase obligations operating leases total contractual obligations relationship with former parent company in connection with the spin off distribution  we entered into a transition services agreement under which thermo electron s corporate staff provided us with certain administrative services 
in return  we paid thermo electron a fee equal to of our consolidated revenues for the period from november  through december   for the first quarter of and for the second quarter of  plus out of pocket and third party expenses 
we were party to a corporate services arrangement with thermo electron through november  under which thermo electron s corporate staff provided certain administrative services  including certain legal advice and services  risk management  certain employee benefit administration  tax advice and preparation of tax returns  centralized cash management and certain financial and other services  for which we have paid thermo electron annually an amount equal to of our consolidated revenues 
effective april  the fee under this agreement was reduced to through the spin off date 
for these services we were charged million in these amounts were recorded as selling  general and administrative expenses 
recent accounting pronouncements see note to the consolidated financial statements for a complete description of the effect of recent accounting pronouncements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates  which could affect our future results of operations and financial condition 
we manage our exposure to these risks through our regular operating and financing activities 
we generally view our investment in international subsidiaries with a functional currency other than our reporting currency as long term 
our investment in international subsidiaries is sensitive to fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
the functional currencies of our international subsidiaries are denominated principally in the euro  sterling and yen 
the effect of a change in currency exchange rates on our net investment in international subsidiaries is reflected in the accumulated other comprehensive income component of stockholder equity 
a reduction in year end functional currency exchange rates  relative to the us dollar  would result in a million reduction of stockholder equity 
our cash  cash equivalents and variable rate short term obligations are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
interest rate changes would result in a change in interest income and expense due to the difference between the current interest rates on cash  cash equivalents and the variable rate short term obligations and the rate that these financial instruments may adjust to in the future 
our market risk exposure for interest rates is immaterial
