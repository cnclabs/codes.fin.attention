unless otherwise indicated  all references to a year reflect our fiscal year that ends on december overview altiris is a leading provider of software products and services that enable organizations to manage it assets throughout their lifecycles 
our it lifecycle management solutions address the challenges of it deployment and migration  software delivery and operations management  inventory tracking and asset management  and server provisioning and management through scalable and integrated software products 
we have grown our revenue from million in to million in history and background we began operations in as the software division of keylabs  a privately held independent software quality and e commerce testing company 
in august  altiris  inc was spun out as a separate corporation and the stockholders and option holders of keylabs were issued shares of our common stock and options to purchase our common stock in proportion to their ownership interest in keylabs 
as part of this transaction  we purchased certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of the keylabs software division in exchange for a  promissory note 
this transaction was accounted for as a reorganization of entities under common control with the assets and liabilities recorded at carry over basis 
from inception through  our operations were primarily funded through borrowings and equity investments from the canopy group  inc  or canopy  a principal stockholder at the time 
through february  we had a revolving credit facility with canopy 
in february  we completed a private placement of preferred stock for net proceeds of million 
additionally  in february canopy exercised a warrant to purchase shares of our common stock for proceeds of million 
in may  we completed a private placement of  shares of our series c non voting preferred stock for net proceeds of million 
the series c non voting preferred stock subsequently converted into class b non voting common stock at the completion of our initial public offering 
in may of  we completed our initial public offering of  shares of common stock at a price per share of  with net proceeds  after underwriting discounts and commissions and direct offering costs  of approximately million 
the class b non voting common stock automatically converted into voting common stock in may in august  we completed a follow on public offering of  shares of our common stock and realized net proceeds from the offering of million 
our initial product development was focused on deployment and imaging 
in  we released our first migration product 
in september  we acquired substantially all of the assets of computing edge for total consideration of million  which added key components to our software and operations management  and inventory and asset management products 
in february  we acquired substantially all of the assets of tekworks for total consideration of million  which included key components of our helpdesk and problem resolution products that we had previously licensed from tekworks

in december  we acquired wise solutions  for total consideration of million  which added enterprise application packaging to our product offerings 
in march  we acquired fslogic inc  for total consideration of million  which file system layering technology that enhances our application management capabilities 

table of contents sources of revenue we derive the large majority of our revenue from sales of software licenses 
we sell our products through online sales and our direct sales force  as well as through indirect channels  such as distributors  vars  oems and systems integrators 
we also derive revenue from sales of annual upgrade protection  or aup  technical support arrangements  consulting and training services 
generally  we include the first year of aup with the initial license of our products 
after the initial aup term  the customer can renew aup on an annual basis 
the majority of our revenue has been generated in the united states 
revenue from customers outside of the united states accounted for of our total revenue in  of our total revenue in and of our total revenue in as of december   we had sales people located internationally in australia  belgium  france  germany  japan  the netherlands  singapore  sweden  switzerland and the united kingdom 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with statement of position  or sop  as modified by sop sop  as modified  which requires revenue earned on software arrangements involving multiple elements such as software products  aup  technical support  installation and training to be allocated to each element based on the relative fair values of the elements 
the fair value of an element must be based on vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe 
we establish vsoe based on the price charged when the same element is sold separately 
if vsoe of all undelivered elements exists but vsoe does not exist for one or more delivered elements  then revenue is recognized using the residual method 
under the residual method  the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the license fee is recognized as revenue 
license revenue we license our it lifecycle management products primarily under perpetual licenses 
we recognize revenue from licensing of software products to an end user when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists and the software product has been delivered to the customer  provided there are no uncertainties surrounding product acceptance  fees are fixed or determinable  and collectibility is probable 
for licenses where vsoe for aup and any other undelivered elements exists  license revenue is recognized upon delivery using the residual method 
for licensing of our software to oems  revenue is not recognized until the software is sold by the oem to an end user customer 
for licensing of our software through other indirect sales channels  revenue is recognized when the software is sold by the reseller  var or distributor to an end user customer 
we consider all arrangements with payment terms longer than our normal business practice  which do not extend beyond months  not to be fixed or determinable and revenue is recognized when the fee becomes due 
if collectibility is not considered probable for reasons other than extended payment terms  revenue is recognized when the fee is collected 
service arrangements are evaluated to determine whether the services are essential to the functionality of the software 
revenue is recognized using contract accounting for arrangements involving customization or modification of the software or where software services are considered essential to the functionality of the software 
revenue from these software arrangements is recognized using the percentage of completion method with progress to complete measured using labor cost inputs 
as of december   we had million of deferred revenue 
services revenue we derive services revenue primarily from aup  technical support arrangements  consulting  training and user training conferences 
aup and technical support revenue is recognized using the straight line method over the period that the aup or support is provided 
revenue from training arrangements or seminars and from consulting services is recognized as the services are performed or seminars are held 
critical accounting policies the policies discussed below are considered by us to be critical to an understanding of our financial statements 
the application of these policies places significant demands on the judgment of our management and  
table of contents when reporting financial results  cause us to rely on estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we describe specific risks related to these critical accounting policies below 
a summary of significant accounting policies can be found in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
regarding all of these policies  we caution that future results rarely develop exactly as forecast  and the best estimates routinely require adjustment 
our critical accounting policies include the following revenue recognition  allowances for doubtful accounts receivable and product returns  impairment of long lived assets  and valuation allowances against deferred income tax assets 
as described above  we recognize revenue in accordance with sop  as amended 
revenue recognition in accordance with sop can be complex due to the nature and variability of our sales transactions 
to continue recognizing software license revenue in the period in which we obtain persuasive evidence of an arrangement and deliver the software  we must have vsoe for each undelivered element 
if we do not continue to maintain vsoe for undelivered elements  we would be required to defer recognizing the software license revenue until the other elements are delivered  which could have a significant negative impact on our revenue 
additionally  the assessment that services are not essential to the functionality of the software may change depending on our mix between services and software products of future arrangements 
further implementation guidelines relating to sop and related modifications as well as new pronouncements may result in unanticipated changes in our revenue recognition practices and such changes could significantly affect our future revenues and results of operations 
we offer credit terms on the sale of our products to a significant majority of our customers and require no collateral from these customers 
we generally also provide a day return right 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable based upon our historical collection experience and expected collectibility of all accounts receivable 
we also maintain an allowance for estimated returns based on our historical experience 
revenue generated from operations in geographical locations where we do not yet have sufficient historical return experience is not recognized until the return right lapses 
our actual bad debts and returns may differ from our estimates and the difference could be significant 
in connection with the acquisitions of the assets of computing edge  tekworks  previo  wise solutions  and the carbon copy technology  we recorded million of intangible assets consisting of intellectual property  customer lists  core technology  trademark and trade name  non compete agreements  and goodwill 
trademark and trade name and goodwill have indefinite lives 
we evaluate goodwill for impairment  using a fair value based analysis  at least annually 
the identifiable intangible assets are generally amortized over the estimated useful lives ranging from months to years 
we evaluate our identifiable intangible assets  property and equipment and other long lived assets for impairment and assess their recoverability when changes in circumstances lead us to believe that any of our long lived assets may be impaired 
we assess recoverability by comparing the estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset to the asset s carrying amount 
if an impairment is indicated  the write down is measured as the difference between the carrying amount and the estimated discounted cash flow value 
during the year ended december   we determined that certain of the intangible assets were impaired as a result of competitor product releases and other changes in our operations 
as a result  we recorded a million impairment write down of intangible assets based on our estimates of future cash flows 
had different assumptions or criteria been used to evaluate and measure the impairment  the amount of the impairment write off could have been materially different than the million recorded 
we provided a valuation allowance of million and million against our entire net deferred tax assets as of december  and  respectively 
the valuation allowance was recorded given the losses we have incurred through december  and the uncertainties regarding our future operating profitability and taxable income 
had we assumed the net deferred tax asset was fully realizable  and released the valuation allowance  a deferred tax provision benefit of and million would have been recorded in and  respectively 
the remaining benefit associated with a release of valuation allowance would be attributable to stock option tax deductions and recorded as an increase to additional paid in capital 
we will continue to evaluate the evaluation allowance and in we may eliminate some or all of the valuation allowance if and as we continue to operate at a profit 

table of contents losses since inception and limited operating history we have incurred significant costs to develop our technology and products  to recruit and train personnel for our engineering  sales  marketing  professional services and administration departments  and to build and promote our brand 
as a result  we have incurred significant losses since our inception and had an accumulated deficit of million as of december our limited operating history makes the prediction of future operating results difficult 
we believe that period to period comparisons of operating results should not be relied upon to predict future performance 
our prospects must be considered in light of the risks  expenses and difficulties encountered by companies at an early stage of development  particularly companies in rapidly evolving markets 
we are subject to the risks of uncertainty of market acceptance and demand for our products and services  competition from larger  more established companies  short product life cycles  our ability to develop and bring to market new products on a timely basis  dependence on key employees  the ability to attract and retain additional qualified personnel and the ability to obtain adequate financing to support growth 
in addition  we have been dependent on a limited number of customers for a significant portion of our revenue 
we may not be successful in addressing these risks and difficulties 
dividends related to convertible preferred stock during the year ended december   we recorded preferred stock dividends in the amount of million representing the beneficial conversion feature related to the issuance of  shares of series b preferred stock and  shares of series c non voting preferred stock 
the amount of the beneficial conversion feature for the series b preferred stock was established at the date of issuance based on the difference between the sale or conversion price of per share and the estimated fair value of common shares on the date of issuance of per share 
the amount of the beneficial conversion feature for the series c non voting preferred stock was established at the date of issuance based on the difference between the sale or conversion price of per share and the estimated fair value of common shares on the date of issuance of per share

in december  the fasb issued a revision to interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  or finr 
finr clarifies the application of arb no 
 consolidated financial statements to certain entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support 
finr requires the consolidation of these entities  known as variable interest entities  by the primary beneficiary of the entity 
the primary beneficiary is the entity  if any  that will absorb a majority of the entities expected losses  receive a majority of the entity s expected residual returns  or both 
among other changes  the revisions of finr a clarified some requirements of the original fin  which had been issued in january  b eased some implementation problems  and c added new scope exceptions 
finr deferred the effective date of the interpretation for public companies  to the end of the first reporting period ending after march  under these guidelines  we will adopt finr in the first quarter of fiscal the adoption of this interpretation is not expected to have a material effect on our business  results of operations  financial position  or liquidity 
in november  the emerging issues task force  or eitf  reached a consensus on eitf no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
eitf no 
addresses certain aspects of the accounting by a vendor for arrangements under which the vendor will perform multiple revenue generating activities 
eitf no 
is effective for interim periods beginning after june  the adoption of this statement did not have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations 
factors that could affect future results set forth below and elsewhere in this annual report on form k  and in other documents we file with the sec  are risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward looking statements contained in this annual report on form k 
because of the following factors  as well as other variables affecting our operating results  past financial performance should not be considered a reliable indicator of future performance  and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods 
we have limited operating experience  have only recently become profitable and may not be able to maintain or increase our profitability 
if we cannot maintain or increase profitability  our stock price could decline 
we were incorporated in august and have a limited operating history  which makes it difficult to forecast our future operating results 
you should consider and evaluate our prospects in light of the risks and 
table of contents uncertainty frequently encountered by early stage companies in rapidly evolving markets 
although quarterly revenues have continued to increase in recent quarters  it was not until the fourth quarter of that we were profitable under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  or gaap  and we may not realize sufficient revenue to maintain or increase profitability in future periods 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we anticipate that our operating expenses will increase substantially in the foreseeable future as we continue to develop our technology and products  increase our services capabilities  expand our distribution channels  increase our sales and marketing activities  integrate acquired technologies  businesses and personnel  and expand our united states and international operations 
these efforts may prove more expensive than we currently anticipate and we may not succeed in increasing our revenue sufficiently to offset these higher expenses 
any failure to increase our revenue as we implement initiatives to grow our business could prevent us from maintaining or increasing profitability and  as a result  our stock price could decline 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis 
our quarterly operating results are difficult to predict  and if we do not meet quarterly financial expectations of securities analysts or investors  our stock price is likely to decline 
our quarterly revenue and operating results are difficult to predict and may fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
it is possible that our operating results in some quarters will be below market expectations 
if this happens  the market price of our common stock is likely to decline 
as a result  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our financial results are not necessarily meaningful  and you should not rely on them as an indication of our future performance 
fluctuations in our future quarterly operating results may be caused by many factors  including changes in demand for our products  the size  timing and contractual terms of orders for our products  any downturn in our customers and potential customers businesses  the domestic economy or international economies where our customers and potential customers do business  the timing of product releases or upgrades by us or by our competitors  any significant change in the competitive dynamics of our markets  including strategic alliances and consolidation among our competitors or our strategic partners  changes in the mix of revenue attributable to higher margin software products as opposed to substantially lower margin services  and changes in customers or partners businesses resulting from disruptions in the geopolitical environment including military conflict or acts of terrorism in the united states or elsewhere 
a significant portion of our software revenue in any quarter depends on orders booked and shipped in the last month  weeks or days of that quarter 
many of our customers are large businesses  and if an order from one of these large customers does not occur or is deferred  our revenue in that quarter could be substantially reduced  and we may be unable to proportionately reduce our operating expenses during a quarter in which this occurs 
our operating expenses are based on our expectations of future revenue and are relatively fixed in the short term 
we plan to increase our operating expenses 
if our revenue does not increase commensurate with those expenses  net income in a given quarter could be less than expected 
if microsoft successfully delivers expanded systems management software offerings that compete with our products or if the microsoft technologies upon which our products are dependent become incompatible with our products or lose market share  the demand for our microsoft based products would suffer 
microsoft has delivered expanded offerings in the systems management software market that compete with our products 
microsoft has also announced its intention to continue to deliver expanded offerings in the systems 
table of contents management software market that may compete with our products 
microsoft has substantially greater financial  technical and marketing resources  a larger customer base  a longer operating history  greater name recognition and more established relationships in the industry than we do 
if microsoft gains significant market share in the systems management market with competing products  our ability to achieve sufficient market penetration to grow our business may be impaired and the demand for our products would suffer 
in addition  the possible perception among our customers and potential customers that microsoft is going to be successful in marketing expanded systems management software offerings that compete with our products may delay their buying decisions and limit our ability to increase market penetration and grow our business 
in addition  many of our products are designed specifically for the windows platform and designed to use current microsoft technologies and standards  protocols and application programming interfaces 
although some of our products work on other platforms  such as unix  linux  macintosh and palm  we believe that the integration between our products and microsoft s products is one of our key competitive advantages 
if microsoft promotes technologies and standards  protocols and application programming interfaces that are incompatible with our technology  or promotes and supports existing or future products offered by our competitors that compete with our products  the demand for our products would suffer 
in addition  our business would be harmed if microsoft loses market share for its windows products 
we expect many of our products to be dependent on the windows market for the foreseeable future 
if the market for windows systems declines or develops more slowly than we anticipate  our ability to increase revenue could be limited 
although the market for windows systems has grown rapidly  this growth may not continue at the same rate  or at all 
we believe that some of our success has depended  and will continue to depend for the foreseeable future  on our ability to continue as a complementary software provider for microsoft s systems management server  or sms 
because we do not have any long term arrangements with microsoft  we cannot be certain that our relationship with microsoft will continue or expand 
any deterioration of our overall relationship with microsoft could materially harm our business and affect our ability to develop  market and sell our products 
any deterioration of our relationships with hp could adversely affect our ability to develop  market and sell our products and impair or eliminate a substantial revenue source 
we have generated a substantial portion of our revenue as a result of our relationships with hewlett packard company  or hp 
an important part of our operating results depends on our relationships with hp 
the loss of significant revenue from hp would negatively impact our results of operations 
hp accounted for approximately of our revenue in and approximately of our revenue in we have a license and distribution agreement with hp under which hp distributes our products to customers directly or through hp s distributors and resellers 
we also have an agreement with hp to develop and market an integrated product combining our server deployment and provisioning technology with hp servers 
if either of these agreements were terminated  our business would be harmed 
in addition  hp recently announced a number of acquisitions of software companies that offer products that compete or in the future may compete with some of our products 
if hp continues to expand its software offerings through acquiring companies in our market  our ability to expand our relationship with hp could be limited 
if our hp customer base perceives that such acquisitions adversely affect our relationship with hp  our ability to grow our hp customer business could be adversely affected 
any deterioration in our overall relationship with hp would harm our business and adversely affect our ability to develop  market and sell our products  grow our revenue or sustain profitability 
if we do not continue to execute on our relationship with dell  our ability to market and sell our products through dell will be limited and a substantial revenue source will be impaired or eliminated 
an important part of our future operating results will depend on our relationship with dell  inc  or dell 
the loss of significant revenue opportunities with dell could negatively impact our results of operations 
dell 
table of contents accounted for approximately of our revenue in and of our revenue in we have a software licensing agreement with dell under which dell has been granted a nonexclusive license to distribute certain of our software products and services to third parties 
any deterioration in our relationship with dell could adversely affect our ability to grow our business and impair a substantial revenue source 
we face strong competitors that have greater market share than we do and pre existing relationships with our potential customers  and if we are unable to compete effectively  we might not be able to achieve sufficient market penetration to sustain profitability 
the market for it lifecycle management products and services is rapidly evolving and highly competitive  and we expect competition in this market to persist and intensify 
for example  in recent periods  microsoft has expanded its product offerings in the systems management market and we expect microsoft to continue to expand its presence in this market 
we may not have the resources or expertise to compete successfully in the future 
many of our competitors have substantially greater financial  customer support  technical and marketing resources  larger customer bases  longer operating histories  greater name recognition and more established relationships in the industry than we do 
if our competitors maintain significant market share  we might not be able to achieve sufficient market penetration to grow our business  and our operating results could be harmed 
there has been consolidation in our markets  which we believe will continue and could lead to increased price competition and other forms of competition 
established companies such as hp and symantec have recently acquired companies that compete in our markets and may continue to acquire or establish cooperative relationships with our other competitors 
such established companies may also develop or expand upon their own systems management software 
in addition  we may face competition in the future from large established companies  as well as from emerging companies  that have not previously entered the market for it lifecycle management software or that currently do not have products that directly compete with our products 
it is also possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share 
we may not be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors  and this would impact our revenue adversely and cause our business to suffer 
in addition  existing and potential competitors could elect to bundle their products with  or incorporate systems management software into  products developed by themselves or others 
developers of software products with which our products must be compatible to operate could change their products so that they will no longer be compatible with our products 
if our competitors were to bundle their products in this manner or make their products incompatible with ours  this could harm our ability to sell our products and could lead to price reductions for our products  which would likely reduce our profit margins 
we have made and expect to continue to make acquisitions that could disrupt our operations and harm our operating results 
our growth is dependent on  among other things  market growth  our ability to enhance our existing products and our ability to introduce new products on a timely basis 
as part of our strategy  we intend to continue to make investments in or acquire complementary companies  product lines  technologies and personnel 
we have acquired and integrated technologies from hp  computing edge  fslogic  previo  tekworks and wise solutions 
acquisitions involve a number of difficulties and risks to our business  including  but not limited to  the following potential adverse effects on our operating results from increases in goodwill amortization  acquired in process technology  stock compensation expense  increased compensation expense resulting from newly hired employees  and other expenses associated with integrating new technologies  personnel and business operations  failure to integrate acquired technologies with our existing products and technologies  failure to integrate management information systems  personnel  research and development and marketing  sales and support operations  
table of contents potential loss of key employees from the acquired company  diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  disruption of our ongoing business  potential loss of the acquired company s customers  failure to realize the potential financial or strategic benefits of the acquisition  failure to successfully further develop the acquired company s technology  resulting in the impairment of amounts capitalized as intangible assets  diminishing the value of the altiris brand or reputation if an acquisition is not successful  and unanticipated costs and liabilities  including significant liabilities that may be hidden or not reflected in the final acquisition price 
acquisitions may also cause us to issue common stock that would dilute our current stockholders percentage ownership  assume liabilities  record goodwill and non amortizable intangible assets that would be subject to impairment testing on a regular basis and potential periodic impairment charges  incur amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets  incur large and immediate write offs  and restructuring and other related expenses  or become subject to litigation 
mergers and acquisitions of technology companies are inherently risky  and we cannot give any assurance that our previous or future acquisitions will be successful and will not materially adversely affect our business  operating results or financial condition 
if we fail to integrate successfully any future acquisitions  or the technologies associated with such acquisitions  into our company  the revenue and operating results of the combined company could decline 
any integration process will require significant time and resources  and we may not be able to manage the process successfully 
if our customers are uncertain about our ability to operate on a combined basis  they could delay or cancel orders for our products 
we may not successfully be able to evaluate or utilize the acquired technology and accurately forecast the financial impact of an acquisition transaction  including accounting charges 
even when an acquired company has already developed and marketed products  there can be no assurance that product enhancements will be made in a timely fashion or that preacquisition due diligence will have identified all possible issues that might arise with respect to such products or the technologies and intellectual property from which the products are derived 
additionally  we may have to incur debt or issue equity securities to pay for any future acquisition  either of which could affect the market price of our common stock 
the sale of additional equity or convertible debt could result in dilution to our stockholders 
the incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased fixed obligations and could also include covenants or other restrictions that would impede our ability to manage our operations 
if the market for it lifecycle management software does not continue to develop as we anticipate  the demand for our products might be adversely affected 
we believe that historically many companies have addressed their it lifecycle management needs for systems and applications internally and have only recently become aware of the benefits of third party software products such as ours as these needs have become more complex 
our future financial performance will depend in large part on the continued growth in the number of businesses adopting third party it lifecycle management software products and their deployment of these products on an enterprise wide basis 

table of contents if we do not expand our indirect distribution channels  we will have to rely more heavily on our direct sales force to develop our business  which could limit our ability to increase revenue and grow our business 
our ability to sell our products into new markets and to increase our penetration into existing markets will be impaired if we fail to expand our distribution channels and sales force 
our indirect sales channels generated approximately of our revenue in and approximately of our revenue in our sales strategy requires that we establish multiple indirect marketing channels in the united states and internationally through computer manufacturers  original equipment manufacturers  or oems  vars  systems integrators and distributors  and that we increase the number of customers licensing our products through these channels 
our ability to establish relationships with additional computer manufacturers will be adversely affected to the extent that computer manufacturers decide not to enter into relationships with us because of our existing relationships with other computer manufacturers with which they compete 
in addition  the establishment or expansion of our relationships with computer manufacturers may cause other computer manufacturers with which we have relationships to reduce the level of business they conduct with us or even terminate their relationships with us  either of which would adversely affect our revenue and our ability to grow our business 
moreover  our channel partners must market our products effectively and be qualified to provide timely and cost effective customer support and service  which requires us to provide proper training and technical support 
if our channel partners do not effectively market  sell and support our products or choose to place greater emphasis on products offered by our competitors  our ability to grow our business and sell our products will be negatively affected 
we plan to continue to expand our sales efforts worldwide and invest substantial resources toward this expansion 
despite these efforts  we may experience difficulty in recruiting and retaining qualified sales personnel 
because we rely heavily on our sales organizations  any failure to expand these organizations with qualified personnel could limit our ability to sell our products 
in addition  new sales personnel can require up to several months to begin to generate revenue from the sale of our products 
as a result  our operating results may be adversely affected to the extent we incur significant expenses on hiring and retaining new sales personnel who do not begin to generate revenue within several months or at all 
if our existing customers do not purchase additional licenses or renew annual upgrade protection  our sources of revenue might be limited to new customers and our ability to grow our business might be impaired 
historically  we have derived  and plan to continue to derive  a significant portion of our total revenue from existing customers who purchase additional products and renew annual upgrade protection  or aup 
sales to existing customers represented of our revenue in and of our revenue in if our customers do not purchase additional products or renew aup  our ability to increase or maintain revenue levels could be limited 
most of our current customers initially license a limited number of our products for use in a division of their enterprises 
we actively market to these customers to have them license additional products from us and increase their use of our products on an enterprise wide basis 
our customers may not license additional products and may not expand their use of our products throughout their enterprises 
in addition  as we deploy new versions of our products or introduce new products  our current customers may not require or desire the functionality of our new products and may not ultimately license these products 
we also depend on our installed customer base for future revenue from aup renewal fees 
the terms of our standard license arrangements provide for a one time license fee and a prepayment for one year of aup 
aup is renewable annually at the option of our customers and there are no minimum payment obligations or obligations to license additional software 
if we experience delays in developing our products  our ability to deliver product releases in a timely manner and meet customer expectations will be impaired 
we have experienced delays in developing new versions and updating releases of our products  including our recent release of the altiris infrastructure product  and may experience similar or more significant product delays in the future 
to date  none of these delays has materially harmed our business 
if we are unable  
table of contents for technological or other reasons  to develop and introduce new and improved products or enhanced versions of our existing products in a timely manner  our business and operating results could be harmed 
difficulties in product development  product localization or integration of acquired or licensed technologies could delay or prevent the successful introduction  marketing and delivery of new or improved products to our customers  damage our reputation in the marketplace and limit our growth 
if we fail to manage effectively the significant growth in our business  then our infrastructure  management and resources might be strained and our ability to manage our business could be diminished 
our historical growth has placed  and any further growth is likely to continue to place  a significant strain on our resources 
we have grown from employees on december  in two offices worldwide  to employees as of december  in offices worldwide 
to manage our continued growth and geographically dispersed organization  we expect to continue to expand or otherwise improve our internal systems  including our management information systems  customer relationship and support systems  and operating  administrative and financial systems and controls 
this effort may cause us to make significant capital expenditures or incur significant expenses  and divert the attention of management  sales  support and finance personnel from our core business operations  either of which may adversely affect our financial performance in one or more quarters 
moreover  our growth has resulted  and any future growth will result  in increased responsibilities of management personnel 
managing this growth will require substantial resources that we may not have or otherwise be able to obtain 
our failure to implement or maintain internal systems that enable us to effectively manage our growth  our financial results in any given period may be adversely impacted and our business and financial condition could be materially harmed 
our industry changes rapidly due to evolving technological standards  and our future success will depend on our ability to continue to meet the sophisticated and changing needs of our customers 
our future success will depend on our ability to address the increasingly sophisticated needs of our customers by supporting existing and emerging technologies  including technologies related to the development of windows and other operating systems generally 
if we do not enhance our products to meet these evolving needs  we may not remain competitive and be able to grow our business 
we will have to develop and introduce enhancements to our existing products and any new products on a timely basis to keep pace with technological developments  evolving industry standards  changing customer requirements and competitive products that may render existing products and services obsolete 
in addition  because our products are dependent upon windows and other operating systems  we will need to continue to respond to technological advances in these operating systems  including major revisions 
our position in the market for it lifecycle management software for windows and other systems and applications could be eroded rapidly by our competitors product advances 
consequently  the lifecycles of our products are difficult to estimate 
we expect that our product development efforts will continue to require substantial investments  and we may lack the necessary resources to make these investments on a timely basis 
our product sales cycles for large enterprise wide sales often last in excess of three months and are unpredictable and our product sales cycles for sales to large businesses are typically longer than the sales cycles to small businesses  both of which make it difficult to forecast our revenues and results of operations for any given period 
we have traditionally focused our sales efforts on the workgroups and divisions of our customers  resulting in a sales cycle ranging between and days or even longer 
we are continually increasing our efforts to generate enterprise wide sales  which often have sales cycles that extend beyond that experienced with sales to workgroups or divisions 
in addition  our sales to larger enterprises have increased in recent periods 
if we do not correctly forecast the timing of our sales in a given period  the amount of revenue we recognize in that period could be negatively impacted  which could negatively affect our operating results 
in addition  the failure to complete sales  especially large  enterprise wide sales  in a particular period could significantly reduce revenue in that period  as well as in subsequent periods over which revenue for the sale would likely be recognized 
the 
table of contents sales cycle associated with the purchase of our products is subject to a number of significant risks over which we have little or no control  including customers budgetary constraints and internal acceptance requirements and procedures  concerns about the introduction or announcement of our competitors new products  announcements by microsoft relating to windows  and potential downturns in the it market and in economic conditions generally 
errors in our products or product liability claims asserted against us could result in decreases in customers and revenue  unexpected expenses and loss of market share 
because our software products are complex  they may contain errors or bugs that can be detected at any point in a product s lifecycle 
while we continually test our products for errors and work with customers through our customer support services to identify and correct bugs  errors in our products may be found in the future even after our products have been commercially introduced 
detection of any significant errors may result in  among other things  loss of  or delay in  market acceptance and sales of our products  diversion of development resources  injury to our reputation  or increased service and warranty costs 
in the past  we have discovered errors in our products and have experienced delays in the shipment of our products during the period required to correct these errors 
product errors could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
moreover  because our products primarily support other systems and applications  such as windows  any software errors or bugs in the operating systems or applications may result in errors in the performance of our software  and it may be difficult or impossible to determine where the errors reside 
in addition  we may be subject to claims for damages related to product errors in the future 
while we carry insurance policies covering this type of liability  these policies may not provide sufficient protection should a claim be asserted 
a material product liability claim could harm our business  result in unexpected expenses and damage our reputation 
our license agreements with our customers typically contain provisions designed to limit exposure to potential product liability claims 
our standard software licenses provide that if our products fail to meet the designated standard  we will correct or replace such products or refund fees paid for such products 
our standard agreements in many jurisdictions also provide that we shall not be liable for indirect or consequential damages caused by the failure of our products 
however  such warranty and limitation of liability provisions are not effective under the laws of certain jurisdictions 
although no product liability suits have been filed to date  the sale and support of our products entails the risk of such claims 
unfavorable economic conditions and reductions in it spending could limit our ability to grow our business 
our business and operating results are subject to the effects of changes in general economic conditions 
although there are indications that economic conditions are improving  at least in the united states  we are still experiencing the effect of the recent severe downturn in the worldwide economy and we are uncertain as to future economic conditions 
this uncertainty persists because of the potential long term impact of terrorist attacks  such as the attacks on the united states on september   and the resulting military actions against terrorism 
in the future  concerns about global recession  war and additional acts of terrorism may continue to impact global economies negatively 
if these concerns continue or worsen  demand for our products and services may be reduced as a result of even further reduced spending on it products such as ours 
we are subject to risks inherent in doing business internationally that could impair our ability to expand into foreign markets 
sales to international customers represented approximately of our revenue in and approximately of our revenue in our international revenue is attributable principally to sales to customers in europe and asia pacific 
our international operations are  and any expanded international operations will be  subject to a 
table of contents variety of risks associated with conducting business internationally that could harm our business  including the following longer payment cycles  seasonal reductions in business activity during the summer months in europe and certain other parts of the world  increases in tariffs  duties  price controls or other restrictions on foreign currencies or trade barriers imposed by foreign countries  limited or unfavorable intellectual property protection in foreign countries  unfavorable laws that increase the risks of doing business in certain foreign countries  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  increased administrative expenses  the possible lack of financial and political stability in foreign countries that prevent overseas sales and growth  restrictions against repatriation of earnings from our international operations  potential adverse tax consequences  and difficulties in staffing and managing international operations  including the difficulty in managing a geographically dispersed workforce in compliance with diverse local laws and customs 
fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies could result in currency transaction losses 
as we expand our international operations  we expect that our international business will continue to be conducted in foreign currencies 
fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies relative to the united states dollar have caused  and we expect such fluctuations to continue to increasingly cause  currency transaction gains and losses 
we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations upon future quarterly and annual operating results 
we may experience currency losses in the future 
to date  we have not adopted a hedging program to protect us from risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations 
international political instability may increase our cost of doing business and disrupt our business 
increased international political instability  evidenced by the threat or occurrence of terrorist attacks  enhanced national security measures  sustained police or military action in afghanistan and iraq  strained international relations with north korea  tensions between taiwan and china  tensions between india and pakistan and other conflicts in the middle east and asia  may halt or hinder our ability to do business  increase our costs and adversely affect our stock price 
this increased instability may  for example  negatively impact the reliability and cost of transportation  negatively affect the desire of our employees and customers to travel  adversely affect our ability to obtain adequate insurance at reasonable rates or require us to take extra security precautions for our domestic and international operations 
in addition  this international political instability has had and may continue to have negative effects on financial markets  including significant price and volume fluctuations in securities markets 
if this international political instability continues or escalates  our business and results of operations could be harmed and the market price of our common stock could decline 
we rely on our intellectual property rights  and our inability to protect these rights could impair our competitive advantage  divert management attention  require additional development time and resources or cause us to incur substantial expense to enforce our rights  which could harm our ability to compete and generate revenue 
our success is dependent upon protecting our proprietary technology 
we rely primarily on a combination of copyright  patent  trade secret and trademark laws  as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights 
these laws  procedures and provisions provide only limited 
table of contents protection 
we currently own five patents 
however  our patents may not provide sufficiently broad protection or they may not prove to be enforceable in actions against alleged infringers 
in addition  patents may not be issued on our current or future technologies 
despite precautions that we take  it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy aspects of our current or future products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
in particular  we may provide our licensees with access to proprietary information underlying our licensed applications which they may improperly appropriate 
additionally  our competitors may independently design around patents and other proprietary rights we hold 
policing unauthorized use of software is difficult and some foreign laws do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as united states laws 
litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights  protect our trade secrets or determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others 
litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention 
if third parties assert that our products or technologies infringe their intellectual property rights  our reputation and ability to license or sell our products could be harmed 
in addition  these types of claims could be costly to defend and result in our loss of significant intellectual property rights 
we expect that software product developers  such as ourselves  will increasingly be subject to infringement claims  whether the claims have merit or not  as the number of products and competitors in the software industry segment grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps 
if third parties assert that our current or future products infringe their proprietary rights  there could be costs associated with defending these claims  whether the claims have merit or not  which could harm our business 
any future claims could harm our relationships with existing customers and may deter future customers from licensing our products 
in addition  in any potential dispute involving our intellectual property  our customers or distributors of our products could also become the target of litigation  which could trigger our indemnification obligations in certain of our license and service agreements 
any such claims  with or without merit  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation  including costs related to any damages we may owe resulting from such litigation  cause product shipment delays or result in loss of intellectual property rights which would require us to obtain licenses which may not be available on acceptable terms or at all 
if we are unable to retain key personnel  our ability to manage our business effectively and continue our growth could be negatively impacted 
our future success will depend to a significant extent on the continued service of our executive officers and certain other key employees 
of particular importance to our continued operations are our president and chief executive officer  greg butterfield  and our chief technology officer  dwain kinghorn 
none of our executive officers are bound by an employment agreement 
if we lose the services of one or more of our executive officers or key employees  or if one or more of them decide to join a competitor or otherwise compete directly or indirectly with us  our business could be harmed 
searching for replacements for our key personnel could divert management s time and result in increased operating expenses 
if we cannot continually attract and retain sufficient and qualified management  technical and other personnel  our ability to manage our business successfully and commercially introduce products could be negatively affected 
our future success will depend on our ability to attract and retain experienced  highly qualified management  technical  research and development  and sales and marketing personnel 
the development and sales of our products could be impacted negatively if we do not attract and retain these personnel 
competition for qualified personnel in the computer software industry is intense  and in the past we have experienced difficulty in recruiting qualified personnel  especially technical and sales personnel 
moreover  we intend to expand the scope of our international operations and these plans will require us to attract experienced management  sales  marketing and customer support personnel for our international offices 
we expect 
table of contents competition for qualified personnel to remain intense  and we may not succeed in attracting or retaining these personnel 
in addition  new employees generally require substantial training in the use of our products  which will require substantial resources and management attention 
future changes in accounting standards  particularly changes affecting revenue recognition and accounting for stock options  could cause unexpected revenue fluctuations 
future changes in accounting standards  particularly changes affecting revenue recognition and accounting for stock options  could require us to change our accounting policies 
these changes could cause deferment of revenue recognized in current periods to subsequent periods or accelerate recognition of deferred revenue to current periods  each of which could cause shortfalls in meeting securities analysts and investors expectations 
any of these shortfalls could cause a decline in our stock price 
since our inception  we have used stock options and other long term equity incentives as a fundamental component of our employee compensation packages 
we believe that stock options and other long term equity incentives directly motivate our employees to maximize long term stockholder value and  through the use of vesting  encourage employees to remain with altiris 
the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  among other agencies and entities  is currently considering changes to gaap that  if implemented  would require us to record an additional charge to earnings for employee stock option grants 
this proposal would negatively impact our earnings 
for example  recording charges for employee stock options under sfas  accounting for stock based compensation would have increased our net loss by million in and by million in in addition  new regulations proposed by the nasdaq national market requiring stockholder approval in connection with stock option plans could make it more difficult for us to provide stock options to employees in the future 
to the extent that new regulations make it more difficult or expensive to grant options to employees  we may incur increased accounting compensation costs  change our equity compensation strategy or find it difficult to attract  retain and motivate employees  each of which could materially and adversely affect our business 
our principal stockholders may exercise significant influence over our business affairs and may make business decisions with which you disagree and which may adversely affect the value of your investment 
our principal stockholders  three entities affiliated with technology crossover ventures  or tcv  and canopy  respectively  beneficially own approximately and of our common stock and may exercise significant influence over most matters requiring approval by our stockholders  including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions 
this concentration of ownership may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of our company or discouraging others from making tender offers for our shares  which could prevent our stockholders from receiving a premium for their shares 
these actions may be taken even if they are opposed by the other stockholders

we have implemented anti takeover provisions that could make it more difficult to acquire us 
our certificate of incorporation  our bylaws and delaware law and our agreements with hp contain provisions that may inhibit potential acquisition bids for us and prevent changes in our management

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio and have no foreign exchange contracts 
our financial instruments consist of cash and marketable securities  trade accounts receivable  accounts payable and short and long term obligations 
we consider investments in highly liquid instruments purchased with an original maturity of days or less to be cash equivalents 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our short and long term obligations 
thus  fluctuations in interest rates would not have a material impact on the fair value of these securities 
our business is principally transacted in united states dollars 
during the year ended december   approximately of the us dollar value of our invoices were denominated in currencies other than the united states dollar 
accordingly  we are subject to exposure from adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
this exposure is primarily related to local currency denominated revenue and operating expenses in australia  france  germany  the netherlands  singapore  sweden  and the united kingdom 
we believe that a natural hedge exists in local currencies  as local currency denominated revenue will substantially offset the local currency denominated operating expenses 
we will continue to assess our need to hedge currency exposures on an ongoing basis 
however  as of december   we had no hedging contracts outstanding 
at december   we had million in cash and available for sale securities 
a hypothetical increase or decrease in interest rates would not have a material impact on our results of operations  or the fair market value or cash flows of these instruments
