critical accounting policies the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates that effect the amounts reported and disclosed in the consolidated financial statements 
by their nature  these estimates are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
theses estimates are based on our experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable in the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates 
however  actual results could differ from those estimates 
our significant accounting policies are included in note to our consolidated financial statements 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
property and equipment we have significant capital invested in our property and equipment  which represents approximately of our total assets 
we utilize our judgment in various ways including determining whether an expenditure is considered a maintenance expense or a capital asset  determining the estimated useful lives of assets  and determining if or when an asset has been impaired 
our property and equipment is evaluated for impairment whenever circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use 
if the sum of the expected future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges is less than the carrying amount  we recognize an impairment loss 
the impairment loss recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value and is charged to operations in the period in which such impairment is determined by management 
we do not believe that any impairment has occurred or is likely to occur in the near future 
regulation our business can be materially impacted both positively and negatively by legislative and regulatory changes  such as those previously described 
significant negative changes resulting from these activities could result in an impairment of our property and equipment in accordance with generally accepted accounting standards 
additional information regarding how our business can be impacted by legislative and regulatory changes are included in item vi  and item vii  respectively  in this form k
