item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis presents the factors that had a material effect on amo s cash flows and results of operations during each of the three years in the period ended december   and the company s financial position at that date 
except for the historical information contained herein  the following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risk and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that might cause such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed in the subsection entitled certain factors and trends affecting amo and its businesses 
this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the historical consolidated financial statements of amo and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this form k 
overview we are a global leader in the development  manufacture and marketing of medical devices for the eye and contact lens care products 
our products in the ophthalmic surgical market include intraocular lenses  phacoemulsification systems  viscoelastics and surgical packs used in cataract surgery  and microkeratomes used in refractive surgery 
our eye care products include disinfecting solutions to destroy harmful microorganisms in and on the surface of contact lenses  daily cleaners to remove undesirable film and deposits from contact lenses  enzymatic cleaners to remove protein deposits from contact lenses and lens rewetting drops to provide added wearing comfort 
we have operations in approximately countries and sell our products in approximately countries and have organized our operations into three regions americas north and south america  europe  africa and asia pacific excluding japan  but including australia and new zealand  and japan 
separation from allergan allergan spun off its existing optical medical device business by contributing all of the assets related to the two business lines that comprise the optical medical device business to us and distributing all of our outstanding shares of common stock to its stockholders 
we had no material assets  liabilities or activities as a separate corporate entity until allergan s contribution to us of the optical medical device business 
the contribution of assets and distribution to allergan stockholders was completed on june  as a result of the spin off  we are an independent public company and allergan no longer maintains any stock ownership in us 
allergan did not account for our business on the basis of separate legal entities  subsidiaries  divisions or segments 
the accompanying consolidated financial statements for the years ended december  through june  and december  include those revenues and expenses directly attributable to our operations and allocations of certain allergan corporate expenses 
these amounts have been allocated on a basis that was considered by allergan management to reflect most fairly or reasonably the utilization of the services provided to us or the benefit obtained by us 
all material intercompany balances have been eliminated 
the financial information included herein does not necessarily reflect what the results of our operations would have been had we operated as a stand alone public entity during all pre spin off periods presented  and may not be indicative of our future operations 
prior to the spin off  we participated in various allergan administered functions including shared services surrounding selling  general and administrative expenses  retirement and other post retirement benefit plans  income taxes and cash management 
our allocated portion of the expenses for these services are included in selling  general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of operations 
for the years ended december  through june  and  these allocated expenses were million  and million  respectively 
prior to the spin off  our income had been included in consolidated income tax returns filed by allergan  and most of the related income taxes had been paid by allergan 
allergan had managed its tax position for the benefit of its entire portfolio of businesses 
allergan s tax methodologies and elections are not necessarily reflective of the tax methodologies and elections that we would have followed or follow as a stand alone company 
our income tax expense has been recorded as if we filed tax returns separate from allergan 
prior to the spin off  we entered into several agreements with allergan in connection with  among other things  transitional services  employee matters  manufacturing and tax sharing 
the transitional services agreement set forth charges generally intended to allow allergan to fully recover the allocated costs of providing certain services  plus all out of pocket costs and expenses  except that we paid to allergan a commission related to our products that were sold by them during the transition period 
we recovered costs from allergan in a similar manner for services provided by us 
all transitional services with the exception of limited facility leases terminated in june under the manufacturing agreement  allergan manufactures certain of our eye care products and vitrax viscoelastics for a period of up to three years from the date of the spin off 
we purchase these products from allergan at a price equal to allergan s fully allocated costs plus 
during and subsequent to the spin off  we purchased million and million  respectively  of product from allergan 
on an annual basis  a pricing true up calculation is to be performed during the first calendar quarter 
this true up calculation is based upon the actual volume of products shipped by allergan to us during the preceding year versus the forecasted volume submitted by us that was used to calculate the invoiced prices 
during the year  we periodically review the volume of purchases and accrue for estimated shortfalls  if any 
in march  we received a payment of million from allergan based upon the true up calculation for the period subsequent to the spin off through december  this payment has been recorded as a credit to cost of sales in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations 
we are currently transitioning to our own manufacturing facilities 
if we are unable to obtain regulatory approvals for new facilities or locate and obtain regulatory approvals for third party manufacturers to produce our products in a timely fashion  our business may be negatively impacted 
the tax sharing agreement governs allergan s and our respective rights  responsibilities and obligations with respect to taxes for any tax period ending before  on or after the spin off 
generally  allergan is liable for all pre spin off taxes except that we will indemnify allergan for all pre spin off taxes attributable to our business for in addition  the tax sharing agreement provides that allergan is liable for taxes that are incurred as a result of restructuring activities undertaken to effectuate the spin off 
we and allergan have made representations to each other and to the internal revenue service in connection with the private letter ruling that allergan has received regarding the tax free nature of the spin off of our common stock by allergan to its stockholders 
if either we or allergan breach our representations to each other or to the internal revenue service  or if we or allergan take or fail to take  as the case may be  actions that result in the spin off failing to meet the requirements of a tax free spin off pursuant to section of the internal revenue code  the party in breach will indemnify the other party for any and all resulting taxes 
critical accounting policies and estimates revenue and accounts receivable we recognize revenue from product sales when title and risk of loss transfers  delivery has occurred  the price to the buyer is determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured  with the exception of intraocular lenses distributed on a consignment basis  which are recognized as revenue upon notification of implantation in a patient and fulfillment of the other revenue recognition criteria 
we generally permit returns of product from a customer if the product is returned in a timely manner  in good condition  and through the normal channels of distribution 
return policies in certain international markets can be more stringent and are based on the terms of contractual agreements with customers 
allowances for returns are provided for based upon an analysis of our historical patterns of returns matched against the sales from which they originated 
historically  product returns have been within the amounts reserved 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is determined by analyzing specific customer accounts and assessing the risk of uncollectibility based on insolvency  disputes or other collection issues 
in addition  we routinely analyze the different receivable aging categories and establish allowances based on the length of time receivables are past due 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of first in  first out cost or market 
on a regular basis  we evaluate inventory balances for excess quantities and obsolescence by analyzing estimated demand  inventory on hand  sales levels and other information 
based on these evaluations  inventory balances are reduced  if necessary 
impairment of long lived assets on january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  whereby goodwill is no longer amortized  but instead is subject to a periodic impairment review 
as our operations are comprised of four reporting units  we review the recoverability of our goodwill by comparing each reporting unit s fair value to the net book value of its assets 
if the book value of the reporting unit s assets exceeds its fair value  the goodwill is written down to its implied fair value 
additionally  we review the carrying amounts of goodwill and other intangibles whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
impairment indicators include  among other conditions  cash flow deficits  historic or anticipated declines in revenue or operating profit and adverse legal or regulatory developments 
if it is determined that such indicators are present and the review indicates that the assets will not be fully recoverable  based upon undiscounted estimated cash flows over the remaining amortization periods  their carrying values are reduced to estimated fair market value 
estimated fair market value is determined primarily using the anticipated cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved 
for the purposes of identifying and measuring impairment  long lived assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities 
deferred taxes we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method  whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
we evaluate the need to establish a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets based upon the amount of existing temporary differences  the period in which they are expected to be recovered and expected levels of taxable income 
a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets is established when it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
stock based compensation we measure stock based compensation for option grants to employees and members of the board of directors using the intrinsic value method 
comparing fiscal years ended december   and net sales 
the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  net sales by major product line 
year ended december  in thousands ophthalmic surgical eye care total net sales us international excluding us net sales for increased by million  or  to million in from million in the increase in compared to was the result of increased sales in both product lines and favorable currency changes 
foreign currency fluctuations in increased sales by million  or  as compared to average rates in effect in global sales of our ophthalmic surgical products increased by million  or  from to sales of our ophthalmic surgical products in the united states increased million  or  between and  primarily due to sales of the sovereign compact with whitestar phacoemulsification system and the higher growth associated with the sensar acrylic intraocular lens 
international sales of our ophthalmic surgical products increased by million  or  between and  primarily due to sales increases in phacoemulsification products and the sensar acrylic intraocular lens and favorable foreign currency changes 
foreign currency fluctuations in increased international ophthalmic surgical sales by million  or  as compared to average rates in effect in we believe that global sales of ophthalmic surgical products will continue to grow due to increased sales of our sovereign compact with whitestar phacoemulsification system and the sensar and the clariflex intraocular lenses  both with the optiedge design 
global sales of our eye care products increased by million  or  from to sales of our eye care products in the united states decreased by million  or  between and  primarily due to lower sales of private label eye care products 
international sales of our eye care products increased by million  or  between and  primarily due to an increase in sales of our complete branded products and favorable currency changes 
foreign currency fluctuations in increased international eye care sales by million  or  as compared to average rates in effect in in the future  we expect global sales of our eye care products will continue to grow due to increased sales of our complete branded products and continued sales growth in europe and japan 
net sales for decreased by million  or  to million in from million in the decrease in net sales in compared to was the result of a decrease in sales of our private label eye care products partially offset by an increase in sales of our ophthalmic surgical products 
foreign currency fluctuations in increased sales by million  or  as compared to average rates in effect in global sales of our ophthalmic surgical products increased by million  or  from to sales of our ophthalmic surgical products in the united states increased million  or  between and  primarily due to growing acceptance of the sovereign with whitestar technology  our technologically advanced phacoemulsification system  and the higher growth associated with the sensar acrylic intraocular lens 
international sales of our ophthalmic surgical products increased by million  or  between and primarily due to sales increases in phacoemulsification products and the sensar acrylic intraocular lens and favorable foreign currency changes  which were partially offset by a sales decrease in silicone intraocular lenses 
foreign currency fluctuations in increased international ophthalmic surgical sales by million  or  as compared to average rates in effect in global sales of our eye care products decreased by million  or  from to sales of our eye care products in the united states decreased million  or  between and  primarily due to management s decision to exit the lower margin sales of private label eye care products

income and expenses 
the following table sets forth certain statement of operations items as a percentage of net sales year ended december  net sales cost of sales gross margin other operating costs and expenses selling  general and administrative research and development operating income interest expense loss on investments  net unrealized loss gain on derivative instruments other non operating expense  net earnings before income taxes net earnings gross margin 
our gross margin percentage remained relatively constant in as compared to and increased as a percent of net sales by percentage points from in to in in  we expect our eye care product gross margin percentage to be unfavorably impacted by higher costs of product supplied by allergan and pre production costs incurred at our manufacturing facility in spain 
the increase in gross margin as a percent of net sales in as compared to was primarily the result of decreased sales of low margin private label products and a change in product sales mix to higher margin surgical products  including the sensar and clariflex intraocular lenses 
our gross margin in was negatively impacted by the june write off of million of inventory deemed unusable due to our spin off from allergan 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased as a percent of net sales by percentage points to in from in this increase was primarily the result of increased sales and marketing efforts in the global eye care business and incremental costs associated with running an independent public company 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased as a percent of net sales by percentage points to in from in this increase was the result of increased general and administrative expenses incurred in preparation for the spin off and as we began operations as an independent public company partially offset by lower selling expenses and a reduction in goodwill amortization of million 
additionally  we increased our allowance for doubtful accounts by million and million in and  respectively  primarily as a result of deterioration in the aging of certain customer accounts in europe 
research and development 
research and development expenses increased as a percent of net sales by percentage points to in from in and by percentage points to in from in research and development spending increased as a result of an increase in spending for research efforts in both the ophthalmic surgical business and the eye care business 
our investment in research and development yielded new products in  such as our new sovereign compact phacoemulsification system and our next generation multi purpose solution  complete moistureplus 
in  we expect to bring to market our new vitreal retinal system  amo gemini  and next generation microkeratome in europe  our next generation multi functional array intraocular lens  a capsular tension ring in the us and an advanced formulation of our blink contact lens rewetter 
non operating expense 
interest expense was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
interest expense increased million in compared with primarily due to the debt incurred just prior to the spin off 
in addition  interest expense includes aggregate costs of million comprised of the pro rata write off of debt issuance costs and original issue discount of million and recognition of a pro rata portion of net realized gains on interest rate swaps of million associated with the prepayment of the term loan in june  the consummation of the modified dutch auction tender offer for million aggregate principal amount of senior subordinated notes in july and the repurchase of an additional million aggregate principal amount of senior subordinated notes in september we expect interest expense to be lower in as compared to due to a lower average debt level and a lower weighted average interest rate 
interest expense increased million in compared with primarily due to the million of debt incurred just prior to the spin off 
loss on investments is comprised of a million and a million charge for the permanent impairment of equity investments in and  respectively 
we recorded an unrealized loss on derivative instruments of million in compared to an unrealized loss of million in and an unrealized gain of million in we record as unrealized loss gain on derivative instruments the mark to market adjustments on the outstanding foreign currency options which we entered into or were allocated as part of allergan s overall risk management strategy to reduce the volatility of expected earnings in currencies other than the us dollar 
other non operating expense in includes early debt extinguishment costs of million associated with the tender offer and repurchase of senior subordinated notes partially offset by foreign exchange gains and interest income 
other non operating expense in includes early debt extinguishment costs of million associated with the prepayment of debt in japan in june income taxes 
the effective tax rate in was  as compared to in the decrease in was primarily attributable to the utilization of foreign tax credits 
our future effective income tax rate will vary depending on our mix of domestic and international taxable income or loss and the various tax and treasury methodologies that we implement  including our policy regarding repatriation of future accumulated foreign earnings 
we expect our effective tax rate to be in the mid to high percent range in due to improved supply chain tax efficiencies 
our effective tax rate in was  up from the effective tax rate in the increase in was primarily attributable to the provision of us federal and state income taxes and foreign withholding taxes on the portion of undistributed earnings of non us subsidiaries expected to be remitted  which was not provided for in the prior year 
effective june   income taxes are provided on taxable income at the statutory rates applicable to such income 
in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 
 accounting by a company for the income tax effects of transactions among or with its shareholders under fasb statement no 
 we established deferred tax assets of approximately million as of december  through a credit to equity for all differences resulting from the spin off in the financial reporting and tax bases of certain assets and liabilities 
these differences occurred in jurisdictions where the transfer of assets and liabilities to us in the spin off was deemed to be a taxable transaction 
in such situations  the tax bases were adjusted to reflect the fair market value of the assets and liabilities on the spin off date whereas the financial reporting bases were unchanged 
as a result of an improvement in profitability in japan in  we were able to utilize million of our net operating loss carryforward benefit to offset taxes currently payable and realize the benefits associated with million of deferred tax assets in japan  for which we previously had established a valuation allowance 
previously  management did not believe that realization of these benefits was more likely than not  and had provided a million valuation allowance for these deferred tax assets in prior years 
in  we determined  based solely on our judgment  that realization of the deferred tax assets of million had become more likely than not and  accordingly  we reversed the valuation allowance previously established 
as a result of the realization of these deferred tax assets  our valuation allowance on deferred tax assets and our income tax expense were reduced  and our net earnings were increased  by approximately million in we do not anticipate that our future provision for income taxes will include tax benefits similar to those recognized in seasonality 
traditionally  we have realized a seasonal trend in our sales and net earnings  with the smallest portion of our ophthalmic surgical sales being realized in the first quarter and with sales gradually increasing from the second to fourth quarter 
we believe sales of our ophthalmic surgical products are comparatively higher in the fourth quarter because hospitals  ambulatory surgical centers and other customers increase spending as they reach their year end and are able to spend the remainder of their annual budgeted amounts 
liquidity and capital resources management assesses our liquidity by our ability to generate cash to fund operations 
significant factors in the management of liquidity are funds generated by operations  levels of accounts receivable  inventories  accounts payable and capital expenditures  adequate lines of credit  and financial flexibility to attract long term capital on satisfactory terms 
as of december   we had cash and equivalents of million 
historically  we have generated cash from operations in excess of working capital requirements  and we expect to do so in the future 
net cash provided by operating activities in was million compared to million in and million in operating cash flow decreased in compared to primarily as a result of lower net earnings due to the additional costs of our operations as an independent company  the early debt extinguishment costs discussed above and a decrease in accounts payable 
cash provided by operating activities may fluctuate in future periods as a result of a number of factors  including fluctuations in our operating results  accounts receivable collections  inventory management  and the timing of tax and other payments 
in february  the company received approximately million from allergan 
this payment ended a dispute between us and allergan regarding the ownership of a certain value added tax receivable due from france 
as part of the settlement with allergan  we will be responsible for paying penalties and expenses associated with the receivable  which are expected to be less than million 
during  we expect to increase eye care inventory levels in preparation for our transition away from allergan as a supplier of certain eye care products  which will unfavorably impact operating cash flow 
operating cash flow increased in compared to primarily as a result of improved management of inventory and an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses and other liabilities  partially offset by lower net earnings 
net cash used in investing activities was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
in november  we completed the purchase of an existing manufacturing facility in madrid  spain 
we financed the approximately million purchase of this facility with available cash and borrowings under our senior credit facility 
expenditures for property  plant and equipment totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the decrease in expenditures in as compared to is primarily due to the large amount of improvements to our leased headquarters during the expenditures were primarily comprised of improvements to our leased headquarters and also include expansion of manufacturing facilities and a variety of other projects designed to improve productivity 
we expect to invest approximately million to million in property  plant and equipment in expenditures for demonstration demo and bundled equipment  primarily phacoemulsification and microkeratome surgical equipment  were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
we maintain demo and bundled equipment to facilitate future sales of similar equipment and related products to our customers 
we expect to invest approximately million to million in demo and bundled equipment in expenditures for capitalized internal use software were million  million and million  and  respectively 
we capitalize internal use software costs after technical feasibility has been established 
we expect to invest approximately million to million in capitalized software in net cash used in financing activities was million in  which was primarily comprised of million of long term debt borrowings and million from the sale of stock to employees reduced by long term debt repayments of million and financing related costs of million 
net cash used in financing activities was million in  which was comprised of million of long term debt borrowings and million of net proceeds from the settlement of an interest rate swap offset by long term debt repayments of million  financing related costs of million and million of net distributions to allergan 
a majority of cash generated from operations prior to june  was transferred to allergan 
net transfers to allergan ceased as of june  as a result of the spin off 
net cash used in financing activities was million in  which was comprised of million in distributions to allergan  net of advances  and million in net repayments of debt 
as of the spin off date  we incurred million of debt 
we used approximately million of the proceeds to repay indebtedness borrowed from allergan to purchase various assets from allergan  make a distribution to allergan in exchange for various assets contributed to us and repay a portion of allergan s debt assumed by us in connection with the spin off 
as of december   we had repaid million of this debt through cash from operations and new borrowings 
in june  we amended and restated our senior credit facility to retire the original million term loan  and increase the senior revolving credit facility from million to million 
the amended and restated senior credit facility matures on june  as of december   we had no borrowings outstanding under this senior credit facility 
additionally  in june  we consummated the offering of million of convertible senior subordinated notes due a majority of the proceeds from this offering were used to consummate our modified dutch auction tender offer for million aggregate principal amount of our senior subordinated notes in july in september  we repurchased an additional million aggregate principal amount of senior subordinated notes 
as a result of the tender offer and the repurchase of the senior subordinated notes  we recorded an aggregate charge of approximately million for the premium paid on the notes and for the write off of the pro rata portion of capitalized debt related costs 
the senior credit facility provides that we will maintain certain financial and operating covenants which include  among other provisions  maintaining specific leverage and interest coverage ratios 
certain covenants under the senior credit facility and the indenture relating to the senior subordinated notes also limit the incurrence of additional indebtedness 
the senior credit facility prohibits cash dividend payments 
we were in compliance with these covenants at december  our cash position includes amounts denominated in foreign currencies  and the repatriation of those cash balances from some of our non us subsidiaries may result in additional tax costs 
however  these cash balances are generally available without legal restriction to fund ordinary business operations 
we believe that the net cash provided by our operating activities  supplemented as necessary with borrowings available under our revolving credit facility and existing cash and equivalents  will provide sufficient resources to meet our working capital requirements  debt service and other cash needs over the next year 
we are dependent  in part  upon the reimbursement policies of government and private health insurance companies 
government and private sector initiatives to limit the growth of health care costs  including price regulation and competitive pricing  are continuing in many countries where we do business 
as a result of these changes  the marketplace has placed increased emphasis on the delivery of more cost effective medical therapies 
while we have been unaware of significant price resistance resulting from the trend toward cost containment  changes in reimbursement policies and other reimbursement methodologies and payment levels could have an adverse effect on our pricing flexibility 
additionally  the current trend among hospitals and other customers of medical device manufacturers is to consolidate into larger purchasing groups to enhance purchasing power 
the enhanced purchasing power of these larger customers may also increase the pressure on product pricing  although we are unable to estimate the potential impact at this time 
inflation 
although at reduced levels in recent years  inflation continues to apply upward pressure on the cost of goods and services used by us 
the competitive and regulatory environments in many markets limit our ability to fully recover these higher costs through increased selling prices 
we continually seek to mitigate the adverse effects of inflation through cost containment and improved productivity and manufacturing processes 
foreign currency fluctuations 
approximately  and of our revenues in the years ended december   and  respectively  were derived from operations outside the united states  and a significant portion of our cost structure is denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
therefore  we are subject to fluctuations in sales and earnings reported in us dollars as a result of changing currency exchange rates 
the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on sales was a million and million increase in and  respectively  and a million decrease in the sales increase in and was due primarily to a strengthening of the japanese yen and euro versus the us dollar 
the sales decrease in was due primarily to a weakening of the japanese yen and european currencies

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we routinely monitor our risks associated with fluctuations in currency exchange rates and interest rates 
we address these risks through controlled risk management that may include the use of derivative financial instruments to economically hedge or reduce these exposures 
we do not expect to enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
for all periods presented through june   we were considered in allergan s overall risk management strategy 
as part of this strategy  allergan managed its risks based on management s judgment of the appropriate trade off between risk  opportunity and costs 
with respect to our risks  allergan primarily utilized foreign currency option and forward contracts to economically hedge or reduce these exposures 
given the inherent limitations of forecasting and the anticipatory nature of the exposures intended to be hedged  there can be no assurance that such programs will offset more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable movements in either interest or foreign exchange rates 
in addition  the timing of the accounting for recognition of gains and losses related to mark to market instruments for any given period may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the underlying economic exposures and  therefore  may adversely affect our operating results and financial position 
to ensure the adequacy and effectiveness of our interest rate and foreign exchange hedge positions  we continually monitor  from an accounting and economic perspective  our interest rate swap positions and foreign exchange forward and option positions  when applicable  both on a stand alone basis and in conjunction with our underlying interest rate and foreign currency exposures 
interest rate risk 
our million of fixed rate debt is comprised solely of domestic borrowings  and our million of variable rate debt is comprised of borrowings in japan 
thus  our interest expense will fluctuate with rate changes in japan 
we had previously entered into various interest rate swap agreements  which effectively converted the interest rate on million of the senior subordinated notes from a fixed to a floating rate and converted the interest rate on million of term loan borrowings from a floating to a fixed rate 
the interest rate swaps had maturity dates beginning in and qualified as either fair value or cash flow hedges 
changes in fair value of the interest rate swap agreement qualifying as a cash flow hedge were recorded in other comprehensive income to the extent such changes were effective and as long as the cash flow hedge requirements were met 
in may and october  we realized the value of the interest rate swaps qualifying as fair value hedges 
we received an aggregate of approximately million  of which approximately million represented the net settlement of the accrued but unpaid amount between us and the swap counterparties 
the remaining amount of approximately million was recorded as an adjustment to the carrying amount of the senior subordinated notes as a premium and is amortized over the remaining life of the notes 
at december   after recognizing a pro rata portion of the gain upon repurchase of a portion of the notes  the unamortized gain on these interest rate swaps was million 
in may  we terminated the interest rate swap qualifying as a cash flow hedge 
we paid approximately million and included the related loss of approximately million as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income 
as a result of the prepayment of the term loan in june  the loss on the interest rate swap was fully recognized as interest expense

overall  we are a net recipient of currencies other than the us dollar and  as such  we benefit from a weaker dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger us dollar relative to major currencies worldwide 
accordingly  changes in exchange rates  and in particular a strengthening of the us dollar  may negatively affect our consolidated net sales and gross profit as expressed in us dollars 
we may enter into foreign exchange option and forward contracts to reduce earnings and cash flow volatility associated with foreign exchange rate changes to allow management to focus its attention on its core business issues and challenges 
accordingly  we enter into contracts which change in value as foreign exchange rates change to economically offset the effect of changes in value of foreign currency assets and liabilities  commitments and anticipated foreign currency denominated sales and operating expenses 
we enter into foreign exchange option and forward contracts in amounts between minimum and maximum anticipated foreign exchange exposures  generally for periods not to exceed one year 
we use foreign currency option contracts  which provide for the sale of foreign currencies to offset foreign currency exposures expected to arise in the normal course of our business 
while these instruments are subject to fluctuations in value  such fluctuations are anticipated to offset changes in the value of the underlying exposures 
the principal currencies subject to this process are the japanese yen and the euro 
the foreign currency options are entered into to reduce the volatility of earnings generated in currencies other than the us dollar  primarily earnings denominated in japanese yen and the euro 
as a result  the changes in the fair value of foreign currency option contracts are recorded through earnings as unrealized loss gain on derivative instruments while any realized gains or losses on expired contracts are recorded through earnings as other  net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
the premium cost of purchased foreign exchange option contracts are recorded in other current assets and amortized over the life of the options 
as part of allergan s risk management strategy  foreign exchange forward contracts were entered into to protect the value of foreign currency denominated intercompany receivables and the changes in the fair value of the foreign currency forward contracts were economically designed to offset the changes in the revaluation of the foreign currency denominated intercompany receivables 
as a result  our allocated portion of current changes in both the foreign currency forward contracts and revaluation of the foreign currency denominated intercompany receivables was recorded through other  net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
at december   the aggregate notional amounts and strike amounts of our outstanding yen and euro currency option contracts were million and and million and  respectively 
the notional principal amount provides one measure of the transaction volume outstanding as of year end  and does not represent the amount of our exposure to market loss 
the fair value of these foreign currency option contracts was million at december  the estimate of fair value is based on applicable and commonly used prevailing financial market information as of december  the amounts ultimately realized upon settlement of these financial instruments  together with the gains and losses on the underlying exposures  will depend on actual market conditions during the remaining life of the instruments 
through june   our allocated portion of changes in the revaluation of foreign currency forward contracts and changes in the fair value of foreign currency option contracts was based on our percentage of net sales compared to total allergan net sales 
in the last half of and as part of the transitional services agreement with allergan  we paid to allergan the costs of certain yen denominated foreign currency option contracts previously entered into by allergan 
the impact of foreign exchange risk management transactions on income was a net realized loss of million and million in and  respectively  and a net realized gain of million in and are recorded in other  net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations
