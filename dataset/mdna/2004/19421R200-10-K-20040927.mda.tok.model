item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the selected consolidated financial data and the company s consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere herein 
introduction and overview collectors universe inc the company provides grading and authentication and other services to dealers and collectors of high end collectible coins  sportscards  stamps  sports and entertainment memorabilia  and autographs that we believe adds value to those collectibles by enhancing their marketability and  thereby  providing increased liquidity to the dealers and collectors that own and buy and sell such collectibles 
we principally generate revenues from the fees paid by dealers and collectors for our authentication and grading services 
to a much lesser extent  we generate revenues from the sale of advertising on our websites  the sale of printed publications and collectibles price guides and advertising in such publications  and the sale of historical data and information about the collectibles graded and authenticated by us that we believe facilitates commerce in those collectibles 
during the period from through the latter part of fiscal  we also were engaged in the business of marketing and selling collectible coins  sportscards and sports entertainment and historical memorabilia 
most of those sales were made at multi venue auctions that were conducted by our collectibles sales divisions  which were comprised of bowers and merena galleries and kingswood coin auctions for rare coins  superior sportscard auctions for vintage sportscards and sports memorabilia  and odyssey for entertainment and historical memorabilia 
we also sold collectible coins  at retail  by direct sales methods 
at the authorization of the company s board of directors  in december we adopted a plan to focus our financial and managerial resources  and collectibles expertise  on the operations and growth of our grading and authentication and other collectibles service businesses  by divesting the collectibles auctions and direct sales businesses which comprised our collectibles sales segment 
the decision to implement this plan was based on a number of factors and considerations that included  among others  the historical operating results of the collectible sales and auction businesses  which had proved to be disappointing as compared to the operating results of our grading and authentication businesses  a lack of synergies between the collectibles sales and auction businesses and our grading authentication busine sses  which made it difficult to achieve efficiencies in our operating expenses  and the additional capital that would be required to grow our auction and retail sales businesses in comparison to the lower capital requirements of our grading and authentication businesses 
see bussiness recent developments disposition of collectibles sales businesses in part i of this report 
pursuant to that plan  during fiscal we sold the businesses that comprised our collectibles sales segment  including bowers and merena galleries  superior sports auctions  kingswood coin auctions  odyssey publications and lynn knight currency auctions 
we also terminated the licenses under which we operated our david hall rare coins division which had been engaged in the business of selling collectible coins at retail 
pursuant to the agreements pursuant to which those businesses were sold  we retained their collectibles inventories and their then outstanding accounts receivables  which are in the process of being liquidated 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard sfas  the assets and related liabilities of these businesses have been classified as held for sale  their related operating results have been classified as discontinued operations and prior period financial statements have been restated on that same basis 
see selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements contained in part ii of this report 
additionally  as a result of our divestiture of our auction and direct sales businesses  the discussion that follows focuses almost entirely on our grading and authentication businesses  which comprise our continuing operations 
factors that can affect our financial position and operating results factors that can affect our revenues and cash flows 
historically  the operations of our collectibles sales businesses caused significant fluctuations in our cash resources due primarily to the business cycle associated with the auctions conducted those businesses 
as a result of the disposition of those businesses  we do not expect to experience such fluctuations in future periods 
additionally  the focus on the provision of grading and authentication and other valued added services is expected to give rise to more stable and more predictable cash flows 
in fiscal  and  we generated cash of   and  respectively  from our continuing grading and authentication operations 
additionally  during the fiscal year ended june   we generated cash of  from the sale of our collectibles sales businesses and the liquidation of the inventories and accounts receivable of those businesses that we had retained 
as a result  at june  the remaining net assets of those businesses  which we are in the process of liquidating  totaled approximately  factors affecting our gross profit margins 
the gross profit margins on grading submissions are affected by the mix of collectibles submitted for grading between i coins and sportscards and ii vintage or classic coins and sportscards  on the one hand  and modern coins and sportscards  on the other hand 
generally  the prices for grading and authentication of collectible coins are higher than those charged for the grading of sportscards 
in addition  our prices for grading of collectible coins and sportscards vary depending on the turn around time requested by our customers who submit collectibles to us for grading and authentication 
as a general rule  customers request faster turn around for vintage or clas sic coins and sportscards than they do for modern submissions 
impact of economic conditions on financial performance 
we generate substantially all of our revenues from the collectibles market  which primarily relies on discretionary consumer spending 
as a result  our revenues sometimes decline and our operating result can be adversely affected by recessionary economic conditions  which often result in a decline in sales of collectibles and which  in turn  can lead to a decline in grading submissions 
on the other hand  conditions such as these  as well as price declines or volatility in the stock market  often lead investors to increase their purchases of precious metals  which can also lead to increases in submissions of such collectibles for grading 
we believe that these market factors contributed to the increase in our grading and authentication revenues 
the following table provides information regarding the respective numbers of coins  sportscards  autographs and stamps that were graded or authenticated by us in the fiscal years ended june  and and their estimated values  which are the amounts at which those coins  sportscards and stamps were insured by the dealers and collectors who submitted them to us for grading and authentication 
units processed declared value coins sportscards autographs stamps total critical accounting policies and estimates general 
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap  we record our assets at the lower of cost or fair value 
in determining the fair value of certain of our assets  principally accounts receivable  inventories  deferred income taxes  and goodwill  we must make judgments  estimates and assumptions regarding future events and circumstances that could affect the value of those assets  such as future economic conditions that will impact our ability to collect our accounts receivable in future periods 
those judgments  estimates and assumptio ns are made based on current information available to us at that time 
many of those future events and circumstances  however  are outside of our control and  if changes in those events or circumstances occur or unanticipated events occur  we may be required under gaap to adjust our earlier estimates that are affected by those changes 
any downward adjustments are commonly referred to as write downs of the assets involved 
it is our practice to establish reserves or allowances to record downward adjustments or write downs in the carrying value of assets such as accounts receivable and inventory 
such write downs are recorded as charges to income or increases in expense in our statement of operations in the periods when those reserves or allowances are established or increased to take account of changed conditions or events 
with respect to other assets  such as goodwill  we write down their carrying value in the event of a permanent impairment as a charge to income 
as a result  our judgments  estimates and assumptions about future events can  and will  affect not only the amounts at which we record such assets on our balance sheet  but also our results of operations 
the decisions as to the timing of adjustments or write downs of this nature also require subjective evaluations or assessments about the effects and duration of events or changes in circumstances 
for example  it is difficult to predict whether events  such as occurred on september  or increases in interest rates or economic slowdowns  will have short or longer term consequences for our business  and it is not uncommon for it to take some time after the occurrence of an event or the onset of changes in economic circumstances  for the full effects of such events or changes to be recognized 
therefore  management makes such estimates based upon the information available at that time and reevaluates and adjusts its reserves and allowances for potential write downs on a quarterly basis 
under gaap  businesses also must make estimates or judgments regarding the periods during which  and also regarding the amounts at which  sales are recorded 
those estimates and judgments will depend on a number of factors  including whether the customers may be entitled to return the products or reject or adjust the payment for the services provided to them 
additionally  in the case of a business that grants its customers contractual rights to return products sold to them  gaap generally will require that the business establish a reserve or allowance for product returns by means of a reduction in the amount at which its sales are recorded  based primarily on the nature  extent and duration of those rights and the historical product return experience 
in making our estimates and assumptions  we follow gaap and accounting practices applicable to our business and those that we believe will enable us to make fair and consistent estimates of the fair value of assets and establish adequate reserves or allowances 
set forth below is a summary of the accounting policies that we believe are material to an understanding of our financial condition and results of operations 
revenue recognition policies 
grading and authentication services 
our grading customers generally prepay our grading and authentication fees when they submit their collectible items to us for grading and authentication 
we record those prepayments as deferred revenue 
upon grading of the collectible and its shipment back to the customer  we record the revenue from the grading and authentication services rendered and deduct this amount from deferred revenue 
for certain dealers to whom we extend open account privileges  we record revenue at the time of shipment 
accounts receivable and the allowance for doubtful accounts 
in the normal course of business  we extend payment terms to many of the larger  more creditworthy collectibles dealers who submit collectibles to us for grading and authentication on a recurring basis 
we regularly review their accounts  estimate the amount of  and establish an allowance for uncollectible amounts in each reporting quarterly period 
the amounts of such allowances are based on several factors  including the age and extent of significant past due accounts  and specific economic conditions that may affect the ability of account debtors to pay their accounts receivable balances 
estimates of uncollectible amount s are reviewed each quarter and  based on that review  are revised to reflect changed circumstances or conditions in the quarterly period they become known 
for example  if the financial condition of certain dealers or economic conditions were to deteriorate  adversely affecting their ability to make payments on their accounts  increases in the allowance may be required 
since the allowance is created by recording a charge against income that is reflected in selling  general and administrative expenses  an increase in the allowance will cause a decline in our operating results in the period when the increase is recorded 
inventory valuation reserve 
our collectibles inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market and have been reduced by an inventory valuation allowance to provide for declines in the value of those inventories 
the amount of the allowance is determined on the basis of market knowledge  historical experience and estimates concerning future economic conditions that may impact the sale value of those inventories 
if there is an economic downturn or there occurs other events or circumstances that are likely to make it more difficult to sell  or that would lead us to reduce the prices at which we are likely to be able to sell  those collectibles  it may become necessary to increase t he allowance 
increases in this allowance will cause a decline in operating results as such increases are recorded by charges against income 
additionally  due to the relative uniqueness of some of the collectibles included in our collectibles inventory  valuation of such collectibles often involves judgments that are more subjective than more standards products sold by other businesses 
as a result  there may be some instances when we are not able to identify a decline in the value of some collectibles until they are sold 
long lived assets and goodwill 
long lived assets such as property and equipment  goodwill and intangible assets are reviewed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
prior to fiscal  estimated undiscounted future cash flows were used to determine if an asset was impaired and  if such a determination was made  the carrying value of the asset would be reduced to fair value 
any resulting impairment was recorded as a charge against income in the period in which the impairment was recorded 
however  under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  that was adopted by the company in fiscal  we are required to make goodwill impairment determinations on the basis of the fair values of the assets of our reporting units  as defined in sfas no 
 rather than on the basis of undiscounted cash flows 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we performed a transitional goodwill impairment test as of the beginning of fiscal  the year of adoption of that new standard 
we also performed an additional impairment test in june those tests were conducted at a reporting unit level and compared each reporting unit s fair value to its carrying value 
we first determined that collectors universe s reporting units were sub units of its then two reportable segments grading and authentication and collectibles sales 
we then measured the value for each reporting unit on the basis of a weighted combination of valuation approaches  including discounted cash flows and multiples of sales and earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda 
on the basis of these valuations  we concl uded that all our goodwill  which arose principally out of our acquisitions of our collectibles sales businesses  was impaired 
as a result  in fiscal we recorded a non cash after tax charge of  of which  was recorded as a cumulative change in accounting principle for continuing grading and authentication operations  and the balance of  was recorded as a cumulative effect of accounting change as part of the loss from discontinued collectibles sales operations 
in addition  we recorded a before tax impairment charge of  relating to the june  impairment test  as part of the loss from discontinued operations  and a non cash before tax impairment charge of  in our statement of operations for fiscal grading warranty costs 
we offer a warranty covering the coins and sportscards we authenticate and grade 
under the warranty  if any coin or sportscard that was previously graded by us is later submitted to us for re grading and either i receives a lower grade upon that resubmittal or ii is determined not to have been authentic  we will offer to purchase the coin or sportscard or pay the difference in value of the item at its original grade as compared with its lower grade 
however  this warranty is voided if the coin or sportscard  upon resubmittal to us  is not in the same tamper resistant holder in which it was placed at the time we last graded it 
we accrue for estimated warranty costs based on historical trends and related experience 
to date our reserves have proved to be adequate 
however  if warranty claims were to increase in relation to historical trends and experience  we would be required to increase our warranty reserves and incur additional charges that would adversely affect our results of operations in future periods 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain financial data  expressed as a percentage of net revenues  derived from our statements of operations for the respective periods indicated below fiscal years ended june  net revenues cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses selling  general administrative amortization of goodwill impairment of goodwill total operating expenses operating income loss interest income  net other  net income loss before provision benefit for income taxes provision benefit for income taxes income loss before cumulative effect of accounting change cumulative effect of accounting change net of income taxes loss from discontinued operations  net of gain on sales of discontinued businesses in net of income taxes net income loss net revenues 
net revenues consist primarily of fees generated from the grading and authentication of sportscards  coins and stamps and  to a much lesser extent  revenues from the publication of collectibles magazines 
net revenues are determined net of discounts and allowances 
the following table sets forth our net revenues for the fiscal years ended june   and and the dollar amount of and the percentage increases in net revenues in fiscal and fiscal  in each case as compared to the immediately preceding fiscal year year ended june  dollars in thousands vs 
vs 
increase decrease increase decrease amount amount amount amount percent amount percent net revenues the increase in net revenues in  compared to  was attributable a increase in the volume of collectibles graded in fiscal and  more importantly  to a increase in the number of coins graded in as compared to  because the average of the fees paid for the grading of coins is higher than the average of the fees paid for the grading of sportscards and stamps 
as a result  coins accounted for of the total collectibles graded in fiscal as compared to in fiscal consequently  while coins represented of the total number of collectibles that were graded in  coin grading generated of the net revenues in  as compared to of net revenues in the increase in the demand for our coin grading services was largely attributable to two factors i an increase in purchases and sales of collectible and gold bullion coins by investors  which we believe was due in large part to a shift by investors of some of their funds from marketable securities to tangible assets in response to continuing uncertainties in the stock markets  and ii new marketing programs that we initiated in fiscal additionally  while the number of sportscards graded declined by in fiscal  as compared to  sportscard grading revenues actually increased to  in fiscal  as compared to  in fiscal  because the increase in sportscards graded in fiscal was primarily attributable to a large bulk order for the grading of newly manufactured sportscards obtained from a leading sportscard manufacturer in fiscal  for which the average selling price was lower than for the grading of sportscards submitted by dealers and collectors 
the increase in grading and authentication revenues in  as compared to fiscal  was due primarily to increases of in coin grading submissions and in sportscard grading submissions  as compared to however  the increase in sportscard submissions was offset somewhat by a decline in the average price charged for sportscard grading in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  primarily as a result of the bulk submission of newly manufactured sportscards in fiscal and a reduction in submissions of higher value vintage sportscards  for which the average selling price is higher because dealers who submit vintage sportscards for grading usually request faster turn around time than for lower value modern sportscards 
gross profit 
gross profit is calculated by subtracting the cost of revenues from net revenues 
cost of revenues consist primarily of labor to grade and authenticate coins  sportscards  autographs and stamps  production and printing costs  credit cards fees and warranty expense 
gross profit margin is gross profit stated as a percent of net revenues 
fiscal year ended june  dollars in thousands gross profit gross profit margin the increase in our gross profit margin in  as compared to  was due to a combination of factors  the most important of which consisted of i the increase in grading submissions of coins  on which we realize higher margins than on submissions of other collectibles for grading  and ii an overall increase in net revenues described above  which caused the fixed elements of our cost of revenues to represent a lower percentage of total revenues in as compared to in fiscal  the modest decline of in our gross profit margin  as compared to  was due to an increase in bulk sportscards grading submissions  on which we realized lower margins than on other submissions of sportscards 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses primarily include wages and payroll related expenses  advertising and promotional expenses  facility and security expenses  outside professional fees and service charges  travel related expenses and other general administrative expenses 
year ended june  dollars in thousands sg a expenses as a percentage of net revenues although the dollar amount of sg a expense incurred in continuing operations increased by  in  as compared to  such expenses decreased as a percentage of net revenues in fiscal  primarily as a result of the nearly increase in net revenues 
additionally  the mix of sg a expenses changed in  as compared to  as corporate general and administrative expenses declined by  in fiscal  due to a number of factors  including a reduction in administrative personnel made possible by the disposition of the collectibles sales businesses  and the fact that in fiscal general and administrative expenses included  of consulting fees incurred for services rendered in connection with securing  in state enterprise zone tax credits 
the reduction in corporate general and administrative expenses in fiscal were offset  however  by increases in sg a expenses that were related to the increases in grading submissions in fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease in sg a expenses  as a percentage of net revenues  in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was due primarily to the fact that  in fiscal  net revenues increased at a greater rate than did sg a expenses  partially offset by the incurrence in fiscal of the tax consulting fees related to our obtaining the state enterprise zone tax credits in amortization of goodwill 
we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  effective as of july   the commencement of fiscal in accordance with sfas  we ceased amortizing goodwill recorded in past business combinations effective as of july  as a result  there were no charges recorded for goodw ill amortization expense in fiscal or by comparison  we recorded goodwill amortization expense of  or of net revenues  in fiscal goodwill impairment 
sfas no 
also required us to perform a transitional goodwill impairment test as of the beginning of fiscal  the year of its adoption 
accordingly  we conducted that test at a reporting unit level and compared each reporting unit s fair value to its carrying value 
we first determined that our reporting units were sub units of our reportable segments 
we then measured the value for each reporting unit on the basis of a weighted combination of valuation approaches  including discounted cash flows and multiples of sales and earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda 
on the basis of that valuation  we concluded that a substantial portion of our goodwill was imp aired and  in the first quarter of fiscal  we recorded a non cash after tax transitional goodwill impairment charge of  net of income taxes as a change in accounting principle 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded  as part of operating expenses  a non cash goodwill impairment charge of  due to the adoption in fiscal of our plan to dispose of our collectibles sales businesses and the classification of the results of the operations of those businesses as discontinued operations   of the  transitional goodwill impairment charge recorded in the first quarter of has been classified as a cumulative change in accounting principle  and the remaining  as part of the loss from discontinued operations recorded for fiscal also  of the  goodwill impairment charge recorded as part of operating expenses in the fourth quarter of fiscal   is now classified as part of the continuing operating expense in fiscal and the remaining  has been classified as part of the loss from discontinued operations in fiscal there was no goodwill im pairment charge in fiscal because all goodwill had been written off in fiscal in fiscal  we recorded a  goodwill impairment charge  as part of operating expenses  to reduce the carrying value of the assets of our stamp grading division  professional stamp experts pse  as a result of a determination that its future revenues were likely to be lower than had been previously expected 
interest income  net 
interest income is generated on cash balances that we invest primarily in highly liquid money market accounts  short term bank certificates of deposit and commercial paper instruments 
interest income  net from continuing operations  was  in fiscal  compared with  in fiscal and  in fiscal the increase in as compared to is primarily related to interest earned on tax refunds that the company received in fiscal the decrease in interest income in  compared to was primarily attributable to declines in short term interest rates earned on cash balances during  and the repayment of certain notes receivables that were outstanding in p rior periods 
our cash balances increased in the second half of due to the improved performance of our grading and authentication businesses and the proceeds realized from the disposition of our collectibles sales businesses and related assets 
as a result  we currently anticipate that interest income will be somewhat higher in the first six months of fiscal than in the same six months of fiscal provision benefit for income taxes 
the provision made for income taxes in fiscal and the income tax benefits recorded in fiscal and were calculated on the basis of our expected federal and state effective income tax rates for those years 
contributing to the income tax benefit in fiscal were  of california enterprise zone hiring tax credits covering eligibility periods from to  for which required governmental approvals were obtained in the second quarter of fiscal discontinued operations loss from discontinued operations 
as a result of our decision in fiscal to dispose of our collectibles sales businesses  in accordance with sfas the assets and related liabilities of those businesses have been classified as held for sale and their related operating results for fiscal years   and have been classified as discontinued operations in the financial statements included in this report 
therefore  in fiscal years and  the loss from discontinued operations net of income taxes relates to the operations of those discontinued businesses for the entirety of those fiscal years 
in fiscal  the loss from discontinued operations includes i the losses from their operations t hrough the respective dates on which they were disposed of and ii the losses or gains recognized on the sales of those businesses and the disposition of those of their assets consisting primarily of inventories and accounts receivable that we retained 
in fiscal year  the loss from discontinued businesses includes the transitional goodwill adjustment of  that arose as a result of the adoption of sfas and the goodwill impairment charge of  recorded in the fourth quarter of see goodwill impairment discussed above 
quarterly results of operations and seasonality the following tables present unaudited quarterly financial information for each of the eight quarters beginning september  and ending on june  the information has been derived from our unaudited quarterly financial statements  which have been prepared by us on a basis consistent with our audited financial statements appearing elsewhere in this form k 
the consolidated financial information set forth below includes all necessary adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring adjustments  that management considers necessary for a fair presentation of the unaudited quarterly results when read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this form k 
these operating results  which reflect the reclassification of our results of oper ations between continuing operations and discontinued operations as a result of the disposition of our collectibles sales businesses  are not necessarily indicative of results that may be expected for any subsequent periods 
we typically experience a decline in net revenues during our second fiscal quarter that ends on december  which we believe is related to the holidays that take place during that period 
our operating results also may fluctuate in the future due to a number of factors which are outside of our control 
see overview above in this section of this report for a discussion of those factors

historically  we have relied on internally generated funds  rather than borrowings  as our primary source of funds to support our grading operations 
we expect our grading and authentication services to provide us with relatively stable and predictable cash flows because in most instances our customers prepay for those services at the time they submit their collectibles for authentication and grading and we are able to closely monitor the overall volume of grading submissions and make adjustments to our operating expenses to the extent required to maintain positive cash flow from operations 
continuing operations provided net cash of  during the year ended june  primarily from operating profits and collections of tax refunds 
this compares to net cash from continuing operations of  in the year ended june  net cash generated from investing activities was  for the years ended june  and consisted primarily of cash received from the sale of discontinued businesses of  partially offset by expenditures for upgrading the company s corporate computer hardware  and secondarily for new tooling for producing plastic  tamper resistant holders in which collectible coins and sports cards that we grade or authenticate are placed prior to being sent back to the customer 
financing activities provided net cash of  in the year ended june   consisting of proceeds from sales of our shares under our employee stock purchase plan and the exercise of employee stock options 
at june   we had the following outstanding obligations under operating leases  net of sublease income for years ending june thereafter with the exception of those obligations  we do not have any material financial obligations  such as long term debt  capital lease  or purchase obligations 
however  we are currently seeking a line of credit from a bank or other lending institution primarily to enable us to provide advances to coin and other collectibles dealers as a means of generating additional interest income and also providing an additional incentive for large collectibles dealers to do business with us 
we anticipate that any such advances that we might make generally would be secured by dealers collectibles inventories 
there is no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining such a line of credit 
we also may use cash resources to make acquisitions of other collectibles service businesses  if we identify acquisition opportunities that we believe are attractive 
we believe that our existing cash balances and internally generated funds will be sufficient to fund our cash requirements for at least the next twelve months 
however  our cash requirements will depend on several factors  including our ability to achieve and maintain operating profitability and whether or not we make business acquisitions for cash or stock 
accordingly  we may require financing from external sources in the future through equity or debt offerings  which may or may not be available or may be dilutive to our stockholders 
our ability to obtain financing from external sources will depend upon our operating results  financial condition  future business prospects  our stock price performance and conditions then prevailing in the relevant capital markets 
recent accounting pronouncements in october  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
addresses significant issues relating to the implementation of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and develops a single accounting model  based on the framework established by sfas no 
 for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale  wheth er previously held and used or newly acquired 
sfas no 
was adopted by the company on july  the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
however  as discussed above in this section of this report and in note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report  we have classified the assets  related liabilities of the collectible sales businesses as held for sale  and their related operating results have been classified as discontinued operations in accordance with sfas no 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
addresses significant issues regarding the recognition  measurement  and reporting of costs associated with exit and disposal activities  including restructuring activities 
sfas no 
also addresses recognition of certain costs related to terminating a contract that is not a capital lease  costs to consolidate facilities or relocate employees  and termination benefits provided to employees that are involuntarily terminated under the terms of a one time benefit arrangement that is not an ongoing benefit arrangement or an individual deferred compensation contract 
sfas no 
is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  in  we decided to relocate the operations of our bowers and merena division part of the discontinued operations to louisiana  and in fiscal  we incurred certain severance costs associated with exiting our discontinued businesses 
we accounted for these actions in accordance with sfas no 
in november  the fasb issued fasb interpretation fin no 
 guarantors accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees and indebtedness of others  an interpretation of fasb statements nos 
 and  and rescission of fasb interpretation no 
 disclosure of indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
fin elaborates on the interim and annual financial statement disclosures that are required to be made by companies that have guaranteed third party obligations 
fin also requires that a guarantor recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing a guarantee 
the initial recognition and measurement provisions of this interpretation became applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december   while  the provisions of the disclosure requirements became effective for financial statements for interim or annual periods ending after december  we did not issue any guarantees in the year ended june  from time to time  we enter into certain types of contracts that contingently require us to indemnify parties against third party claims 
these contracts consist primarily of i the asset purchase agreements pursuant to which we have sold our collectibles auction businesses  under which we have agreed to indemnify the buyers of those businesses on terms customary for transactions of this nature  ii certain real estate leases under which we are required to indemnify property owners for environmental or other liabilities and other claims arising from our use of the leased premises  and iii agreements with the company s officers  directors and employees  under which we are obligated to indemnify such persons for liabilities arising out of their employment or service relationship with us or our su bsidiaries 
the terms of such indemnification obligations vary by contract and  in most instances  a specific or maximum dollar amount is not explicitly stated therein 
historically  we have not had to make any significant payments in respect of these indemnification obligations and no liabilities have been recorded for those obligations in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets 
in january  the fasb issued fin r  consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of arb no 
 and revised in december fin r requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiar y of the entity if the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
fin r is effective for all new variable interest entities created or acquired after december  for variable interest entities created or acquired prior to december   the provisions of fin r must be applied for the first interim or annual period beginning after march  the adoption of fin r did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows  as the company has no interests in variable interest entities 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liability and equity 
sfas no 
establishes standards for how companies classify and measure certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas no 
is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  the company adopted the standard on july  the company has determined that sfas no 
did not have any significant impact on its co nsolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact the financial position  results of operations or cash flows of the company due to adverse changes in financial market prices  including interest rate risk  foreign currency exchange rate risk  commodity price risk and other relevant market rate or price risks 
the company is exposed to a degree of market risk through changes in short term interest rates 
at june   we had approximately  in cash and cash equivalents 
these funds are primarily invested in a highly liquid money market fund  and interest earned is re invested in the same fund 
the company is exposed to the risk of declining short term interest rates  but we do not consider this risk to be material 
we have no activities that would expose us to foreign currency exchange rate risks or commodity price risks
