item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following information is provided in connection with  and should be read in conjunction with  the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
we operate on a fiscal year ending on april the following discussion and analysis is for the fiscal year ended april  
table of contents overview we are a self advised equity real estate investment trust engaged in owning and operating income producing real properties 
our investments include multi family residential properties and commercial properties located primarily in the upper midwest states of minnesota and north dakota 
our properties are diversified in property type and location 
as of april   our real estate portfolio consisted of multi family residential properties containing  apartment units and having a total carrying amount net of accumulated depreciation of million  and commercial properties containing approximately million square feet of leasable space and having a total carrying amount net of accumulated depreciation of million 
our primary source of income and cash is rents associated with multi family residential and commercial leases 
during fiscal year  iret continued to operate in a difficult economic environment 
unemployment rates in our core markets  job growth at a pace slower than anticipated  continued low interest rates and an abundant supply of housing and commercial property alternatives all contributed to increased vacancy levels at our multi family and commercial properties  lower rental income and increased costs for tenant concessions 
in addition  identifying potential acquisition properties that met our investment criteria continued to be a challenge during fiscal year the slow economy  combined with a widespread demand for real estate from traditional and non traditional investors  resulted in a significant reduction in the investment returns from all types of real estate 
in response to these operating conditions  during fiscal year iret was able to implement only modest rental rate increases at certain of our multi family and commercial properties  and relied on a greater use of rent and other tenant concessions in order to improve occupancy rates 
during fiscal year  vacancy levels in our stabilized multi family residential and commercial properties continued to increase  to compared to at the end of fiscal year in the case of our multi family portfolio  and to from at the end of fiscal year in the case of our commercial portfolio 
total revenues of iret properties  our operating partnership  increased by million to million  compared to million in fiscal year this increase was primarily attributable to the addition of new real estate properties 
operating income declined in fiscal year  to million from million in fiscal year our cost for tenant concessions  such as free rent  offered to attract new tenants to our multi family residential properties  increased to million for the twelve months ended april   compared to million for fiscal year other expenses increased during fiscal year as well  with real estate taxes  maintenance  utility  administrative and operating expense and insurance costs all increasing from year earlier levels 
while some of this increase was due to the addition of new real estate to our portfolio  the majority was due to increased costs at our existing real estate assets 
during fiscal year  the company added five multi family residential properties with a total of apartment units  and commercial properties with a total of approximately million rentable square feet  to our investment portfolio  for an aggregate purchase price of million 
the company disposed of seven properties  for sale prices totaling million 
additional information and more detailed discussions of our fiscal year operating results are found in the following sections of this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
critical accounting policies set forth below is a summary of the accounting policies that management believes are critical to the preparation of the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
real estate 
real estate is carried at cost  net of accumulated depreciation  less an adjustment  if any  for impairment 
depreciation requires an estimate by management of the useful life of each property as well as an allocation of the costs associated with a property to its various components 
if the company does not allocate these costs appropriately or incorrectly estimates the useful lives of its real estate  depreciation expense may be misstated 
depreciation is computed on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
the company uses a year estimated life for buildings and improvements 
maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred 
renovations and improvements that improve and or extend the useful life of the asset are capitalized over their estimated useful life  generally five to ten years 

table of contents upon acquisitions of real estate  the company assesses the fair value of acquired tangible assets including land  buildings and personal property  which is determined by valuing the property as if it were vacant  and considers whether there were significant intangible assets acquired for example  above and below market leases  the value of acquired in place leases  and tenant relationships  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
and acquired liabilities  and allocates the purchase price based on these assessments 
the as if vacant value is allocated to land  buildings  and personal property based on management s determination of the relative fair value of these assets 
the estimated fair value of the property is the amount that would be recoverable upon the disposition of the property 
techniques used to estimate fair value include discounted cash flow analysis  independent appraisals  and reference to recent sales of comparable properties 
estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including the historical operating results  known trends  and market economic conditions that may affect the property 
land value is assigned based on the purchase price if land is acquired separately  or based on estimated market value if acquired in a merger or in a portfolio acquisition 
above market and below market in place lease values for acquired properties are recorded based on the present value using an interest rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired of the difference between i the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in place leases and ii management s estimate of fair market lease rates for the corresponding in place leases  measured over a period equal to the remaining non cancelable term of the lease 
the company performs this analysis on a lease by lease basis 
the capitalized above market and below market lease values are amortized and included in operating expenses as depreciation amortization related to real estate investments and amortized over the remaining non cancelable terms of the respective leases 
other intangible assets acquired include amounts for in place lease values that are based upon the company s evaluation of the specific characteristics of the leases 
factors considered in these analyses include an estimate of carrying costs during hypothetical expected lease up periods  considering current market conditions  and costs to execute similar leases 
the company also considers information about each property obtained during its pre acquisition due diligence and marketing and leasing activities in estimating the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired 
property sales or dispositions are recorded when title transfers and sufficient consideration is received by the company 
the company s properties are reviewed for impairment if events or circumstances change indicating that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
if the company incorrectly estimates the values at acquisition or the undiscounted cash flows  initial allocations of purchase price and future impairment charges may be different 
the impact of the company s estimates in connection with acquisitions and future impairment analysis could be material to the company s financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company periodically evaluates the collectibility of amounts due from tenants and maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of tenants to make required payments under their respective lease agreements 
the company also maintains an allowance for receivables arising from the straight lining of rents 
this receivable arises from earnings recognized in excess of amounts currently due under lease agreements 
management exercises judgment in establishing these allowances and considers payment history and current credit status in developing these estimates 
if estimates differ from actual results this would impact reported results 

table of contents mortgage loans receivable 
the company evaluates the collectibility of both interest and principal of each of its mortgage loans receivable which total million as of april  if circumstances warrant to determine whether it is impaired 
however  if the company fails to identify that a borrower is unable to perform  the company s bad debt expense may be different than estimated 
revenue recognition the company has the following revenue sources and revenue recognitions policies base rents income arising from tenant leases 
these rents are recognized over the non cancelable term of the related leases on a straight line basis  which includes the effects of rent steps and free rent abatements under the leases 
percentage rents income arising from retail tenant leases which are contingent upon the sales of the tenant exceeding a defined threshold 
these rents are recognized in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin  which states that this income is to be recognized only after the contingency has been removed ie  sales thresholds have been achieved 
expense reimbursement income income arising from tenant leases  which provide for the recovery of all or a portion of the operating expenses and real estate taxes of the respective property 
this income is accrued in the same periods as the expenses are incurred 
income taxes 
the company operates in a manner intended to enable it to continue to qualify as a real estate investment trust reit under sections of the internal revenue code of  as amended 
under those sections  a reit which distributes at least of its reit taxable income as a distribution to its shareholders each year and which meets certain other conditions will not be taxed on that portion of its taxable income which is distributed to its shareholders 
the company intends to distribute to its shareholders of its taxable income 
therefore  no provision for federal income taxes is required 
if the company fails to distribute the required amount of income to its shareholders  it would fail to qualify as a reit and substantial adverse tax consequences may result 
recent accounting pronouncements there are no accounting standards or interpretations that have been issued  but which have not yet been adopted  that we believe will have a material impact on our financial statements 

table of contents results of operations revenues total revenues for fiscal year were million  compared to million in fiscal year and million in fiscal year revenues during fiscal year were million greater than revenues in fiscal year and revenues during fiscal year were million greater than in fiscal year for fiscal  the increase in revenue of million resulted from in thousands rent from properties acquired in fiscal year in excess of that received in from the same properties rent from properties acquired in fiscal year increase in rental income on existing properties  net of declining occupancy levels an increase in straight line rents an increase in discount and fee revenue a decrease in rent from properties sold for fiscal  the increase in revenue of million resulted from in thousands rent from properties acquired in fiscal year in excess of that received in from the same properties rent from properties acquired in fiscal year increase in rental income on existing properties  net of declining occupancy levels an increase in straight line rents an increase in discount and fee revenue a decrease in rent from properties sold as illustrated above  the substantial majority of the increase in our gross revenue for fiscal and resulted from the addition of new real estate properties to the iret properties portfolio  rather than from rental increases on existing properties 
for the next to months  we expect acquisitions to continue to be the most significant factor in any increases in our revenues and ultimately our net income 
while acceptable real estate assets are still available for purchase  the slow economy combined with a widespread demand for real estate from traditional and non traditional investors has resulted in a significant reduction in the investment returns from all types of real estate 
this reduction in the rates of return has been offset to some extent by the dramatic drop in borrowing costs to historically low levels 
while we were able to take advantage of those lower borrowing costs for most of our recent acquisitions  the majority of our debt is fixed and not prepayable without significant prepayment costs and fees 
gain on sale of real estate the company realized a gain on sale of real estate for fiscal of 
million 
this compares to million of gain on sale of real estate recognized in fiscal and 
million recognized in fiscal a list of the properties sold during fiscal year  showing sales price  depreciated cost plus sales costs and net gain loss is included below under the caption property dispositions 
we anticipate that we will continue to sell our older and smaller locations as opportunities arise

a discussion of the factors having the greatest impact on our business compared to the prior two fiscal years is set forth below 
in management s opinion  most of these negative influences show only slight signs of lessening in the next twelve months 
increased economic vacancy 
during fiscal  vacancy levels at our stabilized multi family residential properties continued to increase throughout our entire portfolio to compared to at the end of fiscal year  for economic occupancy levels of approximately in fiscal year compared to approximately in fiscal year economic occupancy is defined as total possible revenue less vacancy loss as a percentage of total possible revenue 
total possible revenue is determined by valuing occupied units or square footage at contract rates  and vacant units or square footage at market rates 
stabilized properties are those properties that we have owned for the entirety of the periods being compared  and include properties that were redeveloped or expanded during the periods being compared 
likewise  vacancy levels at our stabilized commercial properties increased to  from at the end of fiscal year  for economic occupancy levels of approximately in fiscal year compared to approximately in fiscal year a majority of the markets in which we operate continue to experience overall poor economic conditions  in respect to job creation 
the poor economic climate has translated directly into increased vacancy at many of our properties 

table of contents our commercial vacancy is primarily due to our inability to either renew existing leases or to re lease space being vacated by tenants at the expiration of their lease 
while not necessarily indicative of future business cycles  in past economic downturns  a recovery in occupancy levels generally trails the pick up in economic activity by twelve months or more 
despite some positive economic developments  we have yet to see a significant increase in demand for multi family residential or commercial space 
we continue to expect that demand in our markets for both apartments and commercial space will remain weak through the remainder of our current fiscal year 
increased real estate taxes 
taxes imposed on our real estate properties increased by million  or for the fiscal year ended april  of the increased real estate taxes  million or is attributable to the addition of new real estate acquired in fiscal  while million or is due to increased costs for real estate taxes on existing real estate assets 
most of our new property acquisitions during the past year were in minnesota  a jurisdiction with higher property taxes than north dakota and the other states in which we own property 
under the terms of most of our commercial leases  the full cost of real estate tax is paid by the tenant as additional rent 
for our noncommercial real estate properties  any increase in our real estate tax costs must be collected from tenants in the form of a general rent increase 
while we have implemented selected rent increases  the current economic conditions and increased vacancy levels have prevented us from raising rents in the amount necessary to fully recover our increased real estate tax costs 
to further compound the problem  a number of states in which we operate continue to face state budget shortfalls 
our experience is that such shortfalls translate into local governments raising property taxes 
increased maintenance expense 
the maintenance expense category increased by million or for the fiscal year ended april   as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal of the increased maintenance costs for the fiscal year ended april   million or is attributable to the addition of new real estate acquired in fiscal and  while million or is due to increased costs for maintenance on existing real estate assets 
under the terms of most of our commercial leases  the full cost of maintenance is paid by the tenant as additional rent 
for our noncommercial real estate properties  any increase in our maintenance costs must be collected from tenants in the form of a general rent increase 
while we have implemented selected rent increases  the current economic conditions and increased vacancy levels have prevented us from raising rents in the amount necessary to fully recover our increased maintenance costs 
increased utility expense 
the utility expense category increased by million or for the fiscal year ended april   as compared to fiscal of the increased utility costs  
million or is attributable to the addition of new real estate acquired in fiscal and  while million or is due to increased costs for utilities on existing real estate assets 
under the terms of most of our commercial leases  the full cost of utilities is paid by the tenant as additional rent 
for our other noncommercial real estate properties  any increase in our utility costs must be collected from tenants in the form of a general rent increase 
while we have implemented selected rent increases  the current economic conditions and increased vacancy levels have prevented us from raising rents in the amount necessary to fully recover our increased utility costs 
since our real estate portfolio is primarily located in minnesota and north dakota  the severity of winters has a large impact on our utility costs 

table of contents increased administrative and operating expense 
administrative and operating expenses increased by 
million or for the fiscal year ended april   as compared to fiscal of this increase in administrative and operating expense for the fiscal year ended april   
million or was due to employee related costs 
over the past year  we have hired six new employees 
the addition of these new employees  together with increases in the wages and benefits paid to existing employees  account for the increase in administrative and operating costs for the fiscal year ended april  increased insurance premiums 
insurance expense increased by 
million or for the fiscal year ended april   compared to the prior fiscal year 
of the increased insurance costs  
million or is attributable to the addition of new real estate during fiscal years and  while 
million or is due to increased premium costs for coverage on existing real estate assets 
under the terms of most of our commercial leases  the full cost of insurance is paid by the tenant as additional rent 
for our other real estate properties  any increase in our insurance costs must be collected from tenants in the form of a general rent increase 
while we have implemented selected rent increases  the current economic conditions and increased vacancy levels have prevented us from raising rents in the amount necessary to fully recover our increased insurance costs 
we do not expect our insurance costs to decline during fiscal increase in interest expense 
our mortgage debt increased million or for the fiscal year ended april  our mortgage interest expense increased by million or for the fiscal year ended april   as compared to fiscal year  due to the fact that interest rates on new mortgages incurred during were lower than rates on mortgages in prior periods 
of the increased interest expense for the fiscal year ended april   million or is attributable to the addition of new real estate  while interest expenses on existing real estate assets increased by million or  due primarily to increased borrowing on existing mortgages 
factors impacting net income during fiscal as compared to increased economic vacancy 
during fiscal  vacancy levels at our stabilized multi family residential properties increased throughout our entire portfolio  from at the end of to at the end of fiscal likewise  vacancy levels at our stabilized commercial properties increased from at the end of fiscal to at the end of fiscal a majority of the markets in which we operate continued to experience overall poor economic conditions  particularly in respect of job creation 
the poor economic climate translated directly into increased vacancy at many of our properties 
uninvested cash 
the most significant reason for the decline in net income per common share during fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was our large balance of cash and marketable securities 
while this money was invested in short term income producing investments  we ordinarily seek to invest in income producing real estate 
it was not until the second quarter of fiscal that we were able fully to invest the proceeds from the equity raised during first quarter into income producing real estate 
this delay in investing such proceeds resulted in a reduction in net income for the fiscal year ended april  as compared to

for our noncommercial real estate properties  any increase in our real estate tax costs must be collected from tenants in the form of a general rent increase 
while we implemented portfolio wide rent increases  economic conditions and increased vacancy levels prevented us from raising rents in the amount necessary to fully recover our increased real estate tax costs

increased administrative and operating expense 
administrative and operating expenses increased by million or for the fiscal year ended april   as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal of this increase in administrative and operating expense for the fiscal year ended april    or was due to professional fees and costs associated with our offering of common shares in the first quarter of fiscal in prior years  the work associated with offerings of common shares to the public was largely done by our employees

table of contents in the first table below are not identical to the fiscal year results presented in the second table  because the properties comprising our stabilized property portfolio vary from year to year  due to our ongoing acquisition and disposition activity 
the company analyzes and compares results of operations on properties that we have owned for the entirety of the periods being compared including properties that were redeveloped or expanded during the periods being compared  with properties purchased or sold during the periods being compared excluded from this analysis 
this comparison allows the company to evaluate the performance of existing properties and their contribution to net income 
measuring performance on a stabilized property basis is useful to investors because it enables evaluation of how the company s properties are performing year over year 
management uses this measure to assess whether or not it has been successful in increasing net operating income  renewing the leases of existing tenants  controlling operating costs and appropriately handling capital improvements

grove  mn creekside office building billings  mt america s best boise  id century apartments dickinson  nd edgewood vista land duluth  mn total fiscal gain funds from operations iret considers funds from operations ffo a useful measure of performance for an equity reit 
iret uses the definition of ffo adopted by the national association of real estate investment trusts  inc nareit in  as clarified in  and nareit defines ffo to mean net income computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  excluding gains or losses from sales of property  plus depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be calculated to reflect funds from operations on the same basis 
while iret uses the nareit definition of ffo  the components of that definition in many cases require interpretation  and iret accordingly has made certain interpretations in applying the definition 
in particular  in calculating ffo per share  iret adds back to net income computed in accordance with gaap the allocations made to limited partners  and divides this amount by the total number of iret common shares of beneficial interest and upreit units outstanding 

table of contents under the partnership agreement pursuant to which iret s upreit units are issued  upreit unitholders effectively have the same claim on the earnings and assets of iret as do iret s shares of beneficial interest shareholders  and therefore iret considers that the upreit units also should be included with the shares of beneficial interest in calculating ffo per share 
iret believes that  while this particular adjustment made by iret in calculating ffo is not specifically provided for in the nareit definition  it is consistent with the definition 
while ffo is widely used by reits as a primary performance metric  not all real estate companies use the same definition of ffo or calculate ffo in the same way 
accordingly  ffo presented here is not necessarily comparable to ffo presented by other real estate companies 
ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income as determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of iret s performance  but rather should be considered as an additional  supplemental measure  and should be viewed in conjunction with net income as presented in the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
management believes that ffo is helpful to investors as a measure of our performance because it excludes various items included in net income that do not relate to or are not indicative of our performance  such as gains and losses on sales of real estate and real estate related depreciation and amortization  which can make periodic analyses of operating performance more difficult to compare
