at july   the company had million of cash

in  we received cash from financing activities of million  million of which was provided by hunt capital growth fund ii  lp hunt capital pursuant to the issuance of a subordinated secured convertible note 
the note is secured by all of the assets of the company  has a five year term  carries a coupon  and does not require any interest payments until maturity 
the note is convertible into common stock of the company at per share 
following the end of the fiscal year  on august   we received million from institutional investors pursuant to the issuance of secured convertible notes due august  the notes are secured by all of the assets of the company  subject to an intercreditor agreement between the institutional investors and hunt capital  and require interest payments semi annually in cash or  at the company s option  in shares of its common stock or in the form of additional one year notes accruing interest at the rate of per annum 
the notes are convertible into common stock of the company at per share 
in connection with this financing  the company also issued to the investors i warrants to purchase up to  shares of the company s common stock  exercisable at per share and expiring in march  and ii warrants to purchase up to  shares  exercisable at per share and generally expiring in february the following summarizes our contractual cash obligations as of july  in millions payments due by fiscal year total long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases total contractual cash obligations the long term debt identified as due in fiscal in the preceding table represents principal and capitalized interest to date on the subordinated secured convertible note 
in addition  the secured convertible notes issued following the end of fiscal year  on august   are due early in fiscal year  on august  accordingly  given the potentially significant cash requirements necessary to meet this debt repayment schedule during fiscal  the company may need to seek additional capital to refinance these notes in fiscal if they have not been converted into common stock prior to that time 
a term of the subordinated secured convertible note and the secured convertible notes requires that the company maintain the listing and trading of its common stock on either the nasdaq national market or the 
table of contents 
index to financial statements nasdaq smallcap market 
if the company is unable to maintain its listing on nasdaq  the company will be in default on the listing requirement covenant in the note agreements 
such a default provides the holders of the notes with the ability to require immediate repayment of the principal and interest then owed under the notes 
the company s stock has remained listed on the nasdaq smallcap market subject to a grace period granted by nasdaq through december   as a result of the company s failure to meet the minimum bid price listing maintenance requirement of the exchange 
to remain listed past that date  the bid price of the company s stock must be at least for consecutive trading days prior to that date 
the company has the opportunity to effect a share consolidation prior to that date to attempt to cause the bid price of the stock to reach the required trading level 
to effect a share consolidation  the company must submit the matter to a stockholder vote and receive stockholder approval of such an action 
at its next annual meeting of stockholders  the company plans to seek stockholder approval of a share consolidation in an attempt to meet the nasdaq minimum bid price requirement  if necessary 
if the company s stock is delisted from nasdaq  if the notes have not been converted to common stock  and if as a result of a delisting the lenders should choose to accelerate the repayment of their notes  the company may be unable to repay the principal and interest owed 
based on our current activity and expectations  including maintaining our listing on nasdaq  we believe we have sufficient cash resources to enable the company to finance its capital requirements 
if future financing is required  we will attempt to arrange it to meet our requirements with the timing  amount and form of issue depending on the prevailing market and general economic conditions 
critical accounting policies our critical accounting policies are as follows revenue recognition the company derives revenue from two primary sources  content and certification 
content revenue includes fees received from the sale of course materials such as books  cd roms  web based course books  assessment products and content licenses 
we recognize content revenue from the sale of course books and other products when they are shipped 
content licenses are either purchased on a fee per use basis or for a one time fee 
revenue is recognized over the period in which we have a commitment for continuing involvement or obligation to provide services to the customer 
in most cases  no such commitment exists  and revenue is recognized when content is shipped 
certification revenue includes fees paid by certification candidates to take our certification tests and annual fees received from our education partners  including ciw and ctp atps 
we recognize certification revenue when certification tests are administered  and partner fees over the period during which we have a commitment for continuing involvement or obligation to provide services to the partner 
valuation of intangibles and long lived assets we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles  long lived assets and related goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors considered important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  and our market capitalization and other market value indicators relative to net book value

additional factors that may affect results of operations and market price of stock this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of all statements other than historical or current facts  including  without limitation  statements about our business strategy  plans and objectives of management and our future prospects  are forward looking statements 
although we believe that the expectations reflected in these statements are reasonable in view of the facts available to us  no assurance can be given that all of these statements will prove to be accurate 
such forward looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from these expectations 
among these risks are those set forth in the following section  as well as those discussed elsewhere herein 
if any of these risks materialize  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be harmed  the market price of our common stock could decline  or both 
we have limited cash resources and may need to raise additional funds 
we are operating with limited cash resources 
based on our current activity and expectations  including maintaining our listing on nasdaq  we believe we have sufficient cash resources for at least the next twelve months of operations 
however  a moderate change to our revenue generating capability or expense structure could result in increased operating losses 
increased operating losses would erode our liquidity by further reducing cash resources and could result in the need to raise additional funds 
in the first quarter of fiscal year both the subordinated secured convertible note and the secured convertible notes will mature and all outstanding principal and capitalized interest thereupon will become due and payable 
although these securities are convertible into common stock at any time  should they not be converted into common stock by their holders prior to their maturity dates  the company may need to seek capital to refinance these debt instruments 
given our relatively small size and historical operating results  our access to capital is limited 
should we need to raise additional funds  it cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain them on terms satisfactory to us 

table of contents 
index to financial statements if we could not raise additional funds on terms satisfactory to us  we would be forced to raise funds on terms that we would not otherwise accept  seek funds through other means such as a sale of some or all of our assets or operations  or otherwise significantly alter our operating plan  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
our common stock could be delisted from the nasdaq stock market 
on june   we received notice from nasdaq that for consecutive business days our common stock had closed below the minimum per share requirement for continued listing on the nasdaq smallcap market  and were provided a grace period through december   to regain compliance with the requirement 
in order to remain on the nasdaq smallcap market  we will need to satisfy the bid price requirement by having a closing bid price of our common stock of at least for a minimum of ten consecutive business days 
if we do not comply by december   nasdaq has indicated it will provide written notification that we did not regain compliance 
if we do not cure our minimum bid price deficiency  and if nasdaq delists our common stock  then the common stock may be traded on the otc bulletin board or the pink sheets 
many institutional and other investors refuse to invest in stocks that are traded at levels below the nasdaq markets  which could reduce the trading liquidity in our common stock or make our effort to raise capital more difficult 
otc bulletin board and pink sheets stocks are often lightly traded or not traded at all on any given day 
any reduction in trading liquidity or active interest on the part of our investors could have adverse consequences on our stockholders  either because of reduced market prices or lack of a regular  active trading market for our common stock 
if our common stock is delisted from the nasdaq stock market  payment of our secured debt could be accelerated 
a term of the subordinated secured convertible note and the secured convertible notes requires that the company maintain the listing and trading of its common stock on the nasdaq smallcap market 
if we do not cure our minimum bid price deficiency  and if nasdaq delists our common stock  we will be in default on the listing requirement covenant in the note agreements 
such a default provides the holders of the notes with the ability to require immediate repayment of the principal and interest then owed under the notes 
if the company s stock is delisted  and if as a result of that delisting the lenders should choose to accelerate the repayment of their notes  the company may be unable to repay the principal and interest owed and would be forced to seek alternative financing at that time 
although the company intends to cure its minimum price deficiency by effecting a share consolidation which must be approved by its stockholders  no assurances can be given that it will be successful in that regard 
as a result  the company s audited financial statements for the year ended july  contain a going concern qualification from the company s auditors 
we have incurred significant losses to date and may continue to incur losses in the future 
we have incurred net losses of approximately million from our inception in through july  our ability to generate revenue growth in the future is subject to uncertainty 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to increase revenues  manage expenses  or maintain profitability 
should revenue decrease in the future  we may not be able to stem losses thereafter through expense reductions  given the magnitude of the reductions already implemented 
our industry is intensely competitive and we may lose market share to companies developing similar services and products and to larger competitors with greater resources 
we face substantial competition in the education and training market 
competition in the ict training market is intense and is affected by the rapidly evolving nature of the information technology industry 
a number of other companies offer products and services similar to ours  and additional new competitors may emerge in the future 
many of our existing competitors have substantially greater capital resources  technical expertise  
table of contents 
index to financial statements marketing experience  research and development status  established customers and facilities than do we 
as a result  there is a risk that we will not be able to successfully compete with existing and future competitors  which would adversely affect our financial performance 
in our industry  technology advances rapidly and industry standards change frequently 
to remain competitive and improve profitability  we must continually enhance our existing products and promptly introduce new products  services  and technologies to meet the changing demands of our customers 
our failure to respond to technological changes quickly would adversely affect our financial performance 
demand for our products is susceptible to adverse economic conditions and educational funding constraints 
our business and financial performance is influenced by adverse financial conditions affecting our target customers and by general weakness in the economy 
in the short run  many corporations may not view ict skills training as critical to the success of their businesses 
when these companies experience poor operating results  whether as a result of adverse economic conditions  competitive issues or other factors  they may decrease or delay spending on training and education 
in addition  most of our academic customers are reliant on the availability of funding to pursue their existing educational programs and new initiatives 
if educational funding is limited  whether as a result of overall economic conditions  budgetary constraints  the political environment or other factors  these institutions may delay or forego spending for our content and certification products 
shares that may be sold could result in a market overhang that depresses our stock price 
the potential for future sales of our common stock could depress the market price of our common stock 
in addition  the perception that such sales will occur could also adversely affect the price 
as long as certain registration statements that have been filed with the sec remain effective  the selling stockholders under those registration statements may sell approximately million shares  or approximately of the shares of common stock outstanding assuming the issuance of all shares covered by those registration statements 
these shares were privately issued and are otherwise subject to restrictions on resale under securities laws 
any such sales  or even the market perception that such sales could be made  may depress the price of the common stock 
our common stock may experience extreme price and volume fluctuations 
our common stock has experienced substantial price and volume volatility  which may continue in the future 
additionally  the stock market from time to time experiences significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
these broad market fluctuations may also adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
in addition to such broad market fluctuations  factors such as  but not limited to  the following may have a significant effect on the market price of our common stock the delisting of our common stock from the nasdaq smallcap market  fluctuations in our operating results  including those caused by our lengthy sales cycle and seasonal effects on our business  the perception by others of our ability to obtain any necessary new financing  a limited trading market for our common stock  and public announcements concerning us  our competitors or our industry 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk relating to our operations results primarily from changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
a portion of our cash flow is expected to be received in non us currencies 
in addition  a portion of our assets is held in foreign subsidiaries 
accordingly  we are exposed to foreign currency fluctuations against the us dollar 
such exposure is not significant relative to our overall operations and we believe that the risk associated with our exposure will not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations
