company overview valentis is creating innovative cardiovascular therapeutics 
we begin our product development at the stage of a gene or protein with known activity and apply our expertise in formulation  manufacturing  clinical development and regulatory affairs to create products that fill unmet medical needs 
valentis has a series of technologies ranging from gene delivery and expression technologies to proprietary formulation and manufacturing technologies that allow us to generate novel therapeutics to treat a wide range of diseases 
while valentis is focusing its efforts on the development of novel cardiovascular therapeutics  its technologies are being applied by its collaborators for the development of therapeutics to treat a variety of indications including infectious diseases and cancer 
deltavasc  the company s lead product  is based on the developmentally regulated endothelial cell locus del angiogenesis gene formulated with a valentis proprietary pinc polymer delivery system 
deltavasc is currently in phase ii clinical trials in patients with the intermittent claudication ic form of peripheral arterial disease pad 
the primary endpoint in this trial is improvement in exercise tolerance days after dosing of the product 
valentis expects that results from this phase ii trial will be available at the end of september a positive outcome for the clinical trial demonstrating a statistically significant drug effect and safety for use in the targeted population is critical to the continued development of deltavasc 
a negative trial outcome could have a material and adverse effect on the further development of deltavasc  negatively affect valentis ability to raise additional financing on acceptable terms  if at all  negatively impact our business and prospects and cause the price of our common stock to fall 
see additional factors that may affect future results for a description of the risks related to our product development efforts  including risks with regard to the deltavasc pad phase ii clinical trial 
if results of the phase ii clinical trial justify proceeding to a phase iii clinical trial of deltavasc  because of the size of the potential market for the product and the number of possible uses for the product  the valentis expects to license it to a pharmaceutical company that will assume responsibility for late stage development and commercialization 
results of operations fiscal years ended june   and revenue revenue recognized in the fiscal years ended june   and is as follows in thousands year ended june  collaborative research and development revenue roche holdings  ltd 
 license and milestone revenue geneswitch licenses  dnavax gene delivery technology license and milestone pinc gene delivery technology licenses manufacturing technology milestone  pegylation technology licenses  other revenue total revenue    changes in revenue for each of the fiscal years ended june   and are explained below no revenue was recognized from roche in fiscal and  as the collaboration with roche ended in in accordance with the terms of the agreement 
revenue from roche for fiscal year was recognized in accordance with the performance of research obligations under the agreement 
the geneswitch revenue recognized in fiscal  and resulted primarily from license and annual license maintenance fees received under several agreements for valentis geneswitch technology  totaling approximately  million and  respectively 
the geneswitch revenue recognized in fiscal consists primarily of license fees received under expanded licensing agreements  which do not require payment of annual maintenance fees 
the dnavax gene delivery technology license and milestone revenue of  recognized in fiscal consists of a milestone payment of  and a license fee of  received during under a license agreement related to our dnavax delivery technology 
pinc gene delivery technology licenses revenue of  recognized in fiscal reflects license fees received under agreements related to our pinc delivery technology 
we recognized million of manufacturing technology milestone revenue in fiscal under a license agreement for our plasmid dna manufacturing technology 
in july  polymasc pharmaceuticals  our wholly owed subsidiary  entered into a license and settlement agreement with alza corporation  a unit of johnson johnson 
under the agreement  polymasc settled its patent infringement litigation against alza and granted a worldwide  irrevocable and non exclusive license to alza under its peg liposome patents 
non recurring license revenue of million was recognized from this agreement in fiscal we recognized  of license revenue related to our pegylation technology in other revenue recognized in fiscal consists primarily of profit sharing and royalty revenue of  resulting from a plasmid dna manufacturing agreement 
other revenue of  recognized in fiscal reflects primarily work performed under small business innovation research sbir grants  which was completed in august revenue derived from corporate collaborations and licenses helps us fund our operations and may increase in the future if we are successful in establishing new collaborations and additional licensing of our technology 
we expect revenue to decline in fiscal compared to fiscal due to the recognition of the non recurring license revenue from alza in fiscal if we are unsuccessful in establishing new collaborations  additional licensing and grants  revenues may decline 
therefore  a reduction in revenue funds for conducting our research and development  clinical trial  manufacturing  marketing and sales efforts may occur 
expenses research and development expenses were million  million and million for the fiscal years ended june   and  respectively 
the increase in expenses in fiscal compared to primarily reflects increased clinical trial expenses for the deltavasc pad phase ii clinical trial  which was initiated in july the increase was partially offset by decreased expenses resulting from staff reductions in october the decrease in expenses in fiscal compared to was primarily attributable to staff reductions and savings resulting from the reduction of preclinical product development efforts and suspension of clinical programs in oncology in january  and lower expenditures resulting from the further reduction of staff in october valentis expects its total annual research and development expenses to increase in the future reflecting expanded manufacturing and clinical trial expenses associated with advancing the deltavasc pad product to phase iii clinical testing 
however  research and development expenses may increase or decrease depending on the outcome of the deltavasc pad phase ii clinical trial and if the company is successful in securing additional new funding and strategic partnerships to support increased spending levels 
the results of the trial are expected at the end of september the scope and magnitude of future research and development expenses are difficult to predict at this time given the number of studies that will need to be conducted for any of our potential products 
in general  biopharmaceutical development involves a series of steps beginning with identification of a potential target and including  among others  proof of concept in animal studies and phase i  ii  and iii clinical studies in humans each of which is typically more expensive than the previous step 
our research and development expenses currently include costs for scientific personnel  animal studies  supplies  equipment  consultants  patent filings  overhead allocation  human clinical trials and sponsored research at academic and research institutions 
general and administrative expenses were million  million and million for the fiscal years ended june   and  respectively 
the decrease in expenses in fiscal compared to and was attributable primarily to savings resulting from staff reductions in october and january  and lower clinical support costs as a result of reductions in preclinical product development and suspended clinical programs in oncology in january the decrease in expenses in fiscal compared to was also related in large part to reduced professional fees and other expenses discussed in the following sentence 
the increase in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily attributable to increased professional fees resulting from the company s capital restructuring efforts  the patent infringement lawsuit with alza corporation and lease exit expenses in fiscal  partially offset by savings resulting from the reduction of general and administrative staff associated with our restructuring actions 
we expect our annual general and administrative expenses to increase in the future reflecting support of expanded manufacturing and clinical trial activities associated with advancing the deltavasc pad product to phase iii clinical testing and expenses associated with increased corporate governance principally associated with sarbanes oxley 
however  general and administrative expenses may increase or decrease depending on the outcome of the deltavasc pad phase ii clinical trial and if the company is successful in securing additional new funding and strategic partnerships to support increased spending levels 
valentis recorded million for amortization of goodwill and other acquired intangible assets during fiscal  which is associated with the acquisitions of genemedicine in fiscal and polymasc in fiscal we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 sfas goodwill and other intangible assets on july  as of june  and  the company had goodwill of approximately  which is no longer being amortized but is subject to an impairment analysis on at least an annual basis in accordance with the requirements of sfas we performed the required impairment analyses during fiscal and fiscal  and determined that goodwill was not impaired 
corporate restructuring in conjunction with the company s announcement in january that it would suspend clinical development of its cancer immunotherapy products  valentis implemented a restructuring plan to better align the company s cost structure with market conditions 
this plan significantly reduced the company s preclinical product development efforts and suspended its clinical programs in oncology in an effort to lower future expenditures and conserve cash 
a total of positions  primarily in preclinical and manufacturing research and development  and associated general and administrative staff  were eliminated as a result of the restructuring 
for the fiscal year ended june   we recorded restructuring and related charges of approximately million 
on october   the company announced that it had further reduced its staff and planned expenditures to allow it to continue the development of its lead product  del for the treatment of a variety of cardiovascular diseases including peripheral arterial disease pad and ischemic heart disease ihd 
in addition  the company will continue to advance its the geneswitch gene regulation technology through the licensing to other companies 
in connection therewith  the company reduced staff by individuals in order to reduce the company s cash expenditures 
for the fiscal year ended june   we recorded restructuring and related charges of approximately  interest income and other income and expense  net interest income and other income and expense  net was approximately  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the decrease in interest income and interest expense and other  net in fiscal compared to  as well as compared to  resulted primarily from decreased interest income derived from lower investment balances  partially offset by decreased interest expense derived form lower loan balances and favorable foreign currency exchange rates 
interest expense for fiscal  and were approximately zero   and  respectively 
deemed dividends related to series a redeemable convertible preferred stock the deemed dividends related to series a redeemable convertible preferred stock see note redeemable convertible preferred stock and stockholders equity in our notes to consolidated financial statements include the accretion of warrants  the accretion of a beneficial conversion feature and the accretion of related issuance costs 
upon conversion of the series a preferred stock to common stock in january  the remaining million of unaccreted deemed dividend representing the balance of amounts attributed to common stock purchase warrants  beneficial conversion feature and issuance costs related to the series a preferred stock was fully accreted and recorded as a deemed dividend and included in the amounts discussed in the paragraphs below related to accretion of the warrants  beneficial conversion feature and issuance costs 
this deemed dividend  along with a deemed dividend of approximately  accreted during january  was included in the calculation of net loss applicable to common stockholders for the fiscal year ended june  the accretion of warrants for the fiscal years ended june  and was approximately million and million  respectively 
the accretion of the beneficial conversion feature for the fiscal years ended june  and was approximately  and  respectively 
the aggregate accretion value associated with the warrants and beneficial conversion feature were included in the calculation of net loss applicable to common stockholders 
issuance costs of approximately million were accounted for as a discount on the series a preferred stock and were accreted over the year redemption period 
accretion of approximately million and  for the fiscal years ended june  and  respectively  was included in the calculation of net loss applicable to common stockholders 
additionally  as a result of the simultaneous conversion of the series a preferred stock to common stock and the reduction in the series a preferred stock conversion price  the excess of the fair value of the common stock issued to the series a preferred stockholders over the fair value of the common stock issuable pursuant to the original conversion terms was approximately million 
this amount also was included in the calculation of net loss applicable to common stockholders for the fiscal year ended june  dividends on series a redeemable convertible preferred stock dividends on the series a preferred stock see note redeemable convertible preferred stock and stockholders equity in our notes to consolidated financial statements were calculated at value at the rate of per annum  and were approximately  and million for the fiscal years ended june  and  respectively  and were charged against additional paid in capital and included in the calculation of net loss applicable to common stockholders 
there were no dividends paid on the series a preferred stock during fiscal because all of the outstanding shares of series a preferred stock were converted into common stock in january new accounting pronouncements in november  the fasb issued emerging issues task force issue no

liquidity and capital resources as discussed elsewhere in this report  including further below  we have received a report from our independent auditors regarding the consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended june  that includes an explanatory paragraph stating that the financial statements have been prepared assuming valentis will continue as a going concern 
the explanatory paragraph states the following conditions which raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern i we have incurred recurring operating losses since inception  including a net loss of million for the fiscal year ended june   and our accumulated deficit was million at june  and ii we anticipate requiring additional financial resources to enable us to fund our operations at least through june  management s plans as to these matters are also described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
since its inception  valentis has financed its operations principally through public and private issuances of its common and preferred stock and funding from collaborative arrangements 
in june  we completed a private placement  in which we issued and sold  shares of common stock and warrants  exercisable for a five year period  to purchase  shares of common stock at per unit  resulting in net proceeds of approximately million 
the warrants are exercisable at per share 
in addition  we issued to jefferies company  inc  the placement agent of the private placement  warrants to purchase  shares of common stock at per share  exercisable for a five year period june private placement 
in january  we completed a private placement of  shares of common stock at per share along with warrants  exercisable for a five year period  to purchase  shares of common stock at per share  resulting in net proceeds of approximately million january private placement 
pursuant to a purchase agreement under the january private placement  in the event that we issue additional shares of common stock within one year of the closing in certain non exempt transactions for a price less than the average of the closing bid prices per share of its common stock on the nasdaq smallcap market during the trading days immediately preceding such issuance the threshold price  then we will be obligated to issue additional shares to the purchasers of our common stock and warrants in the january private placement 
we will not receive any proceeds from the issuance of these additional shares 
the number of these additional shares which would be issuable to each purchaser under this provision would be equal to the difference between the purchase price of per share and the threshold price  divided by the threshold price  multiplied by the number of shares of our common stock the purchaser has purchased in the january private placement 
in addition  in that event  the exercise price of the warrants would be proportionally reduced 
the shares of our common stock and warrants issued in the january private placement  as well as the shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants are restricted securities as that term is defined in the securities act of  as amended 
we entered into registration rights agreements with the purchasers in the january private placement and the june private placement 
pursuant to the registration rights agreements  we filed with the securities and exchange commission registration statements related to the shares issued to the purchasers and shares issuable upon the exercise of the warrants under the private placements 
the registration statements were declared effective by the securities and exchange commission on march   and august  for the shares issued to the purchasers and shares issuable upon the exercise of the warrants under the january private placement and the june private placement  respectively 
in the event we must suspend use of the registration statements for greater than consecutive days or a total of days in the aggregate during the time we are required to keep the registration statement effective under the registration rights agreements  then we must pay to each purchaser in cash of the purchaser s aggregate purchase price of the shares for the first month  as well as an additional of the purchaser s aggregate purchase price for each additional month thereafter  while the use of the registration statements has been suspended 
we currently expect to be required to maintain availability of the registration statement for at least two years following the closing 
in addition  if we issue any additional shares under the antidilution provisions of the january private placement s purchase agreement  we would be required to register those shares as well 
in july  our wholly owned subsidiary  polymasc pharmaceuticals plc  announced that it settled its patent infringement litigation against alza corporation  a unit of johnson johnson 
under the settlement  polymasc received million  and granted a worldwide license to alza under its peg liposome patents 
the agreement settles pending patent infringement litigation in the united states and germany  as well as opposition proceedings in japan and before the european patent office 
we have used and expect to continue to use the net proceeds from the sale of the common stock for general corporate purposes  which may include funding research  development and product manufacturing  increasing our working capital  reducing indebtedness  acquisitions or investments in businesses  products or technologies that are complementary to our own  and capital expenditures 
we lease our facilities and under operating leases 
these leases expire between november and october with renewal options at the end of the initial terms of the facilities leases 
minimal annual rental commitments under the operating leases at june  are as follows in thousands fiscal year ended june  our capital expenditures were  in fiscal   in fiscal and  in fiscal we expect our capital expenditures to increase in the future reflecting expanded manufacturing and clinical trial expenses associated with advancing the deltavasc pad product to phase iii clinical testing 
however  capital expenditures may increase or decrease depending on the outcome of the deltavasc pad phase ii clinical trial at the end of september and if we are successful in securing additional new funding and strategic partnerships to support increased spending levels 
net cash used in operating activities decreased approximately million and million to approximately million in fiscal compared to fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the decreases were primarily attributable to the decreased net losses and lower cash disbursements resulting from staff reductions in january and october  and decreased legal expenses due to the resolution of the patent infringement litigation against alza 
these decreases were offset in part by increased clinical trial expenditures 
net cash used in investing activities was approximately million for the fiscal year ended june   which primarily related to the purchases of marketable securities 
net cash provided by investing activities was approximately million and million for the fiscal year ended june  and  respectively  which primarily reflects the maturities of available for sale investments 
net cash provided by financing activities was approximately million for the fiscal year ended june   which consisted primarily of net proceeds received from the private placements of common stock completed in january and june net cash used in financing activities was approximately  for the fiscal year ended june   which related primarily to the payments of preferred stock dividends 
net cash provided by financing activities was approximately million for the fiscal year ended june   which consisted primarily of net proceeds received from the underwritten public offering of our common stock in december  partially offset set by payments on long term debt 
except for the quarter ended september   in which we reported net income of approximately million resulting principally from the million non recurring license revenue recognized under the license and settlement agreement with alza corporation see note  we have experienced net losses since our inception through june   and reported a net loss of million for the fiscal year ended june  our accumulated deficit was million at june  we expect such losses to continue into the foreseeable future as we proceed with the research  development and commercialization of our technologies 
depending on the outcome of the deltavasc pad phase ii clinical trial at the end of september  spending levels for research and development and general and administrative expenses may increase above current levels  to reflect increases in manufacturing and clinical trial efforts to advance the deltavasc pad product to phase iii testing 
at june   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and investments  and we anticipate that we will require additional financial resources to advance deltavasc and continue our planned operations at least through june  we are currently supporting the ongoing deltavasc phase ii clinical trial 
this multicenter  randomized  placebo controlled clinical trial conducted at approximately centers in the united states is a study performed within the fda regulations and guidelines regarding whether patients suffering from peripheral arterial disease can increase blood flow in their legs after being treated with deltavasc compared to patients given the placebo 
the results of the phase ii trial are expected at the end of september should the outcome of the deltavasc pad phase ii clinical trial demonstrate a statistically significant drug effect and is safe for the targeted population  we may seek additional financing and pursue corporate partners  to advance deltavasc pad to phase iii clinical testing 
should the outcome of the deltavasc pad phase ii clinical trial fail to demonstrate a statistically significant drug effect and is safe for the targeted population  our business and reputation could be harmed and the market price of our common stock could fall 
we may not be able to obtain additional financing and pursue corporate partners on acceptable terms  or at all 
any failure to obtain an adequate and timely amount of additional capital on commercially reasonable terms may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations  including our viability as an enterprise 
as a result of these concerns  management may pursue strategic alternatives  which may include the sale of securities  the sale or merger of the business  the sale of certain assets or other actions 
the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern 
the financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from the matters discussed above 
critical accounting policies clinical trial expenses valentis believes the accrual for clinical trial expense represents its most significant estimate used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
valentis accruals for clinical trial expenses are based in part on estimates of services received and efforts expended pursuant to agreements established with clinical research organizations and clinical trial sites 
we have a history of contracting with third parties that perform various clinical trial activities on behalf of the company in the ongoing development of our biopharmaceutical drugs 
the financial terms of these contracts are subject to negotiations and may vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows 
the company determines its estimates through discussion with internal clinical personnel and outside service providers as to progress or stage of completion of trials or services and the agreed upon fee to be paid for such services 
the objective of valentis clinical trial accrual policy is to reflect the appropriate trial expenses in our financial statements by matching period expenses with period services and efforts expended 
in the event of early termination of a clinical trial  we accrue expenses associated with an estimate of the remaining  non cancelable obligations associated with the winding down of the trial 
our estimates and assumptions for clinical trial expenses have been reasonably accurate in the past 
revenue recognition revenue arrangements with multiple elements are divided into separate units of accounting if certain criteria are met  including whether the delivered item has value to the customer on a stand alone basis and whether there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items 
consideration received is allocated among the separate units of accounting based on their respective fair values  and the applicable revenue recognition criteria are considered separately for each of the separate units 
non refundable up front payments received in connection with research and development collaboration agreements  including technology advancement funding that is intended for the development of the company s core technology  are deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the relevant periods specified in the agreement  generally the research term 
revenue related to collaborative research with the company s corporate collaborators is recognized as research services are performed over the related funding periods for each contract 
under these agreements  the company is required to perform research and development activities as specified in each respective agreement 
the payments received under each respective agreement are not refundable and are generally based on a contractual cost per full time equivalent employee working on the project 
research and development expenses under the collaborative research agreements approximate or exceed the revenue recognized under such agreements over the terms of the respective agreements 
deferred revenue may result when the company does not incur the required level of effort during a specific period in comparison to funds received under the respective contracts 
payments received relative to substantive  at risk incentive milestones  if any  are recognized as revenue upon achievement of the incentive milestone event because the company has no future performance obligations related to the payment 
incentive milestone payments are triggered either by results of the company s research efforts or by events external to the company  such as regulatory approval to market a product 
the company also has licensed technology to various biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies 
under these arrangements  the company receives nonrefundable license payments in cash 
these payments are recognized as revenue when received  provided the company has no future performance or delivery obligations under these agreements 
otherwise  revenue is deferred until performance or delivery is satisfied 
certain of these license agreements also provide the licensee an option to acquire additional licenses or technology rights for a fixed period of time 
fees received for such options are deferred and recognized at the time the option is exercised or expires unexercised 
additionally  certain of these license agreements involve technology that the company has licensed or otherwise acquired through arrangements with third parties pursuant to which the company is required to pay a royalty equal to a fixed percentage of amounts received by the company as a result of licensing this technology to others 
such royalty obligations are recorded as a reduction of the related revenue
