critical accounting estimates in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we make assumptions  judgments and estimates that can have a significant impact on our net revenue  operating income and net income  as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet 
we base our assumptions  judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
on a regular basis we evaluate our assumptions  judgments and estimates and make changes accordingly 
we believe that the assumptions  judgments and estimates involved in the accounting for revenue recognition  income taxes and valuation of non marketable equity securities have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements  so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies 
we discuss below the critical accounting estimates associated with these policies 
historically  our assumptions  judgments and estimates relative to our critical accounting policies have not differed materially from actual results 
for further information on the critical accounting policies  see note of our notes to consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with current generally accepted accounting principles that have been prescribed for the software industry 
revenue recognition requirements in the software industry are very complex and are subject to change 
our revenue recognition policy is one of our critical accounting policies because revenue is a key component of our results of operations and is based on complex rules which require us to make judgments and estimates 
in applying our revenue recognition policy we must determine which portions of our revenue are recognized currently and which portions must be deferred 
in order to determine current and deferred revenue  we make judgments and estimates with regard to future deliverable products and services and the appropriate pricing for those products and services 
our assumptions and judgments regarding future products and services could differ from actual events 
we have to estimate provisions for returns which are recorded against our revenues 
in determining our estimate for returns  and in accordance with our internal policy regarding channel inventory  we rely upon historical data  the estimated amount of product in our distribution channel  the rate at which our product sells through to the end user  product plans and other factors 
our estimated provisions for returns can vary from what actually occurs 
more or less product may be returned from what was estimated 
the amount of inventory in the channel could be different than what is estimated 
our estimate of the rate of sell through for product in the channel could be different than what actually occurs 
these factors and unanticipated changes in the economic and industry environment could make our return estimates differ from actual 
income taxes we provide for the effect of income taxes on our financial position and results of operations in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under this current accounting pronouncement  income tax expense is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and for deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity s financial statements or tax returns 
management must make significant assumptions  judgments and estimates to determine our current provision for income taxes and also our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against our net deferred tax asset 
our judgments  assumptions and estimates relative to the current provision for income tax take into account current tax laws  our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities 
changes in tax law or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of current and future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our financial position and results of operations 
our assumptions  judgments and estimates relative to the value of our net deferred tax asset take into account predictions of the amount and category of future taxable income 
actual operating results and the underlying amount and category of income in future years could render our current assumptions  judgments and estimates of recoverable net deferred taxes inaccurate  thus materially impacting our financial position and results of operations 
accounting for our marketable and non marketable equity securities it is our policy to review our equity holdings on a regular basis to evaluate whether or not each security has experienced an other than temporary decline in fair value 
our policy includes  but is not limited to  reviewing the cash position  earnings revenue outlook  stock price performance over the past six months  liquidity and management ownership of each investment 
if we believe that an other than temporary decline exists in one of our marketable equity securities  it is our policy to write down these equity investments to the market value and record the related write down as an investment loss on our consolidated statements of income 
the ultimate value realized on these equity investments is subject to market volatility until they are sold 
the stocks of a number of technology investments held both directly and by adobe ventures are not publicly traded and  therefore  there is no established market for these securities 
in order to determine the fair market value of these investments  we use the most recent round of financing involving new non strategic investors or other estimates of current market value 
it is our policy to review the fair value of these investments held by adobe ventures on a regular basis to evaluate the carrying value of the investments in these companies 
the evaluation process is based on information we request from these privately held companies 
this information is not subject to the same disclosure regulations as us publicly traded companies and as such  the basis for these evaluations is subject to the timing and the accuracy of the data received from these companies 
estimating the fair value of non marketable equity investments in early stage technology companies is inherently subjective  requiring significant judgment by management  and may contribute to significant volatility in our reported results 
results of operations overview of in fiscal  our primary goal was to deliver a series of innovative products to our customers to drive revenue and earnings growth 
with new releases of our acrobat desktop and server products  a new video software suite  new versions of our creative professional products and the introduction of adobe creative suite  adobe delivered more new releases in than in any previous year 
the new releases of our acrobat desktop products supported our epaper segment strategy which we renamed intelligent documents beginning in fiscal  which was to concentrate on the adoption of acrobat across several identified markets 
the release of adobe creative suite was also in line with our strategy for the creative professional business segment which was to continue our commitment to creative professionals by enabling more efficient collaboration and workflow through improved product integration and new functionality 
additionally  our overall revenues were positively impacted by the strength of the euro and the yen during fiscal we continue to focus on delivering innovative products and solutions for our customers to drive revenue and earnings growth 
in fiscal  we expect to see continued growth in our business segments 
our success could be limited by several factors  including the timely release of new products  continued market acceptance of our products  the introduction of new products by existing or new competitors and unfavorable exchange rate fluctuations 
for a further discussion of these and other risk factors  see the section titled factors that may affect future performance 
revenue year ended november  change to year ended november  change to year ended november  product    percentage of total revenues services and support percentage of total revenues total revenues    percentage is not meaningful 
we have four reportable segments that offer different product lines digital imaging and video  creative professional  epaper  and oem postscript and other 
the digital imaging and video segment provides users with software for creating  editing  enhancing and sharing digital images and photographs  digital video  audio and animations 
the creative professional segment provides software for professional page layout  professional web page layout  graphic and illustration creation  technical document publishing and business publishing 
the epaper segment provides electronic document distribution software that allows users to create  enhance  annotate and securely send adobe pdf files that can be shared  viewed  navigated and printed exactly as intended on a broad range of hardware and software platforms 
in addition  this segment provides server based solutions for enterprises and government agencies in the areas of document generation  document process management and collaboration  and document control and security 
the oem postscript and other segment includes printing technology used to create and print simple or visually rich documents with precision 
services and support is composed of professional services such as consulting services and training and support such as maintenance and technical support primarily related to the licensing of our epaper server solutions products 
professional services revenue is recognized using the percentage of completion method and is measured monthly based on input measures  such as on hours incurred to date compared to total estimated hours to complete  with consideration given to output measures  such as contract milestones  when applicable 
a significant portion of our support revenue comprises our extended enterprise maintenance and support offerings  which entitles customers to receive product upgrades and enhancements during the term of the maintenance and support period  which is typically one year 
our support revenue also includes support for our desktop products whereby we offer a range of support programs  from fee based incident to annual support contracts and developer support to partners and developer organizations 
as noted in our annual report on form k  we realigned our business segments at the beginning of fiscal the results for fiscal years and  and the discussion that follows  have been reclassified to reflect the realignment of the operating segments 
year ended november  change to year ended november  change to year ended november  digital imaging and video percentage of total revenues creative professional percentage of total revenues epaper percentage of total revenues oem postscript and other percentage of total revenues total revenues    the epaper segment includes professional services and support revenue 
fiscal revenue compared to fiscal revenue revenue from our digital imaging and video segment decreased during fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily due to a decrease in revenues from our digital imaging software products 
overall  we experienced a decrease in revenues from our digital imaging software products  which was mainly attributable to product lifecycle timing 
with the introduction of adobe creative suite  which includes photoshop  we have experienced a shift in revenue from photoshop to the adobe creative suite which is reported in the creative professional segment 
the decrease in revenues from our digital imaging software products was partially offset by an increase in revenues from our digital video software products 
the increase in revenues from our digital video software products was due primarily to new releases of adobe video collection 
revenue from our creative professional segment increased during fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily due to a increase in revenues from our professional page layout products 
the growth in revenues from our professional page layout products was due to the release of new products during fiscal  primarily the introduction of adobe creative suite  as well as the planned migration of customers from our business publishing products 
this increase was partially offset by decreases in revenues from our other products in the creative professional segment 
revenues from our business publishing products decreased due to the planned migration of customers to our professional page layout products 
finally  revenues from our illustration  type and technical publishing  and web publishing products decreased by  which was primarily attributable to product lifecycle timing 
revenue from our epaper segment increased during fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily due to new releases of our acrobat desktop products during the second quarter of fiscal  as well as increased sales and marketing focus  enhanced corporate and government licensing programs  and product price increases 
overall we experienced a increase in revenues from our acrobat desktop products  which was driven by continued adoption of acrobat desktop products in government  financial services  manufacturing  and the architecture  engineering and construction markets among others 
additionally  revenues from our epaper segment increased due to a increase in revenues from licensing of our epaper server solution products and the professional services and support revenue associated with these products 
the increase in revenue generated from the licensing of our epaper server solution products and associated professional services and support was primarily attributable to the acquisition of accelio during the second quarter of fiscal while we expect revenue from our server products to continue to grow in fiscal  we expect acrobat desktop product growth to be lower in fiscal due to our strong results in fiscal revenue from our oem postscript and other segment remained relatively stable during fiscal as compared to fiscal this was due to an increase in royalty revenues from our larger oem customers during the first half of fiscal this increase was offset by a decline in revenues due to continued weakness in the print business throughout the year and smaller oem customers moving to clone postscript technologies 
revenue from this segment has declined over the last few years and we expect this trend to continue  but if the decline significantly exceeds our expectations  it may harm our future results 
fiscal revenue compared to fiscal revenue revenue from our digital imaging and video segment decreased during fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily due to an decrease in revenues from our digital video software products due to a combination of product lifecycle timing and the economic impact on the digital video software market 
we also experienced a overall decline in revenues from our digital imaging software products 
we believe the decrease in revenues from our digital imaging software products was due to a combination of the economic weakness across the world  the impact of lower marketing spending by corporations resulting in a reduced number of creative professional customers  and the trend of our customers migrating towards the purchasing of adobe collection products as opposed to individual products  which are reported in the creative professional segment 
revenue from our creative professional segment decreased in fiscal as compared to fiscal  primarily due to a decrease in revenues from our business publishing products 
this decrease in revenues was due to a weaker global economy in when compared to there was a decline in revenues from our type and technical publishing products due to overall economic weakness in the geographic markets in which these products are used 
additionally  there was a decrease in revenues from our web publishing products which we attributed to weakness in the web publishing market as well as less sales and marketing emphasis on these products 
finally  there was a decrease in revenues from our illustration software due to product lifecycle timing and the continued economic impact on creative professional customers  who are the main end user for this software 
the decreases in revenue in our creative professional segment were partially offset by a increase in revenues from our professional page layout products which is attributable to a planned migration of customers from our business publishing products  increased marketing activities and growing customer demand 
revenue from our epaper segment increased during fiscal as compared to fiscal  primarily due to an increase in licensing of our epaper server solutions products and the professional services and support revenue associated with these products 
this increase is due to the acquisition of accelio during the second quarter of fiscal revenue from our oem postscript and other segment decreased during fiscal as compared to fiscal  due to the following factors continued weakness in the print business  lower average selling prices generating less royalty revenue from certain oem customers  and smaller oem customers transferring to clone postscript technologies 
geographic and platform information year ended november  change to year ended november  change to year ended november  americas percentage of total revenues emea percentage of total revenues asia percentage of total revenues total revenues    the increase in revenues  in fiscal as compared to fiscal  in each of our geographic segments was primarily due to the strength of our epaper desktop products 
additionally  revenue in emea and asia increased due to the overall strength of the euro  in emea  and the yen in asia  during fiscal the decrease in revenue from asia in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to weakness in the japan economy 
the decreases in the americas and emea during fiscal compared to fiscal were due to product lifecycle timing and a weak economy that negatively impacted the creative professional customer 
total application platform mix excluding platform independent and unix revenues for fiscal was split on windows and on macintosh compared to and  respectively  in fiscal and and  respectively  in fiscal we expect the trend towards the windows platform to continue in the foreseeable future as a significant majority of our epaper revenues are on the windows platform 
in adobe s experience  the actual amount of product backlog at any particular time is not a meaningful indicator of our future business prospects 
prior to major product releases  we tend to have significant levels of backlog  but at other times backlog is minimal and we normally ship products within a few days of receiving an order  subject to credit verification and our global channel inventory policy 
backlog is also subject to variability beyond our global channel inventory policy at the end of a reporting period  in amounts typically less than of reported revenue 
our global channel inventory position continues to be within company policy 
cost of revenue year ended november  change to year ended november  change to year ended november  product percentage of total revenues services and support percentage of total revenues total cost of revenues percentage is not meaningful 
product cost of product revenue includes product packaging  third party royalties  excess and obsolete inventory  amortization related to localization costs and acquired technologies  and the costs associated with the manufacturing of our products 
in fiscal and fiscal  cost of product revenue also included hosted server costs associated with the adobe designteam 
cost of product revenue decreased during fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily due to product mix 
during fiscal  we received higher licensing revenue versus shrink wrapped product revenue  compared to fiscal  which resulted in lower material costs 
additionally  cost of product revenue for fiscal included the amortization and impairment costs associated with the adobe designteam  which was discontinued during the third quarter of fiscal an impairment charge of million for capitalized hosted server costs associated with adobe designteam was recorded during fiscal cost of product revenue increased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to increased amortization of web site development costs related to adobe designteam which was launched in the fourth quarter of fiscal and the subsequent impairment charge for the remaining development costs 
services and support cost of services and support revenue is composed primarily of employee related costs and the related costs incurred to provide consulting services  training and product support 
cost of services and support revenue increased during fiscal as compared to fiscal  and from fiscal as compared to fiscal  primarily due to the acquisition of accelio during the second quarter of fiscal operating expenses research and development year ended november  change to year ended november  change to year ended november  expenses percentage of total revenues research and development expenses consist principally of salary and benefit expenses for software developers  contracted development efforts  related facilities costs  and expenses associated with computer equipment used in software development 
research and development expenses increased during fiscal as compared to fiscal of the total increase in research and development expenses during fiscal  percentage points of the increase were due to compensation and related benefits associated with headcount growth and higher incentive compensation and percentage points were due to an accrual for major product releases 
the remaining percentage points of the increase were due to various individually insignificant items 
research and development expenses increased in fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily due to higher compensation and related benefits associated to headcount growth from the acquisition of accelio to support product development efforts 
we believe that investments in research and development  including the recruiting and hiring of software developers  are critical to remain competitive in the marketplace and are directly related to continued timely development of new and enhanced products 
we will continue to focus on long term opportunities available in our end markets and make significant investments in the development of our desktop application and server based software products 
sales and marketing year ended november  change to year ended november  change to year ended november  expenses percentage of total revenues sales and marketing expenses include salary and benefit expenses  sales commissions  travel expenses  and related facilities costs for our sales  marketing  customer support  order management and order fulfillment personnel 
sales and marketing expenses also include the costs of programs aimed at increasing revenue  such as advertising  trade shows  public relations and other market development programs 
sales and marketing expenses increased during fiscal as compared to fiscal of the total increase in sales and marketing expenses  percentage points of the increase were due to compensation and related benefits associated with headcount growth  higher incentive compensation and higher sales commissions 
the remaining percentage points of the increase were due to various individually insignificant items 
sales and marketing expenses decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily due to decreased marketing and advertising spending 
general and administrative year ended november  change to year ended november  change to year ended november  expenses percentage of total revenues general and administrative expenses consist principally of salary and benefit expenses  directors and officers insurance  travel expenses  and related facilities costs for our finance  human resources  legal  information services and executive personnel 
general and administrative expenses also include outside legal and accounting fees  provision for bad debts  and expenses associated with computer equipment and software used in the administration of the business 
general and administrative expenses increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal of the overall increase in general and administrative expenses  percentage points of the increase were due to compensation and related benefits associated with headcount growth and higher incentive compensation and percentage points were due to increased insurance costs 
these increases were slightly offset by percentage points due to a decrease in depreciation related to assets that were written off in the prior fiscal year 
general and administrative expenses decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal of the overall decrease  percentage points were due to a decrease in contractor and professional fees  percentage points were due to a decrease in facility expenses as a result of lower rent expenses  and percentage points were due to a decrease in compensation and related benefits due to reduced headcount 
these decreases were partially offset by percentage points due to an increase in depreciation expenses 
restructuring and other charges year ended november  change to year ended november  change to year ended november  expenses percentage of total revenues percentage is not meaningful 
during fiscal  we revised our estimates of certain costs associated with our restructuring program that was implemented in the fourth quarter of fiscal as a result  during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal  we reversed the excess accrual related to severance and other charges and facilities 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we incurred a restructuring charge of million  which included severance and related charges and the closure of a facility 
the related restructuring program eliminated engineering  sales and marketing  and general and administrative positions worldwide in order to realign our resources for our future business plans 
this restructuring plan was completed during the fourth quarter of fiscal also  in the second quarter of fiscal  we implemented a restructuring plan to eliminate redundant sales and marketing positions  held by adobe employees worldwide  as a result of the acquisition of accelio 
the total restructuring charges  of million  included severance and related charges associated with the reduction in force and the cost of vacating a leased facility 
this restructuring plan was completed during the second quarter of fiscal in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we implemented a restructuring plan to realign our workforce to our future strategic goals and to align our resources with our lower fiscal revenue targets due to adverse economic conditions resulting in part from the events of september  this restructuring also enabled us to increase our investment in digital imaging  digital video and epaper based businesses in fiscal the restructuring charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal was million  all of which related to severance and related charges associated with the reduction in force 
during fiscal  we lowered our estimate of the total costs associated with this restructuring plan  resulting in an adjustment of approximately million 
the adjustment primarily reflected lower than estimated relocation and severance expenses and related charges 
this restructuring plan was completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal acquired in process research and development year ended november  change to year ended november  change to year ended november  expenses percentage of total revenues percentage is not meaningful 
on april   we acquired of the outstanding common stock of accelio 
accelio was a provider of web enabled solutions that help customers manage business processes driven by electronic forms 
we obtained an independent appraiser s valuation to determine the amounts allocated to purchased technology and in process research and development 
the valuation analysis utilized the income approach that takes into consideration discounted future cash flows 
based on this valuation million was allocated to in process research and development  which was expensed as of the date of the acquisition due to the state of the development of certain products and the uncertainty of the technology 
in december  we acquired fotiva 
substantially all of fotiva s assets were intellectual property 
fotiva was a development stage software company that created solutions to help consumers manage  store  enrich  and share digital photographs and other related personal media 
in connection with the acquisition  substantially all of the purchase price of million cash was allocated to in process research and development and expensed at the time of acquisition due to the in process state of the technology 
at the date we acquired fotiva  it was estimated that of the development effort had been completed and that the remaining of the development effort would take approximately eleven months to complete 
the efforts required to complete the development of the technology primarily include finalization of coding  internationalization  and extensive quality assurance testing 
we developed a new product  adobe photoshop album  that we released in the first quarter of fiscal using fotiva s image management technology combined with our digital imaging and epaper technologies 
amortization and impairment of goodwill and purchased and other intangibles year ended november  change to year ended november  change to year ended november  expenses percentage of total revenues percentage is not meaningful 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized 
instead  the goodwill associated with past and any future acquisitions is reviewed annually for impairment 
for further information  see notes and in our notes to consolidated financial statements 
intangible assets with definite lives are still being amortized and are included in cost of product revenue 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we assessed our goodwill for impairment 
this assessment did not result in an impairment of goodwill 
amortization and impairment of goodwill and purchased and other intangibles increased in fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily due to a goodwill impairment charge for the remaining book value of the glassbook acquisition 
the impairment charge was determined based on discounted future cash flows 
non operating income loss year ended november  change to year ended november  change to year ended november  investment loss percentage of total revenues interest and other income percentage of total revenues total non operating income loss percentage is not meaningful 
investment loss investment loss consists principally of realized gains or losses from the sale of marketable equity investments  other than temporary declines in the value of marketable and non marketable equity securities  and equity method gains and losses of adobe ventures 
during fiscal  net investment losses included net losses related to our investments in adobe ventures and our cost method investments totaling million 
this loss of million was partially offset by gains of million from the sale of our marketable equity securities 
during fiscal  investment losses also included write downs due to other than temporary declines in value of million related to our short term investments in salon media group  viewpoint corporation and virage  inc during fiscal  investment losses consisted of net investment losses related to investments in adobe ventures and our cost method investments totaling million 
we also recorded other than temporary write downs related to our marketable equity securities in digitalthink  inc  tumbleweed communications corp  engage  inc  virage  inc  viewpoint corporation  avantgo  inc  and salon media group  inc of million 
these losses were partially offset by gains totaling million from the sale of our marketable equity securities 
during fiscal  investment losses consisted of other than temporary write downs related to our marketable equity securities in tumbleweed communications corp  salon media group  inc  engage  inc  liquent  inc formerly esps  inc  avantgo  inc  viewpoint corporation  and virage  inc of million 
these losses were partially offset by gains totaling million from the sale of our marketable equity securities 
we also recorded net investment losses related to investments in adobe ventures and our cost method investments totaling million 
we are uncertain of future investment gains or losses as they are primarily dependent upon the operations of the underlying companies and market valuations 
these marketable equity securities are inherently risky investments and we may experience further deterioration in fair value in the future 
interest and other income the largest component of interest and other income is interest earned on cash  cash equivalents and short term fixed income investments  but also includes gains and losses on the sale of fixed income investments  foreign exchange transaction gains and losses  and interest expense 
while the average amount of our invested cash increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  our earned interest actually decreased by million due to the lower interest rate environment 
we also recognized million less in recognized gains on our fixed income portfolio 
those decreases were partially offset by an increase of million in other miscellaneous income 
interest and other income decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to a decrease in interest income of million as a result of lower interest rates and lower realized gains of million from the sales of fixed income investments 
the decreases in fiscal compared to fiscal were partially offset by a reduction in losses of million related to the lowered cost of purchased options used in foreign currency hedging 
income tax provision year ended november  change to year ended november  change to year ended november  provision percentage of total revenues effective tax rate our effective tax rate decreased in fiscal from fiscal and in fiscal from fiscal  due to the benefits associated with the structure of our international operations 
part of the tax rate decrease in fiscal was offset by a tax rate increase  approximately  due to the non tax deductible goodwill impairment expense 
factors that may affect future performance we believe that in the future our results of operations could be affected by various factors  including general economic or political conditions in any of the major countries in which we do business delays in development or shipment of our new products or major new versions of existing products difficulties in transitions to new business models or markets in the enterprise  government  consumer and creative professional markets introduction of new products by existing and new competitors  particularly microsoft difficulties in implementing strategic alliances changes to our distribution channel inability to attract and retain key personnel lack of market acceptance of new products  upgrades and services changes in demand for application software  computers and printers intellectual property disputes and litigation industry transitions to new business models renegotiation or termination of royalty or intellectual property licensing arrangements changes in accounting rules  such as expensing of stock options unanticipated changes in tax rates market risks associated with our equity investments as discussed later under quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we periodically provide operating model targets for revenue  gross margin  operating expenses  operating margin  other income  tax rate  share count and earnings per share 
we use these targets to assist us in making decisions about our allocation of resources and investments  not as predictions of future results 
the targets reflect a number of assumptions  including assumptions about product pricing and demand economic and seasonal trends manufacturing costs and volumes the mix of application products and licensing revenue  full and upgrade products  distribution channels and geographic areas these and many other factors described in this report affect our financial performance and may cause our future results to vary materially from these targets or from results from prior periods 
furthermore  if the economy worsens or the economic slow down spreads to other geographic areas where we do business  it would likely cause our future results to vary materially from our targets 
the slower economy may also adversely affect our ability to grow  and political instability in any of the major countries in which we do business may adversely affect our business 
the end markets for our software products are intensely and increasingly competitive  and are significantly affected by product introductions and market activities of industry competitors 
in the markets served by our epaper business which was renamed intelligent documents business beginning in fiscal  microsoft has recently launched a new electronic form tool called infopath as part of the new version of their professional office product 
we believe that microsoft s new infopath product competes with certain aspects of our intelligent documents product line 
given microsoft s market dominance  infopath  or any new competitive microsoft product or technology that is bundled as part of their office product or operating system  could harm our overall intelligent documents market opportunity 
in addition  microsoft is working on the next generation of its windows operating system  codenamed longhorn  which could be released as early as late it is anticipated that microsoft will add new electronic document capabilities to longhorn  potentially providing additional competition to our intelligent document products and solutions 
furthermore  microsoft has increased its presence in the low end and mid range consumer digital imaging markets 
if competing microsoft products achieve widespread acceptance  our operating results could suffer 
in addition  consolidation has occurred among some of the competitors in our markets 
any further consolidations among our competitors may result in stronger competitors and may therefore harm our results of operations 
also  as we seek to further broaden our customer base in the enterprise  government  consumer and creative professional markets  we may not successfully adapt our application software products  business models  or licensing and distribution channels to these changes  which could cause our operating results to suffer 
if we are unable to successfully implement as planned any of our strategic alliances or develop the necessary relationships with enough significant systems integrators to adapt to these changes  our business could be harmed 
additionally  these new markets may result in higher costs and higher acceptance  warranty and indemnification risks than our other markets 
we plan to recruit key talent for our future growth  especially to support our enterprise business 
competition for such high quality personnel  especially highly skilled engineers  is intense 
our ability to effectively manage this growth will require us to continue to improve our operational and financial controls and information management systems  otherwise our business could be seriously harmed 
we rely on equity compensation in order to recruit and retain highly skilled employees in a competitive environment 
if we are unable to provide adequate equity compensation incentives to effectively recruit and retain talented employees  our business may be harmed 
any delays or failures in developing and marketing our products  including upgrades of current products  may also have a harmful impact on our results of operations 
our ability to extend our core technologies into new applications and new platforms and to anticipate or respond to technological changes could affect our ability to develop these products 
a portion of our future revenue will come from these new applications 
delays in product or upgrade introductions could cause a decline in our revenue  earnings or stock price 
we cannot determine the ultimate effect these delays or the introduction of new products or upgrades will have on our revenue or results of operations 
we offer our application based products primarily on windows and macintosh platforms and on some unix platforms 
we generally offer our server based products  but not desktop products  on the linux platform as well as the windows and unix platforms 
to the extent that there is a slowdown of customer purchases of personal computers on either the windows or macintosh platform or in general  or to the extent that significant demand arises for our products or competitive products on the linux desktop platform before we choose and are able to offer our products on this platform  our business could be harmed 
we distribute our application products primarily through distributors  resellers  retailers and increasingly systems integrators  isvs and vars collectively referred to as distributors 
a significant amount of our revenue for application products is from two distributors 
in addition  our channel program now focuses our efforts on larger distributors  which has resulted in our dependence on a relatively small number of distributors licensing a large amount of our products 
our distributors sell our competitors products  if our distributors favor our competitors products for any reason  they may fail to market our products as effectively or to devote resources necessary to provide effective sales  which would cause our results to suffer 
in addition  the financial health of these distributors and our continuing relationships with them are becoming more important to our success 
some of these distributors may be unable to withstand changes in business conditions 
our business could be seriously harmed if the financial condition of some of these distributors substantially weakens 
in connection with the enforcement of our own intellectual property rights or in connection with disputes relating to the validity or alleged infringement of third party rights  we have been  are currently and may in the future be subject to claims  negotiations or complex  protracted litigation as part of our policy to vigorously defend our intellectual property rights  including rights derived from third party licensors 
intellectual property disputes and litigation are typically very costly and can be disruptive to our business operations by diverting the attention and energies of management and key technical personnel 
although we have successfully defended or resolved past litigation and disputes  we may not prevail in any ongoing or future litigation and disputes 
adverse decisions in such litigation or disputes could have negative results  including subjecting us to significant liabilities  requiring us to seek licenses from others  preventing us from manufacturing or licensing certain of our products  or causing severe disruptions to our operations or the markets in which we compete  any one of which could seriously harm our business 
additionally  although we actively pursue software pirates as part of our enforcement of our intellectual property rights  we do lose revenue due to illegal use of our software 
if piracy activities increase  it may further harm our business 
our computer network and applications could be adversely impacted by malicious code such as worms and viruses  which are released into the public internet using recently discovered vulnerabilities in popular software programs 
the documents created by our applications  even those with security features  are also vulnerable to malicious acts such as hacking 
although we have a response team that is notified of high risk malicious events from multiple sources and we take certain preventative measures  these procedures may not be sufficient to avoid harm to our business 
we currently rely on six turnkey assemblers of our products  with at least two turnkeys located in each major region we serve 
if any significant turnkey assembler terminates its relationship with us  or if our supply from any significant turnkey assembler is interrupted or terminated for any other reason  we may not have enough time or be able to replace the supply of products manufactured by that turnkey assembler to avoid serious harm to our business 
although revenue from our oem postscript and other segment remained relatively stable during fiscal as compared to fiscal  we expect revenue from this segment to decline in the future 
our overall business may be harmed if the magnitude of the decline significantly exceeds our expectations 
the continuing weakness in the economy and aggressive competition among printer manufacturers is contributing to pressure on the average selling price of printers  which may result in the reduction of our royalty arrangements or the adoption by an oem of alternative technology 
the internet market is rapidly evolving and is characterized by an increasing number of market entrants that have introduced or developed products addressing authoring and communications over the internet 
as is typical in the case of a new and evolving industry  demand and market acceptance for recently introduced products and services are subject to a high level of uncertainty 
the industry for software that addresses authoring and communications over the internet is still developing 
standards defining web graphics have not yet been fully adopted 
in addition  new models for licensing software may be needed to accommodate new information delivery practices 
the new models may be less lucrative for us than our existing business models 
moreover  critical issues concerning the commercial use of the internet including security  reliability  ease of use and access  cost and quality of service remain unresolved and may affect the growth of internet use  together with the software standards and electronic media employed in such markets 
our quarterly revenues and operating results are difficult to forecast and are likely to fluctuate substantially from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors 
these factors include delays in development or shipment of our new products or major new versions of existing products any seasonality of technology purchases in our geographical markets difficulties in transitions to new business models or markets  including the enterprise and government markets any delays in recognizing revenue on any transaction any changes in general economic conditions changes in our pricing policies or the policies of our competitors changes to our product offering models  including the creative suites platform our operating results are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
dramatic fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may have significant financial impact 
we attempt to mitigate a portion of these risks through foreign currency hedging  based on our judgment of the appropriate trade offs among risk  opportunity and expense 
we have established a hedging program to hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  primarily the japanese yen and the euro 
we regularly review our hedging program and will make adjustments based on our judgment 
our hedging activities may not offset more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates 
we prepare our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
these principles are subject to interpretation by the american institute of certified public accountants the aicpa  the securities and exchange commission the sec and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting policies 
a change in these policies can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even retroactively affect previously reported transactions 
our accounting policies that recently have been or may be affected by changes in the accounting rules are as follows software revenue recognition accounting for stock options accounting for variable interest entities accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets accounting for guarantees and indemnities in particular  new fasb guidelines relating to accounting for goodwill could make our acquisition related charges less predictable in any given reporting period 
it is possible that in the future  we may incur less frequent  but larger  impairment charges related to goodwill we have already recorded  as well as goodwill arising out of potential future acquisitions 
see goodwill and purchased and other intangible assets in note of our notes to condensed consolidated financial statements for more information on this new fasb pronouncement 
changes to these rules or the questioning of current practices may have a significant adverse effect on our reported financial results or in the way in which we conduct our business 
unanticipated changes in our tax rates could affect our future results of operations 
our future effective tax rates could be unfavorably affected by unanticipated decreases in the amount of revenue or earnings in countries with low statutory tax rates  changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities  or by changes in tax laws or the interpretation of tax laws 
in addition  we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other domestic and foreign tax authorities 
we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 
there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial position 
we hold equity investments in public companies that have experienced significant declines in market value 
we also have investments and may continue to make future investments in privately held companies  many of which are considered in the start up or development stages 
these investments are inherently risky  as the market for the technologies or products these companies have under development is typically in the early stages and may never materialize 
our investment activities can impact our net income 
we recorded pre tax losses from marketable securities and other investments in privately held companies of million  million and million during fiscal  and  respectively 
these amounts reflect realized losses from the sale of marketable equity investments  other than temporary declines in the value of marketable equity securities and net investment losses related to investments in adobe ventures and our cost method investments 
in fiscal and  decreases in the market prices of our marketable equity securities resulted in decreases in our pre tax income 
future price fluctuations in these securities and any significant long term declines in value of any of our investments could reduce our net income in future periods 
we are uncertain about future investment gains and losses  as they are primarily dependent upon the operations of the underlying investee companies 
due to the factors noted above  our future earnings and stock price may be subject to volatility  particularly on a quarterly basis 
any shortfall in revenue or earnings or any delay in the release of any product or upgrade compared to analysts or investors expectations has caused and could cause in the future an immediate and significant decline in the trading price of our common stock 
additionally  we may not learn of such shortfalls or delays until late in the fiscal quarter  which could result in an even more immediate and greater decline in the trading price of our common stock 
finally  we participate in a highly dynamic industry 
in addition to factors specific to us  changes in analysts earnings estimates for us or our industry  and factors affecting the corporate environment  our industry  or the securities markets in general  will often result in volatility of our common stock price 
employee and director stock options option program description our stock option program is a long term retention program that is intended to attract  retain and provide incentives for talented employees  officers and directors  and to align stockholder and employee interests 
we consider our stock option program critical to our operation and productivity 
option vesting periods are generally three years for all of the plans within our stock option program

liquidity and capital resources year ended november  change to year ended november  change to year ended november  cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  working capital stockholders equity  adobe ended fiscal with  million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  an increase of million compared to fiscal year end 
our primary source of cash is receipts from revenue 
the primary uses of cash are payroll salaries  bonuses  and benefits  general operating expenses marketing  travel  office rent and cost of product revenue 
another source of cash is proceeds from the exercise of employee options and another use of cash is our stock repurchase program  which is detailed below 
cash provided by operating activities for fiscal of million primarily comprised net income  net non cash related expenses of million  and increases in accrued expenses  income taxes payable and deferred revenue 
accrued expenses increased primarily due to incentive compensation related costs  sales and marketing programs  legal fees and accruals for major product releases 
income taxes payable increased due to an increase in taxable income 
deferred revenue increased primarily due to increased maintenance obligations 
these increases were partially offset by an increase in receivables at the end of the year and a decrease in accrued restructuring charges 
the increase in receivables was primarily due to the increase in revenues during the year 
the decrease in accrued restructuring is primarily due to the payments of severance and facility costs 
during fiscal  cash provided by operating activities of million was primarily due to net income  net non cash related expenses of million  an increase in income taxes payable and deferred revenue and a decrease in accounts receivable 
income taxes payable increased due to an increase in taxable income 
deferred revenue increased primarily due to increased maintenance obligations 
the decrease in trade receivables was primarily due to our improved collections during fiscal these increases in cash were partially offset by a decrease in accrued restructuring charges and accrued expenses 
accrued restructuring charges decreased primarily due to the payment of severance and related charges 
accrued expenses decreased primarily due to incentive compensation related costs 
cash provided by operating activities for fiscal of million was primarily due to net income  net non cash related expenses of million  and a net increase in operating assets and liabilities of million 
net cash used in investing activities in fiscal of million increased from cash used in fiscal of million  primarily due to purchases of short term investments  net of maturities and sales 
the increase in purchases of short term investments is attributable to an increase in cash from operations and proceeds from the re issuance of treasury stock during fiscal net cash used in investing activities for fiscal increased from cash used in fiscal of million primarily due to increased purchases of short term investments because of lower treasury stock purchases 
cash provided by financing activities in fiscal of million increased from cash used in fiscal of million 
during fiscal  more employees exercised their stock options due to higher stock prices 
in fiscal  the net result of exercised options and stock repurchases was an inflow of million due to the rise in stock price and lower stock repurchases as we were targeting higher cash levels 
cash used for financing activities for fiscal decreased from cash used in fiscal of million primarily due to stock repurchase activities 
cash used for stock repurchases in fiscal decreased due to a lower average per share cost 
we have paid cash dividends on our common stock each quarter since the second quarter of adobe s board of directors declared a cash dividend on our common stock of per common share for each of the four quarters in fiscal and under the terms of our lease agreements for our san jose headquarters  we are not prohibited from paying cash dividends unless an event of default occurs 
the declaration of future dividends  whether in cash or in kind  is within the discretion of adobe s board of directors and will depend on business conditions  our results of operations and financial condition  and other factors 
we expect to continue our investing activities  including investments in short term and long term investments and purchases of computer systems for research and development  sales and marketing  product support  and administrative staff 
furthermore  cash reserves may be used to repurchase stock under our stock repurchase programs and strategically acquire software companies  products or technologies that are complementary to our business 
adobe uses highly regarded investment management firms to manage most of our invested cash 
the total return on invested balances in fiscal was  exceeding the industry standard benchmarks established for our investment management firms 
external investment firms actively managed of adobe s invested balances during the year 
the fixed income portfolio is primarily invested in municipal bonds within the us and in highly rated corporate and sovereign obligations outside of the us the balance of the fixed income portfolio is managed internally and invested primarily in money market funds for working capital purposes 
all investments are made according to guidelines and within compliance of policies approved by the board of directors 
our existing cash  cash equivalents  and investment balances may decline during fiscal in the event of further weakening of the economy or changes in our planned cash outlay 
however  based on our current business plan and revenue prospects  we believe that our existing balances together with our anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital and operating resource expenditure requirements for the next twelve months 
cash from operations could be affected by various risks and uncertainties  including  but not limited to the risks detailed in the section factors that may affect future performance 
also  while we currently have no committed lines of credit  we believe that our banking relationships and good credit should afford us the opportunity to raise sufficient debt in the bank or public market  if required 
stock repurchase program i on going dilution coverage to facilitate our stock repurchase program designed to minimize dilution from stock issuance primarily from employee stock plans  we have historically repurchased shares in the open market  sold put warrants and purchased call options 
authorization to repurchase shares to cover on going dilution is not subject to expiration 
however  this repurchase program is limited to covering net dilution from stock issuances and is subject to business conditions and cash flow requirements as determined by our board of directors from time to time 
in fiscal  we did not sell any put warrants 
in fiscal and  we sold approximately million and million put warrants  respectively 
each put warrant entitled the holder to sell one share of adobe s common stock to adobe at a specified price for cash or stock at adobe s option 
at november   no put warrants were outstanding 
in fiscal  we did not purchase any call options 
in fiscal and  we purchased call options that entitled us to buy million and million shares  respectively  of our common stock on certain dates at specified prices 
at november   no call options were outstanding 
stock repurchase program ii additional authorization above dilution coverage in april  the board authorized a million share repurchase program  which allowed us to purchase shares in the open market and enter into contracts to repurchase shares during future quarters by selling put warrants and buying call options 
this program expired in fiscal in march  our board of directors authorized a program to purchase up to an additional million shares of our common stock over a two year period  subject to certain business and cash flow requirements 
the program expired on march  on september   our board of directors authorized a program to purchase up to an additional million shares of our common stock over a three year period  subject to certain business and cash flow requirements

these are exercises of outstanding put and call options 
off balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations our principal commitments as of november   consist of obligations under operating leases  real estate financing agreements  royalty agreements and various service agreements 
we expect to fulfill all of the following commitments from our working capital 
lease commitments we lease certain of our facilities and some of our equipment under noncancelable operating lease arrangements that expire at various dates through rent expense  net of sublease income  for these leases aggregated million  million and million during fiscal  and  respectively 
in september  we entered into a real estate development agreement for the construction of an additional office building for our corporate headquarters in downtown san jose  california 
under the agreement  the lessor agreed to finance up to million over a two year period  toward the construction and associated costs of the building 
the construction of the building was completed in december due to lower than expected financing and construction costs  the final lease balance was lowered to million 
as part of the agreement  we entered into a five year lease that began upon the completion of the building 
at the end of the lease term  we can purchase the building for the lease balance  remarket or relinquish the building 
if we choose to remarket or are required to do so upon relinquishing the building  we are bound to arrange the sale of the building to an unrelated party and will be required to pay the lessor any shortfall between the net remarketing proceeds and the lease balance  up to the maximum recourse amount of million residual value guarantee 
see note in our notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 
in august  we entered into a five year lease agreement for our other two office buildings that currently serve as our corporate headquarters in san jose  california 
under the agreement  we have the option to purchase the buildings at any time during the lease term for the lease balance  which is approximately million 
we are in the process of evaluating alternative financing methods at expiration of the lease in fiscal and believe that several suitable financing options will be available to us 
at the end of the lease term  we can purchase the buildings for the lease balance  remarket or relinquish the buildings 
if we choose to remarket or are required to do so upon relinquishing the buildings  we are bound to arrange the sale of the buildings to an unrelated party and will be required to pay the lessor any shortfall between the net remarketing proceeds and the lease balance  up to the maximum recourse amount of million residual value guarantee 
for further information  see note in our notes to consolidated financial statements 
the two lease agreements discussed above are subject to standard financial covenants 
the agreements limit the amount of indebtedness we can incur 
a leverage covenant requires us to keep our debt to ebitda ratio less than as of november   our debt to ebitda ratio was  well within the limit 
we also have a liquidity covenant which requires us to maintain a quick ratio equal to or greater than as of november   our quick ratio was  well above the minimum 
we expect to remain within compliance in the next months 
we are comfortable with these limitations and believe they will not impact our cash or credit in the coming year or restrict our ability to execute our business plan 
the following table summarizes our contractual commitments as of november  total less than year years years over years non cancelable operating leases  net of sublease income indemnifications in the normal course of business  we provide indemnifications of varying scope to customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products 
historically  costs related to these indemnification provisions have not been significant and we are unable to estimate the maximum potential impact of these indemnification provisions on our future results of operations 
we have commitments to make certain milestone and or retention payments typically entered into in conjunction with various acquisitions  for which we have made accruals in our consolidated financial statements 
in connection with our purchases of technology assets during fiscal  we entered into employee retention agreements totaling million 
we are required to make payments upon satisfaction of certain conditions in the agreements 
as permitted under delaware law  we have agreements whereby we indemnify our officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is  or was serving  at our request in such capacity 
the indemnification period covers all pertinent events and occurrences during the officer s or director s lifetime 
the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited  however  we have director and officer insurance coverage that limits our exposure and enables us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid 
we believe the estimated fair value of these indemnification agreements in excess of applicable insurance coverage is minimal 
as part of our limited partnership interests in adobe ventures  we have provided a general indemnification to granite ventures  an independent venture capital firm and sole general partner of adobe ventures  for certain events or occurrences while granite ventures is  or was serving  at our request in such capacity provided that granite ventures acts in good faith on behalf of the partnerships 
we are unable to develop an estimate of the maximum potential amount of future payments that could potentially result from any hypothetical future claim  but believe the risk of having to make any payments under this general indemnification to be remote 
royalties we have certain royalty commitments associated with the shipment and licensing of certain products 
royalty expense is generally based on a dollar amount per unit shipped or a percentage of the underlying revenue 
royalty expense  which was recorded under our cost of products revenue on our consolidated statements of income  was approximately million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
other information consistent with section a i of the securities exchange act of as added by section of the sarbanes oxley act of  we are responsible for listing the audit and non audit services pre approved in the fourth quarter of by our audit committee to be performed by kpmg llp  our external auditor

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk and financial instruments all market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for non trading purposes 
foreign currency hedging instruments we transact business in foreign countries  in us dollars and in various foreign currencies 
in europe and japan  those transactions that are denominated in euro or yen subject us to exposure from movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
this exposure is primarily related to yen denominated product and support revenue in japan and euro denominated product and support revenue in certain european countries 
in fiscal and  our exposures were billion yen and billion yen  respectively 
in fiscal and  our exposures were million euros and million euros  respectively 
in addition we also have long term investment exposures consisting of the capitalization and retained earnings in our non usd functional foreign subsidiaries 
for the fiscal years ending november  and november  this long term investment exposure totaled a notional equivalent of million and million  respectively 
at this time we do not hedge these long term investment exposures 
our japanese operating expenses are in yen  and our european operating expenses are primarily in euro  which mitigates a portion of the exposure related to yen and euro denominated product revenue 
in addition  we hedge firmly committed transactions using forward contracts 
these contracts do subject us to risk of accounting gains and losses  however  the gains and losses on these contracts largely offset gains and losses on the assets  liabilities and transactions being hedged 
we also hedge a percentage of forecasted international revenue with forward and purchased option contracts 
our revenue hedging policy is designed to reduce the negative impact on our forecasted revenue due to foreign currency exchange rate movements 
at november   total outstanding contracts included the notional equivalent of million in foreign currency forward exchange contracts and purchased put option contracts with a notional value of million 
as of november   all contracts were set to expire at various times through april the bank counterparties in these contracts expose us to credit related losses in the event of their nonperformance 
however  to mitigate that risk we only contract with counterparties with specific minimum rating requirements 
in addition  our hedging policy establishes maximum limits for each counterparty 
economic hedging hedges of forecasted transactions we use option and forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge certain operational cash flow exposures resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
these foreign exchange contracts  carried at fair value  may have maturities between one and twelve months 
such cash flow exposures result from portions of our forecasted revenues denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  primarily the japanese yen and the euro 
we enter into these foreign exchange contracts to hedge forecasted product licensing revenue in the normal course of business  and accordingly  they are not speculative in nature 
we record changes in the intrinsic value of these cash flow hedges in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  until the forecasted transaction occurs 
when the forecasted transaction occurs  we reclassify the related gain or loss on the cash flow hedge to revenue 
in the event the underlying forecasted transaction does not occur  or it becomes probable that it will not occur  we reclassify the gain or loss on the related cash flow hedge from accumulated other comprehensive income loss to interest and other income loss on the consolidated statement of income at that time 
for the fiscal year ended november   there were no such net gains or losses recognized in other income relating to hedges of forecasted transactions that did not occur 
the critical terms of the cash flow hedging instruments are the same as the underlying forecasted transactions 
the changes in fair value of the derivatives are intended to offset changes in the expected cash flows from the forecasted transactions 
we record any ineffective portion of the hedging instruments in other income loss on the consolidated statement of income 
the time value of purchased derivative instruments is deemed to be ineffective and is recorded in other income loss over the life of the contract 
see also note in our notes to consolidated financial statements 
balance sheet hedging hedging of foreign currency assets and liabilities we hedge our net recognized foreign currency assets and liabilities with forward foreign exchange contracts to reduce the risk that our earnings and cash flows will be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
these derivative instruments hedge assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies and are carried at fair value with changes in the fair value recorded as other income loss 
these derivative instruments do not subject us to material balance sheet risk due to exchange rate movements because gains and losses on these derivatives are intended to offset gains and losses on the assets and liabilities being hedged 
at november   the outstanding balance sheet hedging derivatives had maturities of days or less 
a sensitivity analysis was performed on all of our foreign exchange derivatives as of november  this sensitivity analysis was based on a modeling technique that measures the hypothetical market value resulting from a and shift in the value of exchange rates relative to the us dollar 
for option contracts  the black scholes equation model was used 
for forward contracts  duration modeling was used where hypothetical changes are made to the spot rates of the currency 
a and increase in the value of the us dollar and a corresponding decrease in the value of the hedged foreign currency asset would lead to an increase in the fair value of our financial hedging instruments by million and million  respectively 
conversely  a and decrease in the value of the us dollar would result in a decrease in the fair value of these financial instruments by million and million  respectively 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes  nor do we hedge our foreign currency exposure in a manner that entirely offsets the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates 
as a general rule  we do not use financial instruments to hedge local currency denominated operating expenses in countries where a natural hedge exists 
for example  in many countries revenue from the local currency product licenses substantially offsets the local currency denominated operating expenses 
we assess the need to utilize financial instruments to hedge currency exposures  primarily related to operating expenses  on an ongoing basis 
we regularly review our hedging program and may as part of this review determine at any time to change our hedging program 
see also note in our notes to consolidated financial statements 
equity investments we are exposed to equity price risk on our portfolio of marketable equity securities 
as of november   our total equity holdings in publicly traded companies were valued at million compared to million at november   a decrease of 
the decrease was due to sales of million and write downs of million  which were partially offset by a million increase in market value adjustment 
we believe that it is reasonably possible that the fair values of these securities could adversely change in the near term 
we have a policy in place to review our equity holdings on a regular basis to evaluate whether or not each security has experienced an other than temporary decline in fair value 
our policy includes  but is not limited to  reviewing each company s cash position  earnings revenue outlook  stock price performance over the past six months  liquidity and management ownership 
if we believe that an other than temporary decline in value exists in one of our marketable equity securities  it is our policy to write down these equity investments to the market value and record the related write down in our consolidated statements of income 
the following table represents the potential decrease in fair values of our marketable equity securities that are sensitive to changes in the stock market 
fair value deteriorations of   and were selected based on the probability of their occurrence 
marketable equity securities fixed income investments at november   we had an investment portfolio of fixed income securities  including those classified as cash equivalents  of  million compared to million at november   an increase of 
this increase was primarily due to strong operational cash flow  proceeds from stock option exercises and lower levels of stock repurchases 
these securities are subject to interest rate fluctuations 
changes in interest rates could adversely affect the market value of our fixed income investments 
the table below separates the remaining maturities of our fixed income securities into segments to show the approximate exposure to interest rates 
less than one year one year to two years greater than two years total  a sensitivity analysis was performed on our investment portfolio as of november  this sensitivity analysis was based on a modeling technique that measures the hypothetical market value changes that would result from a parallel shift in the yield curve of plus   or basis points over six month and twelve month time horizons 
the following table represents the potential decrease to the value of our fixed income securities given a negative shift in the yield curve used in our sensitivity analysis 
month horizon month horizon we limit our exposure to interest rate and credit risk by establishing and monitoring clear policies and guidelines for our fixed income portfolios 
at the present time  the maximum duration of all portfolios is limited to years 
the guidelines also establish credit quality standards  limits on exposure to any one security issue  limits on exposure to any one issuer and limits on exposure to the type of instrument 
due to limited duration and credit risk criteria established in our guidelines we do not expect the exposure to interest rate risk and credit risk to be material 
interest rate hedging instruments we are exposed to interest rate risk on operating lease obligations that are tied to short term interest rates libor 
while the exposure of our fixed income portfolio to similar short term interest rates may naturally offset some of the risk  in general as short term interest rates rise  it may negatively impact our operating income 
it is our strategy to hedge a portion of that risk 
our policy permits us to hedge this interest rate risk using swap agreements 
the swap agreements exchange variable interest rate payments for fixed interest rate payments with high quality counterparties 
our swaps are designated as cash flow hedges under sfas no 
because they hedge against changes in the amount of future cash flows 
the critical terms of the cash flow hedging instruments are the same as the underlying lease obligation  so the change in fair value of the swaps is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income 
if  for some reason  the terms of the hedge no longer matched the underlying obligation  the change in value of the ineffective portion would be recognized in other income loss on the consolidated statement of income 
our swaps mature at various dates through the third quarter of fiscal  consistent with the expiration of the underlying lease obligations 
the total amount of lease obligations subject to interest rate risk is million 
we have hedged million using interest rate swaps

privately held investments we have direct investments  as well as indirect investments through adobe ventures  in several privately held companies  many of which can still be considered in the start up or development stages 
these investments are inherently risky  as the technologies or products these companies have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize  and we could lose a substantial part of our initial investment in these companies 
it is our policy to review privately held investments on a regular basis to evaluate the carrying amount and economic viability of these companies 
this policy includes  but is not limited to  reviewing each of the companies cash position  financing needs  earnings revenue outlook  operational performance  management ownership changes and competition 
the evaluation process is based on information that we request from these privately held companies 
this information is not subject to the same disclosure regulations as us publicly traded companies  and as such  the basis for these evaluations is subject to the timing and the accuracy of the data received from these companies
