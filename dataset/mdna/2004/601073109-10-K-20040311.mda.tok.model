item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in connection with our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto and other financial information included elsewhere in this form k report 
unless otherwise indicated  all items refer to continuing operations only 
basis of presentation throughout this item  reference will be made to local currencies 
local currency results represent the foreign currency balances translated  in all periods presented  at millipore s predetermined budgeted exchange rates for  thus excluding the impact of fluctuations in the actual foreign currency rates 
in addition to analyzing financial results at actual rates of exchange  management uses this presentation because we believe that the local currency results provide a clearer presentation of underlying business trends separate from the impact of foreign currency 
the us dollar results represent the foreign currency balances translated at actual exchange rates 
executive summary millipore s objective is to be the partner of choice for critical tools  technologies and services used in the discovery  development and manufacture of therapeutic compounds 
we will achieve this by leveraging our understanding of current and expected customer needs  our technology and manufacturing expertise and our direct global access to the markets 
we believe this strategy will enable us to accelerate revenue growth over the long term  improve operating profitability and generate strong cash flows from operations 
revenue growth during revenue growth was comprised of growth in local currencies and an foreign currency impact 
this compares to revenue growth in of growth in local currencies and a foreign currency impact 
revenue from acquisitions in all periods was immaterial and did not effect any of our growth rates 
as described in item  we sell our products into the biotechnology  life science research and other bioscience markets 
additional information related to sales into each one of these markets begins on page of this report 
biotechnology market our revenue growth in the biotechnology market representing approximately of revenue in was in compared to in  all in local currencies 
sales of consumable products in this market grew and respectively in and however  sales of hardware declined by in compared to a growth of in hardware sales in this market are impacted by customers decisions to add to or modify their production capacity 
these orders can be very large and may result in significant variability in our period to period sales growth 
we believe that consumable growth patterns are more indicative of the longer term prospects for this business 
our revenue from the sale of consumables to a customer is dependent on a number of manufacturing variables related to the customer s process and the unique characteristics of the molecule being produced 
these include expression levels  the cell culture system  the purity of the cell harvest  dosage form  batch size  optimization of the process  design age of the plant and commercial success of the drug 
we have particularly strong and broad product offerings for use in the production of monoclonal antibodies  a specific class of biotherapeutics 
however  this is a relatively new market  with only monoclonal antibodies approved for commercial use 
our products are used in at least one of the manufacturing process steps in the majority of these approved drugs 
in the short term our revenue growth in the biotechnology market is impacted by the purchasing patterns of our customers who are directly influenced by the timing and approval of their drugs 
the sales cycle 
table of contents in this market is more of a long term process which follows the various stages of the drug approval process and may span five to seven years 
we provide a number of technologies that can be used in very small scale production of a drug and reliably scale up to full size manufacturing volumes with predictable efficacy 
as a result  our revenue related to a specific drug will increase over the various stages of the drug approval process  in particular as the drug moves into clinical trials and ultimately into commercial production 
we are continuously investing in new products and technologies to expand our offerings in this market 
we believe that our long term customer relationships  our specific and differentiating technologies for this market and the number of biotechnology drugs in the drug pipeline will result in long term sustainable growth 
life science research market the life science research market represented approximately of our revenues in and grew in local currencies in both and our revenue growth in this market is significantly influenced by the general economic climate and funding environment at life science research centers and contract laboratories 
the level of research and development spending by pharmaceutical organizations as well as funding of various private or government research institutions also impact our growth in the life science research market 
our primary market focus is drug development and protein research 
we believe there will be increasing demand by customers  primarily in pharmaceutical companies  for solutions that will accelerate the identification of drug candidates 
longer term  increased levels of protein related research will add to our growth in this market 
in the drug development and protein research areas  we provide targeted products and technologies that increase the researcher s productivity  decrease cycle time and improve the quality of leads 
other bioscience market the other bioscience market represented approximately of our revenues in and grew in local currencies in and in this market is influenced by many of the same economic factors as the life science research market 
we believe the major driver of the increased revenue growth in was the moderately improving economic climate in the us and stabilization of economies in europe and asia 
in addition  product sales to non biotechnology pharmaceutical manufacturers for use in drug production are included in this market 
our revenue from these customers depends more on the volume of drug production than the economic climate 
we have been supplying products to this market for many decades and are well positioned with our global distribution channels and recognized brand names to grow at rates equal to or greater than the underlying market growth 
we continue to enhance our product offerings into this market aimed at providing new functionality to meet our customers needs 
product type and geography in addition to markets  we evaluate our sales by product type and by geography 
approximately of our revenue is from the sale of consumable products 
we believe that a high mix of consumables results in a steady revenue stream as compared to hardware sales that are subject to our customers capital spending cycles 
these cycles may vary significantly from one period to the next 
geographically our sales in were distributed in the americas primarily the united states  in europe and in asia pacific 
approximately of our sales were made through our global direct sales force 
our sales force is augmented with regionally focused distributors and our on line web store 
our worldwide direct customer access allows us to rapidly introduce new products  apply our unique technology solutions to match customer needs and provide valuable feedback for our research and development team 
our mix of revenue by type and geography has been relatively consistent for each of the last three years 
profitability operating income as a percent of sales was in compared with in and in the primary reasons for the decline in profitability in was the impact of increased manufacturing 
table of contents costs and the million charge in the fourth quarter for employee severance and asset write offs 
manufacturing costs increased in as a result of increased spending associated with additional manufacturing capacity and new product and manufacturing process start up costs 
we will continue to invest in manufacturing upgrades in anticipation of future market demands and  therefore  would expect gross profit improvements in the short term to be modest 
our business operations are supported by shared service organizations that operate in regional centers 
these support functions include finance  information technologies  customer service  distribution  human resources and technical services 
the cost of these support functions will grow at a slower rate than the rate of sales growth 
we will continue to invest in sales  service  and application specialists in the field to drive sales growth 
we expect to continue focusing our r d programs on life science research and biotechnology applications 
as a result of the combination of modestly improving gross profit margins and leveraging our shared service infrastructure  while continuing to invest in sales  service and r d efforts  we expect operating income as a percent of sales to improve slightly in the near term 
cash flow cash flow from operations was million in compared with million in and million in the improvement in cash flow from operations in is primarily from higher net income  a slower rate of inventory build and an increase in current liabilities 
we expect to continue using cash flows from operations to invest in capital expenditures and reduce our debt 
future capital expenditures will allow us to continue to provide both the quality and quantity of manufactured product required to meet future customer needs 
given our historical uses of cash and our anticipated cash needs for the next three to five years  we believe that the cash requirements of the business can be met with our cash on hand  cash generated from operating results and our ready access to capital markets for competitively priced instruments 
critical accounting policies and estimates this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
our most critical accounting policies had a significant impact on the preparation of these financial statements 
these policies include estimates and significant judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an on going basis 
by their nature  these estimates and judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following accounting policies and estimates require us to make the most difficult and subjective judgments in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and accordingly are the most critical 
revenue recognition 
revenue from the sale of products is recognized when evidence of an arrangement is in place  related prices are fixed or determinable  delivery has occurred contractual obligations have been satisfied and title and risk of loss have been transferred to the customer and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
when significant obligations remain after products are delivered  such as site assessment acceptance  revenue and related costs are deferred until such obligations are fulfilled 
revenue from service arrangements is recognized when the services are provided 
for laboratory water systems  installation and maintenance service revenues are recognized when the site service visit is completed 
for validation services provided to biopharmaceutical customers  revenue is recognized when the contracted study is complete and accepted by the customer 

table of contents revenue for certain fixed price contracts associated with our process equipment business are recognized under the percentage of completion method poc 
historically  less than of our revenues have been derived from poc sales 
revenue is recognized based on the ratio of hours expended compared with the total estimated hours to complete the construction of the process equipment 
the cumulative impact of any revisions in estimates of the percent complete is reflected in the period in which the changes become known 
in the event assumptions used in calculating poc during the construction of the process equipment are later revised  total revenue and expenses estimated for contracts upon completion could differ from the latter estimate 
actual results related to poc estimates have been materially the same as the assumptions used at the beginning of each contract 
in addition  should a poc contract be cancelled while in progress  we would generally be able to offset the lost revenue and incurred expense with progress payments previously received during the design and construction period 
typically such progress payments can range between and of the total contract sales value 
historically  we have experienced few cancellations 
during the last three years  there have been no cancellations related to poc 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we regularly evaluate our ability to collect outstanding receivables 
allowances for doubtful accounts are provided when collection becomes unlikely 
in performing this evaluation  significant estimates are involved  including an analysis of risks on a customer by customer basis 
based upon this information  we reserve an amount believed to be uncollectible 
at december   the allowance for doubtful accounts represented approximately of gross receivables 
during the past three years  we have provided between million per year for allowances for doubtful accounts  which approximates bad debt write offs during those years 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in their inability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
in addition  revenues attributable to a particular customer would not be recognized in the quarter that collection from that customer was deemed unlikely 
inventory valuation analysis 
our product life cycle is generally a minimum of years and may be in excess of years 
therefore  given the stable demand for our products  we generally rely upon recent historic usage and future demand in estimating the realizable value of our inventory 
finished goods and components that are determined to be obsolete are written off when such determination is made 
in certain cases  for newly introduced products and overstocked products  future demand is considered in establishing inventory write downs 
raw material and work in process inventories are also reviewed for obsolescence and alternative or future use based on reviewing manufacturing plans  future demand and market conditions 
in situations where it is determined that work in process inventories cannot be converted into finished goods  the inventories are written down to net realizable value 
inventory at december  reflects cumulative net realizable value write downs of million 
should it be determined that write downs are insufficient  then we would be required to record additional inventory write downs  which would have a negative impact on gross margin 
once written down  inventory valuation provisions are not subsequently reversed 
valuation of long lived assets 
long lived assets are comprised of property  plant and equipment  intangible assets and goodwill 
we periodically review our long lived assets to determine if impairment has taken place 
the review of goodwill is performed annually at a minimum 
in addition  all long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable and accordingly  the net book value of the asset may be reduced 
significant judgments are required to estimate the future cash flows  appropriate discount rates and other assumptions 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for each asset group 
during and  we invested a cumulative total of million of a planned million project to expand manufacturing capacity adjacent to our existing manufacturing facility in ireland 
we have delayed completion of this facility as existing manufacturing capacity related to a core consumable product line supplemented with our stockpiling program can meet the expected demand of this product line through this facility is currently a multipurpose building shell that is expected to increase manufacturing capacity for this product line 
if necessary  this facility could be used for the manufacturing of alternative products 

table of contents we conducted an impairment review  during  of our goodwill based on a discounted cash flow approach that used our estimates of revenues and costs from our biopharmaceutical operating segment  as well as appropriate discount rates 
the estimates that we used are consistent with our future estimated operating results 
based on our impairment tests  the goodwill associated with our acquisition of the assets of cpg  inc cpg was not impaired during the year ended december  if the fair value of our biopharmaceutical operating segment were substantially reduced  then we may incur charges for impairment of this goodwill 
income tax provision 
we recognize income taxes when transactions are recorded in our statement of operations  with deferred taxes provided for items that are recognized in different periods for financial statement and tax purposes 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
in addition  we estimate our exposures relating to uncertain tax positions and establish reserves for such exposures when they become probable and reasonably estimable 
our valuation allowance is provided primarily to reserve against the expiration of general business credit carryforwards which can be utilized against future taxable income in the united states 
at december   we had general business credit carryforwards of approximately million that expire in the years through and foreign tax credit carryforwards of approximately million that expire in the years through of the million of general business credit carryforwards  approximately million is reserved as a valuation allowance 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  the valuation allowance may need to be increased if we are unable to generate sufficient taxable income within the statutory time period that governs general business credit utilization 
any increase in the valuation allowance could have a material adverse impact on our income tax provision and net income in the period in which such determination is made 
in  foreign tax and general business credits totaling million expired unused and were written off against the valuation allowance 
also  during we implemented tax planning strategies which will allow for the utilization of foreign tax credits which were previously reserved 
as a result  million of the valuation allowance related to foreign tax credits was released 
we have tax reserves which are attributable to potential tax obligations around the world 
over the last year  we have experienced increased tax audit activity 
we believe the reserves are necessary to adequately reflect tax obligations which may arise out of those and future audits 
we provide for us income taxes on the earnings of foreign subsidiaries unless they are considered indefinitely invested outside the us at december   the cumulative earnings upon which us income taxes have not been provided are approximately million 
if these earnings were repatriated to the us  they would generate an additional tax provision to reflect the us tax rate impact 
foreign tax credits would also be generated that would partially reduce the us tax liability associated with any repatriation of earnings 
we estimate an additional million tax provision would be required to reflect the us tax on such repatriation 
employee retirement plans 
we sponsor a retirement plan and post retirement medical plan covering substantially all us employees who meet eligibility requirements 
for both plans  we determine several assumptions that are used in calculating the expense and liability of the plans 
for the retirement plan  these key assumptions include the discount rate  expected return on plan assets and rate of future compensation increases 
in addition  our actuarial consultants determine the expense and liability of the plans using other assumptions for future experience  such as for withdrawal and mortality 
the actuarial assumptions used by us may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of the participants 
these differences may have a significant effect on the amount of pension expense recorded by us in future years 
during  we used a discount rate of  an expected return on plan assets of and rate of future compensation increases of related to our us retirement plan 
the most sensitive assumptions used in calculating the expense and liability of our us retirement plan are discount and expected return on plan assets 

table of contents the following table shows the impact on expense of a basis point change versus the assumptions used 
positive dollar amounts would result in improved operating income  while a negative dollar amount would reduce operating income 
us retirement plan sensitivity analysis dollars in thousands expected return on plan assets discount rate for the post retirement medical plan  our key assumptions include the discount rate and the future medical cost escalation rate 
in addition  our actuarial consultants also employ other assumptions for future experience  such as withdrawal and mortality 
the actuarial assumptions used by us may differ materially from future actual results due to changing conditions in the growth of medical expenses or longer or shorter life spans of the participants 
these differences may have a significant effect on the amount of medical cost expense recorded by us 
during  we used a discount rate of and an expected medical cost escalation rate that declines gradually from in and to in the following table shows the impact on expense of a basis point change versus the assumptions used 
positive dollar amounts would result in improved operating income  while a negative dollar amount would reduce operating income 
post retirement medical sensitivity analysis dollars in thousands medical cost growth rate discount rate on december   president bush signed into law the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of the act 
the act expanded medicare to include  for the first time  coverage for prescription drugs 
we expect that this legislation will eventually reduce our costs for providing retiree medical benefits 
at this point  our investigation into our response to the legislation is preliminary 
sufficient guidance is not yet available from the various governmental and regulatory agencies concerning the requirements that must be met to obtain these cost reductions as well as the manner in which such savings should be measured 
based on this preliminary analysis  it appears that our retiree medical plan will need to be changed in order to qualify for beneficial treatment under the act 
because of various uncertainties related to our response to this legislation and the appropriate accounting methodology for this event  we have elected to defer financial recognition of this legislation until the financial accounting standards board fasb issues final accounting guidance 
when issued  that final guidance could require us to change previously reported information 
this deferral election is permitted under fsp fas intent to refinance short term debt as long term debt 
our credit agreement allows for revolving loan borrowings of up to million 
borrowings against our credit agreement of million were outstanding at december   and have been classified as long term  because of our ability and intent to continuously refinance such borrowings 
if our intent to refinance changes  a significant amount of debt could be characterized as short term debt in future financial statements 

table of contents results of operations net sales the following discussion of net sales summarizes sales growth by the markets in which our products were used  by the geographies in which our products were sold  and by product types 
net sales by market we sell our products into the biotechnology  life science research and other bioscience markets 
sales growth as compared with the prior year in local currency  by market  is summarized in the table below 
local currencies in thousands percent sales growth biotechnology life science research other bioscience total local currency net sales foreign exchange total us dollar net sales of sales in local currency biotechnology life science research other bioscience total biotechnology market the local currency sales growth of in the biotechnology market is comprised of a increase in consumable sales and a decline in sales of hardware 
we sell consumable filter and chromatography media products in this market 
in addition  we sell hardware systems used in the production of biotherapeutics 
these filtration or chromatography hardware systems can range in price from twenty thousand dollars for standardized units to multi million dollar custom designed systems 
although consumables have always been the majority of our sales in the biotechnology market  the percent of sales represented by hardware can change period to period depending upon the number of systems that were sold or are in process 
the hardware buying pattern of our customers may vary from year to year 
in  there were lower capital purchases made by our customers  thus negatively impacting sales 
in addition  in the second half of  we adopted a more selective set of sales criteria which focused on those hardware orders with higher profitability or orders where the customer indicated an intent to purchase our consumables and services 
biotechnology sales growth was approximately the same in north america and europe at while sales in the asia pacific region declined by 
the biotechnology market is in the embryonic stage within the asia pacific region  thus sales growth may change as a result of the timing of a few transactions 
the growth of in the biotechnology market reflected the combination of double digit sales growth in both consumables and hardware sales 
sales growth by geography was in the americas  in europe and in asia pacific although the market is quite small in this geography 
european sales growth in was reflective of an expanding biotechnology business with both us multinational customers and european customers making investments in biotechnology drug production in europe 

table of contents life science research market the local currency sales growth of in the life science research market was due to strong sales of consumable products used in life science filtration  drug discovery research and laboratory water systems  with second half sales growth stronger than the first half of the year 
the difficult economic and funding environment at life science research centers and contract laboratories did not improve until the latter half of the sales growth of in the life science research market was the net result of strong revenue growth for drug discovery  based on a relatively small level of revenue  being partially offset by a decline in sales of products used in genomics applications 
other bioscience market the local currency sales growth of in in the other bioscience market was due to increased sales of consumable products  laboratory water purification systems and services across all geographies 
growth in the americas was strong at due to increased sales to non biotechnology pharmaceutical customers  improved laboratory research funding and increased spending on us homeland defense initiatives 
however  europe s growth was in  reflecting the continued difficult economic climate 
the sales growth of in the other bioscience market was a result of positive growth in european and us markets despite a significant reduction in the build out of new laboratories which adversely impacted the sales growth rate of laboratory water purification systems 
the growth in the european and us markets was partially offset by continued deflationary conditions  government funding delays and pricing pressures in japan and declines in latin america due to the uncertain political environment 
net sales by geography sales growth as compared with the prior year by geography  measured in us dollars and local currencies  is summarized in the table below 
us dollars in thousands percentage sales growth decline americas europe asia pacific total us dollar net sales local currencies in thousands percentage sales growth decline americas europe asia pacific total local currency net sales foreign exchange total us dollar net sales of total sales in us dollars of total sales in local currencies americas europe asia pacific total 
table of contents during  sales growth  measured in local currency  was relatively consistent across our geographies  ranging between and growth 
this is in contrast to when europe s sales growth in local currency was strong at due primarily to strong sales to biotechnology manufacturers while asia pacific sales declined due to general poor economic conditions in japan 
during  the us dollar continued to weaken against a number of foreign currencies 
in general  a weaker us dollar will positively impact sales growth 
the impact of translating foreign currency sales  primarily the european currencies to the us dollar  improved the reported sales growth rate by approximately basis points in and basis points in since we have a higher percentage of sales in europe than asia  weakening of the dollar against the european currencies will have a larger impact on our sales 
in  the us dollar weakened against the euro on average by approximately and against the yen by approximately 
net sales by product type sales growth as compared with the prior year by product type  measured in us dollars and local currencies  is summarized in the table below 
local currencies in thousands percent sales growth decline consumables hardware services total local currency net sales foreign exchange total us dollar net sales of sales in local currency consumables hardware services total our mix of revenue by product type has stayed consistent over the three years 
the decline in hardware sales in was due to the decline in sales of hardware in the biotechnology market  partially offset by strong laboratory water purification system sales 
the strong growth in the sales of services in both years was achieved across all markets 
these increases are due to service revenues associated with the installed base of water filtration systems as well as increased validation support services to our biotechnology and non biotechnology pharmaceutical customers 
gross profit margins gross profit margin percentages were in  in and in in  gross profit margins benefited from the growth in sales of higher margin consumables versus the decline in sales of lower margin hardware sales  as compared with offsetting this benefit to gross profit margins were manufacturing start up costs related to new product introductions  process validation costs  low initial yields associated with new products and new manufacturing technology as well as increased depreciation and overhead expenses related to expansion and improvement of production facilities and net realizable value write downs of obsolete inventory 
in addition  during the fourth quarter of  we recorded a charge of million related to manufacturing personnel severance and fixed asset write offs 

table of contents the gross profit margin percentage for as compared with was positively impacted by favorable exchange rates  a favorable mix of sales in higher margin consumables and increased sales in higher margin geographies  partially offset by lower initial margins and start up costs associated with the introduction of new products and increased inventory reserves for obsoleted products 
operating expenses selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased million or in and million or in  as compared with the prior year 
the increase in was primarily due to million of employee severance costs related to a reduction in work force  million of increased foreign exchange translation due to the us dollar weakening versus the euro and the yen  million for increased facility costs and million for salary related cost of living increases 
these increased costs were partially offset by million of reduced travel during the million or increase in was primarily due to million of increased foreign exchange translation due to the us dollar weakening to the euro and the yen  million increased salary and wages and million for increased facilities resulting from our former subsidiary mykrolis corporation mykrolis no longer occupying previously shared facilities  as well million increase in other sg a expenses 
partially offsetting these increases were a million decrease for reduction in bonus plans  million for reduced travel and million of savings from the restructuring plan 
as a percentage of sales  sg a expenses remained at approximately 
notwithstanding restructuring and cost reductions in other areas  we continued to invest in sales  service and marketing resources focused on maintaining or improving customer services  supporting the launch of new products and developing future sales initiatives aimed at improving our competitive position 
research and development expenses research and development r d expenses increased million or in and million or in  as compared with the prior year 
as a percentage of sales  r d expenses were in  in and in the r d expense includes million of employee severance costs 
excluding this cost  r d increased over the prior year 
the increase in r d spending is driven by an increase in programs focused on the needs of our customers for new and enhanced products for purification and separation of biological fluid streams and tools which will improve the quality of leads in the laboratory drug discovery process 
the increase in r d during compared with was largely due to our increased spending on new product development opportunities including membrane and chromatography based biotechnology and life science research applications as well as disposable manufacturing initiatives 
partially offsetting these investments have been incremental savings of million in as a result of the restructuring plan 
restructuring and other during  we initiated a restructuring program 
key initiatives of the program included globally streamlining of certain corporate shared services and divisional overhead functions to serve smaller organizations 
this action was completed in centralizing into two locations european shared services including order processing  cash collections and cash applications processes 
this action was completed during the fourth quarter of closing the manufacturing operation in china in order to reduce manufacturing infrastructures 
this action was completed in outsourcing certain manufacturing processes in puerto rico to third party vendors in order to create a more flexible cost structure 
this action was completed in 
table of contents these initiatives included a million restructuring charge and million of fixed asset write offs for assets that were no longer in use 
the restructuring charge included million of employee severance costs and million of lease cancellation costs 
approximately positions were eliminated and the affected employees were notified by march  for employees who temporarily continued in their existing positions  related salary costs were charged to operations as incurred 
in total  approximately employees left the company and million of severance benefits were paid 
we expected the restructuring program to yield annualized savings of approximately million 
the savings  which began in the second quarter of  were not fully realized until the savings related to reduced wages  facility related costs and depreciation 
the restructuring program was completed and final cash disbursements were paid in the second quarter of in  the restructuring program was executed in accordance with its plan and we realized million of savings of which million related to cost of sales  million related to sg a and million related to r d 
in  we realized million of savings related to the restructuring program of which million related to cost of sales  million related to sg a and million related to r d 
the savings realized under this restructuring program were materially consistent with our estimated expected savings 
upon completion of this restructuring program  we reversed million of the original estimated reserve  which included million for previously estimated lease and severance payments  as these amounts were no longer required and recorded million of assets that had been originally written off 
during  we settled a lawsuit that resulted in us paying million in damages and license fees 
in addition to completing the restructuring program during  we received proceeds of million and realized a gain of million in connection with a sale of real estate 
other loss on investments in  we recorded a million loss on investments which consisted primarily of the write down of our investment in purepulse technologies  inc purepulse 
earlier in  we had made a million equity investment in purepulse in conjunction with a transaction whereby we acquired rights to sell virus inactivation products utilizing purepulse s intense  pulsed light technology 
however  purepulse was unable to secure additional equity investors and  during the third quarter of  announced that it would suspend operations 
we renegotiated the agreement with purepulse in light of purepulse s suspension of operations 
the new arrangement replaced the original development and product supply agreement with a royalty bearing license under which we have exclusive rights  within our fields of use  to develop  manufacture and sell virus inactivation products using the purepulse technology 
net interest expense net interest expense decreased million in compared with and decreased million in as compared with net interest expense has continued to decrease as our average borrowings have decreased and the weighted average interest rate on our debt has decreased from during to during in addition  interest income increased during as our average cash balance was higher in compared with provision for income taxes our effective tax rates on net income for  and were  and  respectively 
these tax rates represent a blended tax rate primarily as a result of profits across different tax jurisdictions and specific items such as restructuring charges 
the lower tax rate in was primarily a result of the reversal of tax valuation allowance  partially offset by increase in tax reserves 

table of contents during the fourth quarter of  we capitalized certain historical research and development costs for tax returns on a retroactive basis  thereby utilizing net operating losses 
because of this capitalization and other tax planning strategies relating to the use of foreign tax credits  the million valuation allowance related to the foreign tax credits was released 
also in the fourth quarter of  we estimated and recorded additional tax reserves of million related to exposures previously mitigated by the reserved foreign tax credits 
the net impact of this activity resulted in a million tax benefit 
discontinued operations on october   we announced our plans  subject to certain conditions  to separate into two distinct companies by making our microelectronics business segment an independent  publicly traded company 
in accordance with these plans  the microelectronics business segment was separated into mykrolis on march  following the date that our management and our board of directors approved the plan of disposition for mykrolis  our consolidated financial statements and notes reflect our microelectronics business as a discontinued operation in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
on august   mykrolis completed an initial public offering the mykrolis ipo of million of its common shares at a price of per share 
net proceeds from the mykrolis ipo  after deducting the underwriting discount  commissions and other direct costs  were approximately million 
of that amount  mykrolis paid million to us as a repayment of amounts outstanding under the separation agreements between the two companies 
no additional mykrolis shares were purchased pursuant to the underwriters overallotment option provided for as part of the mykrolis ipo 
prior to the mykrolis ipo  our ownership in mykrolis outstanding common shares was  and at december  our ownership in mykrolis outstanding common shares was approximately 
on january   we announced a stock dividend of all of the shares of common stock of mykrolis owned by us 
the dividend distribution occurred on february  to shareholders of record as of the close of business on february  as a result of the planned distribution of mykrolis common shares to millipore shareholders  we recorded an increase to additional paid in capital for the gain on our investment in mykrolis of million at december  the million estimated loss on disposal of discontinued operations recorded in was reduced by million  during  to reflect the actual net loss of mykrolis through the distribution date 
the million loss from discontinued operations for represents the net losses of mykrolis from the beginning of through the adoption of the plan of disposition in the second quarter of the loss on disposal of discontinued operations of million million  pretax included estimated future operating losses of million for mykrolis from the adoption of the plan of disposition through the planned disposition date in the first quarter of and disposition expenses of million 
acquisition on july   we acquired substantially all of the net assets of cpg for million in cash 
the transaction was accounted for under the provisions of sfas no 
business combinations 
cpg had been a supplier to us for several years  providing a base material for some of our chromatography media products 
the acquisition included cpg s intellectual property and physical assets 
the purchase price has been allocated to identifiable net tangible assets of approximately million  and intangible assets of million  based on estimated fair market values of those assets  with the remaining million allocated to goodwill 
the results of operations of cpg  prior to the date of our acquisition  would have had an immaterial impact on our results 

table of contents market risk we are exposed to market risks  which include changes in foreign currency exchange rates and credit risk 
we manage these market risks through our normal financing and operating activities and  when appropriate  through the use of derivative financial instruments 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in revenues  net income and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
the potential change in foreign currency exchange rates offers a substantial risk to us  as approximately of our business is conducted outside of the united states  generally in foreign currencies 
our risk management strategy currently uses forward contracts and in prior years also used swaps to hedge certain foreign currency exposures 
the intent is to offset gains and losses that occur on the underlying exposures with gains and losses resulting from the forward contracts that hedge these exposures 
principal hedged currencies include the euro  japanese yen and british pound 
the periods of these forward contracts typically span less than three months 
we held forward foreign exchange contracts us equivalent notional amounts totaling million at december  the fair value of these contracts was million at december  we do not enter into derivatives for trading or other speculative purposes  nor do we use leveraged financial instruments 
although we attempt to manage our foreign currency exchange risk through the above activities  when the us dollar weakens against other currencies in which we transact our business  generally sales and net income will be positively but not proportionately impacted 
credit risk we are exposed to concentrations of credit risk in cash and cash equivalents and trade receivables 
cash and cash equivalents are placed with major financial institutions with high quality credit ratings 
the amount placed with any one institution is limited by policy 
trade receivables credit risk exposure is limited due to the large number of established customers and their dispersion across different geographies 
capital resources and liquidity cash flow provided from operations was million in  million in and million in the increase in cash flow from operations in compared with was primarily the result of higher net income including a non cash tax benefit of million  continued strong accounts receivable collection performance and higher accrued expenses 
partially offsetting these increases in cash flow from operations were increased purchases and production of inventory 
accounts receivable declined approximately million in compared with due to improved cash collections 
the decrease in accounts receivable resulted in days sales outstanding dso improving from days at december  to days at december   as measured in local currency 
the improvement occurred primarily in the united states and europe where dsos are at their lowest levels in three years 
we believe that our dso will continue at about the current level 
inventory increased approximately million from december  to december  this increase was primarily a result of planned stockpiling initiatives for key raw materials 
we are stockpiling certain key raw materials that are required in anticipation of and sales 
in addition  we are increasing our inventory related to a core consumable product to a level that is in excess of current requirements in order to delay the expenditure required to complete the expansion of manufacturing capacity 
the higher inventory balance resulted in a use of cash from operations 
accrued liabilities increased million from december  to december  approximately million of the total million of severance remained in accrued liabilities at december  as we reduced our global workforce by employees during the fourth quarter of these accrued severance payments will be paid during 
table of contents the increase in cash flow from operations in compared with was primarily the result of higher net income  strong accounts receivable collection performance and reduced foreign income taxes disbursements 
these increases were partially offset by increased purchases and production of inventory 
accounts receivable declined approximately million in compared with due to improved cash collections 
the decrease in accounts receivable resulted in days sales outstanding improving from days at december  to days at december   as measured in local currency 
improvement was achieved in all geographies  particularly in the americas and asia pacific 
inventory increased approximately million from december  to december  primarily as a result of planned stockpiling initiatives for raw materials and the purchase of long lead time production items that were required in anticipation of sales 
the higher inventory balance resulted in a use of cash from operations 
the cash flow that we generated from operations during was used for the purchase of property  plant and equipment and repayment of debt 
during  we purchased million of property  plant and equipment 
we expect to purchase in the range of to million during the additions and the planned additions are driven principally by our continued need to upgrade and add manufacturing capacity and  in  expand our campus in france 
there were various capital programs in progress at december  which we anticipate substantially completing during during  we invested million of a planned million project to expand manufacturing capacity adjacent to its existing manufacturing facility in ireland 
in  we invested an additional million in this building for a cumulative total of million 
since our existing manufacturing capacity can meet the expected demand of this core consumable product through  we have delayed completion of this facility 
this facility remains a multipurpose building shell 
when completed  the facility is expected to increase manufacturing capacity for our core consumable product 
however  if necessary  this facility could be used for alternative manufacturing purposes 
during  the operating cash flow we generated was used for investing activities that included the purchase of property  plant and equipment  the acquisition of cpg and investment in intangible and other assets 
we purchased million of property  plant and equipment during the additions principally involved increasing manufacturing capacity and research and development facilities 
the various capital programs in progress at december  were substantially completed during with the exception of the irish consumable manufacturing facility mentioned above 
in  we also paid million for the acquisition of the assets of cpg 
cash flows from financing activities  during  were principally a result of receiving million from employees exercising stock options 
we also repaid million of borrowings under our revolving line of credit 
in  we received million from stock options that were exercised by our employees 
in addition  we increased borrowings under our revolving credit facility by million partially to assist with the repayment of a million note and million payment of a dividend declared in and paid in beginning in  we decided to discontinue cash dividend payments  instead focusing on investing in r d and building productive capacity 
during  we funded mykrolis million to support its operations  prior to our distribution of mykrolis stock to our shareholders 
the mykrolis ipo in august resulted in net proceeds of million 
these proceeds less million retained by mykrolis pursuant to the separation agreements between millipore and mykrolis  and an additional million of cash generated from mykrolis operations through the date of the mykrolis ipo resulted in net cash provided from discontinued operations of approximately million in in october  we entered into a five year unsecured revolving credit agreement that allows for revolving loan borrowings of up to million 
the terms for interest rates on individual borrowings are established for periods not to exceed twelve months 
because of our ability and intent to continuously refinance such borrowings under our revolving credit agreement  short term borrowings expected to be refinanced  including million of amounts outstanding at december   have been classified as long term 
interest is payable on outstanding borrowings at a floating rate defined in the agreement as eurocurrency rate plus a margin 
the credit 
table of contents agreement also calls for a facility fee at a rate ranging from to percent of the available facility 
the exact amount of the margin and the facility fee is dependent on our debt rating 
during the fourth quarter of  a leading debt rating agency upgraded our rating 
in the first quarter of  another leading agency reaffirmed the rating with a positive outlook 
the credit agreement calls for us to maintain certain financial covenants in the areas of leverage ratios and interest coverage 
we are compliant with all required covenants 
on april   we used available borrowing capacity under the credit agreement to satisfy the million unsecured note due at that time 
during the first quarter of  we repaid the million note that became due in march we maintain various retirement plans for the benefit of our us employees 
at december   our us retirement plan was underfunded relative to its accumulated benefit obligation by million 
we anticipate funding for this plan will be less than million over the next twelve months 
fluctuations in the fair market value of assets related to these plans will affect pension expense in future years 
we believe that our balances of cash and cash equivalents  cash flows expected to be generated by future operating activities  our ready access to capital markets for competitively priced instruments and funds available under our revolving credit agreement will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements over the next twelve to twenty four months

business outlook and uncertainties the following statements are based on current expectations 
these statements are forward looking and actual results may differ materially 
sales we expect sales in local currencies to increase to percentage points over we expect our sales to increase within the biotechnology market that we serve by an amount that could exceed our overall growth 
over the long term  our rate of growth in the biotechnology market will accelerate as our customers progress in their development of therapeutic compounds  particularly monoclonal antibodies 
our biotechnology customers purchase our products for use in their validated production processes 
accordingly  it is important to participate in the development of the manufacturing process for these new therapeutic compounds in order to be specified into the ultimate manufacturing process 
adoption of new technologies and products requires a lengthy validation process prior to adoption 
growth in this market is highly dependent on the development and approval of new therapeutic compounds and their commercial success 
it is difficult to ascertain the number or timing of such approvals and the extent of the commercial success of the approved compounds 
the number of drugs at various stages in the development pipeline has increased over the past two years 
there are approximately antibodies which are of particular interest to us due to our specific technology solutions 
more importantly there are approximately antibodies in phase ii and iii of the approval process 
we may not realize significant revenue growth from drugs in their first year of approval 
significant revenue growth will not occur unless and until the drug has been successfully accepted in the market 

table of contents we expect sales growth within the life science research market to approximate the same rate as our overall growth 
we believe that the general economic environment is beginning to show improvement and expect that there will be an increase in drug development spending and a gradual increase in spending for protein research 
we expect that our new products and protocols used in testing for absorption  solubility and protein binding will successfully penetrate the drug discovery market from target identification through validation 
the extent to which these trends will affect us is very difficult to ascertain 
our other bioscience market is expected to be our slowest growing market in we expect that sales in this market will continue to be impacted by economic pressures  yet the growth rates will approximate our overall growth 
approximately percent of our sales are to customers outside of the americas and are generally denominated in foreign currencies 
as previously noted  currencies had a net positive impact to sales in as compared with if the strong euro and japanese yen rates as of december  remain in effect throughout all of  there would be a significant impact on reported sales growth potentially increasing sales growth by basis points 
our products are made from a wide variety of raw materials that are generally available from alternate sources of supply 
for certain critical raw materials  we have qualified only a single source 
we periodically purchase quantities of some of these critical raw materials in excess of current requirements  in anticipation of future manufacturing needs 
with sufficient lead times  we believe we would be able to validate alternate suppliers for each of these raw materials 
several of these critical raw materials are used in a significant portion of our products and if we were unable to obtain supply of any one of them  the loss of revenues to us would be material 
gross margins we expect gross margin percentages of approximately in  approximately equal to although we expect to benefit from increased production volumes  we are cautious about expecting significant margin expansion in the near future 
we intend to continue to invest in buildings  equipment and personnel upgrades in our manufacturing operations to meet both the future volume demands of our customers as well as keep up with the increasingly demanding manufacturing quality standards of the customers we serve 
operating expenses we expect that operating expenses  as a percentage of sales  in will approximate the percentage achieved in the previous year primarily as a result of continued investment in strategic r d projects 
we expect r d expense to average between and of net sales 
in addition  we will continue to invest in sales  service and marketing resources focused on maintaining or improving customer services  supporting the launch of new products and development of future sales initiatives aimed at improving our competitive positions 
we expect sg a expense to average of net sales 
net interest expense  capital resources and liquidity net interest expense is expected to decrease again in  as we intend to use cash to reduce outstanding borrowings 
during the first quarter of  we repaid the million note that became due in march provision for income taxes the effective tax rate in is projected to be approximately  compared with an effective rate of for excluding the impact of the reversal of tax valuation allowance  establishment of tax reserves and the tax effect related to employee severance  our effective tax rate would have been approximately 
the expected higher tax rate in is due to an expected higher mix of profits in higher tax jurisdictions 
capital spending we expect to spend approximately million for fixed asset additions in approximately of our capital expenditures will be focused on expanding our campus in france to increase manufacturing space and further upgrades to our new hampshire biopharmaceutical manufacturing facility 
we also expect that depreciation expense will be approximately million higher than reported in
