item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein 
all significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated 
overview we are a leading provider of contract land drilling services in the united states with a fleet of rigs  of which rigs are currently marketed 
our customers include independent producers and major oil and gas companies 
we conduct all of our operations through our subsidiaries in the ark la tex  gulf coast  mississippi alabama  south texas  west texas and rocky mountain drilling markets 
our drilling contracts generally provide compensation on a daywork  turnkey or footage basis see item business 
our business is cyclical and our financial results depend upon several factors 
these factors include the overall demand for land drilling services  the level of demand for turnkey and footage services  the demand for deep versus shallow drilling services  the dayrates we receive for our services and our success drilling turnkey and footage wells 
rig activity after a modest increase in our number of rigs working in the first quarter of  our rig count has remained relatively stable 
our premium rig fleet is biased towards deep gas drilling and we believe that our activity and market share have been adversely affected by the general lack of deep drilling in this current industry cycle 
the table below shows the average number of land rigs working in the united states according to the baker hughes rotary rig count and the average number of our rigs working 
domestic land rig full full q to count q q q q year q q q q year date baker hughes grey wolf drilling contract bid rates daywork dayrates are generally driven by utilization 
our daywork bid rates ranged between  and  per rig day during the fourth quarter of however  as the land rig count has increased  our leading edge bid rates have risen to between  and  per rig day 
all leading edge bid rates exclude fuel and top drives 
we believe that the drilling contract dayrates have been affected by an increase in the number of rigs available  as well as by the focus by our competitors on market share rather than higher dayrates 
in addition to our fleet of drilling rigs  we currently own top drives for which our current bid rates range from  to  per day 
bid rates for our top drives are in addition to the above stated bid rates for our rigs 
turnkey and footage contract activity turnkey and footage work continues to be an important part of our business and operating strategy 
our engineering and operating expertise allow us to provide this service to our customers and has historically provided higher revenues and operating margins per rig day worked than under daywork contracts 
however  we are typically required to bear additional operating costs such as drill bits that would otherwise be paid by the customer under daywork contracts 
in  our turnkey and footage operating margin revenues less drilling operations expenses was  per rig day compared to a daywork operating margin of  per rig day  and our turnkey and footage revenue was  per rig day compared to  per rig day for daywork 
for the year ended december   turnkey and footage work represented of our operating margin and of total days worked compared to of our operating margin and of total days worked in the operating margins generated on turnkey and footage contracts vary widely based upon a number of factors  including the location of the contracted work as well as the depth and level of complexity of the wells drilled 
the demand for drilling services under turnkey and footage contracts has historically been greater during periods of overall lower demand 
while demand has been somewhat higher as evidenced by the increase in rig count  the demand for turnkey services has not declined 
we believe this is due in large part to current daywork rates which have increased only slightly despite the increase in rig count 
fourth quarter financial results the fourth quarter of exceeded our previous guidance for the quarter 
our previous guidance for the fourth quarter was a loss per share of on a diluted basis and an operating margin of million or approximately  per rig day 
our earnings per share on a diluted basis was actually for the fourth quarter and our total operating margin revenues less drilling operations expenses was million  or  per rig day 
the fourth quarter operating margin consists of million from turnkey contracts  million from daywork contracts  and million from the sale of a claim in bankruptcy  against a bankrupt customer  for revenues related to the early termination of a long term contract 
we exceeded our previous guidance primarily due to a record quarter from our turnkey business and the sale of the claim noted above 
we averaged rigs working on turnkey contracts during the fourth quarter  representing of the total rig days and of our operating margin 
the operating margin per rig day for turnkey work was  in the fourth quarter of compared to  in the fourth quarter of this increase is due mainly to the complexity and depth of the turnkey wells drilled in the fourth quarter of we believe that turnkey work will remain strong in the first quarter of  however  we are not expecting a repeat of the margin earned in the fourth quarter 
first quarter outlook based on currently anticipated levels of activity and dayrates  we expect to generate an operating margin of approximately million  or  per rig day for the first quarter of net loss per share is expected to be approximately on a diluted basis  projecting an annual tax benefit rate of approximately 
we expect depreciation expense of approximately million and interest expense of approximately million in the first quarter of capital expenditures for are currently projected to be million to million subject to the actual level of rig activity 
these projections are forward looking statements and while we believe our estimates are reasonable  we can give no assurance that such expectations or the assumptions that underlie such assumptions will prove to be correct 
we expect to average between eight and rigs working under turnkey and footage contracts during the first quarter of  however  there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain the current level of activity or operating margins derived from turnkey and footage contracts 
see item business forward looking statements for important factors that could cause actual results to be differ materially from our expectations 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements require our management to make subjective estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
however  these estimates  judgments and assumptions concern matters that are inherently uncertain 
accordingly  actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates made by management  sometimes materially 
critical accounting policies and estimates are defined as those that are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and operating results and require management s most subjective judgments 
the accounting policies that we believe are critical are property and equipment  impairment of long lived assets  revenue recognition  insurance accruals  and income taxes 
property and equipment 
property and equipment are stated at cost with depreciation calculated using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
we expense our maintenance and repair costs as incurred 
we estimate the useful lives of our assets are between three and fifteen years 
impairment of long lived assets 
we assess the impairment of our long lived assets under statement of financial accounting standards board sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
such indicators include changes in our business plans  a change in the physical condition of a long lived asset or the extent or manner in which it is being used  or a severe or sustained downturn in the oil and gas industry 
if we determine that a triggering event  such as those described previously  has occurred we perform a review of our rig and rig equipment 
our review is performed by comparing the carrying value of each rig to the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows for that rig 
if the carrying value of any rig is more than the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows expected to result from the use of the rig  a write down of the rig to estimated fair market value must be made 
the estimated fair market value is the amount at which an asset could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties 
quoted market prices in active markets are the best estimate of fair market value  however  quoted market prices are generally not available 
as a result  fair value must be determined based upon other valuation techniques 
this could include appraisals or present value calculations 
the calculation of undiscounted future net cash flows and fair market value is based on our estimates and projections 
the demand for land drilling services is cyclical and has historically resulted in fluctuations in rig utilization 
the severity and duration of the downturn during triggered an asset impairment charge of million 
we believe the contract drilling industry will continue to be cyclical and rig utilization will fluctuate 
the likelihood of an asset impairment increases during extended periods of rig inactivity 
each year we evaluate our cold stacked and inventory rigs and determine our intentions for their future use 
this evaluation takes into consideration  among other things  the physical condition and marketability of the rig  and projected reactivation or refurbishment cost 
if we were to change our intended use of some or all of the rigs  we could be required under sfas no 
to record an impairment charge 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded a pre tax  non cash asset impairment charge of million after performing such a review 
as we no longer intended to return five of those rigs to service  but use their component parts as spare equipment inventory  we recorded the charge to write the rigs down to their fair market value and reduced the number of drilling rigs in our fleet by five 
in  no impairment of our long lived assets was recorded as no change in circumstances or in our intentions indicated that the carrying value of the assets was not recoverable 
we currently have cold stacked and inventory rigs 
revenue recognition 
revenue from daywork and footage contracts is recognized when earned as services are performed under the provisions of the contracts 
revenue from turnkey drilling contracts is recognized using the percentage of completion method based upon costs incurred to date compared to our estimate of the total contract costs 
under the percentage of completion  we make estimates of the total contract costs to be incurred  and to the extent these estimates change  the amount of revenue recognized could be affected 
the significance of the accrued turnkey revenue varies from period to period depending on the overall level of demand for our services and the portion of that demand that is for turnkey services 
at december   there were eight turnkey wells in progress versus four wells at december   with accrued revenue of million and million  respectively at such dates 
anticipated losses  if any  on uncompleted contracts are recorded at the time our estimated costs exceed the contract revenue 
insurance accruals 
we maintain insurance coverage related to workers compensation and general liability claims up to million per occurrence with an aggregate of million for general liability claims 
these policies include deductibles of  per occurrence for workers compensation coverage and  per occurrence for general liability coverage 
if losses should exceed the workers compensation and general liability policy amounts  we have excess liability coverage up to a maximum of million 
at december  and  we had million and million  respectively  accrued for losses incurred within the deductible amounts for workers compensation and general liability claims 
the amount accrued for the provision for losses incurred varies depending on the number and nature of the claims outstanding at the balance sheet date 
in addition  the accrual includes management s estimate of the future cost to settle each claim such as future changes in the severity of the claim and increases in medical costs 
in addition  we are self insured for our employee health plan but purchase stop loss coverage in order to limit our exposure to a maximum of  per occurrence under the plan 
income taxes 
our deferred tax assets consist primarily of net operating loss carryforwards nol s 
the estimated amount of our nol s at december  are million  which expires from to approximately million of these nol s expire in and  while the remaining million expire between and deferred tax assets must be assessed based upon the likelihood of recoverability from future taxable income and to the extent that recovery is not likely  a valuation allowance is established 
at december   we do not have a valuation allowance as we believe that it is more likely than not that our future taxable income and reversal of deferred tax liabilities will be sufficient to recover our deferred tax assets 
our business  however  is extremely cyclical and is highly sensitive to changes in oil and natural gas prices and demand for our services and there can be no assurances that future economic or financial developments will not impact our ability to recover our deferred tax assets 
in addition  we have million in permanent differences which relate to differences between the financial accounting and tax basis of acquired assets 
the permanent difference will be reduced as the assets are depreciated for financial accounting purposes on a straight line basis over the next nine years 
as the amortization of these permanent differences is a fixed amount  our effective tax rate varies widely based upon the current level of income or loss 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation of our statutory to effective tax rate 
financial condition and liquidity the following table summarizes our financial position as of december  and december  december  december  in thousands amount amount working capital   property and equipment  net   other noncurrent assets   total   long term debt   other long term liabilities   shareholders equity   total   significant changes in financial condition 
the significant changes in our financial position from december  to december  are a decrease in working capital of million  a decrease in other long term liabilities of million and a decrease in shareholders equity of million 
the decrease in working capital is a result of the issuance of the contingent convertible senior notes due the notes and partial redemption of the senior notes due the notes  the net loss for the period and capital expenditures 
the decrease in shareholders equity liabilities is due almost entirely to the net loss for the period of million 
the decrease in other long term liabilities is due to the change in our net deferred tax liabilities resulting from a deferred tax benefit of million 
on may   we issued million aggregate principal amount of notes 
the net proceeds of million from the sale of the notes and million of our available cash  a total of million  were used to redeem million aggregate principal amount of the notes  plus accrued but unpaid interest 
the partial redemption of the notes was made on july  at a redemption premium of 
this redemption premium of million was included in interest expense in the second quarter of amortization of the previously deferred financing costs associated with the notes was accelerated and approximately million of additional interest expense was recognized in the quarter ended june  after the partial redemption of the notes  we continue to owe million in aggregate principal amount of the notes and million in aggregate principal amount of the notes  for a total aggregate principal amount of million for both classes of senior notes 
our annual interest expense will be reduced by approximately million as a result of the refinancing  including approximately million of cash savings 
the net effect on working capital of this refinancing was a reduction of million consisting of a million net reduction in debt outstanding  million in a redemption premium paid on the notes and million in financing costs related to the issuance of the notes 
capital expenditures of million during the year also contributed to the decrease in working capital 
capital expenditures included the cash purchase of two diesel electric scr rigs for million 
notes the notes bear interest at per annum and mature on may  the notes are convertible into shares of our common stock  upon the occurrence of certain events  at a conversion price of per share  which is equal to a conversion rate of approximately shares per  principal amount of notes  subject to adjustment 
we will pay contingent interest at a rate equal to per annum during any six month period  with the initial six month period commencing may   if the average trading price of the notes per  principal amount for the five day trading period ending on the third day immediately preceding the first day of the applicable six month period equals  or more 
the notes are our general unsecured senior obligations and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed  on a joint and several basis  by all of our domestic wholly owned subsidiaries 
non guarantor subsidiaries are immaterial 
the notes and the guarantees rank equally with our notes 
fees and expenses of approximately million incurred at the time of issuance are being amortized through may  the first date the holders may require us to repurchase the notes 
we may redeem some or all of the notes at any time on or after may   payable in cash  plus accrued but unpaid interest  including contingent interest  if any  to the date of redemption at various redemption prices shown in note to our consolidated financial statements 
holders may require us to repurchase all or a portion of their notes on may  or may   and upon a change of control  as defined in the indenture governing the notes  at of the principal amount of the notes  plus accrued but unpaid interest  including contingent interest  if any  to the date of repurchase  payable in cash 
the notes are convertible  at the holders option  prior to the maturity date into shares of our common stock in the following circumstances during any calendar quarter  if the closing sale price per share of our common stock for at least trading days in the period of consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the calendar quarter preceding the quarter in which the conversion occurs  is more than of the conversion price per share per share on that th trading day  if we have called the notes for redemption  during any period that the credit ratings assigned to the notes by both moody s investors service moody s and standard poors s p ratings group are reduced below b and b  respectively  or if neither rating agency is rating the notes  during the five trading day period immediately following any nine consecutive trading day period in which the average trading price per  principal amount of the notes for each day of such period was less than of the product of the closing sale price per share of our common stock on that day multiplied by the number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of  principal amount of the notes  or upon the occurrence of specified corporate transactions  including a change of control 
the notes did not meet the criteria for conversion into common stock at any time during the year ended december  or during to the date of this report 
at february   the credit ratings assigned to the notes by moody s and s p were b and bb  respectively 
the indenture governing the notes does not contain any restriction on the payment of dividends  the incurrence of indebtedness or the repurchase of our securities  and does not contain any financial covenants 
notes at december   we had million in aggregate principal amount of notes outstanding 
the notes  issued in june and may  bear interest at per annum with original maturities on july  the notes are our general unsecured senior obligations and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed  on a joint and several basis  by all of our domestic wholly owned subsidiaries 
non guarantor subsidiaries are immaterial 
the unamortized fees and expenses incurred at the time of issuance related to the principal amount outstanding are being amortized and discounts are being accreted over the life of the notes 
we have the option to redeem the notes in whole or in part during the twelve months beginning july  at  beginning july  at and beginning july  and thereafter at together with any accrued but unpaid interest to the redemption date 
upon a change of control as defined in the indentures governing the notes  each holder of the notes will have the right to require us to repurchase all or any part of such holder s notes at a purchase price equal to of the aggregate principal amount thereof  plus accrued but unpaid interest to the date of purchase 
we may also  from time to time  seek to retire the notes through redemptions  open market purchases and privately negotiated transactions 
upon any such transaction  any difference between the redemption price and the face value of the notes will be recorded as interest expense 
the indentures for the notes permit us and our subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness  including senior indebtedness of up to million aggregate principal amount which may be secured by liens on all of our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries  subject to certain limitations 
the indentures contain other covenants limiting our ability and our subsidiaries ability to  among other things  pay dividends or make certain other restricted payments  make certain investments  incur additional indebtedness  permit liens  incur dividend and other payment restrictions affecting subsidiaries  enter into consolidation  merger  conveyance  lease or transfer transactions  make asset sales  enter into transactions with affiliates or engage in unrelated lines of business 
these covenants are subject to certain exceptions and qualifications 
the indentures consider non compliance with the limitations events of default 
in addition to non payment of interest and principal amounts on the notes  the indentures also consider default with respect to other indebtedness in excess of million an event of default 
in the event of a default  the principal and interest could be accelerated upon written notice by or more of the holders of our notes 
we are in compliance with these covenants 
cit facility our subsidiary grey wolf drilling company lp has entered into a million credit facility with the cit group business credit  inc the cit facility which expires during january the cit facility provides us with the ability to borrow up to the lesser of million or of the orderly liquidation value as defined in the agreement of certain drilling rig equipment located in the contiguous states of the united states of america 
the cit facility is a revolving facility with automatic renewals after expiration unless terminated by the lender on any subsequent anniversary date and then only upon days prior notice 
periodic interest payments are due at a floating rate based upon our debt service coverage ratio within a range of either libor plus to or prime plus to 
the cit facility provides up to million available for letters of credit 
we are required to pay a commitment fee of per annum on the unused portion of the cit facility and letters of credit accrue a fee of per annum 
the cit facility contains affirmative and negative covenants and we are in compliance with these covenants 
substantially all of our assets  including our drilling equipment  are pledged as collateral under the cit facility which is also secured by a guarantee of grey wolf  inc and certain of our wholly owned subsidiaries guarantees 
however  we retain the option  subject to a minimum appraisal value  under the cit facility to extract million of the equipment out of the collateral pool in connection with the sale or exchange of such collateral or relocation of equipment outside the contiguous states of the united states of america 
we currently have no outstanding balance under the cit facility but had million of undrawn letters of credit at february  these standby letters of credit are for the benefit of various insurance companies as collateral for premiums and retained losses which may become payable under the terms of the underlying insurance contracts and for other purposes 
outstanding letters of credit reduce the amount available for borrowing under the cit facility 
among the various covenants that we must satisfy under the cit facility are the following two covenants which apply whenever our liquidity  defined as the sum of cash  cash equivalents and availability under the cit facility  falls below million to ebitda coverage of debt service  tested monthly on a trailing month basis  and minimum tangible net worth as defined in the cit facility at the end of each quarter will be at least the prior year tangible net worth less million adjusted for quarterly tests 
additionally  if the total amount outstanding under the cit facility including outstanding letters of credit exceeds of the orderly liquidation value of our domestic rigs  we are required to make a prepayment in the amount of the excess 
also  if the average rig utilization rate falls below for two consecutive months  the lender will have the option to request one additional appraisal per year to aid in determining the current orderly liquidation value of the drilling equipment 
average rig utilization is defined as the total number of rigs owned which are operating under drilling contracts in the contiguous states of the united states of america divided by the total number of rigs owned  excluding rigs not capable of working without substantial capital investment 
events of default under the cit facility include  in addition to non payment of amounts due  misrepresentations and breach of loan covenants and certain other events including default with respect to other indebtedness in excess of judgments in excess of  or a change in control which means that we cease to own of our two principal subsidiaries  some person or group has either acquired beneficial ownership of or more of the outstanding common stock of grey wolf  inc or obtained the power to elect a majority of our board of directors  or our board of directors ceases to consist of a majority of continuing directors as defined by the cit facility

see notes and notes  above  for information relating to covenants  the breach of which could cause a default under  and acceleration of  the maturity date 
also see notes for information related to the holders conversion rights 
our cit facility provides up to million for the issuance of letters of credit 
if letters of credit which we cause to be issued are drawn upon by the holders of those letters of credit  then we will become obligated to repay those amounts along with any accrued interest and fees 
letters of credit issued reduce the amount available for borrowing under the cit facility and  as a result  we had borrowing capacity of million at december  the following table illustrates the undrawn outstanding standby letters of credit at december  and the potential maturities if drawn upon by the holders amounts in thousands payments due by period potential total less than over contractual obligation committed year years years years standby letters of credit   total   assumes no acceleration of maturity date due to breach of  or default under  the potential contractual obligation 
cash flow the net cash provided by or used in our operating  investing and financing activities is summarized below amounts in thousands years ended december  net cash provided by used in operating activities    investing activities    financing activities   net increase decrease in cash    our cash flows from operating activities are affected by a number of factors including the number of rigs working under contract  whether the contracts are daywork  footage or turnkey  and the rate received for these services 
our cash flow generated from operating activities during the year ended december  was million before changes in operating assets and liabilities compared to cash generated from operating activities during the year ended december  of million before changes in operating assets and liabilities 
while the number of operating days increased by from to  our operating margin declined by million 
this decline was due in large part to the replacement of expiring term contracts with spot market contracts at lower rates and margins 
the lower operating margin contributed to the reduction in cash flow from operating activities as did the million in redemption premium paid upon partial redemption of the notes 
our cash flows from operating activities were also impacted by changes in operating assets and liabilities which used million and provided million in cash flow for the years ended december  and  respectively 
generally  during times of increasing demand  our changes in working capital will result in the use of cash due primarily to the build up of accounts receivable 
while there was a small increase in overall demand in as compared to  the million increase in accounts receivable year over year was primarily due to the increase in demand for turnkey services 
at the end of  there were eight turnkey wells in progress while at the end of there where only four turnkey wells in progress 
this is significant to our cash flow from operations in that we are generally responsible for significantly more costs while drilling under turnkey contracts as opposed to daywork contracts but we are not compensated until the contract terms have been completely satisfied 
under daywork contracts  we bill and are paid as work is performed 
another significant change in working capital was the decrease in accrued interest of million 
this reduction in accrued interest is due to the partial redemption of the notes and the sale of the notes which lowered our overall interest expense and changed the timing of our interest payments 
our cash flow generated from operating activities during the year ended december  was million before changes in operating assets and liabilities compared to cash generated in operating activities during the year ended december  of million before changes in operating assets and liabilities 
this change is principally due to a decrease in operating days and a decrease in our per rig day operating margins between the two periods 
our cash flows from operating activities were also impacted by changes in operating assets and liabilities which provided million and used million in cash flow for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the cash provided by changes in operating assets and liabilities during was due to the decline in accounts receivable as a direct result of the decline in operating days and operating margins 
cash flow used in investing activities for the years ended december    and primarily consisted of million  million  and million of capital expenditures  respectively 
these capital expenditures included the costs of sustaining our rigs  the acquisition of drill pipe and drill collars  the purchase of top drives  and other capital items 
also included in capital expenditures in was the cash purchase of two diesel electric scr rigs for million 
in  capital expenditures included approximately million for the reactivation of cold stacked and inventory rigs 
cash flow used in financing activities for the year ended december  consisted of the partial redemption of the notes and the sale of the notes  the net effect of which was a reduction in debt outstanding of million 
projected cash sources we expect to use cash generated from operations to cover cash requirements  including debt service on the notes and notes and capital expenditures in capital expenditures for are projected to be between million and million  subject to the actual level of rig activity 
we make semi annual interest payments of million on the notes on january and july of each year and semi annual interest payments of million on the notes on may and november of each year through the dates of maturity 
to the extent that we are unable to generate sufficient cash from operations we would be required to use cash on hand or draw on our cit facility 
at february   our cash and cash equivalent balance was approximately million 
from time to time we also review possible acquisition opportunities 
while we currently have no agreements to acquire additional businesses or equipment  we may enter into such agreements in the future 
our ability to consummate any such transaction will be dependent in large part on our ability to fund  primarily through the capital markets  such a transaction 
we cannot give assurance that adequate funding will be available on satisfactory terms 
results of operations in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 
income statement characterization of reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred  we have revised the presentation of reimbursements received for certain expenses in the periods presented 
these reimbursements are now included in contract drilling revenues on our consolidated statement of operations rather than being recorded net of the incurred expenses in drilling operations expenses 
this reclassification had no effect on net income or cash flows 
the following tables highlight rig days worked  contract drilling revenues and drilling operating expenses for our daywork and turnkey operations for the years ended december   and for the year ended december  daywork turnkey operations operations total dollars in thousands  except averages per rig day worked rig days worked    contract drilling revenue    drilling operating expenses    operating margin    averages per rig day worked contract drilling revenue    drilling operating expenses    operating margin    for the year ended december  daywork turnkey operations operations total dollars in thousands  except averages per rig day worked rig days worked    contract drilling revenue    drilling operating expenses    operating margin    averages per rig day worked contract drilling revenue    drilling operating expenses    operating margin    for the year ended december  daywork turnkey operations operations total dollars in thousands  except averages per rig day worked rig days worked    contract drilling revenue    drilling operating expenses    operating margin    averages per rig day worked contract drilling revenue    drilling operating expenses    operating margin    drilling operating expenses exclude depreciation  and general and administrative expenses 
turnkey operations include the results from turnkey and footage contracts 
comparison of fiscal years ended december  and our operating margin decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  operating margin is defined as contract drilling revenues less drilling operating expenses 
this decrease resulted from a million decrease in operating margin from daywork operations  which was partially offset by a million increase in operating margin from turnkey operations 
on a per rig day basis  our total operating margin decreased by per rig day  or  to  in from  in this decrease included a  per rig day decrease from daywork operations and a per rig day increase from turnkey operations 
daywork operations the decrease in operating margin and operating margin per day discussed above was due primarily to the expiration at the end of and in of term contracts that were replaced with spot market contracts at lower rates 
this decrease was partially offset by an increase of rig days worked in compared to contract drilling revenue and contract drilling revenue per rig day decreased as a result of these expiring term contracts 
total drilling operating expenses increased slightly due to the increase in the number of rig days worked  however  remained relatively constant on a per rig day basis 
turnkey operations the increase in total turnkey operating margin was partially due to an increase of  days  or in the number of rig days worked in compared to total turnkey operating margin and operating margin per day also increased due to differences in the complexity of the wells drilled in compared to the increase in the number of turnkey operating days along with the difference in the complexity of the wells drilled  increased contract drilling revenue and drilling operating expenses by million and million  respectively 
contract drilling revenue and drilling operating expenses on a per rig day basis also increased because of the complexity differences 
other depreciation expense increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  during the fourth quarter of  we made the decision not to return five rigs to service and reclassified the component parts of these rigs to spare equipment  shortening the depreciable lives of this equipment 
in addition  depreciation expense is higher due to capital expenditures during general and administrative expenses increased by  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  items affecting general and administrative expenses include compensation expense in related to the hiring of our executive vice president and chief operating officer as well as higher professional fees related to compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of and increases in insurance costs 
these items increased expenses by approximately million in in  severance costs of  and non cash compensation expense of  related to stock options were recorded as a result of the termination of employment of an executive officer 
interest expense increased by million  or  to million for from million for interest expense in includes approximately million of costs associated with the partial redemption of our notes on july  and interest on the million aggregate principal amount of notes issued on may  these costs include a million redemption premium for the notes  million in accelerated amortization of a pro rata portion of the previously deferred financing costs on the notes  and interest on the notes from may  to june  this additional interest expense was partially offset by million lower interest for the last six months of due to the lower interest rate on the notes and million reduction in principal amount of total debt outstanding 
our income tax benefit increased by million to million in from million in the increase is due to the level of losses and a change in our estimate of available state tax net operating losses in the fourth quarter of this change in estimate increased our income tax benefit by  our income tax benefit is also affected by the annual amortization of million in permanent differences related to differences between the financial accounting and tax basis of acquired assets 
the permanent differences are amortized as these assets are depreciated for financial accounting purposes on a straight line basis over their remaining useful lives of approximately nine years at december  as the annual amortization of these permanent differences is a fixed amount  our book effective tax rate can vary widely based upon the current level of income or loss 
comparison of fiscal years ended december  and our operating margin decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  this decrease resulted from a million decrease in operating margin from daywork operations and a million decrease in operating margin from turnkey operations 
on a per rig day basis  our total operating margin decreased by  per rig day  or  to  in from  in this decrease included a  per rig day decrease from daywork operations and a  per rig day decrease from turnkey operations 
daywork operations the decrease in operating margin and operating margin per rig day discussed above is due to numerous factors affecting contract drilling revenue and drilling operating expenses 
first  there were  fewer rig days worked in compared to  which resulted in lower revenues and expenses 
second  revenue and revenue per rig day decreased due to the expiration of term contracts that were replaced with spot market contracts at lower rates 
finally  drilling operating expenses per rig day increased due to a wage increase of effective june   the retention of our experienced toolpushers and drillers during the downturn  the cost of cold stacking rigs  and overhead and other fixed costs being spread over less rig days 
turnkey operations the decrease in operating margin and operating margin per day discussed above was also due to several factors 
the number of rig days worked decreased by days  or  in compared to this resulted in a decrease in contract drilling revenue  which was partially offset by an increase in the revenue per rig day 
the increase in revenue per rig day and the increase in drilling operating expenses and drilling operating expenses per rig day resulted from differences in the complexity of the wells drilled between and revenue and revenue per day were also affected by generally lower daywork dayrates in than in lower daywork dayrates can affect the overall turnkey price charged to customers

inflation and changing prices contract drilling revenues do not necessarily track the changes in general inflation as they tend to respond to the level of activity of the oil and gas industry in combination with the supply of equipment and the number of competing companies 
capital and operating costs are influenced to a larger extent by specific price changes in the oil and gas industry and to a lesser extent by changes in general inflation
