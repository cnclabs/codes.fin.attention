table of contents income tax expense the company s income tax expense is impacted by a number of factors  including the amount of taxable earnings derived in foreign jurisdictions with tax rates that are higher or lower than the federal statutory rate  state tax rates in the jurisdictions where we do business  and our ability to utilize various tax credits 
the company s effective income tax rate on earnings from continuing operations in fiscal was  compared to in fiscal this increase is the result of foreign tax credit limitations due to higher debt extinguishment charges in fiscal the company s effective income tax rate on earnings from continuing operations for fiscal was  compared to for fiscal the decrease is primarily due to ceasing the amortization of goodwill in fiscal  most of which was not deductible for income tax purposes  and lower overall effective tax rates in foreign jurisdictions

as of august   the ingolstadt  germany facility had been closed  three german warehouses leased from third parties have been vacated  and german employment has been reduced by over employees  or 
the remaining million of accrued severance costs at august  will be paid to former employees over the next two years as dictated by contractual arrangements with those employees

table of contents critical accounting policies the company prepares its consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap 
this requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the following policies are considered by management to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact the company s results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
inventory cost is determined using the last in  first out lifo method for a portion of us owned inventory approximately and of total inventories at august  and  respectively 
the first in  first out or average cost method is used for all other inventories 
if the lifo method were not used  the inventory balance would be higher than the amount in the consolidated balance sheet by approximately million and million at august  and  respectively 
each of the company s business units perform an analysis of the historical sales usage of the individual inventory items on hand and a reserve is recorded to adjust inventory cost to market value 
the inventory valuation assumptions used are based on historical experience 
the company believes that such estimates are made with consistent and appropriate methods  however  actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
goodwill and long lived assets the company s goodwill is tested for impairment annually  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
the company performs impairment reviews for its reporting units using a fair value method based on management s judgments and assumptions 
the fair value represents the amount at which a reporting unit could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties on an arms length basis 
in estimating the fair value  the company uses multiples of earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda based on prevailing marketplace valuations 
the company has determined that this approach to measuring fair value is the most appropriate 
the estimated fair value is then compared with the carrying amount of the reporting unit  including goodwill 
independent appraisers are retained to perform additional fair value calculations in situations where our fair value calculations approximate the carrying value of the reporting unit 
during fiscal  the company recorded a goodwill impairment loss as a result of these policies 
see note  goodwill and other intangible assets in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
the company is subject to financial statement risk to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value 
the impairment testing performed by the company at august   indicated that the estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its corresponding carrying amount  including recorded goodwill and  as such  no impairment existed at that time 
indefinite lived intangible assets are subject to annual impairment testing  as well 
on an annual basis  the fair value of the indefinite lived assets are estimated by the company and compared to the carrying value to determine if an impairment charge is required 
effective september   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets  which supercedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and the accounting and reporting provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
related to the disposal of a segment of a business 
the company reviews long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable 
if such indicators are present  the company performs undiscounted operating cash flow analyses to determine if an impairment exists 
if an impairment is determined to exist  any related impairment loss is calculated based on fair value 
a considerable amount of management judgment and assumptions are required in performing the impairment tests  principally in determining the fair value of each reporting unit and the indefinite lived intangible assets 
while the company believes its judgments and assumptions were reasonable  different assumptions could change the estimated fair values and  therefore  impairment charges could be required 

table of contents employee benefit plans the company provides a range of benefits to certain of its employees and retired employees  including pensions and postretirement health care 
plan assets and obligations are recorded based on the company s measurement date utilizing various actuarial assumptions such as discount rates  assumed rates of return  and health care cost trend rates as of that date 
the discount rate used by the company is based on the interest rate of noncallable high quality corporate bonds  with appropriate consideration of local market factors for foreign benefit plans and the company s benefit plans participants demographics and benefit payment terms 
at august  and  the company s weighted average discount rate on domestic benefit plans was and  respectively 
a change in the discount rate by basis points would impact the company s domestic benefit plan expense in fiscal year by less than million 
at august  and  the company s weighted average discount rate on foreign benefit plans was to  respectively 
foreign benefit plans are principally held by european subsidiaries 
a change in the discount rate by basis points would impact the company s foreign benefit plan expense in fiscal year by less than million 
in estimating the expected return on plan assets  the company considers the historical returns on plan assets  adjusted for forward looking considerations  inflation assumptions and the impact of the active management of the plans invested assets 
domestic benefit plan assets consist primarily of participating units in common stock and bond funds 
the company assumed its expected return on domestic benefit plan assets to be at both august  and a basis point change in this assumption would impact fiscal domestic benefit plan expense by less than million 
due to the insignificance of the foreign benefit plan assets  the expected return on plan assets does not materially impact the company s results of operations 
see note  employee benefit plans for further discussion 
the company reviews its actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and makes modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when appropriate 
as required by us gaap  the effects of the modifications are recorded currently or amortized over future periods 
based on information provided by its independent actuaries and other relevant sources  the company believes that the assumptions used are reasonable  however  changes in these assumptions could impact the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
income taxes the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and other loss carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
income tax expense recognized by the company also reflects its best estimates and assumptions regarding  among other things  the level of future taxable income and effect of the company s various tax planning strategies 
future tax authority rulings and changes in tax laws  changes in projected levels of taxable income  and future tax planning strategies could affect the actual effective tax rate and tax balances recorded by the company 
use of estimates the company has recorded reserves or allowances for customer returns and discounts  doubtful accounts  incurred but not reported medical claims  warranty claims  workers compensation claims  product and non product litigation  and incentive compensation 
these reserves require the use of estimates and judgment 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the company believes that such estimates are made with consistent and appropriate methods 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions

seasonality and working capital we have met our working capital needs and capital expenditure requirements through a combination of operating cash flow and availability under revolving credit facilities 
although there are modest seasonal factors within certain of our businesses  on a consolidated basis  we do not experience material changes in seasonal working capital or capital resource requirements 
our receivables are derived from a diverse customer base in a number of industries 
the largest single customer generated approximately of fiscal net sales 
capital expenditures the majority of our manufacturing operations consist of the assembly of components that are sourced from a variety of vendors 
we believe that our capital expenditure requirements are not as extensive as many other industrial companies given the assembly nature of our operations 
capital expenditures for the fiscal years ended august    and were million  million  and million  respectively 
capital expenditures have historically been funded by operating cash flows and borrowings under revolving credit facilities 
for the past three fiscal years  capital expenditures were invested primarily in machinery and equipment and computer systems 
there are no significant capital programs planned in the near future that would require expenditures in excess of fiscal through levels 
raw material costs and inflation we source a wide variety of materials and components from a network of global suppliers 
while such materials are typically available from numerous suppliers  commodity raw materials are subject to price fluctuations 
fluctuations in the market prices for these commodities resulted in a reduction in gross profit by approximately million for fiscal and less than million for fiscal and however  market prices of certain commodities such as steel  plastic resin  and copper have been rising  which could have a negative impact on the company s results 
the company estimates that increases in commodity prices will have an incremental negative impact on gross profit of approximately million in fiscal  as compared to fiscal the company attempts to pass along such commodity price increases to customers to avoid profit margin erosion 
the company has not entered into any derivative contracts to hedge its exposure to commodity risk in fiscal years   or no meaningful measures of inflation are available because we have significant operations in countries with diverse rates of inflation and currency rate movements 
however  we believe that the overall rate of inflation in recent years has been relatively low and has not had a significant effect on our results of operations

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates and  to a lesser extent  commodities 
to reduce such risks  the company selectively uses financial instruments and other proactive management techniques 
all hedging transactions are authorized and executed pursuant to clearly defined policies and procedures  which strictly prohibit the use of financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes

the company does not hedge the translation exposure represented by the net assets of its foreign subsidiaries 
foreign currency translation adjustments are recorded as a component of shareholders equity 
the company s identifiable foreign currency exchange exposure results primarily from the anticipated purchase of product from affiliates and third party suppliers and from the repayment of intercompany loans between subsidiaries denominated in foreign currencies

the company has periodically utilized interest rate swap agreements to manage overall financing costs and interest rate risk

fluctuations in the market prices for these commodities resulted in a reduction in gross profit by approximately million for fiscal and less than million for fiscal and however  market prices of certain commodities such as steel  plastic resin  and copper have been rising  which could have a negative impact on the company s results 
the company estimates that increases in commodity prices will have an incremental negative impact on gross profit of approximately million in fiscal  as compared to fiscal the company attempts to pass along such commodity price increases to customers to avoid profit margin erosion
