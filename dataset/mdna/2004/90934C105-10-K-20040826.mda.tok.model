fees paid to the company were changed  however  to a cost based fee  by amendment dated december  and effective august  managed plan owned by the company omnicare tn 
omnicare tn was organized as a tennessee corporation in october  and is headquartered in memphis  tennessee 
the company was active in the development of omnicare tn  and through the company s wholly owned subsidiary  united american of tennessee  inc  wholly owns omnicare tn 
omnicare tn began as a ppo contractor with the bureau of tenncare  a state of tennessee program that provides medical benefits to medicaid and working uninsured and uninsurable recipients  and operated as a full risk prepaid health services plan until it obtained its tenncare hmo license in march omnicare tn s tenncare hmo contract was executed in october  retroactive to the date of licensure 
in november  omnicare tn contracted with the state of tennessee  doing business as tenncare tenncare  as a medicaid ppo to arrange for the financing and delivery of health care services on a capitated basis to eligible medicaid beneficiaries and the working uninsured and uninsurable non medicaid individuals who lack access to private or employer sponsored health insurance or to another government health plan 
tenncare placed an indefinite moratorium on working uninsured enrollment in december  however  such action did not affect persons enrolled in a plan prior to the moratorium 
in april  enrollment was expanded to include the children of the working uninsured up to age the contract between omnicare tn and tenncare was renewed july  for a month term  expiring december  the new contract provided for increased capitation rates  but eliminated the practice of providing retroactive payments to managed care organizations for high cost chronic conditions of their members adverse selection and payments earmarked as adjustments for covered benefits 
omnicare tn was assigned approximately  members by tenncare in the second half of fiscal as a result of three other managed care organizations  which had contracts with tenncare  ceasing to serve their enrollees or being unable to take on new enrollees 
medical services expenses for such new omnicare tn members disproportionately exceeded omnicare tn s normal per member per month pmpm experience and adversely affected its earnings for and since that period 
omnicare tn received from tenncare in fiscal an adverse selection payment of million for such fiscal expenses 
in june  tenncare developed new risk sharing options for its participating managed care organizations mcos  including omnicare tn 
omnicare tn entered into its changed contract with tenncare effective july  at june   omnicare tn was licensed in and served shelby and davidson counties in tennessee which include the cities of memphis and nashville  respectively 
effective july   omnicare tn received approval from tenncare to expand its service area to western tennessee and to withdraw from davidson county 
additionally  a significant competitor of omnicare tn ceased doing business in october  and tenncare assigned approximately  of that plan s members to omnicare tn on february  beginning july   tenncare implemented an month stabilization program which entailed changes to tenncare s contracts with mcos  including omnicare tn 
during that period  mcos were generally compensated for administrative services only commonly called aso  earned fixed administrative fees  were not at risk for medical costs in excess of targets established based on various factors  were subject to increased oversight  and could incur financial penalties for not achieving certain performance requirements 
through an amendment completed on december   tenncare extended the aso reimbursement system applicable to omnicare tn through june  a subsequent amendment completed on june  further extended the aso reimbursement system applicable to omnicare tn through december  there has been no specific indication yet of what tenncare reimbursement system will apply after that date to omnicare tn 
omnicare tn sought reimbursement from tenncare for exceptionally high medical expenses incurred by new omnicare tn enrollees in fiscal year  including for actuarially estimated claims incurred but not yet reported to omnicare tn 
in response  tenncare amended its contract with omnicare tn in september  retroactive to july  in some respects and to may  in other respects 
the amendment stated that omnicare tn s outside actuary certified the plan required million to meet its statutory net worth requirement for the year ended june  and that omnicare tn is a viable hmo under contract with tenncare on the same basis as other comparable hmos in the program effective july  pursuant to such contractual amendment omnicare tn retroactively elected an available risk option for the ten months from july  through april   tenncare retroactively agreed to reimburse omnicare tn on a no risk aso basis for medical services effective beginning may   and tenncare agreed to pay omnicare tn up to million as necessary to meet its statutory net worth requirement as of june  pursuant to an agreement between tenncare and omnicare tn in october  tenncare further agreed to pay additional funds to omnicare tn if future certified actuarial data confirmed they were needed by omnicare tn to meet that requirement 
under generally accepted accounting principles  the million receivable was not recorded in fiscal financial statements but was recorded in fiscal financial statements 
based on an actuarial determination  an additional million of fiscal medical claims liability was recorded during fiscal in all  fiscal medical claims of million were processed in the fiscal year ended june   and the same aggregate amount was recognized as revenue by omnicare tn 
omnicare tn s application for a commercial hmo license was approved on september  management is not yet actively pursuing that commercial business  however  due to omnicare tn s substantially increased enrollment from members tenncare assigned to it from defunct other plans 
as of august   omnicare tn s total enrollment was  members  of whom were medicaid enrollees and were non medicaid enrollees 
managed plan operated by the company omnicare mi 
as further described below  omnicare mi ceased to be a managed plan operated by the company effective november  while managed by the company  omnicare mi was a not for profit  tax exempt corporation headquartered in detroit  michigan and serving southeastern michigan  operating in wayne  oakland  macomb  monroe and washtenaw counties 
its history included a number of innovations that were adopted and proved successful for the industry 
while managed by the company  it was the first network model hmo in the country and the first to capitate physician services in an ipa model hmo an independent practice association model hmo does not employ physicians as staff  but instead contracts with associations or groups of independent physicians to provide services to hmo members 
omnicare mi also created and implemented the first known mental health capitation carve out in while managed by the company  omnicare mi s enrollment was through companies that offered the health plan coverage to employees and their family members  through individual enrollment and through the state of michigan s medicaid program pursuant to an agreement with the michigan department of community health  which made hmo coverage available to eligible medicaid beneficiaries in certain counties and mandatory in others 
on april   the company funded an unsecured loan to omnicare mi evidenced by a surplus note of million to enable omnicare mi to meet its minimum statutory requirement for net worth and working capital 
the loan consisted of million in cash and conversion of million of management fees owed to the company 
pursuant to the terms of the surplus note  interest and principal payments required approval by the michigan office of financial and insurance services and were repayable only from any statutory surplus earnings of omnicare mi 
note interest was payable annually and forfeited if not then paid 
interest income of million and million on that and a similar earlier surplus note was forfeited for fiscal years and  respectively 
the note principal had no stated maturity or repayment date 
the surplus notes were subordinated to all other claimants of omnicare mi 
based on an analysis of omnicare mi s projected cash flows  the company recorded impairment losses on the valuation of the surplus notes which resulted in bad debt expense of million for the year ended june  on july   claims of all creditors holding surplus notes from omnicare mi were permanently disallowed by the state circuit court order  which approved omnicare mi s amended rehabilitation plan 
as a michigan hmo  omnicare mi has been subject to oversight by the state of michigan s commissioner of the office of financial and insurance services the commissioner 
on july   pursuant to a motion by the commissioner  a state circuit court judge entered an order of rehabilitation of omnicare mi the order and appointed the commissioner as rehabilitator of omnicare mi 
the order directed the rehabilitator to administer all of omnicare mi s assets and business while attempting to effectuate its rehabilitation  preserve its provider network and maintain uninterrupted health care services to the greatest extent possible 
the order required the company to continue performing all services under its omnicare mi management agreement  which the company did until that agreement s termination on november   pursuant to omnicare mi s court approved rehabilitation plan 
the omnicare mi management agreement was amended december   effective august  the amendment reduced the company s management fee revenues from omnicare mi beginning august   by changing the methodology for determining the company s management fee from a fixed percentage of premiums earned by omnicare mi to a cost based fee  which was equivalent to approximately of premiums earned beginning in august  subject to adjustment to appropriately reflect the company s actual costs of performing the management agreement 
the amendment continued unchanged the other basic terms of the company s management agreement with omnicare mi as summarized in table a under managed plans above 
government regulation the company is and or has been subject to extensive federal and state health care and insurance regulations designed primarily to protect enrollees in the managed plans  particularly with respect to government sponsored enrollees

among the other areas regulated by federal and state law are licensure requirements  premium rate increases  new product offerings  procedures for quality assurance  enrollment requirements  covered benefits  service area expansion  provider relationships and the financial condition of the managed plans  including cash reserve requirements and dividend restrictions 
there can be no assurances that the company or omnicare tn will be granted the necessary approvals for new products or will maintain federal qualifications or state licensure 
the licensing and operation of omnicare tn are governed by the tennessee statutes and regulations applicable to health maintenance organizations 
the licenses are subject to denial  limitation  suspension or revocation if there is a determination that the plan is operating out of compliance with the state s hmo statute  failing to provide quality health services  establishing rates that are unfair or unreasonable  failing to fulfill obligations under outstanding agreements or operating on an unsound fiscal basis 
omnicare tn is not a federally qualified hmo and  therefore  is not subject to the federal hmo act 
federal and state regulation of health care plans and managed care products is subject to frequent change  varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and generally gives responsible administrative agencies broad discretion 
laws and regulations relating to the company s business are subject to amendment and or interpretation in each jurisdiction 
in particular  legislation mandating managed care for medicaid recipients is often subject to change and may not initially be accompanied by administrative rules and guidelines 
changes in federal or state governmental regulation could affect the company s operations  profitability and business prospects 
while the company is unable to predict what additional government regulations  if any  affecting its business may be enacted in the future or how existing or future regulations may be interpreted  regulatory revisions may have a material adverse effect on the company 
insurance the company presently carries comprehensive general liability  directors and officers liability  property  business automobile  and workers compensation insurance 
management believes that coverage levels under these policies are adequate in view of the risks associated with the company s business 
in addition  omnicare tn has and omnicare mi while managed by the company had professional liability insurance that covers liability claims arising from medical malpractice 
omnicare tn is required to pay the professional liability insurance premiums under the terms of the company s management agreement 
there can be no assurance as to the future availability or cost of such insurance  or that the company s business risks will be maintained within the limits of such insurance coverage 
competition the managed care industry is highly competitive 
the company directly competes with other entities that provide health care plan management services  some of which are nonprofit corporations and others  which have significantly greater financial and administrative resources 
the company primarily competes on the basis of fee arrangements  cost effectiveness and the range and quality of services offered to prospective health care clients 
while the company believes that its experience gives it certain competitive advantages over existing and potential new competitors  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete effectively in the future 
the company competes with other hmos  ppos and insurance companies 
the level of this competition may affect  among other things  the operating revenues of omnicare tn and  therefore  the revenues of the company 
omnicare tn s primary market competitors in western tennessee are tlc  better health plans and tenncare select 
omnicare tn primarily competes on the basis of enrollment  provider networks and other related plan features and criteria 
management believes that omnicare tn is able to compete effectively with its primary market competitors 
employees the company s ability to maintain its competitive position and expand its business into new markets depends  in significant part  upon the maintenance of its relationships with various existing senior officers  as well as its ability to attract and retain qualified health care management professionals 
the company neither has nor intends to pursue any long term employment agreement with any of its key personnel 
accordingly  there is no assurance that the company will be able to maintain such relationships or attract such professionals 
the total number of employees at august  was compared to at september  the company s employees do not belong to a collective bargaining unit and management considers its relations with employees to be good

beginning in april  omnicare tn wrote to tenncare seeking risk adjustments and reimbursements to compensate omnicare tn for such medical expenses  including for actuarially estimated claims incurred but not yet reported to omnicare tn 
tenncare responded to its mcos situation generally and in some instances individually 
for all its contracted mcos generally  tenncare changed its reimbursement system to an administrative services only aso program for an month stabilization period july  through december   during which the mcos including omnicare tn have no medical cost risk ie  no risk for medical losses  earn fixed administrative fees and are subject to increased oversight

on may   and effective as of january   the company s wholly owned subsidiary  united american of tennessee  inc ua tn  which already owned of the outstanding stock of omnicare tn  purchased the remaining of the outstanding common stock of omnicare tn

as a michigan hmo  omnicare mi is subject to oversight by the state of michigan s commissioner of the office of financial and insurance services the commissioner 
on july   pursuant to a motion by the commissioner  a state circuit court judge entered an order of rehabilitation of omnicare mi the order and appointed the commissioner as rehabilitator of omnicare mi 
the order directed the rehabilitator to administer all of omnicare mi s assets and business while attempting to effectuate its rehabilitation  preserve its provider network and maintain uninterrupted health care services to the greatest extent possible 
pursuant to and since the order  through the management agreement s termination date  the rehabilitator s appointed special deputy served as the chief executive officer of omnicare mi 
the omnicare mi management agreement was amended on december   effective august  the second month of fiscal 
pursuant to the amendment  omnicare mi paid all of its own expenses commencing as of august   except for personnel  rent and depreciation  which the company continued to pay 
the amendment reduced the company s management fee revenues from omnicare mi beginning august   by changing the methodology for determining the management fee from a fixed percentage of premiums earned by omnicare mi to a cost based fee  which was equivalent to approximately of premiums earned beginning in august  subject to adjustment to reflect the company s actual costs of performing the management agreement
