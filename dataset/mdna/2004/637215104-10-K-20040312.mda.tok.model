cash flows from investing activities were likewise relatively flat  in versus  in of note was the  of business acquisitions attributable to the purchase of the assets of page of ncn hygienic products  inc and the additions to property  plant  and equipment  primarily for amtec corporation

in connection with the company s plant closing activity during  the company could incur additional losses upon the disposition of property  plant  and equipment associated with the operations that were closed 
plant closing activities of this nature are unique and infrequent for the company  therefore  these activities possess inherent risk that errors in the estimation process could occur 
subject to the foregoing estimation risk  no major plant closing related expenses are expected in contractual obligations the table below discloses a summary of the company s specified contractual obligations at december  payments due by period in thousands contractual obligations total under year years years purchase obligations   earn out payments     pension contribution   total     purchase obligations represent outstanding purchase orders at december  issued to the company s housewares manufacturers in the orient 
the company can cancel or change many of these purchase orders  but may incur costs if its supplier cannot use the material to manufacture the company s products in other applications or return the material to their supplier 
as a result  the actual amount the company is obligated to pay cannot be estimated 
the company has agreed to make certain earn outs dependent upon the future earnings performance of companies acquired 
the expected payments noted above were based upon the anticipated future levels of earnings of the acquired companies 
the pension contribution represents the cash amounts the company anticipates it will pay to the plan in as the company announced it would be terminating the plan as of december   there will be no further obligations to the plan after december  page of critical accounting policies the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the amount of reported assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and revenues and expenses during the periods reported 
actual results may differ from those estimates 
the company reviewed the development and selection of the critical accounting policies and believes the following are the most critical accounting policies that could have an effect on the company s reported results 
these critical accounting policies and estimates have been reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors 
inventories new housewares small appliance product introductions are an important part of the company s sales to offset the morbidity rate of other housewares small appliance products and or the effect of lowered acceptance of seasonal products due to weather conditions 
new products entail unusual risks and have occasionally in the past resulted in losses related to obsolete inventory as a result of low or diminishing demand for a product 
the company did not have any major new product introductions or morbidity issues in the current year and  accordingly  did not record a reserve for obsolete product 
in the future should product demand issues arise  the company may incur losses related to the obsolescence of the related inventory 
insurance the company is subject to product liability claims in the normal course of business and is self insured for health care costs 
the company insures for product liability claims and health care costs  and retains a self insured retention insurance accrual in the company s financial statements

an increase in the number or magnitude of claims could have a material impact on the company s financial condition 
environmental in may  the company s eau claire  wisconsin site was placed on the united states environmental protection agency s national priorities list under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act of because of hazardous waste deposited on the property 
by december   all remediation projects had been installed  were fully operational  and restoration activities had been completed and accrued liabilities established for the expected cost of the activity 
the company believes its accrued liability reserve will be adequate to satisfy ongoing remediation operations and monitoring activities  however  should environmental agencies require additional studies or remediation projects  it is possible the existing accrual could be inadequate 
the company s current environmental liability is based upon estimates of the future cost to maintain and operate remediation projects and monitor their results based upon historical costs incurred for such activities

modification to the jackson plant should be completed during see note m for a description of plant closing activity 
the estimated accruals for plant closing costs may be subject to adjustment in the future 
potential cost items include the company s success and the length of time required to sell the alamogordo building  larger than expected health care claims for separated employees  and changes in other estimated costs to complete the plant closings

the company s investments are held primarily in fixed and variable rate municipal bonds with an average life of less than one year
