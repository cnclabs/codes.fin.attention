item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and the notes related thereto 
the discussion of results  causes and trends should not be construed to infer any conclusion that such results  causes or trends will necessarily continue in the future 
critical accounting policies the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to product returns  bad debts  inventories  intangible assets  investments  income taxes and contingencies and litigation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
the company determines its reserves by both specific identification of customer accounts were appropriate and the application of historical loss experience to non specific accounts 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventory the company makes purchasing decisions principally based upon firm sales orders from customers  the availability and pricing of raw materials and projected customer requirements 
future events that could adversely affect these decisions and result in significant charges to the company s operations include miscalculating customer requirements  technology changes which render certain raw materials and finished goods obsolete  loss of customers and or cancellation of sales orders  stock rotation with distributors and termination of distribution agreements 
the company writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon the aforementioned assumptions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
when inventory is written off  it is never written back up  the cost remains at zero or the level to which it has been written down 
when inventory that has been written off is subsequently used in the manufacturing process  the lower adjusted cost of the material is charged to cost of sales 
at december   approximately million of inventory at original cost before the write down or reserve in was on hand  including million of raw materials received from the outstanding purchase commitments 
during the third quarter of approximately million of this inventory was scrapped 
management intends to retain the balance of this inventory for possible use in future orders 
should any of this inventory be used in the manufacturing process for customer orders  the improved gross profit will be recognized at the time the completed product is shipped and the sale is recorded 
the following is a quarterly schedule of material reintroduced into production since the initial million charge 
th quarter  st quarter  nd quarter  rd quarter  th quarter  st quarter  nd quarter  rd quarter  th quarter  acquisitions acquisitions continue to be a key element in the company s growth strategy 
if the company s evaluation of a target company misjudges its technology  estimated future sales and profitability levels  or ability to keep pace with the latest technology  these factors could impair the value of the investment  which could materially adversely affect the company s profitability 
the company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million in income taxes the company files income tax returns in every jurisdiction in which it has reason to believe it is subject to tax 
historically  the company has been subject to examination by various taxing jurisdictions 
to date  none of these examinations has resulted in any material additional tax 
nonetheless  any tax jurisdiction may contend that a filing position claimed by the company regarding one or more of its transactions is contrary to that jurisdiction s laws or regulations 
overview bel is a leading producer of electronic products that help make global connectivity a reality 
the company designs  manufactures and markets a broad array of magnetics  modules  circuit protection devices and interconnect products 
while these products are deployed primarily in the computer  networking and telecommunication industries  bel s expanding portfolio of products also finds application in the automotive  medical and consumer electronics markets 
these products are designed to protect  regulate  connect  isolate or manage a variety of electronic circuits 
during  sales increased million from the acquisition by the company of insilco s passive components group and apc 
gross profit margins have been favorably impacted due to various cost cutting measures implemented by the company 
during the company closed its texas sales  manufacturing and research and development facility along with its indiana research and development facility 
some of the research and development jobs were consolidated in the company s san diego  california research and development facility 
these cost cutting measures continued into as many manufacturing and administrative positions were moved from hong kong to china and a mexican facility was closed and the business was moved to the dominican republic 
in  the company recorded a million goodwill impairment charge million net of tax benefit related to north america and asia goodwill 
during the company expensed approximately million which included a million write down taken in the second quarter in inventory and outstanding purchase commitments primarily as a result of the worldwide slow down in demand for the company s products  especially in the telcom sale sector 
during the company incurred a million charge for the write down of fixed assets due to changing customer preferences and projected lower volumes in mature product lines 
the company defines net sales or revenue as gross sales minus returns and allowances 
revenue for the company grew steadily from through bel weathered the economic storms during and and the resulting market downturn 
it is management s opinion that bel s conservative financial approach  coupled with efforts to streamline and economize operations  helped maintain stability and profitability despite significant market challenges during this period 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the past three years  the percentage relationship to net sales of certain items included in the company s consolidated statements of operations 
percentage of net sales years ended december  net sales cost of sales selling  general and administrative expenses other income  net of interest expense earnings loss before income taxes income tax provision benefit net earnings loss the following table sets forth the year over year percentage increases decreases of certain items included in the company s consolidated statements of operations 
increase decrease from prior period compared compared with with net sales cost of sales selling  general and administrative expenses net earnings  sales net sales increased from million during to million during the company attributes this increase principally to sales of approximately million from its two acquisitions in  the insilco passive components group and apc  strong demand for magjack sales from bel s existing business  resulting in an increase of million in such sales  and increased fuse sales of million offset  in part  by a decrease in sales of it module product line of approximately million 
sales in were impacted by a decline in demand affecting the global electronic industry 
the significant components of the company s sales were from magnetic products of million as compared with million during  fuses of million as compared with million during  interconnect products of million as compared with during  and module sales of million as compared with million during 
net sales decreased 
from approximately million in to approximately million in the company attributes this lack of growth to the decline in demand affecting the global electronics industry during although all product lines experienced sales decreases except for magjack  the line of discrete magnetic components for the telecom market was particularly depressed with revenues decreasing from approximately million in to approximately million in the major components of sales during were from magnetic products million  fuses million and modules million 
the company cannot assure investors that the company s revenues will continue to grow during  especially in light of the impact that competition may have in the market 
sales by insilco and apc will continue to affect comparisons of the first quarter of versus the company has limited visibility as to future sales and had one customer with sales in excess of of total sales during the loss of this customer  hon hai precision industry ltd  could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
at this time the company cannot quantify the extent of sales growth arising from unit sales mix and or price changes 
given the change in the nature of the products purchased by customers from period to period  the company believes that neither unit changes nor price changes are meaningful 
the company does not believe that it experienced a material change in unit sales  except for the additional unit sales generated by the acquisition of the insilco passive components group and apc during compared to over the past year  newer and more sophisticated products with higher unit selling prices have been introduced 
through the company s engineering and research effort  the company has been successful in adding additional value to existing product lines  which tends to increase sales prices initially until that generation of products becomes mature and sales prices experience price degradation 
in general  as products become mature  average selling prices decrease 
cost of sales bel generally enters into processing arrangements with four independent third party contractors in the far east 
under the terms of the company s agreements with these contractors  the company is only responsible for value added costs when finished goods pass the company s quality control inspections 
therefore  no value added costs are recorded until the company s quality control group approves the finished goods 
the company s raw materials are valued as finished goods when they are returned from these third party contractors 
value added costs are recorded as incurred for all products manufactured at the company s own manufacturing facilities 
such amounts are determined based upon the estimated stage of production and include labor cost and fringes and related allocations of factory overhead 
such costs are not significant as a percentage of total inventory costs at any point in time 
the company manufactures finished goods at its own manufacturing facilities in glen rock  pennsylvania  inwood  new york  dominican republic and mexico 
see critical accounting policies above for information regarding the use of inventories in the manufacturing process that have been written down in prior years 
cost of sales as a percentage of net sales decreased from during to in the decrease in the cost of sales percentage is primarily attributable to a decrease in direct labor as a percentage of sales and a decrease in factory overheads 
the decrease in direct labor as a percentage of sales is primarily attributable to the lower direct labor costs associated with the insilco manufacturing operations 
the decrease in factory overhead expenses as a percentage of sales is primarily attributable to the increase in sales and cost containment measures resulting primarily from the shut down of the company s texas sales  manufacturing and research facility and the company s indiana research facility 
the closings of the texas and indiana facilities are not expected to materially impact the level of the company s spending on research and development efforts 
the acquisition of the insilco passive components group resulted in additional cost of sales in the amount of million during the year ended december  such cost represented of net sales of insilco products during the year ended december  the company expects increases in cost of sales to continue in future quarters in relation to increases or decreases of insilco sales 
included in cost of sales are research and development expenses of million and million for and  respectively 
the increase is principally attributable to increased research and development expenditures at the company s power products group facilities and the purchase of the passive components group of insilco and apc 
cost of sales as a percentage of net sales decreased from in to in the decrease in the cost of sales percentage is primarily attributable to the following factors that impacted the company s results for the year ended december  o a million charge relating to i an inventory write off of surplus and obsolete inventory and ii estimated losses on non cancelable purchase commitments  o a million charge for the write down of fixed assets due to changing customer preferences and projected lower volumes in mature product lines  and o other charges related to the consolidation of the company s engineering facilities 
there was a strong demand for the company s products during due to the growth of the internet and broadband networking 
while sales and profits increased  it was  at times  difficult to obtain raw materials and components at reasonable prices for our discrete magnetic products 
many oems used third party contract manufacturers  and  as we concluded in the middle of  our customers and contract manufacturers in many instances  ordered quantities well in excess of their needs in order to minimize their risk of shortages and or price increases 
in response to the increased demand for certain product lines  the company entered into non cancelable forward material purchase orders based on customer forecasts 
these forward contracts were necessary to ensure the availability of materials at prices and quantities management projected were necessary to meet anticipated customer orders 
entering into non cancelable forward purchase commitments was a customary practice in our industry during this time period 
in may  the company received a number of requests from major customers and their contract manufacturers seeking to postpone or cancel orders they had made 
the company took immediate steps to negotiate with its customers and suppliers 
with suppliers  it canceled purchase orders where it could  renegotiated contracts to substitute different materials  paid cancellation penalties  or paid suppliers fees not to deliver product 
management also believed that the raw materials on hand in these product lines were either in excess of any foreseeable needs  or would become technologically obsolete before a significant recovery occurred 
estimates were made of materials in excess of reasonable projected needs  and  in the second quarter of  a charge of million was recorded to reduce the carrying value of on hand raw material inventory related to the magnetic product lines 
this charge included a reserve of million related to management s estimate of losses projected to be incurred on non cancelable purchase orders related to these product lines 
negotiations with both customers and suppliers continued through in attempts to minimize the company s estimated losses associated with the cancellation of customer orders and cancellation of non cancelable purchase orders with suppliers 
ultimately  the company accepted delivery of approximately million of the purchase commitments it attempted to cancel and was able to mitigate losses with suppliers for the remaining million reserve established in june  during that time period  raw material replacement costs dropped dramatically 
during and each quarter of  management evaluated existing reserve levels for both non cancelable purchase orders and other on hand inventory other than what had been written off in june 
adjustments to the existing reserve levels were made each quarter based on management s assessments of the status of settlements with suppliers  estimates of excess levels of on hand inventory  existing customer backlog and general market conditions 
through december   the company was able to use approximately 
million of the inventory that was included in the june million charge 
gross profit was not significantly impacted due to comparable deductions in prices that were necessary to be competitive 
during compared to  direct labor increased by approximately million due to increased magjack sales  which require more labor hours to manufacture 
discrete magnetic component sales decreased partially due to the increase in magjack sales which replaced discrete magnetic component components 
the company cannot predict what changes in product mix will occur in the future  although trends suggest a shift towards higher magjack sales 
when inventory that has been written off is subsequently used in the manufacturing process  the lower adjusted cost of the material is charged to cost of sales  resulting in a higher gross margin 
during and  the value of inventory that had been written off and subsequently used in the manufacturing process approximated  and  respectively 
gross profit was not significantly impacted in and due to comparable deductions in selling prices that were necessary to be competitive 
at december   approximately million of inventory at original cost before the write down or reserve in was on hand  including million of raw materials received from the outstanding purchase commitments 
management intends to retain this inventory for possible use in future orders 
should any of this inventory be used in the manufacturing process for customer orders  the improved gross profit will be recognized at the time the completed product is shipped and the sale is recorded 
analysis performed by the company to quantify the cost of savings associated with sales volume and sales mix changes does not provide meaningful information 
the company s cost control measures principally involved the closure of its texas sales  manufacturing and research facility during and its indiana research facility  which was closed during the second quarter of a total of employees were severed at these locations  plus an additional employees were severed at other us locations 
this resulted in a labor and fringe benefit savings of approximately  during and million annually thereafter 
approximately employees in texas were relocated to the company s san diego  california facility 
the company incurred approximately 
million of severance and employee relocation costs during the year ended in the company reduced the manufacturing activities of its fuse department in hong kong and moved those positions to the prc 
in jersey city  mexico  macau and europe  the company reduced headcount 
the company includes research and development in cost of sales 
research and development costs  which are expensed as incurred  amounted to million  million  and million in  and  respectively 
the increase in research and development of million in compared to is principally attributable to the opening of the company s san diego facility in and research and development performed with respect to power products 
the increase in research and development expense for the year ended december  in the amount of million is principally attributed to increased expenditures at the company s power product group facilities and the purchase of insilco s passive components group and apc 
selling  general and administrative expenses the percentage relationship of selling  general and administrative expenses to net sales decreased from during the year ended december  to during the year ended december   in part as a result of the company s ability to leverage general and administrative expenses over a larger revenue base and an impairment charge of million during in connection with the write down of goodwill 
the company attributes the million increase in the dollar amount of such expenses primarily to costs associated with the insilco and apc operations of approximately million  additional salaries and benefits of million  additional professional fees of approximately million and a 
million write off of the building in illinois offset  in part  by the impairment charge of million during in connection with the write down of goodwill  reduced selling expenses of approximately 
million and a reduction in accounts receivable reserves of 
million 
the decrease in selling expenses is attributable to reduced shipping charges and sales salaries resulting from the closing of the texas sales facility 
the increase in salaries and benefits is principally attributable to bonus  salary and fringe benefit increases  professional fees related to sarbanes oxley compliance  and the acquisition of the insilco passive components group 
reduced sales expenses are principally attributable to reduced shipping costs and commission expenses 
the company anticipates continued increases in professional fees principally associated with sarbanes oxley compliance 
future increases in salaries and benefits are more dependent on the future sales growth and profitability of the company 
the company anticipates increases in selling  general and administrative expenses during the first quarter of compared to the first quarter of principally due to the acquisition of the insilco passive components group 
the percentage relationship of selling  general and administrative expenses to net sales increased from in to in selling  general and administrative expenses increased in dollar amount by approximately from to the company attributes the increase in the dollar amount of such expenses primarily to a goodwill impairment charge of approximately million in offset  in part  by i cost containment measures implemented by the company which included reduced salaries and benefits of approximately million  ii the cessation of amortization of goodwill of approximately  in accordance with the adoption of fasb see note of notes to consolidated financial statements and iii a decrease in the amortization of other intangibles of approximately  which are fully amortized 
interest income net interest income earned on cash and cash equivalents decreased by approximately  during compared to the decrease is due primarily to lower interest rates earned on cash and cash equivalents and lower cash balances due to the use of approximately million of cash for the acquisition of insilco s passive components group and the communications products division of apc 
other income  consisting of interest earned on cash and cash equivalents  decreased by approximately million during the year compared to the year the decrease is due to lower interest rates earned on cash and cash equivalents 
interest expense during  the company incurred  of interest expense which arose from a million loan which was borrowed for the acquisition of insilco s passive components group 
the company had no interest expense in and provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes for the year ended december  was million as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in the provision is due primarily to the company s increased earnings before income taxes for the year ended december   as compared with and a valuation allowance of approximately 
million that was established during in connection with foreign net operating losses 
the income tax provision is lower than the statutory federal income tax rate primarily due to lower foreign tax rates 
the provision benefit for income taxes for was  as compared to  for the increase in the provision is due primarily to the company s earnings before income taxes for the year ended december  versus a loss before income taxes for the year ended december  the company conducts manufacturing activities in the far east 
more specifically  the company manufactures the majority of its products in the people s republic of china prc  hong kong and macau and has not been subject to corporate income tax in the prc 
the company s activities in hong kong have generally consisted of administration  quality control and accounting  as well as some limited manufacturing activities 
hong kong imposes corporate income tax at a rate of percent solely on income sourced to hong kong 
that is  its tax system is a territorial one which only seeks to tax activities conducted in hong kong 
since the bel entity in hong kong conducts most of its manufacturing and quality control activities in the prc  most of this entity s income is deemed offshore and thus non taxable in hong kong 
although the statutory tax rate in hong kong is percent  the company generally pays an effective hong kong rate of less than percent 
the company also conducts manufacturing operations in macau 
macau has a statutory corporate income tax rate of percent 
however  the company  as a result of investing in a certain location in macau  was able to obtain a year tax holiday in macau  thereby reducing its effective macau income tax rate from percent to percent 
the tax holiday in macau will expire in april since most of the company s operations are conducted in the far east  the majority of its profits are sourced in these three far east jurisdictions 
accordingly  the profits earned in the us are comparatively small in relation to its profits reported in the far east 
therefore  there is generally a significant difference between the statutory us tax rate and the company s actual effective tax rate 
there was no material tax benefit during because of the lower tax rate in macau 
notwithstanding the above  in and the company s effective tax rate actually exceeded the us statutory rate 
this higher effective tax rate results from a combination of factors 
first  in the company s operating results were close to break even 
this fact  combined with the identification of 
million of foreign earnings that may not be permanently reinvested  as well as the loss in macau for which the company was only able to obtain an percent benefit  resulted in a tax rate in excess of the statutory rate for the company has historically followed a practice of reinvesting a portion of the earnings of foreign subsidiaries in the expansion of its foreign operations 
if the unrepatriated earnings were distributed to the parent corporation rather than reinvested in the far east  such funds would be subject to united states federal income taxes 
through december   management has identified million of foreign earnings that may not be permanently reinvested 
deferred income taxes in the amount of approximately million have been provided on such earnings million during  
million during  
million during and the balance in prior years 
cost control measures in light of the current market in the company s industry  the company continues to review its operating structures in efforts to control costs 
such measures can be expected to result in a restructuring of the company s operations and the recognition of related restructuring charges in future periods 
the company incurred severance charges of approximately 
million and 
million during the years ended december  and  respectively  and anticipates additional severance expenses in the amount of approximately 
million during as more jobs in hong kong are moved to mainland china 
inflation and foreign currency exchange during the past two years  the effect of inflation on the company s profitability was not material 
historically  fluctuations of the us dollar against other major currencies have not significantly affected the company s foreign operations as most sales have been denominated in us dollars or currencies directly or indirectly linked to the us dollar 
most significant expenses  including raw materials  labor and manufacturing expenses  are either incurred in us dollars or the currencies of the hong kong dollar  the macau pataca or the chinese renminbi 
commencing with the acquisition of the passive components group  the company s european sales entity has transactions  which are denominated principally in euros and british pounds 
conversion of these transactions into us dollars has resulted in in currency exchange losses of  which are included in selling  general and administrative expense from realized foreign exchange transactions and approximately  in unrealized exchange gains relating to the translation of foreign subsidiary financial statements which are included in other comprehensive income 
any change in linkage of the us dollar and the hong kong dollar  the chinese renminbi  the macau pataca  the euro or the british pound could have a material effect on the company s results of operations 
net earnings net earnings for includes approximately million attributable to the acquisition of insilco s passive components group 
the contribution of apc was not material 
liquidity and capital resources historically  the company has financed its capital expenditures primarily through cash flows from operating activities 
currently  due to the recent acquisition of the passive components group of insilco technologies  inc  the company has borrowed money under a secured term loan  and has unused lines of credit  as described below 
management believes that the cash flow from operations after payments of dividends and scheduled repayments of the term loan  combined with its existing capital base and the company s available lines of credit  will be sufficient to fund its operations for the near term 
such statement constitutes a forward looking statement 
factors which could cause the company to require additional capital include  among other things  a softening in the demand for the company s existing products  an inability to respond to customer demand for new products  potential acquisitions requiring substantial capital  future expansion of the company s operations and net losses that would result in net cash being used in operating  investing and or financing activities which result in net decreases in cash and cash equivalents 
net losses may result in the loss of domestic and foreign credit facilities and preclude the company from raising debt or equity financing in the capital markets 
the company has a domestic line of credit amounting to million  which was unused at december  the company also has a million domestic revolving line of credit which was unused at december  borrowings under this million line of credit are secured by the same assets which secure the term loan described below 
on march   the company entered into a million secured term loan 
the loan was used to partially finance the company s acquisition of insilco s passive components group 
the loan agreement requires equal quarterly installments of principal with a final maturity on march  and bears interest at libor plus percent percent at december  payable quarterly 
the loan is collateralized with a first priority security interest in of all the issued and outstanding shares of the capital stock of certain of the foreign subsidiaries of bel fuse inc and all other personal property and certain real property of bel fuse inc the company is required to maintain certain financial covenants  as defined in the agreement 
for the year ended december   the company recorded interest expense of approximately  and is in compliance with all of the covenants contained in the loan agreement 
the company s hong kong subsidiary has an unsecured line of credit of approximately million  which was unused at december  this line of credit expires on march  borrowing on this line of credit is guaranteed by the company 
for information regarding further commitments under the company s operating leases  see note of notes to the company s consolidated financial statements in the company s annual report on form k for the year ended december  for information regarding the company s acquisitions of apc and the insilco passive components group  see item of this annual report on form k 
significant changes in balance sheet amounts between december  and december  are primarily attributable to the fact that these acquisitions were reflected in the company s december  balance sheet and were not reflected in the company s december  balance sheet 
the company is constructing a  square foot manufacturing facility in zhongshan city  prc for approximately million 
as of december   the company has paid 
million toward the construction 
the company expects to complete the construction during under the terms of the e power and current concepts  inc acquisition agreements  of may   the company will be required to make contingent purchase price payments up to an aggregate of million should the acquired companies attain specified sales levels 
e power will be paid million in contingent purchase price payments when sales  as defined  reach million and an additional million when sales reach million on a cumulative basis through may  no payments have been required to date with respect to e power 
current concepts will be paid of sales  as defined  on the first million in sales through may during the year ended december  the company paid approximately  in contingent purchase price payments to current concepts 
the contingent purchase price payments have been accounted for as additional purchase price and increase goodwill when such payment obligations are incurred 
on may   the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to of the company s outstanding common shares from time to time in market or privately negotiated transactions
