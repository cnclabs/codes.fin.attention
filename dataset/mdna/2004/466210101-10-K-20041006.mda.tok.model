item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview fueled by an improved north american economy and successful integration of our omniquip acquisition  our fiscal revenues increased to a record billion 
excluding omniquip and delta products  traditional jlg revenues increased by million  or  with sales from the skytrak  lull and military design telehandlers contributing million and delta contributing million 
our operating profitability reached million  a increase from last year with an operating margin of improved from last year s 
net income more than doubled to million  or per diluted share  compared to million  or per diluted share a year ago 
we also continued to improve key operating metrics  reducing trade receivable days sales outstanding to days at year end from days last year while improving our inventory turns to from we achieved these results despite increased raw material costs and industry wide component shortages due in part to the magnitude of demand that followed three years of an industry depression 
additionally  and as expected  the financial health of our european customers has continued to improve as their economies strengthen 
throughout the year we completed several key initiatives highlighted by the acquisition and integration of our omniquip operations 
this included consolidating most administrative functions  transferring production to mcconnellsburg  pennsylvania  and the subsequent closing of five facilities in port washington  wi and mendota heights  mn 
we also continued to make investments in our european presence by establishing an equipment services remanufacturing and reconditioning operations in tonneins  france  to strengthen our position for international growth opportunities 
for the european awp market segment  we expanded our product offering through the acquisition of delta and certain intellectual property and related assets 
additionally  we opened our new parts center in maasmechelen  belgium from which we can bring this service closer to our customers  and we launched the internet based e commerce system in europe  offering replacement parts to our customers in an efficient  timely and convenient process as we have already done in north america 
we launched our initial serviceplus operation in houston  texas 
toward the latter part of fiscal  escalating raw material costs  particularly steel and energy  began to impact our business 
we implemented a steel surcharge in march on all new orders  with the expectation that it would be a temporary measure  a view that was shared by many industry experts 
however  anticipated pricing relief did not materialize  and our ongoing challenge arises from the continued uncertainty associated with raw material costs 
as we monitor the situation  we also evaluate alternative actions to offset these rising costs 
compounding the high costs of raw materials have been vendor capacity constraints 
as our supply chain increased production to keep pace with the strong demand  component delays overshadowed our manufacturing efficiencies in the latter part of the year 
in the discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations that follows  we attempt to list contributing factors in order of significance to the point being addressed 
results of operations we reported net income of million  or per share on a diluted basis  for fiscal  compared to net income of million  or per share on a diluted basis  for fiscal  and income before the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle related to the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  of million  or per share on a diluted basis  for fiscal as discussed below and more fully described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  item of part ii of this report  earnings for  and included charges of million  million and million  respectively  related to repositioning our operations to more appropriately align our costs with our business activity 
certain of these charges are included in cost of sales and others are included in restructuring charges in our consolidated statements of income 
in addition  earnings for fiscal included unfavorable currency adjustments of million compared to favorable currency adjustments of million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
for fiscal  our revenues were billion  up from the million for fiscal which were down from the million reported for fiscal the following tables outline our revenues by segment  product  and geography in thousands for the years ended july years ended july  segment machinery equipment services access financial solutions a products aerial work platforms telehandlers excavators after sales service and support  including parts sales  and used and reconditioned equipment sales financial products a rentals geographic united states europe other a revenues for access financial solutions and for financial products are not the same because access financial solutions also receives revenues from rental purchase agreements that are recorded for accounting purposes as rental revenues from operating leases 
the increase in machinery segment sales from million for fiscal to million for fiscal  or  was principally attributable to the additional sales from omniquip products  increased sales of aerial work platforms in north america  europe and australia  and higher telehandler sales from new products  principally the new north america all wheel steer machines 
after considering the increase in revenues related to the omniquip and delta acquisitions  the remaining increase in sales is the result of general economic improvements in north america reflecting positive trends in construction spending  capacity utilization and consumer confidence 
in addition  the european economy is showing continued improvements  although lagging the north american economic recovery  and there is somewhat of an easing of credit availability to the rental industry 
the increase in equipment services segment revenues from million for fiscal to million for fiscal  or  was due to the additional omniquip revenues  increased service parts sales as a result of our customers fleets aging and increased utilization of fleet equipment  an increase in sales of replacement parts for our competing manufacturers equipment and higher rental fleet and rebuild sales as a result of improved market conditions and increased demand for used equipment 
the decrease in access financial solutions segment revenues from million for fiscal to million for fiscal  or  was principally attributable to an early payoff of a financed receivable  partially offset by higher finance income due to a larger portfolio 
while we have increased interest income attributable to our pledged finance receivables  a corresponding increase in our limited recourse debt resulted in million of interest income being passed on to monetization purchasers in the form of interest expense on limited recourse debt 
in accordance with the required accounting treatment  the interest portion of the payments to monetization purchasers is reflected as interest expense in our consolidated statements of income 
the decrease in machinery segment sales from million for fiscal to million for fiscal  or  was primarily attributable to reduced sales of aerial work platforms principally due to the economic pressures in north america and economic pressures and tightened credit conditions in europe  partially offset by increased sales in australia 
in addition  sales of our excavator product line declined due to softness in the united states construction market and reduced state and municipal budgets 
the decrease in sales of aerial work platforms and excavators was partially offset by increased telehandler sales from new product introductions  principally from the new north america all wheel steer machines and our european designed product offerings 
fiscal machinery segment revenues also benefited from the reversal of previously accrued volume related customer incentives that were not achieved during the year 
the increase in equipment services segment revenues from million for fiscal to million for fiscal  or  was principally attributable to increased parts sales and sales of used equipment partially offset by decreased sales of rental fleet equipment 
the increase in access financial solutions segment revenues from million for fiscal to million for fiscal  or  was principally attributable to income received on a larger portfolio of pledged finance receivables from accumulated monetization transactions 
while we have increased interest income attributable to our pledged finance receivables  a corresponding increase in our limited recourse debt resulted in million of interest income being passed on to monetization purchasers in the form of interest expense on limited recourse debt 
our domestic revenues for fiscal were million  up from fiscal revenues of million 
the increase in our domestic revenues was principally due to the additional sales from omniquip products of million as well as increased sales of aerial work platforms  telehandlers  parts  rental fleet and rebuild equipment and excavators as a result of general economic improvements in north america 
revenues generated from sales outside the united states during fiscal were million  up from fiscal the increase in our revenues generated from sales outside the united states was primarily attributable to improved market conditions resulting in increased sales of aerial work platforms in europe and australia and higher telehandler sales resulting from new product introductions in europe 
our domestic revenues for fiscal were million  down from fiscal revenues of million 
the decrease in our domestic revenues was principally attributable to lower sales of aerial work platforms primarily due to economic pressures in north america and our excavator product line due to the softness in the united states construction market and reduced state and municipal budgets 
this decrease was partially offset by higher sales of telehandlers and service parts as well as increased revenues from financial products 
revenues generated from sales outside the united states during fiscal were million  down from fiscal the decrease in our revenues generated from sales outside the united states was primarily attributable to lower aerial work platform sales in europe due to economic pressures and customer credit constraints  partially offset by increased sales of aerial work platforms in australia and increased telehandler sales in europe 
our gross profit margin increased to in fiscal from in fiscal the increase was attributable to higher margins in our equipment services and machinery segments 
the gross profit margin of our machinery segment was for fiscal compared to for fiscal the increase in fiscal was primarily due to cost reductions associated with our capacity rationalization plan  the favorable impact of currency  the omniquip acquisition and the higher sales volume during fiscal compared to fiscal the increase in our gross profit margin was partially offset by an increase in market prices of raw materials  such as steel and energy  omniquip integration expenses of million  increased freight costs due to increased production rates and expediting materials associated with steel availability and a less favorable product mix 
the gross profit margin of our equipment services segment was for fiscal compared to for fiscal the increase in fiscal was primarily due to an increase in higher margin service parts sales as a percentage of total segment revenues due primarily to the additional sales from products acquired in the omniquip acquisition and improved margins on used equipment sales reflecting increased demand for used equipment 
the gross profit margin of our access financial solutions segment was for fiscal compared to for fiscal the decrease in fiscal was primarily due to a decrease in financial product revenues as a percentage of total segment revenues 
because the costs associated with these revenues are principally selling and administrative expenses and interest expense  gross margins are typically higher in this segment 
our gross profit margin increased to in fiscal from in fiscal the increase was attributable to higher margins in our equipment services and access financial services segments 
the gross profit margin of our machinery segment was for fiscal compared to for fiscal the gross profit margin of our machinery segment was unchanged in fiscal principally due to the weakening of the us dollar against the euro  british pound and australian dollar  as well as fewer trade in packages resulting in lower trade in premiums and a more profitable product mix mainly a result of new product introductions 
these increases were offset by higher product costs associated with the start up of our maasmechelen  belgium facility  the transfer of the telehandler product line to our mcconnellsburg  pennsylvania facility  the negative effect on fixed overhead leveraging due to lower sales volume compared to fiscal and higher warranty costs associated with extended warranty periods 
the gross profit margin of our equipment services segment was for fiscal compared to for fiscal the gross profit margin of our equipment services segment increased in fiscal primarily due to an increase in higher margin service parts sales as a percentage of total segment revenues 
this increase was partially offset by unfavorable mix impact associated with higher used equipment sales and the deferred profit recognized during fiscal from a one time rental fleet sale leaseback transaction 
the gross profit margin of our access financial solutions segment was for fiscal compared to for fiscal the gross profit margin of our access financial solutions segment increased in fiscal primarily due to increased financial product revenues 
our selling  administrative and product development expenses increased million in fiscal compared to fiscal but as a percent of revenues decreased to for fiscal compared to for fiscal the following table summarizes the increase by category in selling  administrative and product development expenses for fiscal compared to fiscal in millions salaries and related benefits bonus accruals omniquip integration expenses consulting and legal costs bad debt provisions amortization expense pension and other postretirement benefit costs advertising and trade shows accelerated vesting of restricted stock awards other includes travel costs and rent expense our machinery segment s selling  administrative and product development expenses increased million in fiscal due primarily to the addition of omniquip  higher payroll and related benefit costs as a result of additional employees  normal merit compensation increases and increased medical costs  amortization expense associated with the acquired omniquip intangible assets  increased pension and other postretirement benefit costs  consulting and legal costs associated with the outsourcing of research and development projects and ordinary business activities  product development expenses related to our european telehandler products  bonus accruals primarily due to our increased profitability  and bad debt provisions 
our equipment services segment s selling and administrative expenses increased million in fiscal million due primarily to higher payroll and related benefit costs as a result of additional employees  normal merit compensation increases and increased medical costs  and the addition of omniquip 
our access financial solutions segment s selling and administrative expenses decreased million in fiscal due primarily to a decrease in bad debt provisions as a result of the lower reserve needed due to a decrease in outstanding finance and pledged finance receivables and a decrease in software costs 
our general corporate selling  administrative and product development expenses increased million in fiscal primarily due to management bonus accruals arising from our increased profitability  omniquip integration expenses  increase in bad debt provisions for specific reserves related to certain european customers as a result of a deterioration in their current financial position  higher payroll and related benefit costs as a result of additional employees  normal merit compensation increases and increased medical costs  higher consulting and legal costs associated with the financial restatement and related activity  an increase in advertising and trade show expenses and costs associated with the accelerated vesting of restricted stock awards in january and february triggered by our share price appreciation 
even though in conjunction with our financial restatement the restricted stock awards were restored to their prior unvested status at the request of our officers and therefore will be eligible to vest again in the future  pursuant to us generally accepted accounting principles gaap  we are required to include the cost of the accelerated vesting in our current period expenses 
our selling  administrative and product development expenses increased million in fiscal compared to fiscal and as a percent of revenues were for fiscal compared to for fiscal our machinery segment s selling  administrative and product development expenses increased million in fiscal due primarily to increased bad debt provisions for specific reserves related to certain customers  higher contract and consulting services  commission costs and incentive based accruals  which were partially offset by lower payroll and related costs and travel expenses due to our cost reduction initiatives 
our equipment services segment s selling and administrative expenses decreased million in fiscal mainly due to lower payroll and related costs 
our access financial solutions segment s selling and administrative expenses decreased million in fiscal due primarily to decreases in bad debt provisions reflecting lower origination activity and reduced non monetized portfolio exposure and lower software costs  which were partially offset by an increase in contract services expenses 
our general corporate selling  administrative and product development expenses decreased million in fiscal primarily due to reductions in bad debt provisions  consulting fees  depreciation expense  software costs and trade show expenses  which were partially offset by higher payroll and related costs  incentive based accruals and legal fees 
during fiscal  we announced further actions related to our ongoing longer term strategy to streamline operations and reduce fixed and variable costs 
as part of our capacity rationalization plan commenced in early  we idled the  square foot sunnyside facility in bedford  pennsylvania  which produced selected scissor lift models  and we relocated that production into our shippensburg  pennsylvania facility 
additionally  reductions in selling  administrative and product development costs resulted from changes in our global organization and from process consolidations 
we have improved our european sales and service operations model by eliminating redundant operations  reducing headcount and focusing on enhancing the business for increased profitability and growth through ongoing manufacturing process improvements 
as a result  pursuant to the plan we anticipated incurring a pre tax charge of million and spending approximately million on capital requirements 
when these changes and consolidations are fully implemented  we expect to generate approximately million in annualized savings  representing a payback of approximately six months 
during fiscal  we incurred approximately million of the pre tax charge related to the idling of our bedford  pennsylvania facility  discussed above  consisting of accruals for termination benefit costs and relocation costs and charges related to relocating certain plant assets and start up costs 
we reported thousand in restructuring costs and million in cost of sales 
during fiscal  we incurred approximately million of this pre tax charge  consisting of accruals for termination benefit costs and relocation costs and charges related to relocating certain plant assets and start up costs and million on capital requirements 
we reported million in restructuring costs and million in cost of sales 
in addition  during fiscal  we paid and charged million of termination benefits and relocation costs against the accrued liability 
during fiscal  we announced the closure of our manufacturing facility in orrville  ohio as part of our capacity rationalization plan for our machinery segment 
operations at this facility have been integrated into our mcconnellsburg  pennsylvania facility 
as a result  pursuant to the plan we anticipated incurring a pre tax charge of million 
we have realized million in annual cost savings associated with the closing of our orrville facility 
during fiscal and  we incurred and million  respectively  of the pre tax charge related to our closure of the orrville  ohio facility  consisting of production relocation costs  which were reported in cost of sales 
additionally  during fiscal  we paid and charged million of termination benefits and lease termination costs against the accrued liability 
for additional information related to our capacity rationalization plans  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  item of part ii of this report 
the increase in interest expense of million for fiscal was primarily due to interest associated with our senior unsecured notes due that were sold during the fourth quarter of fiscal and increased interest expense associated with our limited recourse debt from finance receivables monetizations 
interest expense associated with our finance receivables monetizations was million and million for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the increase in interest expense of million for fiscal was primarily due to the interest expense associated with our limited recourse and non recourse monetizations of million  increased rates on our senior subordinated debt and higher short term rates on our senior credit facilities 
our miscellaneous  net category included currency losses of million in fiscal compared to currency gains of million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
we enter into certain foreign currency contracts  principally forward contracts  to manage some of our foreign exchange risk 
some natural hedges are also used to mitigate transaction and forecasted exposures 
through our foreign currency hedging activities  we seek primarily to minimize the risk that cash flows resulting from the sales of our products will be affected by changes in exchange rates 
we do not designate our forward exchange contracts as hedges under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  and as a result we recognize the mark to market gain or loss on these contracts in earnings 
for additional information related to our derivative instruments  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  item of part ii of this report and the section captioned market risk below 
the change in currency for fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily attributable to our level of hedging positions as well as the expense associated with our hedging transactions 
the increase in currency gains for fiscal was primarily attributable to the significant weakening of the us dollar against the euro  british pound and australian dollar 
our effective tax rate in fiscal was as compared to and in fiscal and  respectively 
the increase in our effective tax rate from in fiscal to in fiscal was primarily attributable to the change in accounting estimate in the prior year and a change in the source of earnings among various jurisdictions with different tax rates in the current year 
the reduction in our effective tax rate from in fiscal to in fiscal was principally due to a million benefit to net income  or 
per diluted share  resulting from a change in accounting estimate attributable to tax benefits received from foreign operations partially offset by the creation of a valuation allowance for certain foreign net operating losses 
we were affected by the adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
as a result of this accounting standard  we no longer amortize goodwill 
this led to the reduction of million in goodwill amortization during fiscal compared to fiscal in addition  during fiscal  we completed our review of our goodwill for impairment as required by sfas no 
and  as a result  we recorded a transitional impairment loss in accordance with the transition rules of sfas no 
of million  or per share on a diluted basis  primarily associated with our gradall acquisition 
this write off was reported as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in our consolidated statements of income 
critical accounting policies and estimates our accounting policies are more fully described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  item of part ii of this report 
as disclosed in note  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and related notes 
future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty 
therefore  the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment 
actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates  and such differences may be material to the financial statements 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies  the following may involve a higher degree of judgment  estimation  or complexity than other accounting policies 
allowance for doubtful accounts and reserves for finance receivables we evaluate the collectibility of accounts and finance receivables based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations  a specific reserve is recorded against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount reasonably expected to be collected 
additional reserves are established based upon our perception of the quality of the current receivables  the current financial position of our customers and past experience of collectibility 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances would be required 
income taxes we record the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets  as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
we evaluate the recoverability of any tax assets recorded on the balance sheet and provide any necessary allowances as required 
the carrying value of the net deferred tax assets assumes that we will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions  based on estimates and assumptions 
if these estimates and related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record additional valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets resulting in additional income tax expense in our consolidated statements of income 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  carry back opportunities  and tax planning strategies in making the assessment 
we evaluate the ability to realize the deferred tax assets and assess the need for additional valuation allowances quarterly 
in addition  we are subject to income tax laws in many countries and judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
the final outcome of these future tax consequences  tax audits  and changes in regulatory tax laws and rates could materially impact our financial statements 
inventory valuation inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
certain items in inventory may be considered impaired  obsolete or excess  and as such  we may establish an allowance to reduce the carrying value of these items to their net realizable value 
we also value used equipment taken in trade from our customers 
based on certain estimates  assumptions and judgments made from the information available at that time  we determine the amounts in these inventory allowances 
if these estimates and related assumptions or the market change  we may be required to record additional reserves 
goodwill we perform a goodwill impairment test on at least an annual basis and more frequently in certain circumstances 
we cannot predict the occurrence of certain events that might adversely affect the reported value of goodwill 
such events may include  but are not limited to  strategic decisions made in response to economic and competitive conditions  the impact of the economic environment on our customer base  or a material negative change in a relationship with a significant customer 
guarantees of the indebtedness of others we enter into agreements with finance companies whereby our equipment is sold to a finance company  which  in turn  sells or leases it to a customer 
in some instances  we retain a liability in the event the customer defaults on the financing 
under certain terms and conditions where we are aware of a customer s inability to meet its financial obligations  we establish a specific reserve against the liability 
additional reserves have been established related to these guarantees based upon the current financial position of these customers and based on estimates and judgments made from information available at that time 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances would be required 
although we are liable for the entire amount under guarantees  our losses would be mitigated by the value of the underlying collateral  jlg equipment 
in addition  we monetize a substantial portion of the receivables originated by afs through an ongoing program of syndications  limited recourse financings and other monetization transactions 
in connection with some of these monetization transactions  we have a loss exposure associated with our pledged finance receivables related to possible defaults by the obligors under the terms of the contracts  which comprise these finance receivables 
allowances have been established related to these monetization transactions based upon the current financial position of these customers and based on estimates and judgments made from information available at that time 
if the financial condition of these obligors were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances would be required 
we discuss our guarantee agreements in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  item of part ii of this report 
long lived assets we review our long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to the future net cash flows expected to be generated by the assets 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds their fair value 
judgments made by us related to the expected useful lives of long lived assets and our ability to realize any undiscounted cash flows in excess of the carrying amounts of such assets are affected by factors such as the ongoing maintenance and improvements of the assets  changes in the expected use of the assets  changes in economic conditions  changes in operating performance and anticipated future cash flows 
since judgment is involved in determining the fair value of long lived assets  there is risk that the carrying value of our long lived assets may require adjustment in future periods 
if actual fair value is less than our estimates  long lived assets may be overstated on the balance sheet and a charge would need to be taken against earnings 
pension and postretirement benefits pension and postretirement benefit costs and obligations are dependent on assumptions used in calculation of these amounts 
these assumptions  used by actuaries  include discount rates  expected return on plan assets for funded plans  rate of salary increases  health care cost trend rates  mortality rates and other factors 
in accordance with gaap  actual results that differ from the actuarial assumptions are accumulated and amortized to future periods and therefore affect recognized expense and recorded obligations in future periods 
while we believe that the assumptions used are appropriate  differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may materially effect our financial position or results of operations 
product liability our business exposes us to possible claims for personal injury or death and property damage resulting from the use of equipment that we rent or sell 
we maintain insurance through a combination of self insurance retentions  primary insurance and excess insurance coverage 
we monitor claims and potential claims of which we become aware and establish liability reserves for the self insurance amounts based on our liability estimates for such claims 
our liability estimates with respect to claims are based on internal evaluations of the merits of individual claims and the reserves assigned by our independent insurance claims adjustment firm 
the methods of making such estimates and establishing the resulting accrued liability are reviewed frequently  and adjustments resulting from our reviews are reflected in current earnings 
if these estimates and related assumptions change  we may be required to record additional reserves 
restructuring and restructuring related as more fully described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  item part ii of this report  we recognized pre tax restructuring and restructuring related charges of million  million and million during fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the related reserves reflect estimates  including those pertaining to separation costs  settlements of contractual obligations  and asset valuations 
we reassess the reserve requirements to complete each individual plan within the program at the end of each reporting period or as conditions change 
actual experience has been and may continue to be different from the estimates used to establish the reserves 
revenue recognition sales of non military equipment and service parts are unconditional sales that are recorded when product is shipped and invoiced to independently owned and operated distributors and customers 
normally our sales terms are free on board shipping point fob shipping point 
however  certain sales  including our all terrain lifter  army system atlas brand of military telehandler products  may be invoiced prior to the time customers take physical possession 
in such cases  revenue is recognized only when the customer has a fixed commitment to purchase the equipment  the equipment has been completed and made available to the customer for pickup or delivery  and the customer has requested that we hold the equipment for pickup or delivery at a time specified by the customer 
in such cases  the equipment is invoiced under our customary billing terms  title to the units and risk of ownership passes to the customer upon invoicing  the equipment is segregated from our inventory and identified as belonging to the customer and we have no further obligations under the order other than customary post sales support activities 
during fiscal  less than of our sales were invoiced and the revenue recognized prior to customers taking physical possession 
in the instances that our shipping terms are shipping point destination  revenue is recorded at the time the goods reach our customers 
the sales terms for our atlas brand of military telehandler products are fob origin 
in order for us to recognize revenue  the atlas telehandler products must pass inspection by a government quality assurance representative qar at the point of production to insure adequate special paint requirements 
the sales terms of our millennia military vehicle mmv brand of military telehandler products are fob destination 
in order for us to recognize revenue  the mmv telehandler products must pass inspection by a government qar at the point of production to insure adequate special paint requirements and by a government representative at the point of destination to verify delivery without damage during transportation 
revenue from certain equipment lease contracts is accounted for as sales type leases 
the present value of all payments  net of executory costs such as legal fees  is recorded as revenue and the related cost of the equipment is charged to cost of sales 
the associated interest is recorded over the term of the lease using the interest method 
in addition  net revenues include rental revenues earned on the lease of equipment held for rental 
rental revenues are recognized in the period earned over the lease term 
we enter into rental purchase guarantee agreements rpgs with some of our customers 
these agreements are normally for a term of no greater than twelve months and provide for rental payments with a guaranteed purchase option at the end of the agreement 
under the terms of the rpg  the customer is obligated to purchase the equipment at the end of the rental period 
the full amount is recorded as revenue and the related cost of the equipment is charged to cost of sales at the inception of the agreement 
we ship equipment on a limited basis to certain customers on consignment  which under gaap allows recognition of the revenues only upon final sale of the equipment by the consignee 
at july   we had million of inventory on consignment 
warranty we establish reserves related to the warranties we provide on our products 
specific reserves are maintained for programs related to machine safety and reliability issues 
estimates are made regarding the size of the population  the type of program  costs to be incurred by us and estimated participation 
additional reserves are maintained based on the historical percentage relationships of such costs to machine sales and applied to current equipment sales 
if these estimates and related assumptions change  we may be required to record additional reserves 
financial condition cash generated from operating activities was million for fiscal compared to cash used in operating activities of million in fiscal the increase in cash generated from operations in fiscal primarily resulted from an increase in accounts payable largely resulting from higher production levels  fewer originations of finance receivables as a result of lower demand for customer financing and the program agreements we entered into during fiscal to provide financing solutions for our customers and our increased profitability 
partially offsetting these effects were an increase in trade receivables resulting from increased sales during fiscal as compared to fiscal and higher inventory levels to support the increased business activity 
the operating cash deficit in fiscal resulted primarily from our increased investment in finance receivables resulting from new originations  lower trade account payables largely resulting from the timing of payments and increased trade receivables resulting from an increase in the days sales outstanding from days at july  to days at july  the increase in the days sales outstanding resulted primarily from increases in outstanding rpgs  european markets remaining in recession  and the relative scarcity of third party credit to finance equipment purchases 
these circumstances resulted in an increase in our european receivables coincident with a decline in our overall european sales 
partially offsetting these effects was a decrease in inventories 
additional information regarding our rpgs is included in the section captioned critical accounting policies and estimates revenue recognition above 
during fiscal  we used a net of million of cash for investing activities compared to million for fiscal our increased use of cash by investing activities for fiscal was principally due to the omniquip acquisition that we completed during the first quarter of fiscal and increases in our rental fleet  partially offset by higher sales of our rental fleet 
our decreased use of cash by investing activities for fiscal was principally due to lower expenditures for equipment held for rental and property  plant and equipment partially offset by a decrease in sales of equipment held for rental 
we received net cash of million from financing activities for fiscal compared to net cash received of million for fiscal the decrease in cash provided by financing activities was largely attributable to the sale in fiscal of our million senior unsecured notes due and fewer monetizations of our finance receivables due to the impact of prior monetizations which reduced the marketability of our remaining portfolio and the new program agreements we entered into during fiscal the increase in cash provided from financing activities in fiscal compared to fiscal largely resulted from increased debt  which included the sale of our million senior unsecured notes due and the proceeds from the monetization of our finance receivables  a portion of which was used to finance working capital requirements 
due to our seasonality of sales  during certain periods we may generate negative cash flows from operations despite reporting profits 
generally  this may occur in periods in which we are building inventory levels in anticipation of sales during peak periods as well as other uses of working capital related to dating terms associated with trade receivables or other sale arrangements such as the previously described rpgs 
the following table provides a summary of our contractual obligations in thousands at july  payments due by period total less than year years years after years short and long term debt a limited recourse debt b operating leases c total contractual obligations d a includes our two note issues and indebtedness under bank credit facilities as more fully described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  item of part ii of this report 
b our limited recourse debt is the result of the sale of finance receivables through limited recourse monetization transactions 
c in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for leases  operating lease obligations are not reflected in the balance sheet 
d we anticipate that funding of our pension and postretirement benefit plans in fiscal will approximate million 
that amount principally represents contributions either required by regulations or laws or  with respect to unfunded plans  necessary to fund current benefits 
we have not presented estimated pension and postretirement funding in the table above as the funding can vary from year to year based upon changes in the fair value of the plan assets and actuarial assumptions

on april   we completed the purchase of delta for million  which included transaction expenses of million 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  item of part ii of this report 
headquartered in tonneins  france  delta has two facilities that manufacture the toucan manlift brand of vertical mast lifts  a line of aerial work platforms distributed throughout europe for use principally in industrial and maintenance operations 
in addition  we purchased certain intellectual property and related assets of manitowoc s discontinued product lines  which will permit us to re launch selected liftlux models 
we funded the purchase price with cash generated from operations 
on august   we completed the omniquip acquisition  which includes all operations relating to the skytrak and lull brand telehandler products 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  item of part ii of this report 
the purchase price was million  with million paid in cash at closing and million paid in the form of an unsecured subordinated promissory note due on the second anniversary of the closing date 
on february   we paid off the million unsecured subordinated promissory note payable to a subsidiary of textron related to the acquisition of omniquip and post closing purchase price adjustments in favor of textron totaling million 
in addition  we incurred million in transaction expenses 
we funded the cash portion of the purchase price and the transaction expenses with remaining unallocated proceeds from the sale of our million senior unsecured notes due and anticipate funding approximately million in integration expenses over a four year period with cash generated from operations and borrowings under our credit facilities 
our principle sources of liquidity for fiscal will be cash generated from operations and borrowings under our credit facilities 
availability of funds under our credit facilities and monetizations of finance receivables depend on a variety of factors described below 
as of july   we had an unused credit commitment totaling million 
we have a three year million senior secured revolving credit facility that expires september and a pari passu  one year million cash management facility that expires september  both facilities are secured by a lien on substantially all of our assets 
availability of credit requires compliance with financial and other covenants  including a requirement that we maintain i leverage ratios during fiscal of net funded debt to ebitda measured on a rolling four quarters and net funded senior debt to ebitda measured on a rolling four quarters not to exceed to and to  respectively  ii a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than to through october  and to through july   and iii a tangible net worth of at least million  plus of consolidated net income on a cumulative basis for each preceding fiscal quarter  commencing with the quarter ended july  availability of credit also will be limited by a borrowing base determined on a monthly basis by reference to of eligible domestic accounts receivable and percentages ranging between and of various categories of domestic inventory 
accordingly  credit available to us under these facilities will vary with seasonal and other changes in the borrowing base and leverage ratios 
we do not expect to have full availability of the stated maximum amount of credit at all times 
however  based on our current business plan  we expect to have sufficient credit availability that combined with cash to be generated from operations will meet our expected seasonal requirements for working capital and planned capital and integration expenditures for fiscal with the commencement of our access financial solutions segment in fiscal  we initially relied on cash generated from operations and borrowings under our credit facilities to fund our originations of customer finance receivables 
through this approach  we generated a diverse portfolio of financial assets which we seasoned and began to monetize principally through limited recourse syndications 
our ability to continue originations of finance receivables to be held by us as financial assets depends on the availability of monetizations  which  in turn  depends on the credit quality of our customers  the degree of credit enhancement or recourse that we are able to offer  and market demand among third party financial institutions for our finance receivables 
during fiscal and fiscal  we monetized million and million  respectively  in finance receivables through syndications 
although monetizations generate cash  under sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishment of liabilities  the monetized portion of our finance receivables portfolio remains recorded on our balance sheet as limited recourse debt 
we expect that our originations and monetizations of finance receivables will continue and that our limited recourse debt balance will continue to decline 
in september  we entered into a program agreement with general electric capital corporation gecc to provide private label financing solutions for our customers in north america and  in march  we entered into an operating agreement with gecc to provide financing solutions for our customers in europe 
in addition  in april  june and july  we entered into additional program agreements with other finance companies to provide private label financing solutions for our customers in the united states and canada 
the terms of these additional agreements are similar to those under the gecc agreements 
under all of these agreements  our customers will continue to have direct interaction with our access financial solutions personnel  but with the finance companies providing direct funding for transactions that meet agreed credit criteria subject to limited recourse to us 
transactions funded by the finance companies will not be held by us as financial assets  and therefore their subsequent monetization will not be recorded on our balance sheet as limited recourse debt 
transactions not funded by the finance companies may still be funded by us to the extent of our liquidity sources and subsequently monetized or they may be funded directly by other credit providers 
during fiscal  million of sales to our customers were funded through these programs 
as discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  item of part ii of this report  we are a party to multiple agreements whereby we guarantee million in indebtedness of others 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances would be required 
also as discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements our future results of operations  financial condition and liquidity may be affected to the extent that our ultimate exposure with respect to product liability varies from current estimates 
and as reported in item of part i of this report  the sec has commenced an informal inquiry relating to our accounting and financial reporting following our february  announcement that we would be restating our audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended july  and for the first fiscal quarter ended october  although the sec s notification advised that the existence of the inquiry should not be construed as an expression or opinion of the sec that any violation of law has occurred  nor should it reflect adversely on the character or reliability of any person or entity or on the merits of our securities  until this inquiry is resolved it may have an adverse effect on our ability to undertake additional financing or capital markets transactions 
outlook this outlook section and other parts of this management s discussion and analysis contain forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of forward looking statements are identified by words such as may  believes  expects  plans and similar terminology 
these statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by the forward looking statements 
important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those suggested by the forward looking statements include  but are not limited to  the following i general economic and market conditions  including political and economic uncertainty in areas of the world where we do business  ii varying and seasonal levels of demand for our products and services  iii limitations on customer access to credit for purchases  iv credit risks from our financing of customer purchases  v interest and foreign currency exchange rates  and vi costs of raw materials and energy  as well as other risks as described in cautionary statements pursuant to the securities litigation reform act which is an exhibit to this report 
we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements 
absent any major economic or geopolitical disruptions  we are optimistic regarding the overall outlook for our company in fiscal regarding our machinery segment  our customers willingness and ability to refresh their fleets primarily depend on three factors i positive economic signals  ii a healthy used equipment market and iii our customers ability to finance significant new purchases 
these factors are trending favorably 
in north america  we expect a low inflation and a low interest rate environment that will be favorable for construction spending 
in addition to a healthy economy  we anticipate increased demand for our products due to new construction techniques and practices that are driving faster project turnaround and creating new applications for our awps and telehandlers 
this increased demand is coupled with an increase in the number of providers of access equipment to end users as the overall structure of our distribution channels has changed from primarily independent rental companies and large consolidators to a mixed customer base that includes new channels such as industrial  do it yourself demand and military 
we expect that the overall increase in demand for access equipment coupled with our new distribution channels will result in a healthy used equipment market for fiscal lastly  with the anticipated low interest rates and more favorable lending terms available from banks  we also expect that our customers will be able to finance new purchases of access equipment at a lower cost of capital 
lagging behind the north american economic recovery  international economies are improving slowly  albeit at differing rates in different regions 
in europe  many of the access equipment specialists are beginning to expand their offerings and cross multi country rental markets 
while this expansion lacks the consolidation that was experienced in the us  more rental companies are expanding into new territories 
europe is also emerging from a significant economic recession and continues to be the driving force of international revenues 
in asia  more affordable used equipment is aiding in that region s adoption of access equipment and providing an exit strategy for fleet replacement in other more mature markets 
turning to our equipment services segment  the major factors that drive demand for parts and services are trending favorably as we are observing i higher fleet utilization  ii growing demand for remanufactured  reconditioned and refurbished equipment as an equipment life cycle extension  and iii a limited servicing capability currently available in the marketplace 
current conditions afford ample opportunity to grow our existing services and expand into new arenas 
for example  we expanded our after market services in europe by establishing an equipment services remanufacturing operation in tonneins  france  bringing this successful north american business model to the international marketplace 
additionally  as the population and age of access equipment increases  we are positioned to take advantage of servicing growth opportunities through our new serviceplus initiative  launched in houston  texas during the fourth quarter of fiscal in our access financial solutions segment  the outlook for capital equipment financing is improving 
accordingly  we expect stable operations as we continue to reap the benefits of our vendor financing relationships in north america and focus on developing similar relationships in europe 
although demand for access equipment worldwide is growing and we believe that we have the right products and services to meet those demands  our business is not without challenges 
the most challenging element in the new fiscal year will be the high costs of raw materials  supplier capacity constraints  and manufacturing inefficiencies associated with the steep ramp up of production 
as in prior years  the first half of the fiscal year is marked by seasonally lower sales  and the first half of fiscal will be further challenged by a near term weighted average cost of steel anticipated to be considerably higher than that expected for the full year 
our response to the higher costs of raw materials included initiating a steel surcharge of in march  and more recently  instituting a base price increase averaging 
our five year strategic plan is designed to reach our billion revenue goal 
demand for access equipment worldwide is growing  and we believe that we have the right products and services  and manufacturing flexibility to meet those demands 
despite the current challenges  we will maintain fiscal discipline and focus on what is important to our stakeholders sales growth  quality of earnings  asset intensity and risk management 
market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates  which could affect our future results of operations and financial condition 
we manage exposure to these risks principally through our regular operating and financing activities 
we are exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of our outstanding debt 
in june  we entered into a million fixed to variable interest rate swap agreement with a fixed rate receipt of in order to mitigate our interest rate exposure 
the basis of the variable rate paid is the london interbank offered rate libor plus 
in july  we entered into a million fixed to variable interest rate swap agreement with a fixed rate receipt of in order to mitigate our interest rate exposure 
the basis of the variable rate paid is the london interbank offered rate libor plus 
during fiscal  we terminated our million notional fixed to variable interest rate swap agreement with a fixed rate receipt of that we entered into during june  which resulted in a deferred gain of million 
this million deferred gain will offset interest expense over the remaining life of the debt 
at july   we had million of interest rate swap agreements outstanding 
these swap agreements are designated as hedges of the fixed rate borrowings which are outstanding and are structured as perfect hedges in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
total interest bearing liabilities at july  consisted of million in variable rate borrowing and million in fixed rate borrowing 
at the current level of variable rate borrowing  a hypothetical increase in interest rates would decrease pre tax current year earnings by approximately million on an annual basis 
a hypothetical change in interest rates would not result in a material change in the fair value of our fixed rate debt 
we manufacture our products in the united states  belgium and france and sell these products in north america and europe as well as other international markets 
as a result of the sales of our products in foreign markets  our earnings are affected by fluctuations in the value of the us dollar  as compared to foreign currencies resulting from transactions in foreign markets 
at july   the result of a uniform strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would have the effect of reducing gross profits for the year ended july  by approximately million 
this calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the us dollar 
in addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates  such changes also affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales price as competitors products become more or less attractive 
our sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in potential changes in sales levels or local currency prices 
we enter into certain foreign currency contracts  principally forward exchanges  to manage some of our foreign exchange risk 
we enter into certain currency forward contracts to mitigate our economic risk to foreign exchange risk that qualify as derivative instruments under sfas no 
however  we have not designated these instruments as hedge transactions under sfas no 
and  accordingly  the mark to market impact of these derivatives is recorded each period to current earnings 
some natural hedges are also used to mitigate transaction and forecasted exposures 
at july   we were managing million of foreign currency contracts 
through our foreign currency hedging activities  we seek primarily to minimize the risk that cash flows resulting from the sales of our products will be affected by changes in exchange rates 
these foreign currency contracts have not historically been material to our financial position and results of operations
