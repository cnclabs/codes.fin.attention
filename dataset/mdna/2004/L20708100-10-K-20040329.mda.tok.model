item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations herein 
segment profits earned by the group from other managed container programs were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively see note to the consolidated financial statements 
owned containers cronos uses various forms of debt funding to finance its owned fleet including bank loans and capital leases 
container ownership provides the group with the ability to generate lease revenues over the life of the container  matched with related interest and depreciation expenses 
from time to time  cronos also owns containers on a temporary basis until such time that the containers are sold to the container equity programs and other managed container programs 
most containers identified for sale to managed container programs are purchased new by cronos  and sold to owners of managed container programs within six months 
this strategy allows cronos more flexibility to negotiate and buy containers strategically  based on market conditions 
in addition  cronos may on occasion own equipment that has been acquired specifically for resale to third parties that does not enter the cronos managed fleet 
assets that are funded by capital lease are initially reported at the fair value of the asset categorized within container equipment  with an equivalent liability reported as capital lease obligations 
container equipment is depreciated over its expected useful life 
finance charges are reported over the lease term in accordance with the effective interest method and are recorded as interest expense 
environmental countries that are signatories to the montreal protocol on the environment agreed in november to restrict the use of environmentally destructive refrigerants  banning production but not use of chlorofluorocarbon compounds cfcs beginning in january since then  the environmental impact of cfcs has become increasingly prominent 
on january   it became illegal for environmentally destructive refrigerants to be handled  other than for disposal  in most of the countries that are members of the european union 
cfcs are used in the operation  insulation and manufacture of refrigerated containers 
all of cronos refrigerated containers purchased since june use non cfc refrigerant gas in the operation and insulation 
table of contents of the containers  although a reduced quantity of cfcs are still used in the container manufacturing process 
the replacement refrigerant used in the group s new refrigerated containers may also become subject to similar governmental regulations 
in the past  the group has retrofitted certain refrigerated containers with non cfc refrigerants 
cronos has decided not to retrofit any additional containers 
in the unlikely event that any such further retrofitting expenses should be required  they would not be material to the financial position or results of operations of the group 
employees as of december   cronos had employees worldwide  were located in europe  in the united states and in asia and australia combined 
none of cronos employees is covered by a collective bargaining agreement 
acquisition policy cronos acquisition policy for the total fleet is driven by capital availability  market requirements and anticipated future demand  including demand generated by trade growth and the replacement of containers retired around the world 
the group believes that the worldwide manufacturing capacity for all container types is adequate to meet its current and near term requirements 
in recent years  china has emerged as the primary location for almost all types of container manufacturing 
refrigeration units  which represent approximately half of the cost of a refrigerated container  are purchased from the two the primary suppliers of container refrigeration units headquartered in the united states who have manufacturing plants in the far east  united states and europe 
these units are shipped to the container manufacturer for installation into the container 
all of the tank containers in the cronos fleet have been purchased from manufacturers based in the united kingdom  south africa  belgium and china 
repair and maintenance all containers are inspected and repaired when redelivered by customers who are obligated to pay for all damage repairs  excluding wear and tear  according to standardized industry guidelines 
as described under description of business lease profile some customers enter into a damage protection plan 
depots in major port areas perform repair and maintenance work that is verified by either independent surveyors or the cronos technical and operations staff 
before any repair or refurbishment is authorized on older containers in the cronos fleet  the cronos technical and operations staff review the age  condition and type of container and its suitability for continued leasing 
cronos compares the cost of such repair or refurbishment with the prevailing market resale price that might be obtained for that container and makes the appropriate decision whether to repair or sell the container 
cronos is authorized to make this decision for most of the owners for whom it manages equipment and makes the decision by applying the same standards to the managed containers as to its own containers 
disposition of used containers cronos estimates that the period for which most containers will be used in the group fleet as a leased marine cargo container ranges from to years 
cronos disposes of used containers in a worldwide secondary market in which buyers include wholesalers  mini storage operators  construction companies and others 
the market for used containers generally depends on new container prices  the quantity of containers targeted for disposal and the overall lease market for containers at a particular location 
operations cronos sales and marketing operations are conducted through cronos containers limited ccl  a wholly owned subsidiary based in the united kingdom 
ccl is supported in this role by area offices and dedicated agents located in san francisco  new jersey  antwerp  genoa  hamburg  gothenburg  singapore  hong kong  sydney  tokyo  taipei  seoul  rio de janeiro  shanghai and madras 

table of contents cronos also maintains agency relationships with independent agents around the world who are generally paid a commission based upon revenues generated in the region or the number of containers that are leased from their area 
these agents are located in jurisdictions where the volume of cronos business necessitates a presence in the area but is not sufficient to justify a fully functioning cronos office or dedicated agent 
agents provide marketing support to the area offices covering the region  together with limited operational support 
in addition  cronos relies on the services of approximately independently owned and operated depots around the world to inspect  repair  maintain and store containers while off hire 
the group s area offices authorize all container movements into and out of the depot and supervise all repairs and maintenance performed by the depot 
the group s technical staff set the standards for repair of the cronos fleet throughout the world and monitor the quality of depot repair work 
the depots provide a link to the group s operations  as the redelivery of a container into a depot is the point at which the container is off hired from one customer and repaired in preparation for re leasing to the next customer 
cronos global network is integrated with its computer system and provides hour communication between offices  agents and depots 
the system allows cronos to manage and control its global fleet by providing the responsiveness and flexibility necessary to service the leasing market effectively 
this system is an integral part of cronos service  as it processes information received from the various offices  generates billings to lessees and produces a wide range of reports on all aspects of the group s leasing activities 
the system records the life history of each container  including the length of time on hire  repair costs  as well as port activity trends  leasing activity and equipment data per customer 
the operations and marketing data is fully interfaced with cronos finance and accounting system to provide revenue  cost and asset information to management and staff around the world 
in recent years  cronos and other lessors have developed certain internet based applications 
for cronos  these applications allow customer access to make on line product inquiries 
the group is continuing to develop this side of its business and will introduce other internet options as suitable applications are identified 
competition competition among container leasing companies is based upon several factors  including the location and availability of inventory  lease rates  the type  quality and condition of the containers  the quality and flexibility of the service offered  the availability of suitable financing and the professional relationship between the customer and the lessor 
other factors include the speed with which a leasing company can prepare its containers for lease and the ease with which a lessee believes it can do business with a lessor or its local area office 
not all container leasing companies compete in the same market as some supply only dry cargo containers and not specialized containers 
cronos competes with various container leasing companies in the markets in which it conducts business 
the container leasing companies essentially comprises three broad groups 
the first group includes five leasing companies that control almost of the total leased fleet 
the second group  which includes cronos  controls approximately of the total leased fleet 
the third group includes the smaller  more specialized fleet operators 
some of cronos competitors have greater financial resources than cronos and may be more capable of offering lower per diem rates on a larger fleet 
in cronos experience  however  ocean carriers generally lease containers from several leasing companies in order to minimize dependence on a single supplier 
economies of scale  worldwide operations  diversity  size of fleet and financial strength are increasingly important to the successful operation of a container leasing business 
additionally  as containerization continues to grow  and regions such as china  south america and the indian sub continent generate an increasing volume of containerized cargo  customers may demand more flexibility from leasing companies  particularly regarding the structure of leases  per diem rates  pick up and drop off locations  and the availability of containers 
cronos believes it has created a strategic advantage due to its product and funding diversity  allowing it to develop a wider customer portfolio and lower risk profile 

table of contents insurance cronos lease agreements typically require ocean carriers to obtain insurance to cover all risks of physical damage and loss of the equipment under lease  as well as public liability and property damage insurance 
however  the precise nature and amount of the insurance carried by each ocean carrier varies from lessee to lessee 
in addition  cronos has purchased secondary insurance effective in the event that a lessee fails to have adequate primary coverage 
this insurance covers liability arising out of bodily injury and or property damage as a result of the ownership and operation of the containers  as well as insurance against loss or damage to the containers  loss of lease revenue in certain cases and cost of container recovery and repair in the event that a customer goes into bankruptcy 
cronos believes that the nature and amounts of its insurance are customary in the container leasing industry and subject to standard industry deductions and exclusions 
item properties cronos leases approximately  square feet of office space near london  england  where its container leasing operations are conducted 
cronos also leases approximately  square feet of office space in san francisco  california  where its managed container program activities are based 
cronos also conducts its container leasing operations from smaller offices that are leased in new jersey  genoa  gothenburg  hamburg  hong kong  singapore and sydney 
the containers owned and managed by cronos are described under item description of business 
as of december   cronos owned  teu of dry cargo containers   teu of refrigerated containers   teu of cpcs   teu of rolltrailers  teu of tank containers  and  teu of other specialized equipment 
the majority of owned containers are financed by debt and capital lease obligations 
under the terms of the debt agreements  the containers act as collateral for the outstanding loan balance 
for assets financed by capital lease facilities  although the group takes all the risks and rewards of ownership  the lessor retains title to the equipment until the capital lease obligation has been discharged and any purchase options have been exercised by the group 
as of december   cronos managed a total of  teu of dry cargo containers   teu of refrigerated containers   teu of tank containers   teu of cpcs  teu of rolltrailers  and  teu of other specialized equipment 
item legal proceedings the contrin settlement the group manages containers for investment entities collectively known as contrin in its other managed container programs 
approximately measured by teus of the group s fleet of containers is owned by contrin 
as previously reported by cronos  since august the group has been defending three lawsuits brought by contrin  one in luxembourg and two in the united kingdom 
on november   the group and contrin settled their differences and entered into a settlement agreement the settlement agreement 
the group reported the settlement in a form k report filed with the securities and exchange commission on november   and filed a copy of the settlement agreement as an exhibit to the report 
reference is made to the form k report for a complete description of the settlement 
the group has secured two judgments against its former chairman  stefan m 
palatin  from the uk courts aggregating approximately million  and has secured two charging orders the cronos charging orders  in the nature of liens  to enforce the judgments against mr 
palatin s beneficial interest in an estate located in amersham  england the amersham estate 
the group has brought an action the foreclosure action in the uk courts seeking to foreclose the cronos charging orders and obtain an order of sale of the amersham estate to satisfy the judgments secured against mr 
palatin 
under the settlement agreement  contrin agreed to file a civil action against mr 
palatin in austria for recovery of million  plus interest and costs 
this civil action follows mr 
palatin s criminal conviction in austria  affirmed on appeal  for  among other things  defrauding contrin of the million 
contrin had sought recovery of these monies from the group in contrin s luxembourg lawsuit filed against the group  now settled as part of the settlement with contrin 
contrin agrees  if it secures a final judgment the austrian judgment against mr 
palatin in austria  to register the austrian judgment in the uk and to assign the austrian judgment to the group for collection against the amersham estate 
on or about november  
table of contents  contrin filed its civil action against mr 
palatin in austria for recovery of million  plus interest and costs 
if the amersham estate is foreclosed upon in satisfaction of the cronos charging orders and any austrian judgment secured by contrin against mr 
palatin  the parties agree that the first million of net foreclosure proceeds from the sale of the amersham estate and attributable to the cronos charging orders and or austrian judgment will be allocated and paid to contrin  with the balance of foreclosure proceeds allocated and paid to cronos in satisfaction of the remaining unsatisfied amount  if any  of the cronos charging orders 
the settlement agreement provides for cronos to pay contrin a total of million if the group is unable to foreclose the cronos charging orders against the amersham estate by the third anniversary of the effective date of the settlement december  
in addition if the net proceeds of foreclosure of the amersham estate in satisfaction of the cronos charging orders and any charging order obtained by the group to enforce the austrian judgment total less than million then the group agrees to make up the difference 
the settlement agreement provides for cronos to pay contrin a total of million not million if the group forecloses the cronos charging orders against the amersham estate by december   and  by the date of foreclosure  contrin has not secured a lien on the amersham estate in aid of its action against mr 
palatin in austria or a charging order against the amersham estate to satisfy any austrian judgment it secures 
in this case  should the net proceeds of foreclosure of the amersham estate in satisfaction of the cronos charging orders total less than million then the group agrees to make up the difference 
the settlement agreement specifies an installment payment plan under which cronos paid contrin million in november and million in february and requires further payments of million on or before january   million on or before april   million on or before july   million on or before october  and million on or before january  the balance of million is due on or before november  each payment reduces  dollar for dollar  the company s obligation to pay contrin million or million  as the case may be  and will count as a credit ie  a reduction to contrin s entitlement to million of net foreclosure proceeds from the sale of the amersham estate 
if foreclosure of the cronos charging orders against the amersham estate occurs before any of these payments is due  then the group s obligation to make the remaining payment s is excused 
under the settlement agreement an escrow account will be established with an independent bank or trust company in london for deposit of the proceeds from foreclosure of the amersham estate as a result of the enforcement of the cronos charging orders and any charging order obtained to enforce the austrian judgment 
the company shall deposit to the escrow account the proceeds of any foreclosure of the amersham estate in response to the cronos charging orders  generally after subtracting and  subject to its obligation to pay by the third anniversary of the settlement  million  as described above  retaining therefrom the amount of any installments made by the group to contrin as described in the preceding two paragraphs 
by the terms of the settlement agreement  contrin has agreed to dismiss the three actions it has brought against the group and releases the group from all claims asserted by contrin in the three actions 
other than for the express obligations undertaken by the group under the settlement agreement  the group denies all liability to contrin by reason of the claims asserted by contrin in the three actions  and the settlement agreement is explicit that nothing in the settlement agreement is to be deemed an admission of  or evidence of  any wrongdoing or liability on the part of the group 
the company calculated that the present value of the total million future cash payments under the settlement agreement installment payment plan  discounted using an appropriate risk free interest rate  was million 
as discussed herein  the group made the first installment payment of million in november in addition  the group had previously recorded a reserve of approximately million against the contrin claims 
interest will be charged to the company s income statement over the period for performance of the settlement agreement using the effective interest rate method 

table of contents valuation of the amersham estate 
in connection with the foreclosure action brought by the group against mr 
palatin to foreclose the cronos charging orders against the amersham estate  the group secured an independent valuation of the amersham estate 
the firm that conducted the valuation was not able to conduct an on site inspection of the amersham estate and therefore based its valuation upon publicly available information about the estate and sales of comparable properties 
the firm valued the amersham estate within the range of million british pounds to million british pounds at current exchange rates  the equivalent of approximately us million to us million 
the land records of the county in which the amersham estate is located do not disclose any mortgage or other indebtedness encumbering the amersham estate 
no assurance can be given that the group will be successful in foreclosing the cronos charging orders against the amersham estate  that the sales price achieved from any such foreclosure would exceed or equal the valuation of the estate of between million british pounds and million british pounds  or that the net proceeds of any such foreclosure would be sufficient to satisfy the cronos charging orders and or any austrian judgment secured by contrin against mr 
palatin 
palatin bankruptcy 
on or about december   a creditor of mr 
palatin initiated a bankruptcy proceeding against him in austria 
the bankruptcy filing has stayed contrin s prosecution of its civil action against mr 
palatin 
while the bankruptcy filing requires the group to serve the bankruptcy trustee with notice of the group s foreclosure action in the uk  the group does not believe that the bankruptcy will effect a stay of prosecution of the foreclosure action 
the group is working cooperatively with contrin in an attempt to minimize the impact of the palatin bankruptcy on the implementation of the settlement

restatement of consolidated financial statements in december  the group adopted interpretation no 
revised fin r  consolidation of variable interest entities 
fin r clarifies the application of accounting research bulletin no 
arb  to certain entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
arb requires that an enterprise s consolidated financial statements include subsidiaries in which the enterprise has a controlling financial interest 
that requirement 
table of contents has usually been applied to subsidiaries in which an enterprise has a majority voting interest 
the voting interest approach is not effective in identifying controlling financial interests in entities that are not controllable through voting interests or in which the equity investors do not bear the residual economic risk 
fin r explains how an enterprise identifies variable interest entities in order to assess its interests in variable interest entities and decide whether to consolidate that entity 
the group has applied fin r to all entities it believes are subject to fin r as of december   and has determined that it is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity 
accordingly  cronos has applied fin r by restating previously issued financial statements with a cumulative effect adjustment in the beginning of the first year restated 
the group holds a share in the variable interest entity to which it sold million of containers in a series of transactions in prior years 
cronos manages the containers in return for a management fee and holds an option to acquire of the container owning company for one us dollar which can be exercised once certain conditions relating to the repayment of the indebtedness of the variable interest entity have been met 
at december   the variable interest entity held cash balances of million  restricted cash of million  container assets of million stated at net book value  debt facilities of million and million of amounts payable to subsidiaries of the company 
the debt is scheduled to be repaid from the cash generated by the container assets 
such amounts are subordinate to the repayment of the variable interest entity debt

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of the group s financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto and the other financial and statistical information appearing elsewhere in this annual report 
the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap 
the segment information presented in note to the group s consolidated financial statements relates to the containers of the group s fleet owned by the group itself or by managed container programs comprising container equity programs and other managed container programs 
owned containers include containers held for resale 
all containers  whether owned or managed  are operated as part of a single fleet 
the group has discretion over which ocean carriers  container manufacturers and suppliers of goods and services it deals with 
since the group s agreements with the owners of managed container programs contain leases within the scope of sfas no 
sfas accounting for leases  they are accounted for in the group s financial statements as leases under which the container owners are lessors and the group is lessee 
in  of payments to owners of managed container programs represented agreements which generally provided that the amounts payable to container owners were based upon the rentals to ocean carriers after deducting direct operating expenses and the income earned by cronos for managing the equipment 
the remaining of payments to managed container programs represented agreements under which there were fixed payment terms 
minimum lease payments on the agreements with fixed payment terms are included in note c to the group s consolidated financial statements 
gross lease revenue is generated by leasing containers  both owned by the group and by managed container programs  to ocean carriers under operating leases  excluding billings in advance 
these amounts are billed on a monthly basis 
amounts due under master leases are calculated by the group at the end of each month and billed approximately to days thereafter 
amounts due under term leases are set forth in the respective lease agreements and are generally billed and payable on a monthly basis 
changes in gross lease revenue depend primarily upon fleet size  utilization rates and per diem rates 
equipment trading revenue and expenses represent revenue earned from the sale of equipment to third parties and the costs of the equipment sold 
in equipment trading transactions  the group enters into an agreement in which it undertakes to supply equipment to a third party 
simultaneously  cronos enters into a separate agreement with a container manufacturer for the acquisition of the equipment 
the group acts as principal in such transactions and accordingly the revenue and expenses are reported gross 
this equipment does not enter the cronos fleet of managed containers 
commissions  fees and other operating income includes acquisition fees relating to the group s managed container programs  income from direct financing leases  fees earned in connection with equipment consultancy and design services  licence fee income earned in connection with the patented cpcs see item description of business  fees from the disposal of used containers in the managed container programs and miscellaneous other fees and income 
this item is affected by the size of managed programs and the contracted acquisition fee  the level of consultancy and design work undertaken  the quantity of cpcs acquired by third parties  the number and value of direct financing leases and income from disposals of used containers 
although acquisition fees are generally received in cash at the inception of a managed container program and are non refundable  they are amortized in the statement of operations on a straight line basis over the period of the managed container agreement to which they relate 
direct operating expenses are direct costs associated with leasing both owned and managed containers 
management analyzes direct operating expenses as a percentage of gross lease revenue 
direct operating expenses may be categorized as follows activity related expenses include agents costs and depot costs such as repairs  maintenance and handling 

table of contents inventory related expenses relate to off hire containers and comprise storage and repositioning costs 
these costs are sensitive to the quantity of off hire containers as well as the frequency at which containers are re delivered 
legal and other expenses include legal costs  insurance and provisions for doubtful accounts 
payments to managed container programs reflect the amounts due to the owners of containers in managed container programs computed in accordance with the terms of the individual agreements 
selling  general and administrative expenses include all employee and office costs  professional fees  business insurance and computer systems costs 
segment profit or loss for reported segments  comprises items directly attributable to specific containers in each of the group s operating segments including gross lease revenue  direct operating expenses  payments to managed container programs  direct financing lease income  container interest expense  container depreciation expense and certain impairment charges 
market overview industry observers report that global container trade grew by an estimated in following similar growth in  container leasing companies have experienced high levels of demand for existing equipment and off hire container inventories have declined as a result 
the current market contrasts sharply with the market in when the shipping and container leasing industries experienced a sharp drop in demand 
the fall in demand together with lower prices for new equipment produced strong downward pressure on lease rates 
as a result of the market downturn in  shipping lines and container leasing companies reduced their levels of investment in new container equipment in and in the first half of this had the effect of addressing  to some extent  the problems of container over supply caused by higher levels of production in and in addition  since the downturn in  some shipping lines opted to lease greater amounts of containers than in previous years by scaling back their level of investment in new container equipment  thereby generating increased demand for new production from the leasing companies 
however  there are indications that shipping lines intend to increase their levels of container purchasing in this may have a negative impact on the demand for leased containers 
in and  the growth in the marketplace together with relatively low equipment and financing costs led to a strong upturn in the level of new container investment by leasing companies 
reports from container manufacturers and industry observers suggest that new container production in surpassed record levels set in earlier years 
for  the level of new container investment is forecast to equal or exceed levels 
however  the cost of new container equipment has increased significantly in the first months of as a result of higher steel prices 
these factors could potentially result in a change in the level of demand and may cause a reduction in the returns earned on the capital invested in new equipment 
as the global economy continues to evolve  shipping lines are faced with rising container imbalances in most major trade routes  rising operating costs associated with repositioning empty containers into high demand locations  and freight rates  despite their recent increases  remain at levels lower than those achieved in previous years 
cronos believes that these conditions favor the larger more established shipping lines that have witnessed strong recoveries in their performance over the last few years 
the group will monitor the aging of lease receivables  collections and the credit status of existing and potential customers in order to detect any signs of a deterioration in their credit position 
global container trade is affected by a wide range of issues including the performance of the world s major economies  the performance of global stock markets and geopolitical issues such as those that currently exist in the middle east and asia  all of which can potentially change the level of demand for leased containers 

table of contents funding one of the main reasons for the improvement in profitability in was the ability of the group to add new equipment to both its owned and managed fleets 
cronos recognizes that its ability to secure funding from third parties in order to expand its container fleet is crucial to its future growth and profitability traditionally  cronos has utilized funding from each of its operating segments to grow its container fleet 
in more recent years  growth has been generated by the owned container segment through debt and capital leases and by the container equity programs segment through the addition of equipment to the joint venture program 
each of these sources provides a flexible financing structure with competitive pricing 
owned containers the primary debt and capital lease facilities include financial covenants that are tested on a quarterly basis relating to minimum tangible net worth  maximum level of total liabilities to tangible net worth  maximum level of debt and capital lease obligations to tangible net worth  interest expense coverage and debt service coverage 
in  the group was in compliance with these covenants 
future compliance with the covenants will depend on the ability of the group to report a minimum level of income before income taxes at the end of each calendar quarter equal to of interest expense for the preceding twelve month period  and to maintain the current portion of borrowings within financial covenant limits 
the breach of a covenant constitutes an event of default 
the primary source of debt funding available to the group is its revolving credit facility the revolving credit facility which the group has utilized to fund the acquisition of new equipment and to refinance existing debt and capital lease obligation facilities 
new equipment is funded by debt and by cash provided by the group 
during  the revolving credit facility was amended and the maximum commitment of the lenders thereunder increased from million to million 
the amended agreement provides that the balance outstanding as of september   will be amortized over five years 
at december   the balance outstanding under the revolving credit facility was million 
the remaining debt will be utilized to purchase new equipment in the first half of the revolving credit facility is subject to annual review and the ability of the group to expand its owned container fleet may be constrained if increased funding is not approved on an annual basis or if the group cannot provide the cash required for new container acquisitions 
container equity programs the joint venture program has been a major source of funding for the group since its inception in at december  the joint venture program had capacity for an additional million of new equipment 
additional debt and equity funding is subject to annual review

dry cargo container per diem rates declined by a further during this may be attributed to three main factors per diem rental rates decreased in line with the reduction in container prices and interest rates 
cronos converted lease agreements with several shipping lines from master to long term leases 
these conversions provide greater revenue stability but at lower lease rates than master leases 
cronos initiated new term leases for older equipment  which  while resulting in lower per diem rates  significantly lowered inventory levels 
the following factors are important when assessing the impact of a reduction in per diem rental rates the improvement in utilization that can result from lower per diem rates may have a significant favorable effect on direct operating expenses due to the reduction in storage and other inventory costs 
the global economic pressures that cause a reduction in lease rates may also contribute  to some extent  to a reduction in interest rates 
utilization since the beginning of  the improvement in market conditions and the implementation of several cronos marketing initiatives resulted in a reduction in off hire dry container inventories resulting in a percentage point increase in utilization

during  the group incurred million for repositioning moves  primarily from us east coast and certain european locations to the far east 
the cost of repositioning containers is offset by savings in storage expense and increased future lease revenues 
the group has tightened the terms of its lease agreements with shipping lines to reduce the possibility of a similar build up of inventories in the future 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  overview cronos reported net income of million in compared to million in the prior year 
the increase in profitability in can be attributed primarily to growth in global container trade 
increased availability of funding for investment in new container production and  in particular  the growth and profitability of the joint venture program

this reflects the strong demand from the ocean carriers for this type of lease together with a cronos funding base designed to add more term leases which provide revenue stability and a low cost base 
analysis discussion gross lease revenue glr of million for the year ended december   was million  or  higher than for the prior year 
of the increase  million was due to the combined effect of the change in utilization and per diem rates and million was due to the increase in fleet size

direct operating expenses were million in  a decrease of million  or  compared to the primary reasons for the decline were a reduction of million in inventory related costs reflecting a million decline in storage due to the reduction in off hire container inventories  partially offset by an increase of million in repositioning expense reflecting the cost of moving off hire equipment from low demand to high demand locations 
a million increase in the amount of legal and other costs as the provision for doubtful accounts was increased to reflect the deterioration in the credit position of a far east based shipping line

operating cash flow 
the group s operating cash flow is derived from lease revenues generated by the group s container fleet  fee revenues from its managed container programs and other parties and income earned on equipment trading transactions 
operating cash flow is utilized to meet costs relating to day to day fleet support  payments to managed container programs  selling  general and administrative expenses  interest expense  servicing the current portion of long term borrowings  financing a portion of certain debt funded equipment acquisitions and providing equity contributions to fund of the capital requirements of the joint venture program 
operating cash flow is largely dependent upon the timely collections of lease revenues from shipping lines 
based on loss experience for the last twelve years  bad debts have approximated of lease revenues 
the group monitors the aging of lease receivables  collections and the credit status of existing and potential customers 
there is a risk that some shipping lines may experience financial difficulty 
any resultant material increase in the level of bad debts could potentially impair the ability of the group to meet its operating and other commitments 
at december   the group had million of available container borrowing facilities under which million was outstanding

the joint venture program is a million container purchase program which was established to acquire and lease to third party lessees marine cargo containers through a joint venture owned by a subsidiary of the company and owned by an affiliate of the bank 
the group and the bank have each committed approximately million in equity to the joint venture program and the bank and another financial institution have committed a total of million in debt financing 
therefore  the lenders provide up to of the cost of acquiring the containers with cronos and the bank as the joint venture partners  each providing one half of the equity to fund the balance of the capital requirements of the joint venture program 
the joint venture entity is a bankruptcy remote  special purpose company organized under the laws of bermuda and is accounted for under the equity method of accounting

the general partner will be indemnified by the partnership for any liabilities suffered by it arising out of its activities as general partner  except in the case of misconduct or negligence 
as a limited liability partnership  the limited partners may not be assessed for additional capital contributions and therefore it is possible that the general partner could be liable for any additional contributions required

critical accounting policies and estimates container equipment depreciable lives 
container equipment is either depreciated over a life of years to a residual value of  or  over a life of years to a residual value of 
management evaluates the period of amortization and residual values to determine whether subsequent events and circumstances warrant revised estimates of useful lives and residual values 
container equipment valuation 
the group reviews owned container equipment when changes in circumstances require consideration as to whether the carrying value of the equipment has become impaired  pursuant to guidance established in sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
management considers assets to be impaired if the carrying value of the asset exceeds the future projected cash flows from related operations undiscounted and without interest charges 
when impairment is deemed to exist  the assets are written down to fair value or projected discounted cash flows from related operations 
the group evaluates future cash flows and potential impairment of its fleet by container type rather than for each individual container 
therefore  future losses could result for individual container disposals due to various factors including age  condition  suitability for continued leasing  as well as geographic location of the containers where disposed 
deferred taxation 
under sfas no 
sfas accounting for income taxes  the group is required to record a valuation allowance if realization of a deferred tax asset is unlikely 
substantial weight must be given to recent historical results and near term projections  and management must assess the availability of tax planning strategies that might impact either the need for  or the amount of  any valuation allowance 
based on the recent history of operating losses in its us subsidiaries  the near term outlook and management s evaluation of available tax planning strategies  the group has maintained a valuation 
table of contents allowance for its deferred tax asset related to net operating loss carryforwards in the us since as of december   the group s valuation allowance aggregated million 
in the event the group were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax asset  a reversal of part or all of the valuation allowance would be recorded 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
cronos continually tracks its credit exposure to each customer using specialist third party credit information services and reports prepared by local staff to assess credit quality 
cronos credit committee meets quarterly to analyze the performance of existing customers and to recommend actions to be taken in order to minimize credit risks 
over the last years  bad debts have approximated of gross lease revenues 
based on this information  cronos has calculated an allowance for doubtful accounts comprising specific amounts provided against known probable losses on certain customers plus an additional amount based on loss experience for other customers 
however  the group may be subject to unexpected loss in rental revenue from container lessees that default under their container lease agreements 
goodwill 
on january   the group adopted sfas no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  which provides that intangible assets with finite useful lives be amortized over that life and that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives will not be amortized  but will rather be tested at least annually for impairment 
the annual impairment test uses cash flow discounting techniques to determine the fair value of respective reporting units 
management discounts the projected future net cash flows to be generated by the reporting units based on historic and projected trends for per diem revenues  utilization  container disposal proceeds and funding costs over the expected remaining life of the unit 
although the projected trends are based on historical and current available information  they require subjective management judgment for projections relating to utilization rates  per diem rates  the disposal age of the containers  equipment residual values  cash collections and interest rates 
gross lease revenue managed container programs 
cronos leases equipment to ocean carriers that is owned by its managed container programs 
cronos acts as principal in the lease arrangement with shipping lines based on the characteristics of these transactions in which cronos determines the ocean carrier to which the equipment is leased  sets the applicable lease rental rate  acts as primary obligor in the transaction and collects the lease rentals 
accordingly  cronos reports the resulting lease income on a gross basis  rather than net of its lease costs to the managed container programs 
us limited partnership programs fin r 
the group has determined that the us limited partnership programs are variable interest entities as defined in fin r 
cronos has performed an analysis of the expected losses and the expected residual returns of the us limited partnership programs and determined that the group is not the primary beneficiary 
although the assumptions used in the calculation of expected losses and expected residual returns are based on historical and current available information  they require subjective management judgment for projections relating to utilization rates  per diem rates  the disposal age of the containers  equipment residual values and cash collections 
new accounting pronouncements in december  the group adopted fin r consolidation of variable interest entities 
fin r clarifies the application of accounting research bulletin no 
arb to certain entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
arb requires that an enterprise s consolidated financial statements include subsidiaries in which the enterprise has a controlling financial interest 
that requirement has usually been applied to subsidiaries in which an enterprise has a majority voting interest 
the voting interest approach is not effective in identifying controlling financial interests in entities that are not controllable through voting interests or in which the equity investors do not bear the residual economic risk 
fin r explains how an enterprise identifies variable interest entities in order to assess its interests in variable interest entities and decide whether to consolidate that entity 
the group has applied fin r to all entities it believes are subject to fin r as of december   and has determined that it is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity 
accordingly  cronos has applied fin r by restating previously issued financial statements with a cumulative effect adjustment in the beginning of the first year restated
