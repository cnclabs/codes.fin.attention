item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the applicable period 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates  assumptions and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  intangible assets  income taxes  financing arrangements and contingencies 
management bases its estimates  assumptions and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant estimates  assumptions and judgments used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
commission income is recorded on the effective date of the policy or the billing date  whichever is later 
in the case of contingent commissions tied to achieving specified volume levels  revenue is recorded when the related criteria has been met 
contingent commission income associated with profit sharing arrangements is recorded at the earlier of the amounts being reasonably estimatable or receipt of such amounts 
service fees are earned over the period the related services are performed 
discontinued operations 
as of december   pico s risk based capital fell into the mandatory control level 
consequently  on march   pico and the california doi entered into an oversight agreement which effectively gave the california doi control over pico s operations 
on april   the california doi obtained a conservation order for pico which was followed on june  by a liquidation order 
subsequent to the liquation order  the company provided limited operation support to pico 
given the continued activity with pico through the third quarter of  the company was precluded from treating pico as a discontinued operation for accounting purposes 
in the fourth quarter of the requirements of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment of disposal of long lived assets sfas for treating a segment as a discontinued operation were met 
consequently  operating activity related to workers compensation underwriting has been reclassified as discontinued operations 
as a result  certain financial information previously issued has been adjusted to give effect to the classification of the pico business as discontinued operations in accordance with sfas amounts related to discontinued operations in primarily relate to the write off of pico receivables and employee severance costs associated with the discontinuance of pico operations 
business acquisitions and purchase price allocations 
all of the company s acquisitions have been accounted for using the purchase method 
consequently  the net assets and results of operations of the acquired operations have been included in the company s consolidated financial statements from the respective acquisition dates 
the company structures such transactions to include earn out provisions whereby the ultimate purchase price is tied to actual revenues in the months immediately following the effective date generally twelve months 
additional or reduced consideration resulting from such earn out provisions is reflected as an adjustment to goodwill when the contingency is resolved 
the company uses a methodology based on discounted future cash flows derived from acquired client lists and attrition rates to estimate the fair value of the expiration rights and other intangible assets at the date of acquisition 
expiration rights are amortized on a straight line basis over their estimates lives of five to seven years 
non compete agreements are typically valued at their stated contractual amount and are amortized on a straight line basis over the terms of the agreements 
goodwill is not subject to amortization 
both the allocation of purchase price and the estimation of useful lives require management s judgment 
if historical fact patterns were to change  such as the rate of attrition of acquired client accounts  the company may be required to allocate more purchase price to goodwill or accelerate the amortization of expiration rights  which may have a material negative impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
goodwill and other intangible asset impairment 
the company assesses the recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets at least once a year or as required based on triggering events 
a triggering event is a change in business circumstances that indicates that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable 
examples of a triggering event include poor financial results or projections  deterioration of client base  loss of key employees or changes in the marketplace 
reviews for triggering events require the use of management s judgment 
if as a result of the impairment review  the company finds that the carrying value of an asset is in excess of the fair value  the company would be required to take a charge against current earnings 
the results of our reviews disclosed no such asset impairments in and income taxes 
determining the consolidated provision for income tax expense  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any related valuation allowance involves judgment 
gaap requires deferred tax assets and liabilities to be recognized for the estimated future tax effects attributed to temporary differences and carryforwards based on provisions of the enacted tax law 
the effects of future changes in tax laws or rates are not anticipated 
temporary differences are differences between the tax basis of an asset or liability and its reported amount in the consolidated financial statements 
carryforwards primarily include items such as net operating losses  which can be carried forward to future tax years 
the company is required to reduce its net deferred tax asset by a valuation allowance to the extent that  based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that any deferred tax asset will not be realized 
any increase in the related allowance account would decrease reported earnings on a dollar for dollar basis in the year in which such recognition was to occur 
because of the quasi reorganization effected by the company in  any decrease in the valuation allowance will be a direct increase to additional paid in capital 
overview the company s revenues consist primarily of commission income  contingent commission income  service fees and other income

prior to august  scif s maximum commission rate was 
effective august  the maximum commission rate is 
since commission rates are only adjusted at renewal  the full impact of this change will not be reflected in the company s consolidated financial statements until the last half of the company is attempting to mitigate the impact of the scif commission adjustment in a number of significant ways 
first  the company is actively engaged in offering alternative risk structures  including proprietary access to a member owned bermuda captive 
second  the company is diversifying its revenue base by expanding its property and casualty commissions and developing a significant crop insurance platform as discussed above
