key markets for the company s products  as a percent of net sales  include pulp and paper  paints and adhesives  construction materials  food  pharmaceutical and personal care  and industrial specialties including oilfield  textiles and general industrial 
over of the company s revenues are generated outside of north america 
net sales by region in were north america  europe  asia pacific and latin america 
the company operates through two reportable segments and four divisions performance products pulp and paper and aqualon and engineered materials and additives fibervisions and pinova 
net sales for as a percent of total sales  by division  were pulp and paper  aqualon  fibervisions  and pinova 
pulp and paper is a large and technically advanced provider of pulp and paper chemicals and technical paper process solutions 
the industry in which pulp and paper competes is projected to experience average growth rates of to through demand for process chemicals  retention aids and strength resins has increased as the quality of pulp used in paper products has been reduced 
however  the industry has become increasingly competitive as consolidation continues within the pulp and paper customer base 
aqualon is a supplier of products that manage the properties of aqueous water based systems 
aqualon s products are mostly derived from renewable natural raw materials  including cellulose and guar  and are used in paints and coatings  personal care products such as toothpaste and shampoo  oil and gas well drilling to provide fluid loss control and as a strengthening agent in mortar and plaster  among other uses 
fibervisions is a global supplier of synthetic fibers made from polypropylene and polyethylene used primarily in non woven fabrics for disposable diapers and other hygienic products 
pinova offers products that generally are custom made to fit a particular use in an industry and impart or improve the properties of a variety of compounded substances 
performance in was impacted by several significant economic factors higher costs  especially for energy and energy related raw materials  but also for pension benefits  overall flat price volume mix growth  appreciation in the euro against the us dollar  and continued productivity improvement offsetting the negative effects of the higher costs 
in addition  pulp and paper  aqualon and fibervisions benefited from new product introductions 
higher cost energy and natural gas crude oil as feedstock are impacting many raw materials  particularly derivatives of chlor alkalai  ethylene  benzene  propylene and natural gas 
the company has instituted a number of initiatives to mitigate these negative effects  including product substitution  exploring new sourcing opportunities and entering into forward contracts for a portion of its natural gas requirements 
paper and paperboard production was down in north america 
office paper production in europe  a key market for hercules  was also down 
factors impacting the north american paper industry include a declining manufacturing base as more production shifts off shore to countries such as china  lower classified advertising newsprint  lower weight magazines and a slowdown in print advertising  and plastics substitutes for liquid packaging 
market conditions affecting the aqualon business were generally stable in volume growth was fueled by an increase in the construction  oil field and personal care businesses 
global price increases were implemented in the first half of  partially offsetting higher raw material and energy costs 
further price increases have been announced to offset new raw material increases 
in fibervisions  margins were under pressure in europe including the middle east and africa  the americas and asia due to renewed competitive activity and higher raw material prices 
the business mitigated these factors through continued streamlining of its fixed cost structure 
new product introductions and the consolidation of the es fibervisions joint ventures contributed million and million  respectively  to net sales growth in lower volumes in the pinova business were driven by lost business in its chewing gum and adhesives markets 
higher raw material costs and pension expense also negatively impacted profits 
the business has been successful in regaining most of the lost volumes through increased sales to existing customers and the addition of new customers

critical accounting estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations is based on its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires hercules to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
hercules evaluates its estimates on a regular basis  including those related to sales returns and allowances  bad debts  inventories  impairments of long lived assets  income taxes  restructuring  contingencies  including litigation and environmental and pension and other benefit obligations 
hercules bases its estimates on various factors including historical experience  consultation and advice from third party subject matter experts and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and circumstances 
hercules believes that the following accounting estimates are critical due to the significant subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for the matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change and the affect of the estimates and assumptions on its consolidated financial statements 
the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
allowances for doubtful accounts are based on historical experience and known factors regarding specific customers and industries in which the customers operate 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances would be required 
aside from goodwill and intangible assets  which are tested for impairment under the guidance provided in sfas  the company has adopted sfas and tests other long lived assets for impairment based on the guidance provided in sfas the company records an impairment loss on its long lived assets based on the excess of the carrying amount over fair value when expected future undiscounted cash flows are insufficient to recover the carrying amount of the asset 
the fair value represents expected future cash flows from the use of the assets  discounted at the rate used to evaluate potential investments 
if the company determines that an impairment loss has occurred  the loss is recognized in the income statement 
deterioration in future economic conditions  poor operating results in a business or the determination that the long lived asset is unsuitable for one reason or another  new or stronger competitors  or changes in technology could result in losses or the inability to recover the carrying value of the asset  thereby possibly requiring an impairment in the future 
hercules adopted the provisions of sfas effective january  hercules identified the following reporting units betzdearborn  pulp and paper  aqualon  fibervisions and pinova 
in connection with hercules transitional review  recorded goodwill was determined to be impaired in the betzdearborn and fibervisions reporting units 
in the first quarter of  hercules completed its transitional impairment review of the identified reporting units and recognized an after tax impairment loss of million as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
in addition  an after tax impairment loss of million was recognized in the first quarter of relating to the company s equity investment in cp kelco  which had an impairment under sfas as a result of hercules adoption of sfas  the company no longer records approximately million of annual amortization relating to existing goodwill and intangibles 
pursuant to sfas  the company is required to perform an annual assessment of its reporting units for impairment 
to assess impairment  the company compares the reporting unit s book value of net assets  including goodwill  to its fair value 
fair value is estimated using a combination of valuation approaches including the market value and income approaches 
in the event that the book value exceeds the fair value  the company recognizes an impairment to the extent the book value of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill for any reporting unit  calculated by determining the fair value of the assets and liabilities for the reporting unit 
deterioration in future economic conditions  poor operating results in the reporting units  new or stronger competitors  or changes in technology could result in an inability to recover the carrying value of the goodwill and intangible assets  thereby requiring an impairment in the future 
hercules records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized after consideration of future taxable income and reasonable tax planning strategies 
at december   the company had gross deferred tax assets of approximately million  including capital and operating loss carryforwards of million 
valuation allowances of approximately million have been set up on the total deferred tax assets 
in the event that hercules were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its deferred tax assets  for which a valuation allowance had not been established  or is able to utilize capital and or operating loss carryforwards for which a valuation allowance has been established  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset will be reflected in income in the period such determination is made 
hercules has and will continue to record charges for the estimated costs of employee severance and other exit costs pursuant to the company s strategy to continuously improve return on capital  streamline organizational structure  improve work processes and consolidate manufacturing and non manufacturing resources 
since initiating the strategy in the third quarter  the company has recognized million in charges for severance and other exit costs 
in the event that it is determined that additional employees must be involuntarily terminated  or that additional manufacturing or non manufacturing facilities must be closed pursuant to work process redesign or other cost reduction initiatives  supplemental reserves would be required  which would result in an incremental charge against earnings 
in the event that the number of employees involuntarily terminated pursuant to restructuring plans is less than anticipated due to greater than anticipated voluntary resignations  an adjustment to reduce excess restructuring reserves would increase income in the period that the determination was made 
hercules establishes reserves for environmental matters  litigation and other contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability is reasonably estimable 
at december   the company had accrued million for contingencies and asset retirement obligations in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for contingencies sfas  and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas 
the actual costs will depend upon numerous factors  including the number of parties found responsible at each environmental site and their ability to pay  the actual methods of remediation required or agreed to  outcomes of negotiations with regulatory authorities  outcomes of litigation  changes in environmental laws and regulations  technological developments  the years of remedial activity required  changes in the number or financial exposures of claims  lawsuits  settlements or judgments  or in the ability to reduce such financial exposures by collecting indemnity payments from insurers 
if the contingency is resolved for an amount greater or less than has been accrued  or hercules share of the contingency increases or decreases  or other assumptions relevant to the development of the estimate were to change  hercules would recognize an additional expense or benefit in income in the period such determination was made 
hercules has established reserves for asbestos related personal injury lawsuits and claims 
based on the results of a study the company commissioned of its asbestos related liability and considering amounts outstanding under previous settlements  the company estimated that its reasonably possible financial exposure for these matters ranged from million to million  with no amount within this range representing a better estimate than any other amount 
the company s estimates are based on a number of assumptions including the number of future claims  the timing and amount of future payments  disease  venue  the dynamic nature of asbestos litigation and the present uncertainty concerning the participation of its excess insurance carriers and other circumstances 
at december   the company has recorded a gross accrued liability of million  reflecting the low end of the range and million for previously settled but unpaid asbestos claims  for present and future potential asbestos claims before anticipated insurance recoveries 
the company believes that it is probable that million of the million accrual will be funded by or recovered from insurance carriers 
that belief  which is subject to the various assumptions set forth herein  is based on many factors that have been evaluated by the company  along with outside insurance counsel  including the indemnity and defense payments that have been made by its now exhausted insurance carriers  and by some of its other carriers  and the limits of remaining potentially available insurance coverage  as well as the range of possible outcomes in the company s insurance coverage litigation taking into account  among other considerations  the facts and status of that litigation  and the relevant case law 
the company provides defined benefit pension and postretirement welfare benefit plans to employees in the united states who meet eligibility requirements 
similar plans are provided outside the united states in accordance with local practice 
pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and the related expense income are determined based upon actuarial assumptions regarding mortality  medical inflation rates  discount rates  long term return on assets  salary increases  medicare availability and other factors 
the assets of the us  united kingdom us and the netherlands defined benefit plans constitute  and  respectively  of the total defined benefits plan assets applicable to plans sponsored by the company 
in  the actual return earned on us plan assets exceeded the expected long term rate of return assumption of 
the historical return on us plan assets earned in and was less than the expected long term rate of return assumption 
in addition  yields on long term corporate bonds continued to decrease throughout and  pursuant to the company s annual review of the actuarial assumptions  the discount rate was lowered to at december  based on current assumptions  pension and postretirement benefit plan expenses for the years  and are projected to be approximately million  million and million 
the projected increase in pension expense over in  and is due to the decline in interest rates and the unfavorable performance of the pension investment portfolio over the period the increase in and also assumes the adoption of the mortality table in the adoption of the mortality table increases pension and postretirement expense by approximately million per year 
the company presently anticipates a decrease in consolidated pension and postretirement expense in from as a result of favorable investment performance in as a result of past unfavorable investment performance and the lower discount rate  the accumulated benefit obligation abo exceeded the fair value of plan assets at december  at december   the abo of the us  us and german defined benefit pension plans of  million  million and million  respectively  exceeded their funded benefits 
the company is required to recognize an additional liability equal to the sum of such excess plus the prepaid pension asset balance  with a corresponding after tax charge to other comprehensive income in stockholders equity 
at december   the company recorded an additional minimum liability aml of million pre tax with an after tax charge to other comprehensive income of million 
at december   the aml decreased million to million pre tax and  accordingly  the change to accumulated other comprehensive income was decreased by million to million 
at december   the consolidated projected benefit obligation was  million 
a basis point decrease or increase in the discount rate has approximately a plus or minus million impact on the company s consolidated abo 
at the present time  the us defined benefit pension plan is at a sufficient funding level as to not require erisa mandated contributions 
the company has initiated a study to review plan changes that are expected to result in a reduction of future expenses and liabilities to its us defined benefit final pay pension plan 
the company has decided  however  that it is in the best interests of the company and its pension plan participants to make voluntary contributions to the plan 
if the us qualified pension plan performs in accordance with the actuarial assumptions  the company presently anticipates making voluntary cash contributions of approximately million per year over the next few years  including million contributed to the us defined benefit plan in january the company also contributed million to its non us pension plans in the fourth quarter to bring funding to required levels or to improve government mandated funding provisions

as a result of the de consolidation  long term debt reflects the company s obligation to hercules trust ii for the crests units junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures long term debt at december  also reflects the company s obligations to hercules trust i on the toprs junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures 
the indenture for the crests units junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures does not provide the ability for the company to repay  redeem or defease the crests units junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures through purchasing the crests units 
accordingly  at december  the outstanding balance of crests units junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures has not changed as a result of the company s purchase of the crests units

the term b loan bears interest at libor at december  
the revolving credit agreement bears interest at libor plus an applicable margin  currently  which is determinable based on the company s leverage ratio 
the senior credit facility is secured by liens on the company s us assets including real  personal and intellectual properties and is guaranteed by substantially all of the company s current and future wholly owned domestic subsidiaries 
issuance costs related to the financing are included in deferred charges and other assets and are being amortized over the term of the loans  using the effective interest method

the company s contractual commitments as of december  are summarized as follows dollars in millions payments due by period less than after total year years years years long term debt obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term liabilities reflected on the registrant s balance sheet under gaap total contractual cash obligations includes amounts related to asbestos related matters  asset retirement obligation  and workers compensation claims 
due to the dynamic nature of asbestos litigation and the present uncertainty concerning the participation of the company s excess insurance carriers  it is impractical to determine the anticipated payments in any given year 
therefore  the non current asbestos related liability of million has been reflected in the after five years column 
the company had the following commercial commitments at december  lines of credit of million outstanding and letters of credit of million  both of which may require payments in the future 
if required  these commitments would be funded from general corporate funds 
the company projects cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet its investing and financing requirements in the next several years 
the company presently is in discussions to refinance a portion of its debt 
the proposed refinancing  if implemented  is expected to reduce interest expense and extend debt maturities to future years 
risk factors indebtedness as of december   the company s total debt was approximately  million  of which is fixed rate indebtedness 
the company s indebtedness has significant consequences 
for example  it could increase the company s vulnerability to economic downturns and competitive pressures  require the company to dedicate a substantial portion of its cash flow from operations to payments on its indebtedness  thereby reducing the availability of its cash flow to fund working capital  capital expenditures  research and development efforts and other general corporate purposes  limit the company s flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in its business and the industries in which it operates or in pursuing attractive business opportunities requiring debt financing  place the company at a disadvantage to its competitors that have less debt  and limit the company s ability to borrow additional funds due to restrictive covenants 
the senior credit facility and the indenture governing the senior notes due  which together account for a large portion of the company s debt  contain numerous restrictive covenants  including  among other things  covenants that limit the company s ability to borrow money and incur contingent liabilities  make dividend or other restricted payments  use assets as security in other transactions  enter into transactions with affiliates  enter into new lines of business  issue and sell stock of restricted subsidiaries  sell assets or merge with or into other companies and make capital expenditures 
in addition  the senior credit facility requires the company to meet financial ratios and tests  including maximum leverage and interest coverage levels 
these restrictions could limit the company s ability to plan for or react to market conditions or meet extraordinary capital needs and could otherwise restrict corporate activities 
the company s ability to comply with the covenants and other terms of the senior credit facility and the indenture governing the senior notes and to satisfy these and other debt obligations will depend upon the company s current and future performance 
the company s performance is affected by general economic conditions and by financial  competitive  political  business and other factors  many of which are beyond the company s control 
the company believes that the cash generated from its business will be sufficient to enable the company to comply with the covenants and other terms of the senior credit facility and the indenture governing the senior notes and to make debt payments as they become due 
the company and its subsidiaries may incur additional indebtedness in the future 
as of december   the company had a million senior credit facility with a syndicate of banks 
under the senior credit facility  the company has a million revolving credit agreement  which permits certain additional borrowings 
in addition  the company has the option to borrow an additional million to million under the senior credit facility 
if new indebtedness is added to the company s current indebtedness levels  the risks described above could increase 
market risk fluctuations in interest and foreign currency exchange rates affect the company s financial position and results of operations 
the company has used several strategies to actively hedge interest rate and foreign currency exposure and minimize the effect of such fluctuations on reported earnings and cash flow see foreign currency translation and derivative financial instruments and hedging in the summary of significant accounting policies and notes and 
sensitivity of the company s financial instruments to selected changes in market rates and prices  which are reasonably possible over a one year period  are described below 
the market values for interest rate risk are calculated by the company utilizing a third party software model that employs standard pricing models to determine the present value of the instruments based on the market conditions as of the valuation date 
the company s derivative and other financial instruments subject to interest rate risk consist substantially of debt instruments and trust preferred securities 
at december  and  net market value of these combined instruments was a liability of billion and billion  respectively 
the sensitivity analysis assumes an instantaneous basis point move in interest rates from their levels  with all other variables held constant 
a basis point increase in interest rates at december  and would result in an and million decrease  respectively  in the net market value of the liability 
a basis point decrease in interest rates at december  and would result in a and million increase  respectively  in the net market value of the liability 
our financial instruments subject to foreign currency exchange risk consist of foreign currency forwards and options and represent a net asset position of million and million at december  and  respectively 
the following sensitivity analysis assumes an instantaneous change in foreign currency exchange rates from year end levels  with all other variables held constant 
a strengthening of the us dollar versus other currencies at december  and would result in a million decrease and a million increase  respectively  in the net asset position while a weakening of the dollar versus all currencies would result in a million increase and a million decrease  respectively  in the net asset position 
foreign exchange forward and option contracts have been used to hedge the company s firm and anticipated foreign currency cash flows 
thus  there is either an asset or cash flow exposure related to all the financial instruments in the above sensitivity analysis for which the impact of a movement in exchange rates would be in the opposite direction and substantially equal to the impact on the instruments in the analysis 
there are presently no significant restrictions on the remittance of funds generated by the company s operations outside the united states 
the company has not designated any derivative as a hedge instrument under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas and  accordingly  changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in earnings 
environmental in the ordinary course of its business  the company is subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations covering compliance matters or imposing liability for the costs of  and damages resulting from  cleaning up sites  past spills  disposals and other releases of hazardous substances 
changes in these laws and regulations may have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position and results of operations 
any failure by the company to adequately comply with such laws and regulations could subject the company to significant future liabilities 
environmental remediation expenses are funded from internal sources of cash 
such expenses are not expected to have a significant effect on the company s ongoing liquidity 
environmental cleanup costs  including capital expenditures for ongoing operations  are a normal  recurring part of operations and are not significant in relation to total operating costs or cash flows see item  legal proceedings and note 
litigation hercules is a defendant in numerous lawsuits that arise out of  and are incidental to  the conduct of its business 
these suits concern issues such as product liability  contract disputes  labor related matters  patent infringement  antitrust proceedings  environmental proceedings  property damage and personal injury matters 
while it is not feasible to predict the outcome of all pending suits and claims  the ultimate resolution of these matters could have a material effect upon the financial position of hercules  and the resolution of any of the matters during a specific period could have a material effect on the quarterly or annual operating results for that period see item  legal proceedings and note 
pension the assets and liabilities associated with the company s defined benefit plans are subject to interest rate and market risk 
a basis point decrease or increase in the discount rate has approximately a plus or minus million impact on the abo 
a basis point decrease or increase in the assumed rate of return has approximately a plus or minus million impact on the us pension and postretirement expense estimated for see note 
indemnifications in connection with the sale of certain company assets or businesses  the company has indemnified respective buyers against certain liabilities that may arise in connection with the sales transactions and business activities prior to the ultimate closing of the sale 
these indemnifications typically pertain to environmental  tax  employee and or product related matters 
if the indemnified party were to incur a liability or have a liability increase as a result of a successful claim  pursuant to the terms of the indemnification  the company would be required to reimburse the buyer 
these indemnifications are generally subject to threshold amounts  specified claim periods and other restrictions and limitations 
the carrying amount recorded for all indemnifications as of december  is million 
although it is possible that future payments may exceed amounts accrued  due to the nature of indemnified items  it is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential loss or range of loss 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the sec issued sab  revenue recognition  which supersedes sab  revenue recognition in financial statements  and updates portions of the interpretive guidance included in topic of the codification of staff accounting bulletins in order to make this interpretive guidance consistent with current authoritative accounting guidance 
the company had previously adopted the necessary changes incorporated into sab  which did not have a material effect on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in january  the fasb issued staff position fas  accounting and disclosure requirements related to the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of fsp 
fsp permits a sponsor of a postretirement health care plan that provides a prescription drug benefit to make a one time election to defer accounting for the effects of the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of the medicare act 
the medicare act  which was signed by the president on december   introduces a prescription drug benefit under medicare medicare part d as well as a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to medicare part d 
the company offers a drug benefit plan and has elected to defer current recognition of the effects of the act in the accounting for its plan pursuant to fsp until authoritative guidance on the accounting for the federal subsidy is issued 
as such  any measures of the accumulated projected benefit obligation or net periodic postretirement benefit cost in the financial statements or accompanying notes do not reflect the effects of the act on the plan  and as the specific authoritative guidance on the accounting for the federal subsidy is still pending  it is possible that when guidance is issued it could require the company to change previously reported information
