item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general photo control corporation is a manufacturer of professional photographic equipment and the bookendz docking stations 
there are three photographic product lines long roll film and digital cameras  electronic flash equipment and lens shades 
all three product lines are used primarily for high volume portrait  commercial and school photography 
the company continues to offer service parts and support on a fourth line of photographic package printers 
however  because this product is technologically obsolete  no new printers have been sold in the last four years 
the bookendz products are docking stations for the apple powerbook  ibook and ipod 
in recent years there has been a consolidation in the markets served by our photographic equipment  resulting in excess capacity and sales to fewer customers 
sales are highly concentrated to several high volume studio and school photographers 
for the years ended december   and  three customers comprised  and  respectively of the company s sales 
sales by other companies of consumer digital cameras and products have increased significantly over the last several years 
however  the professional photographic markets have experienced a slow gradual increase for digital products with the lower volume individual wedding and studio photographers purchasing high end professional cameras from such companies as kodak  fuji and nikon 
this trend has yet to emerge in the high volume professional photographers  which is the market the company primarily serves 
beginning in  sales of the company s new film cameras decreased significantly because professional photographers would either make new investments in digital products or buy used film equipment 
as a result  the company s camera sales have declined in recent years 
the company offers several digital camera products and in introduced three new camera products  a five mega pixel camera  a fourteen mega pixel camera and a fourteen mega pixel camera back  however  shipments of production units did not begin until management believes that newer digital products will offset the decline in sales of film cameras and increase sales in future years 
the company s electronic flash equipment is of high quality  premium priced  and targeted at high volume photographers 
lighting considerations are similar for both digital and film photography 
during the company began to distribute a low priced line of lights imported from china 
also  at the end of  a new high quality  lower priced monolight was brought to market 
during a new lower priced line of digital floor power supplies was introduced with shipments of production units beginning in the company expects its new products coupled with its older products will satisfy a broader spectrum of the lighting market 
the lens shade product line also includes light filters and brackets that are used to attach the special effect shades and filters to professional medium format cameras 
both the lens shade line and photographic printer service parts account for less than eight percent of sales in and the bookendz docking stations allow owners of apple powerbooks  ibooks and ipods to remove the device from the dock for travel and upon return  dock the device without having to make a connection for each individual peripheral device 
apple constantly changes the configuration of their equipment and the docks are frequently redesigned and retooled to accommodate theses changes 
the company has developed new digital products in an effort to offset the decline in sales of film based products 
however  it is unknown the effect to which this strategy will be successful 
in addition the company has attempted to diversify outside the photographic market by purchasing the bookendz docking product line in and the vaddio product line in january the vaddio product line is specialized cameras and controls used in the video conferencing and presentation markets 
the products are sold through a dealer network that resells and installs the equipment 
the end users are a variety of businesses and various organizations that wish to utilize video conferencing 
schools and churches are a significant share of the presentation market 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts 
the more significant estimates include reserves for obsolete inventory  reserves for warranty and the carrying value of intangible assets 
in assessing the ultimate realization of inventories  we are required to make judgments as to future demand requirements and compare them with the inventory levels 
reserve requirements increase as projected demand decreases due to market conditions  technological and product life cycle changes 
we have experienced significant changes in reserves in recent periods due to photography switching from film to digital capture and consolidation of our customers resulting in excess capacity and declining requirements for equipment 
such estimates are difficult to make under current volatile economic conditions and it is possible significant changes in required inventory reserves may continue to occur in the future 
warranty reserves are determined by applying historical claim rate experience to the current installed base of equipment 
historical claim rates are developed using four years of actual warranty expense to establish the reserve requirement for any given accounting period 
currently the only intangible asset is the patent for the bookendz docking station 
this asset is being amortized over the legal life of the patent  however  if significant changes would occur to the estimated future cash flow of the product sales under the patent right  an additional write down would be determined based on the reduction of such cash flows 
off balance sheet financing arrangements as of december  there are no off balance sheet arrangements  unconsolidated subsidiaries and commitments or guarantees of other parties
