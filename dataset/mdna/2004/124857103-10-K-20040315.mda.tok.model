critical accounting policies financial reporting release no 
 cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies frr  suggests companies provide additional disclosure and commentary on those accounting policies considered most critical 
frr considers an accounting policy to be critical if it is important to the company s financial condition and results of operations  and requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application 
for a summary of the company s significant accounting policies  including the critical accounting policies discussed below  see the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of the company s financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates its estimates  which are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the result of these evaluations forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amount of expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions 
the following accounting policies require significant management judgments and estimates 
accounting for the production and distribution of motion pictures and television programming is in accordance with sop  which requires management s judgment as it relates to total revenues to be received and costs to be incurred throughout the life of each program 
these estimates are used to determine the amortization of capitalized production costs  expensing of participation and residual cost and any necessary net realizable value adjustments 
the cost of blockbuster s rental library  which includes videocassettes  dvds and games  is amortized over periods ranging from to months to an estimated residual value of to per ii unit  according to the product category 
the estimates for useful lives and residual values of the rental library are continually evaluated based on changes in consumer demand 
changes in demand or buying patterns may impact the carrying value of the rental library and rental margins 
during  blockbuster changed the estimates regarding useful lives and residual values for videocassettes and game products  which resulted in inventory write downs and increased amortization expense 
the company accounts for its business acquisitions under the purchase method of accounting 
the total cost of acquisitions is allocated to the underlying net assets  based on their respective estimated fair values 
the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the tangible net assets acquired is recorded as intangibles 
determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management s judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions  including assumptions with respect to future cash inflows and outflows  discount rates  asset lives  and market multiples  among other items 
in accordance with sfas  the company tests goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment during the fourth quarter of each year  and on an interim date should factors or indicators become apparent that would require an interim test 
a significant downward revision in the present value of estimated future cash flows for a reporting unit could result in an impairment of goodwill under sfas and a non cash charge would be required 
balance sheet reserves and liabilities related to taxes  legal issues  restructuring charges and discontinued businesses  including asbestos and environmental matters  require significant judgments and estimates by management 
the company continually evaluates these estimates based on changes in the relevant facts and circumstances and events that may impact estimates 
while management believes that the current reserves for matters related to discontinued businesses  including environmental and asbestos are adequate  there can be no assurance that circumstances will not change in future periods 
pension benefit obligations and net periodic pension costs are calculated using many actuarial assumptions 
two key assumptions used in accounting for pension liabilities and expenses are the discount rate and expected rate of return on plan assets 
the discount rate reflects the rate at which the pension benefit obligations could effectively be settled 
the company used investment grade corporate bond yields to support its discount rate assumption 
the expected return on plan assets assumption was derived using the current and expected asset allocation of the pension plan assets and considering historical as well as expected returns on various classes of plan assets 
for  the unrecognized actuarial loss for pension plans decreased as a result of plan assets producing a return higher than the expected return due to the market conditions in partially offset by lowering the discount rate for the company s major plans from in to in as of december   the total accumulated benefit obligations exceeded the fair value of the corresponding plan assets and therefore  the company recorded a minimum pension liability of million 
as of december   such pension liability was million 
risk factors the risk factors listed below  in addition to those set forth elsewhere in this report  could affect the business and future results of the company 
past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods 
the company derives substantial revenues from the sale of advertising on its over the air networks  basic cable networks  television stations  radio stations and outdoor businesses 
the sale of advertising is affected by viewer demographics  viewer ratings and market conditions for advertising 
adverse changes to any of these factors  including as a result of acts of terrorism or war  could have a negative effect on revenues 
ii the company s basic cable networks and premium subscription television networks are dependent upon affiliation agreements with cable and direct to home satellite services dth distributors on acceptable terms 
the loss of carriage on such distributors  or continued carriage on less favorable terms  could adversely affect  with respect to basic cable networks  revenues from subscriber fees and the ability to sell advertising and  with respect to premium subscription television networks  subscriber fee revenues 
in addition  continued consolidation among cable and or dth distributors and vertical integration of such distributors into the cable or broadcast network business  could have an adverse effect on subscriber fees and advertising revenues  as the company s ability to launch new networks or maintain or obtain additional distribution for existing networks is impacted by these factors 
operating results derived from the company s motion picture and television production businesses fluctuate depending primarily upon cost of such productions and acceptance of such productions by the public  which are difficult to predict 
motion picture and television production has experienced cycles in which increased costs of talent  reduced availability of co financing opportunities  and other factors have resulted in higher production costs 
in addition  the commercial success of the company s motion picture and television productions depends upon the quality and acceptance of other competing productions  and the availability of alternative forms of entertainment and leisure time activities 
in accordance with sfas  the company tests goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment during the fourth quarter of each year  and on an interim date should factors or indicators become apparent that would require an interim test 
a significant downward revision in the present value of estimated future cash flows for a reporting unit could result in an impairment of goodwill under sfas and a non cash charge would be required 
such a charge could have a significant effect on the company s reported net earnings 
the board of directors of the company has authorized pursuing the divestiture of viacom s approximately interest in blockbuster  and the company  while continuing to consider other alternatives  anticipates that the divestiture would be achieved through a tax free split off 
the company may determine  for market or other reasons  not to effectuate the divestiture of blockbuster  or a split off of blockbuster  if it does occur  may be taxable 
in addition  should the company complete a divestiture of blockbuster  if the fair value of blockbuster at the date of divestiture were below book value  a loss would be recognized 
such a loss could have a significant effect on the company s reported net earnings 
while the company seeks to ensure compliance with fcc indecency laws and regulations  the definition of indecency is subject to interpretation and there can be no assurance that employees of the company will not make decisions resulting in the broadcast of programming that does not meet such standards 
such programming could subject the company to regulatory review or investigation  fines  adverse publicity or other sanctions including the loss of station licenses 
technology developments  including digital copying and file compression  and the growing penetration of high bandwidth internet connections  increase the threat of content piracy by making it easier to duplicate and widely distribute pirated material 
the company takes actions to vigorously enforce its rights and protect its copyrighted materials and products  however there can be no assurance that it will be successful in preventing the distribution of pirated content 
increased piracy of the company s copyrighted materials could negatively affect its operations and financial results 
advances in technologies such as personal video recorders and video on demand and changes in consumer behavior facilitated by these or other technologies could have an adverse effect on the company s businesses  particularly its television and video businesses 
ii the company has contingent liabilities related to discontinued businesses  including environmental liabilities  liabilities related to illnesses of former employees and other pending and threatened litigation 
while the pending or threatened litigations and environmental and other liabilities should not have a material adverse effect on the company  there can be no assurance in this regard 
the company s home video retail business currently enjoys a competitive advantage over most other movie distribution channels  except theatrical releases  due to the early timing of the video retailer distribution window 
the video business could be negatively affected if the video retail distribution windows were no longer the first following the theatrical release  the length of the video retail distribution window were shortened  or the video retail distribution windows were no longer as exclusive as they are now 
the company believes that the studios have a significant interest in maintaining a viable video retail industry  however  the order  length and exclusivity of each window for each distribution channel is determined solely by the studio releasing the movie and the company cannot predict the impact  if any  of any future decisions by the studios 
increased studio licensing of product to video on demand and similar services might impact their decisions with respect to the timing and exclusivity of the video retailer distribution window with possible adverse effect on the video business 
the company cannot control or predict with certainty studio pricing policies for dvd and vhs product 
current studio policies reducing the pricing of movies released to dvds and an increasing percentage of vhs titles allow for an affordable sales price by the retailer to the consumer from the beginning of the home video distribution window 
this lower sell through pricing has led to increased competition from other retailers  including mass merchants and online retailers who are able to purchase dvds for sale to consumers at the same time as traditional video retailers purchase both dvds and videocassettes for rental 
if sell through pricing  increased competition and consumer interest in building personal dvd libraries cause consumers to increasingly desire to purchase rather than rent movies  the video business could be negatively affected if it is unable to increase rental market share  to replace profits from rentals with profits from sales of sell through product  or to otherwise positively affect gross profits 
in addition  if studios make future changes in their pricing policies  which could include pricing rental windows for dvds or expanded exploitation by studios of any international copyright laws that allow studios to charge retailers more for dvd and vhs rental product than for sell through product  the profitability of the video business could be negatively affected if it is unable to enter into arrangements with the studios that effectively balance copy depth and cost considerations 
the company s operating results fluctuate due to the timing and availability of theatrical and home video releases  as well as the recording of license fees for television exhibition of motion pictures and for syndication and basic cable exhibition of television programming in the period that the products are available for such exhibition 
nai  through its ownership of the company s class a common stock  has voting control of the company 
sumner m 
redstone  the controlling shareholder of nai  is the chairman of the board and chief executive officer of the company 
nai is in a position to control the outcome of corporate actions that require shareholder approval  including the election of directors  issuance of securities and transactions involving a change of control 
during  the company entered into a new employment agreement with each of its chief executive officer and chief operating officer which addresses the specific responsibilities of each position 
there can be no assurance that either of these executives will remain with the company for the full term of his employment agreement 
a departure of either of these executives  or of other key executives of the company  could have an adverse effect on the company 
in the operation of its businesses  the company engages the services of writers  directors  actors and others  which are subject to collective bargaining agreements 
work stoppages and or higher costs in connection with these agreements could adversely impact the company s operations 
ii changes in laws and regulations  including in particular fcc ownership and indecency rules  could  directly or indirectly  adversely affect the operations and ownership of the company s properties 
some of the company s businesses are seasonal 
the home video rental and retail business and the consumer publishing business are subject to increased periods of demand coinciding with summer and winter holidays  while a substantial majority of the theme parks operating income is generated from may through september 
in addition  the home video and theme parks businesses revenues are influenced by weather 
the company s radio and outdoor advertising businesses experience fluctuations based on the timing of advertising expenditures by retailers 
these risk factors are not necessarily all of the important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed by the company 
other unknown or unpredictable economic  business  competitive  regulatory or other factors also could have material adverse effects on the company s future results
