item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis and the related financial data present a review of the consolidated financial condition and operating results of bankunited for the periods presented 
this discussion and analysis is presented to assist the reader in understanding and evaluating the financial condition  results of operations and future prospects of bankunited  and is intended to supplement  and should be read in conjunction with  the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
overview bankunited s results of operations are dependent primarily on its net interest income  which is the difference between the interest earned on its assets  primarily its loan and securities portfolios  and its cost of funds  which consists of the interest paid on its deposits and borrowings 
bankunited s results of operations are also affected by its provision for loan losses as well as non interest income  non interest expenses and income tax expense 
non interest expenses consist of employee compensation and benefits  occupancy and equipment  insurance  professional fees  telecommunications and data processing  loan servicing expense  and other operating expenses 
results of operations are also dependent on the dollar volume and asset quality of bankunited s loans and investments 
in addition to the foregoing  results of bankunited s operations  like those of other financial institution holding companies  are affected by bankunited s asset and liability management policies  as well as factors beyond bankunited s control  such as general economic conditions and the monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government 
lending activities are affected by the demand for mortgage financing and other types of loans  and are thus influenced by interest rates and other factors affecting the supply of housing and the availability of funds 
deposit flows and costs of funds are influenced by yields available on competing investments and by general market rates of interest 
in evaluating bankunited s financial condition and operating performance  management focuses on increasing loan originations to residential mortgage  commercial and commercial real estate customers  increasing total and core deposit balances  improving bankunited s net interest margin  maintaining higher credit standards  low levels of non performing assets and adequate loan loss reserves  managing interest rate risk  controlling expenses  and ensuring adequate funding for ongoing growth 
based on these factors  highlights of bankunited s performance for fiscal include loan production for improved by compared to  to reach billion total loans  net increased to billion  up over last year 
non performing assets as a percentage of total assets of  down from at september th last year 
core deposits increased in by to billion non interest bearing deposits increased by to million as of september  million raised in successful private offering of convertible senior notes at a rate of market capitalization increased by to million as of september critical accounting policies bankunited s financial position and results of operations are impacted by management s application of accounting policies involving judgments made to arrive at the carrying value of certain assets 
in implementing its policies  management must make estimates and assumptions about the effect of matters that are inherently less than certain 
actual results could differ significantly from these estimates which could materially affect the reported amounts of our assets  liabilities  income and expenses 
for a detailed discussion of bankunited s significant 
table of contents accounting policies  see note summary of significant accounting policies to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the most critical accounting policies applied by bankunited are those that relate to the allowance for loan losses  and the valuation of mortgage servicing rights 
estimates of the amount of the allowance for portfolio loan losses  and the valuation of loans held for sale both affect the carrying amount of the loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses is a subjective judgment that management must make regarding the loan portfolio  and is established and maintained at levels that management believes are adequate to cover losses resulting from the inability of borrowers to make required payments on loans 
estimates for loan losses are made by analyzing historical loan losses  current trends in delinquencies and charge offs  plans for problem loan administration and resolution  the views of regulators  changes in the size and composition of the loan portfolio  and peer group information 
in addition  the economic climate and direction  increases or decreases in overall lending rates  political conditions  legislation directly or indirectly impacting the banking industry  and economic conditions affecting specific geographical areas in which bankunited conducts business are all considered 
where there is a question as to the impairment of a specific loan  management obtains valuations of the property or collateral securing the loan  and current financial information of the borrower  including financial statements  when available 
since the calculation of appropriate loan loss allowances relies on management s estimates and judgments relating to inherently uncertain events  actual results may differ from these estimates 
for a more detailed discussion on the allowance for loan losses  see asset quality and  e allowance for loan losses in note summary of significant accounting policies to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
several estimates impact mortgage servicing rights  including the amount of gains or losses recognized upon the securitization and sale of residential mortgage loans  the amortization of the assets  and the periodic valuation of the assets 
the initial and ongoing valuation and amortization of mortgage servicing rights is significantly impacted by interest rates  prepayment experience and the credit performance of the underlying loans 
in general  in periods of declining interest rates  the value of these assets declines due to prepayments on loans serviced

liquidity and capital resources liquidity management is the process of allocating assets and structuring liabilities to provide sufficient cash or cash equivalents to meet an entity s daily operating needs on an ongoing basis 
it is the policy of bankunited to manage our funds so that there is no need to make unplanned sales of assets or to borrow funds under emergency conditions 
sources of liquidity include cash and cash equivalents  deposit growth  fhlb advances  federal reserve borrowings  loan repayments  investment portfolio run off  liquidation of investments and mortgage backed securities  and overnight and term repurchase agreements 
bankunited s objective in managing liquidity is to maintain sufficient resources of available cash to address both short and long term business funding needs such as loan demand  investment purchases  deposit fluctuations  and debt service requirements 
in doing so  bankunited maintains an overall liquidity position that has an aggregate amount of readily accessible and marketable assets  cash flow and borrowing capacity to meet unexpected deposit outflows and or increases in loan demand 
cash levels are minimized to levels required by regulation and necessary to meet the projected anticipated needs for business operations 
bankunited is not aware of any events  or uncertainties  which may impede liquidity in the short or long term 
bankunited utilizes deposits originated through its network of retail branches as a source of funds 
core deposits represent approximately of total deposits as of september  compared to at september  for information on deposits  see note deposits to the notes to consolidated financial statement 

table of contents borrowings a substantial portion of balance sheet growth has been funded by borrowings 
bankunited utilizes both short and long term borrowings 
short term borrowings are due within one year  long term borrowings are due in one year or more 
the bank may borrow funds from the fhlb of atlanta and from other sources 
the fhlb system acts as a source of funding for member financial institutions 
in addition  bankunited uses subordinated notes  securities sold under agreements to repurchase and trust preferred securities in order to increase available funds 
as a shareholder of the fhlb of atlanta  the bank must hold shares of stock in the fhlb  which totaled million at september  the fhlb of atlanta offers a wide variety of borrowing plans  each with its own maturity and interest rate 
fhlb borrowings  known as advances  are secured by a member s share of stock in the fhlb and by certain types of mortgages and other eligible collateral 
the terms and rates charged for fhlb advances vary in response to general economic conditions 
a portion of the bank s advances have been obtained through a convertible advances program that permits the fhlb to call an advance at its discretion on a specified call date which generally occurs every three months following an initial period ranging from three months to four years 
should the fhlb elect to exercise this option  the bank can either convert the advance from a fixed rate basis to floating rate basis or repay it in full 
the bank also has advances under the fhlb knockout advance program 
in general  a knockout advance is structured as a fixed rate advance that the fhlb may call at the end of any given three month period after the non conversion period which expires  if the month libor rate equals or exceeds an agreed upon threshold rate 
should a particular advance be called by the fhlb  the bank can either convert the advance from a fixed rate basis to a floating rate basis or pay it in full 
see item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the fhlb of atlanta will consider various factors  including an institution s regulatory capital position  net income  quality and composition of assets  lending policies and practices  and level of current borrowings from all sources  in determining the amount of credit to extend to an institution 
as of september   bankunited had billion of fhlb advances outstanding  including approximately million maturing within days 
approximately million of the advances outstanding as of september  were convertible with a weighted average coupon rate approaching which  due to their structure  are expected to remain outstanding for another four to five years 
as of september   bankunited had approximately million of additional borrowings available on its line of credit with the fhlb of atlanta 
bankunited may seek increases in available credit lines with the fhlb based on additional available collateral 
in addition  an institution that fails to meet the qualified thrift lender test may have restrictions imposed on its ability to obtain fhlb advances 
the bank currently meets the qualified thrift lender test 
securities sold under agreements to repurchase is another source of borrowed funds which is available to bankunited 
under this type of borrowing  securities are pledged against borrowed funds and are released when the funds are repaid 
bankunited typically uses this type of borrowing alternative on a short term basis  but may also use these instruments on a long term basis 
as of september   bankunited had billion in investments and mortgage backed securities pledged against securities sold under agreements to repurchase with an outstanding balance of billion  of which  approximately million mature overnight 
in february and march of  bankunited issued million of senior convertible notes that mature in march and bear interest at an annual rate of payable semiannually 
upon conversion of the notes bankunited may  at its discretion  in lieu of delivering shares of class a common stock  deliver cash or a combination of cash and shares of class a common stock 
the notes will mature on march  bankunited may redeem for cash some or all of the notes at any time on or after march  at of the principal amount of the notes plus any accrued and unpaid interest  contingent interest and additional amounts  if any 
holders may require bankunited to purchase all or part of the notes for cash at a purchase price of of the 
table of contents principal amount of the notes plus accrued and unpaid interest including contingent interest and additional amounts  if any  on march   march   march   march  and march  or upon the occurrence of a fundamental change 
the notes are senior unsecured obligations  ranking equally in right of payment with all of bankunited s existing and future unsecured senior indebtedness 
the notes are effectively subordinated to bankunited s entire senior secured indebtedness and all indebtedness and liabilities of its subsidiaries 
the bank used the net proceeds from the issuance of the notes for general corporate purposes  loan financing  and assisting in the bank s asset liability management 
see note borrowings to notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion on senior convertible notes 
bankunited has issued trust preferred securities through its trust subsidiaries  which in turn have invested the proceeds from the sale thereof in junior subordinated deferrable debentures issued by bankunited the junior subordinated debentures 
in the past four fiscal years  all of the trust preferred securities issued by bankunited s trust subsidiaries have been sold through participation in pools  whereby a number of financial institutions issue trust preferred securities through their trust subsidiaries  and sell such securities to investors in private placement transactions 
in november  the board of directors of bankunited authorized the purchase from time to time in the open market  or otherwise  of up to  shares of trust preferred securities issued by bankunited s trust subsidiaries 
as of september   bankunited had purchased a total of  shares of trust preferred securities issued by its trust subsidiaries on the open market at a cost of million 
proceeds from the sale of junior subordinated debentures  if contributed to the bank as additional paid in capital  increase tier equity capital for regulatory purposes 
bankunited uses derivative instruments as part of its interest rate risk management activities to reduce risks associated with its borrowing activities 
derivatives used to hedge interest rate risk associated with long term fixed and variable rate debt include interest rate swaps and caps 
see item a

table of contents interest income 
interest income increased by million for the year ended september   compared to the same period in this net increase is the result of increases of million due to changes in volume of interest earning assets  offset by decreases of million due to changes in yield on those assets 
the volume related changes in interest income stem primarily from the increase in average loans  mortgage backed securities  and investment securities and fhlb stock  which increased interest income by million  million  and million  respectively  for the year ended september  compared to the yield related changes in interest income stem mostly from the decrease in yield on loans of basis points from for the year ended september  to for the same period in this drop in yield on loans reduced interest income by million for the year ended september  compared to the prior year 
although bankunited benefited from a decrease in prepayments during fiscal compared to  these benefits were offset by higher amounts of unamortized premiums and deferred fees associated with these prepayments 
yields also dropped on mortgage backed securities  and fhlb stock reducing interest income by million and million  respectively  for the year ended september  compared to the prior year 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased by million for the year ended september   compared to the prior year 
this net decrease is the result of increases of million due to changes in volume  offset by decreases of million due to an overall reduction in rates 
the majority of the volume related changes stem from the increase in average fhlb advances and repurchase agreements  which increased interest expense by million 
interest expense was increased to lesser extent by million  and million respectively  from increases in volume of savings accounts  and certificates of deposit during fiscal interest income was reduced during fiscal by million and million  respectively  from lower volumes of trust preferred securities and subordinated debentures  and medium term notes 
the rate related changes stem from the decrease in rates paid in the aggregate on all liabilities  from for the year ended september  to for the most significant improvement came from a drop in rates paid on fhlb advances and other borrowings  which changed from for the year ended september  to for despite the higher rate convertible advances of million  with a weighted average coupon rate approaching  which  due to their structure are expected to remain outstanding for another four to five years 
this improvement of basis points reduced the cost of funds by million 
the drop in rates paid on certificates of deposits of basis points from for the year ended september  to for reduced the cost of funds by million 
additional reductions in the cost of funds came from the drop in rates paid on savings accounts  trust preferred securities  and transaction and money market accounts  of basis points  basis points  and basis points  respectively during year ended september  compared to the drop in rates paid on these interest bearing liabilities reduced the cost of funds by million in the aggregate for the year ended september  compared to provision for loan losses bankunited records provisions for loan losses as a charge to income in amounts necessary to adjust the allowance for loan losses as determined by management through its review of asset quality

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate sensitivity as a financial intermediary bankunited invests in various types of interest earning assets primarily loans  mortgage backed securities  and investment securities which are funded largely by interest bearing liabilities primarily deposits  fhlb advances  repurchase agreements  senior notes  and trust preferred securities and subordinated debentures 
none of these financial instruments are entered into for trading purposes 
such financial instruments have varying levels of sensitivity to changes in market interest rates that creates interest rate risk for the bank 
accordingly  bankunited s net interest income  the most significant component of its net income  is impacted by changes in market interest rates and yield curves  particularly if there are differences  or gaps  in the repricing frequencies of its interest earning assets and the interest bearing liabilities which fund them 
bankunited monitors such interest rate gaps and seeks to manage its interest rate risk by 
table of contents adjusting the repricing frequencies of its interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
in addition to reviewing reports which summarize bankunited s various interest sensitivity gaps  management utilizes a simulation model which measures the financial impact certain interest rate scenarios are likely to have on the bank 
as discussed more fully below  a variety of factors influence the repricing characteristics and the market values of bankunited s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  but many of these factors are difficult to quantify 
additionally  bankunited utilizes derivative financial instruments designed to reduce the interest rate risk associated with its interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
the matching of the repricing characteristics of assets and liabilities may be analyzed by examining the extent to which such assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive and by monitoring an institution s interest rate sensitivity gap 
an asset or liability is said to be interest rate sensitive within a specific time period if it will contractually mature or reprice  or if by management assumption  it is likely to be impacted by prepayments  run off  early withdrawal  or other such forces which can impact the timing and amount of a given financial instrument s cash flows 
an interest rate sensitivity gap is the difference between the amount of interest earning assets anticipated to mature or reprice within a specific time period and the amount of interest bearing liabilities anticipated to mature or reprice within that same period 
a gap is considered to be positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets maturing or repricing within a specific time frame exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities maturing or repricing within that same time frame 
conversely  a gap is considered to be negative when  within a given period of time  the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive assets 
during a period where the general level of interest rates is rising  a bank with a negative gap over that period is likely to experience a decline in net interest income  while a bank with a positive gap will typically experience an increase in net interest income 
during  bankunited has shifted its lending activities towards adjustable rate mortgages  which primarily reprice monthly 
bankunited has funded this growth with liabilities that primarily reprice within six months or less 
significant assumptions utilized in managing interest rate risk assessing and managing bankunited s exposure to interest rate risk involves significant assumptions concerning the exercise of options which are considered to be embedded in many of the financial instruments on bankunited s balance sheet  the expected movement and relationship of various interest rate indices  the impact of lag and cap risk  and the general availability of mortgages 
embedded options 
as of september   a substantial portion of bankunited s loans and mortgage backed securities consist of mortgage loans that contain an embedded option allowing borrowers to repay all  or a portion of  their loan prior to maturity  frequently without penalty 
the existence of this embedded prepayment option can adversely impact bankunited s financial performance 
in general  fixed rate securities tend to exhibit an increase in market value when the level of interest rates falls  and they tend to exhibit a decrease in market value when the level of interest rates rises 
mortgage loans having embedded prepayment options  and the securities which contain them  tend to decrease in market value as interest rates rise 
however increases in market value due to a decrease in interest rates are typically suppressed since in a lower rate environment borrowers are more likely to prepay  or refinance  their mortgage loans 
consequently  the adverse impact an investment in mortgage loans or mortgage securities may have on bankunited s market value of equity  should interest rates rise  may exceed the beneficial impact should interest rates fall by a like amount 
additionally  in an increasing interest rate environment bankunited s funding costs may be expected to increase more quickly than would bankunited s earnings from its mortgage loan assets 
this could result in a deterioration in bankunited s net interest margin 
however  due to the asymmetry discussed previously  improvement in bankunited s net interest margin due to a general decrease in interest rates may be less than the deterioration in bankunited s net interest margin given a similar increase in the general level of interest rates 
a borrower s propensity for prepayment is dependent upon a number of factors  some of which are the loan s current interest rate versus the rate at which the borrower would be able to refinance  the economic benefit expected to be obtained from refinancing  the borrower s financial ability to refinance  the availability of mortgage loans in general  and numerous other economic and non economic factors  some of which may vary by geographic region 

table of contents savings and checking deposits generally may be withdrawn upon customer request without prior notice 
however  on an overall basis  one customer s withdrawal is likely to be offset by another customer s deposit resulting in a dependable source of funds 
time deposits are generally subject to early withdrawal penalties  which results in the large majority of these deposits being maintained until maturity 
similarly  term fhlb advances have prepayment penalties  which discourage early repayment by the bank 
bankunited s trust preferred securities may be redeemed at par plus accrued interest receivable after five years from the issuance date  except for securities issued by bankunited capital  which have a ten year call provision 
see note borrowings to the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the trust preferred securities 
bankunited borrows from the fhlb in the form of advances to fund operations 
these advances have a variety of terms  rates and repayment provisions 
a significant portion of the bank s advances have been obtained through a convertible advances program that permits the fhlb to call an advance at its discretion on a specified call date which generally occurs every three months following an initial period ranging from three months to four years 
should the fhlb elect to exercise this option  the bank can either convert the advance from a fixed rate basis to a floating rate basis or repay it in full 
should the fhlb elect to exercise this option  bankunited s cost of funds may be affected adversely 
approximately million of the advances outstanding as of september  were convertible with a weighted average coupon rate approaching which  due to their structure  are expected to remain outstanding for another four to five years 
the bank also has advances under the fhlb knockout advance program 
in general  a knockout advance is structured as a fixed rate advance that the fhlb may call at the end of any given three month period after the non conversion period which expires  if the month libor rate equals or exceeds an agreed upon threshold rate 
should a particular advance be called by the fhlb  the bank can either convert the advance from a fixed rate basis to a floating rate basis or pay it in full 
included in the million of convertible advances above  are a total of million in knockout advances borrowed during fiscal  each with a year term and a one year non callable period 
the initial rates on these advances range from to while the threshold rates range from to 
bankunited chose to borrow under the knockout advance program during fiscal because  as long as these advances remain unconverted by the fhlb  the stability of bankunited s net interest margin would be enhanced 
however  if the month libor rate were to rise to these threshold rates so as to allow the fhlb to call one or more of bankunited s knockout advances  the funding cost associated with the advance would become higher and more volatile  negatively impacting bankunited s net interest margin 
these same knockout advances were outstanding at september  as a result of the overall declining interest rate environment since  the fixed rate cost of those knockout advances has negatively affected the cost of our borrowings and the resulting net interest margin 
interest rate indices 
bankunited s arm loans and mortgage backed securities are primarily indexed to the one year constant maturity treasury cmt or monthly treasury average mta indices 
bankunited s commercial and consumer loans may be indexed to prime or libor 
to the extent such loans and mortgage backed securities are funded by deposits  fhlb advances  and other interest bearing liabilities whose interest costs are influenced by indices not highly correlated with the above indices  an environment of changing interest rates may impact the various indices differently which may lead to significant changes in the value of  and the net earnings generated from  bankunited s financial instruments 
historical relationships between various indices may not necessarily be indicative of future relationships 
lag risk 
lag risk results from timing differences between repricing of adjustable rate assets and liabilities 
the effect of this timing difference  or lag  would be favorable in a falling interest rate environment and negative during periods of rising interest rates 
this lag risk can produce short term volatility in the net interest margin during periods of interest rate movements even though over time the lag effect will balance out 

table of contents as an illustration we have loans indexed to the mta 
the mta index is the twelve month average of the monthly treasury constant maturity rates as published in the federal reserve statistical release 
in periods of rapidly moving interest rates loans tied to this index will not reprice to the current level of rates for months while liabilities generally reprice to current market interest rates immediately 
cap risk 
in times of sharply rising interest rates  caps may serve to limit the increase in interest income generated from certain interest earning assets 
conversely  in an environment of sharply falling interest rates  they may reduce the decline in bankunited s interest income 
over periods of time where the general level of interest rates has had time to fluctuate  the alternating positive and negative effects generated by such interest rate caps will be largely offsetting 
over shorter periods  however  and to the extent any caps are actually limiting the interest rate adjustment of any assets  they can increase the volatility of bankunited s net interest income  and to a lesser extent  its market value of equity 
bankunited has mitigated its cap risk by originating loans that do not have periodic caps and certain hybrid arm loans that will adjust from up to basis points at the first adjustment period 
this first adjustment period can range from years to years 
bankunited anticipates the majority of these hybrid arm loans will prepay prior to the first adjustment 
availability of mortgage loans 
the availability of mortgage loans meeting bankunited s criteria is dependent upon  among other things  the size and level of activity in the residential real estate lending market  which in turn depends on other factors including the level of interest rates  regional and national economic conditions and changes in residential real estate values 
to the extent that bankunited is unable to originate or acquire a sufficient volume of mortgage loans meeting its criteria  bankunited s operating results could be adversely affected 
in originating or acquiring mortgage loans  bankunited competes with reits  investment banking firms  savings and loan associations  banks  mortgage bankers  insurance companies  mutual funds  competing lenders  fnma  fhlmc  gnma  and other entities which purchase mortgage loans  some of which have greater financial resources than bankunited 
increased competition for the origination or acquisition of eligible mortgage loans or a diminution in the supply could result in bankunited having to incur higher costs and accept lower yields 
this  in turn  would reduce the amount by which bankunited s yield on earning assets would exceeds its cost of funding those assets 
the following table sets forth the re pricing gap between interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities expected to mature or re price within the same period of time 
this gap analysis is a static view as of september  the analysis reflects assumptions made as to the prepayment of residential mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities 
assumptions are also made as to the re pricing period of deposits that have no stated maturity and are not contractually subject to re pricing except as determined by bankunited 
other interest bearing assets and liabilities have been scheduled to re price based on the earlier contractual re pricing or final maturity date of the contract 
assumptions as to the prepayment of mortgage backed securities and residential mortgage loans are based upon expected prepayment speeds and an analysis of current market conditions 
money market  savings and transaction accounts are assumed to re price based upon deposit decay estimates determined by bankunited 
pricing of these deposits is determined by bankunited based upon market conditions and other factors 
the conditions and assumptions utilized in this analysis may not be appropriate at another point in time 
consequently  the interpretation of this information is highly subjective

table of contents in addition to preparing and reviewing periodic gap reports which help identify repricing mismatches  bankunited uses simulation models which estimate the impact on net interest income of various interest rate scenarios  balance sheet trends and strategies 
these simulations incorporate assumptions about balance sheet dynamics  such as loan and deposit growth and pricing  changes in funding mix and asset and liability repricing and maturity characteristics based on bankunited s expectations for the next months 
simulations are run under various interest rate scenarios to determine the impact on net income and capital 
from these scenarios  interest rate risk is quantified and appropriate strategies are developed and implemented 
the overall interest rate risk position and strategies are reviewed on an ongoing basis by senior management 
based on the information and assumptions in effect on september   management estimates the impact  on net interest income  of a gradual and parallel basis point rise or fall in interest rates over the next months to be an increase of or a decrease of  respectively 
bankunited recognizes that there are numerous assumptions and estimates associated with the simulations described above which may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates 
in this regard  the simulation model assumes that the composition of bankunited s interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains relatively constant over the period being measured and also assumes that the change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration to maturity or repricing of specific assets and liabilities 
in addition  prepayment estimates and other assumptions within the model are highly subjective in nature  involve uncertainties and  therefore  cannot be determined with precision 
accordingly  although the simulation model may provide an indication of bankunited s interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time  such measurements are not intended to provide for a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on bankunited s net interest income and may often differ from actual results 
bankunited s operations are affected by many factors beyond its control such as the overall condition of the economy  monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government  and regulations specific to the banking industry 
revenues generated from lending activities are impacted by loan demand  which in turn impacts the interest rates at which such loans may be made  the supply of housing  the availability of funds to lend  and the cost of obtaining such funds 
derivative and hedging activities 
bankunited uses derivative instruments as part of its interest rate risk management activities to reduce risks associated with its borrowing activities 
derivatives used for interest rate risk management include various interest rate swaps and caps that relate to the pricing of specific on balance sheet instruments and forecasted transactions 
in connection with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas  we recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the consolidated statement of financial condition and report them at fair value with realized and unrealized gains and losses included in either earnings or in other comprehensive income  depending on the purpose for which the derivative is held and whether the derivative qualifies for hedge accounting 
bankunited has interest rate swap agreements that qualify as fair value hedges and those that qualify as cash flow hedges 
fair value hedges are used to hedge fixed rate debt 
bankunited uses cash flow hedges to hedge interest rate risk associated with variable rate debt 
in connection with its interest rate management activities  bankunited may use other derivatives as economic hedges of on balance sheet assets and liabilities or forecasted transactions which do not qualify for hedge accounting under sfas accordingly  these derivatives are reported at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet with realized gains and losses included in earnings 
by using derivative instruments  bankunited is exposed to credit and market risk 
credit risk  which is the risk that a counterparty to a derivative instrument will fail to perform  is equal to the extent of the fair value gain in a derivative 
credit risk is created when the fair value of a derivative contract is positive  since this generally 
table of contents indicates that the counterparty owes us 
when the fair value of a derivative is negative  no credit risk exists since bankunited would owe the counterparty 
bankunited minimizes the credit risk in derivative instruments by entering into transactions with high quality counterparties as evaluated by management 
market risk is the adverse effect on the value of a financial instrument from a change in interest rates or implied volatility of rates 
we manage the market risk associated with interest rate contracts by establishing and monitoring limits as to the types and degree of risk that may be undertaken 
the market risk associated with derivatives used for interest rate risk management activity is fully incorporated into our market risk sensitivity analysis
