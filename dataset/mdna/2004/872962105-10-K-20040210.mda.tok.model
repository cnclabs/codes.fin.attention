item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with selected financial data and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
executive summary we generate our revenues from our homebuilding operations homebuilding and financial services operations financial services 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information  we have determined that homebuilding and financial services comprise our operating segments 
through our homebuilding operations we design  build and market high quality detached single family residences  town homes and condominiums in metropolitan markets located in four major geographic regions florida  the mid atlantic  texas and the west 
at december   we were actively selling homes in communities  by comparison at december   we were actively selling homes in communities  and at december   we were actively selling homes in communities 
our homebuilding operations generate the majority of their revenue from the sale of homes to homebuyers and to a lesser degree from the sale of land and homesites to other homebuilders 
our homes are designed to appeal to a diverse group of homebuyers  such as first time homebuyers  move up homebuyers  homebuyers who are relocating to a new city or state  buyers of second or vacation homes  active adult homebuyers  and homebuyers with grown children who want a smaller home empty nesters 
our homes are generally sold in advance of their construction 
once a sales contract has been signed  we classify the transaction as a new sales contract and include the home in backlog 
such sales contracts are usually subject to certain contingencies such as the buyer s ability to qualify for financing 
revenue from the sale of homes and the sale of land is recognized at closing when title passes to the buyer 
at this point a home is considered to be delivered and is removed from backlog 
the principal expenses of our homebuilding operations are i cost of sales and ii selling  general and administrative sg a expenses 
homebuilding cost of sales consists primarily of the cost of home construction  the acquisition cost of land and the cost of land development 
sg a expenses for our homebuilding operations include administrative costs  advertising expenses  on site marketing expenses  commission costs  and closing costs 
as part of our objective to provide homebuyers a seamless home purchasing experience  we have developed  and are expanding  our complementary financial services business 
as part of this business  we provide mortgage financing and closing services and offer title  homeowners and other insurance products 
our mortgage financing operation derives most of its revenues from buyers of our homes  although it also offers its services to existing homeowners refinancing their mortgages 
by comparison  our closing services and our insurance agency operations are used by our homebuyers as well as a broad range of other clients purchasing or refinancing residential or commercial real estate 
our mortgage financing operations revenues consist primarily of origination and premium fee income  interest income  and the gain on the sale of the mortgages 
our title operations revenues consist primarily of title insurance and closing services 
all of our underwriting risk associated with title and homeowners insurance policies is transferred to third party insurers 
the principal expenses of our financial services operations are sg a expenses  which consist primarily of compensation and interest expense on our warehouse line of credit 
was a transition year for us 
upon consummation of our merger in june  we began the process of identifying the steps to become an efficient  large scale homebuilder 
during we executed on many of the steps identified to achieve this objective 
we began with active communities and  homes in backlog  representing revenues of million 
at the close of  we had active communities and  homes in backlog  representing million in revenues 
the majority of this increase can be attributed to our florida and west regions where we have made a significant investment in building our homesite supply and opening up new communities 
our texas region continues to be impacted by the slower demand for new housing 
however  we have seen this offset by increased activity in several other markets 
as we add new communities  we are actively seeking to expand our market share by increasing the number of homes we deliver with lower average sales prices 
as part of this strategy  we have completed acquisitions of homebuilders in the florida  mid atlantic and west regions that specialize in homes with an average sales price lower than our current average 
in addition  we have sought to organically expand this product diversification 
consequently  our average home sales price decreased during during we also spent significant time and costs restructuring the way we operate 
we began with our homebuilding operations relying on multiple information systems 
we have converted all our homebuilding divisions to one information system 
we have also invested in building a corporate center to efficiently manage our critical business functions  such as operations  finance  legal and corporate governance 
we believe that these steps were essential to support our anticipated growth and to allow us to operate efficiently 
we expect the first half of to continue to be impacted by costs associated with building our foundation for growth and our considerable ramp up of new communities 
as a result  we expect the second half of to reflect the financial results of the significant investments we have made in our business 
critical accounting policies in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements  we apply accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the application of generally accepted accounting principles may require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying results 
listed below are those policies that we believe are critical and require the use of complex judgment in their application 
homebuilding revenues and cost of sales revenue from the sale of homes and the sale of land and homesites is recognized at closing when title passes to the buyer and all of the following conditions are met a sale is consummated  a significant down payment is received  the earnings process is complete  and the collection of any remaining receivables is reasonably assured 
as a result  our revenue recognition process does not involve significant judgments or estimates 
however  we do rely on certain estimates to determine the related construction and land costs and resulting gross profit associated with revenues recognized 
our construction and land costs are comprised of direct and allocated costs  including interest  indirect construction costs and estimated costs for future warranties and indemnities 
our estimates are based on historical results  adjusted for current factors 
land  land improvements and other common costs are generally allocated on a relative fair value basis to units within a parcel or community 
land and land development costs generally include related interest and property taxes incurred until construction is substantially completed 
financial services revenues and expenses our financial services operations generate their revenues from their mortgage financing and title operations 
our mortgage financing operations revenues consist primarily of origination and premium fee income  interest income and the gain on the sale of the mortgages 
revenue from our mortgage financing operations is generally recognized when the mortgage loans and related servicing rights are sold to third party investors 
substantially all of our mortgages are sold to private investors within days of closing 
title operations revenues consist primarily of title insurance agency and closing services  which are recognized as homes are closed 
as a result  our revenue recognition process does not involve significant judgments or estimates 
impairment of long lived assets housing projects and land homesites under development are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value 
property and equipment is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation 
we assess these assets for impairment in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
requires that long lived assets be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
these evaluations for impairment are significantly impacted by estimates of future revenues  costs and expenses and other factors involving some amount of uncertainty 
if an asset is considered to be impaired  the impairment loss to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
goodwill effective january   we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
upon the adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill is no longer subject to amortization 
goodwill is subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment by applying a fair value based test 
if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value  goodwill is considered to be impaired 
we continually evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the remaining balance of goodwill may not be recoverable 
in evaluating impairment  we estimate the sum of the expected discounted future cash flows derived from such goodwill 
such evaluations for impairment are significantly impacted by estimates of future revenues  costs and expenses and other factors involving some amount of uncertainty 
if the goodwill is considered to be impaired  the impairment loss to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeds the fair value of the expected future cash flows 
homesite option contracts and consolidation of variable interest entities we enter into option contracts with land sellers and third party financial entities as a method of acquiring developed homesites 
from time to time to leverage our ability to acquire and finance the development of these homesites  we transfer our option right to third parties 
option contracts generally require the payment of a non refundable cash deposit or the issuance of a letter of credit for the right to acquire homesites over a specified period of time at predetermined prices 
typically  our deposits or letters of credit are less than of the underlying purchase price 
we generally have the right at our discretion to terminate our obligations under these option agreements by forfeiting our cash deposit or repaying amounts drawn under the letter of credit with no further financial responsibility 
we do not have legal title to these assets 
additionally  we do not have an investment in the third party acquirer and do not guarantee their liabilities 
however  if certain conditions are met  including the deposit and or letters of credit exceeding certain significance levels as compared to the remaining homesites under the option contract  we will include the homesites in inventory with a corresponding liability in consolidated land bank obligations 
at december   we owned approximately  homesites  or of our homesite supply  and had option contracts on  homesites  or of our homesite supply 
in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities 
interpretation no 
is applied immediately to variable interest entities vies created after january  interpretation no 
addresses consolidation by business enterprises of vies which have one or both of the following characteristics the equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated support from other parties  which is provided through other interests that will absorb some or all of the expected losses of the entity  or the equity investors lack one or more of the following essential characteristics of a controlling financial interest a the direct or indirect ability to make decisions about the entity s activities through voting rights or similar rights  or b the obligation to absorb the expected losses of the entity if they occur  which makes it possible for the entity to finance its activities  or c the right to receive the expected residual returns of the entity if they occur  which is the compensation for the risk of absorbing the expected losses 
generally  in the homebuilding industry  homebuilders will enter into option contracts for the purchase of land or homesites with entities that may qualify as vies 
we believe that interpretation no 
will have to be evaluated as it relates to these and similar types of arrangements 
in applying interpretation no 
to our homesite option contracts  estimates regarding cash flows and other assumptions have to be made 
we believe that our critical assumptions are reasonable based on historical evidence and industry practice 
based on our analysis of contracts entered into after january   we determined that we are the primary beneficiary of certain of these homesite option contracts 
consequently  interpretation no 
requires us to consolidate the assets homesites at their fair value  although we have no legal title to the assets  our maximum exposure to loss is limited to the deposits or letters of credits placed with these entities  and creditors  if any  of these entities have no recourse against us 
the effect of the consolidation was to increase inventory by million  excluding deposits of million which had been previously recorded  with a corresponding increase to consolidated land bank obligations in the accompanying consolidated statement of financial condition as of december  warranty reserves in the normal course of business we will incur warranty related costs associated with homes which have been delivered to the homebuyers 
warranty reserves are established by charging cost of sales and recognizing a liability for the estimated warranty costs for each home that is delivered 
we monitor this reserve on a monthly basis by evaluating the historical warranty experience in each market in which we operate and the reserve is adjusted as appropriate for current quantitative and qualitative factors 
actual future warranty costs could differ from our currently estimated amounts 
insurance and litigation reserves insurance and litigation reserves have been established for estimated amounts based on an analysis of past history of claims 
we have  and require the majority of our subcontractors to have  general liability insurance that protects us against a portion of our risk of loss from construction related claims 
we reserve for costs to cover our self insured retentions and deductible amounts under these policies and for any costs in excess of our coverage limits 
because of the high degree of judgment required in determining these estimated reserve amounts  actual future claim costs could differ from our currently estimated amounts 
recent acquisitions on february   we acquired the net assets of the james construction company  a homebuilder operating in the greater denver  colorado area  for approximately million in cash 
in addition  we are obligated to pay an additional million to the sellers over a two year period 
on february   we acquired the net assets of trophy homes  inc  a homebuilder operating in las vegas  nevada  and certain homesites for approximately million in cash 
in addition  if certain targets are met regarding home deliveries during and  we will be obligated to pay up to an additional million to the sellers over a two year period 
of this amount  we paid million of additional consideration during the year ended december  results of operations selected financial and other information the following table includes selected consolidated statement of income and other data dollars in thousands  except per share data year ended december  homebuilding revenues home sales land sales cost of sales home sales land sales gross profit selling  general administrative expenses variable stock based compensation expense depreciation and amortization expense severance and merger related expenses loss on early retirement of debt other income  net homebuilding pretax income financial services revenues expenses financial services pretax income income from continuing operations before income taxes income tax expense income from continuing operations earnings per common share from continuing operations diluted weighed average number of common shares outstanding diluted other data ebitda homes delivered average sales price per home delivered gross margin on revenue from home sales ratio of sg a expenses to homebuilding revenues ratio of homebuilding pretax income to homebuilding revenues homes in backlog at end of year year ended december  sales value of homes in backlog at end of year total active communities at year end ebitda represents earnings from continuing operations before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization and consists of the sum of income from continuing operations before a income taxes  b amortization of capitalized interest in cost of sales  c homebuilding interest expense and d depreciation and amortization 
we have included information concerning ebitda because we believe that it is an indication of the profitability of our core operations and reflects the changes in our operating results 
we do not use ebitda as a measure of our liquidity because we do not believe it is a meaningful indication of our cash flow 
ebitda is not required by generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap  and other companies may calculate ebitda differently 
ebitda should not be considered as an alternative to operating income or to cash flows from operating activities as determined in accordance with gaap and should not be construed as an indication of our operating performance or a measure of our liquidity

our effective tax rate attributable to income from continuing operations decreased to during the year ended december   from during the year ended december  the decrease is due primarily to expected reductions in state taxes as a result of modifying our corporate structure and other tax planning initiatives 
homebuilding during the year ended december   homebuilding revenues increased to billion  from billion during the year ended december  the increase of was due primarily to the increase in revenues from home sales to billion during the year ended december   from billion during the year ended december  this increase of is due to an increase in home deliveries to  during the year ended december   from  during the year ended december  the increase in home deliveries was partially offset by a slight decline in the average selling price on delivered homes to  from  in addition to the increase in revenue from home sales  we generated additional revenue from land sales 
for the year ended december   our revenues from land sales were million  as compared to million for the year ended december  land sales are incidental to our residential homebuilding operations and are expected to continue in the future but may significantly fluctuate up and down 
our florida region realized an increase in revenue from home sales of million  or  to million during the year ended december  this increase is primarily due to a increase in home deliveries to  which was partially offset by a slight decrease in the average selling price of homes delivered to  during the year ended december   as compared to  home deliveries and an average selling price of homes delivered of  during the year ended december  the increase in home deliveries is primarily due to the deliveries generated by our jacksonville division  which was acquired during the fourth quarter of our mid atlantic region realized an increase in revenue from home sales of million  or  to million during the year ended december  this increase is primarily due to a increase in home deliveries to  which was partially offset by a decline in our average selling price to  during the year ended december   as compared to home deliveries and an average selling price of homes delivered of  during the year ended december  the increase in home deliveries is primarily attributable to the deliveries generated by our baltimore division  which was acquired during the fourth quarter of this increase in home deliveries by our baltimore division was partially offset by a decline in home deliveries by our virginia division  which had a shortage of available product during the period as compared to the prior year due to the timing of new community openings 
the decline in our average sales price is also due to the shift in home deliveries between our virginia and baltimore divisions  as our baltimore division has historically realized a lower average sales price than our virginia division 
our texas region realized an increase in revenue from home sales of million  or  to million during the year ended december  this increase is primarily due to a increase in home deliveries to  during the year ended december   as compared to  home deliveries during the year ended december  and an increase in our average sales price to  during the year ended december   from  during the year ended december  the home delivery volume for the year ended december  continues to reflect the slower demand for new housing in several of our texas markets 
our west region realized an increase in revenue from home sales of million  or  to million for the year ended december  this increase is due to a increase in home deliveries to  during the year ended december   from home deliveries during the year ended december  the increase in home deliveries is primarily due to the deliveries generated by our acquisitions in las vegas and colorado which occurred during the first quarter of the increase in home deliveries was partially offset by a decline in our average selling price in this region to  from  as a result of the diversification of our product mix in this region due to our recent acquisitions 
our homebuilding gross profit increased to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  this increase of is primarily due to an increase in revenue from home sales 
our gross margin on home sales decreased to during the year ended december   from during the year ended december  this decrease is primarily due to an increase in the cost of homesites and higher incentives in several of our markets  with the greatest impact being in our texas markets 
additionally  for the year ended december   we generated gross profit on land sales of million as compared to million for the year ended december  sg a expenses increased to million during the year ended december   approximately of which was general and administrative expenses  from million during the year ended december  as a percentage of homebuilding revenues  sg a expenses increased to for the year ended december   as compared to for the year ended december  a significant portion of the increase in sg a expenses during is attributable to the general and administrative expenses necessary to effect our transition from two separately operated homebuilders to a single national homebuilder and to implement our core strategy of obtaining critical mass in existing markets 
we have begun to see the results of this transition as we have increased the number of active communities and homes in backlog as of december   by and to and  respectively  as compared to and  respectively  as of december  the remainder of the increase in sg a expenses is primarily attributable to expenses associated with recently acquired companies 
upon consummation of our merger in june  we began the process of identifying the steps necessary to become an efficient  large scale homebuilder 
management identified the following significant objectives strengthen our management and operational resources  streamline our operational and corporate structure  and integrate our information systems 
since the merger  we have substantially strengthened our management and operational resources and streamlined our operational and corporate structure 
this plan consisted of placing experienced controllers in our divisions and regional offices as well as developing a corporate center to efficiently manage our finance  operations  legal and corporate governance functions 
the creation of our corporate center has resulted in the development of an internal audit function  centralization of our treasury function and creation of a centralized shared services organization to oversee and manage our land acquisition  supply management  product development and building science functions 
we believe that the development of a strong corporate center is a key component of improving the effectiveness of our critical business processes and strengthening our internal control structure and corporate governance 
in connection with this initiative we incurred recruiting fees and other costs of million 
by the middle of  we expect to have completed this portion of our transition plan 
during  we also incurred significant professional and other fees as a result of modifying our corporate structure to become more efficient from an organizational  operational  and income tax standpoint 
we began to realize benefits from these expenditures through lower income taxes in as our effective tax rate decreased to and expect to continue to recognize lower relative income taxes and other operating costs over time 
we believe that the costs associated with this initiative should be completed by the end of the first quarter of beginning shortly after our merger  one of our primary initiatives was to integrate our information systems into one enterprise wide platform and to enhance our internal financial and operational reporting 
these enhancements included developing a company wide point of sale system  an intranet site  which has become the information distribution network for our divisions  and a should cost model  which will be used to benchmark the cost benefit of design and construction decisions 
we believe that these enhancements will enable us to effectively operate as a large scale homebuilder and support our anticipated growth 
as a result of our systems integration  during the year ended december   we experienced a million increase in non capitalizable information technology expenses consisting primarily of consulting fees  systems training and other related expenses 
we have converted all of our homebuilding divisions to one information system  however  we believe that we will continue to incur some costs during the first two quarters of related to completing the final phases of the conversion 
we believe that the successful completion of our transition plan will enhance our ability to effectively manage our business and execute our strategic growth plans 
we anticipate that additional non recurring costs related to completing our transition will be incurred through the first half of we believe that on a comparable basis  our sg a expenses as a percentage of homebuilding revenues will decline in the second half of during the year ended december   we recognized a compensation charge of million for variable accounting of certain stock based awards  which include accelerated vesting criteria 
we recognized this expense as a result of the market price of our common stock  as of december   being greater than the exercise price 
during there was no stock based compensation expense 
during the year ended december   we incurred a net charge of million in severance charges  as compared to million in severance and merger related charges during the year ended december  the charges during included severance accrued related to former executives of both newmark and engle and million in legal  consulting and advisory fees 
during the year ended december   in connection with our june notes offering  we recognized a loss on the early retirement of debt of million 
this charge relates to the exit fees incurred and the write off of unamortized deferred finance costs associated with the then existing borrowings 
during the year ended december   depreciation and amortization expense increased to million  from million during the year ended december  this increase is primarily attributable to the increase in capitalized software costs incurred in connection with our information systems conversion as these costs are being depreciated over a useful life ranging from months to years 
financial services financial services revenues increased to million during the year ended december   from million during the year ended december  the increase in financial services revenues is primarily attributable to an increase in the number of closings by our mortgage and title operations 
the number of closings at our mortgage operations increased to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december  the number of closings at our title operations increased to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december  for the year ended december   our financial services segment capture ratios have remained relatively consistent with the year ended december  approximately of our homebuyers paid in cash 
our mortgage operations capture ratio for non cash homebuyers was for the year ended december   as compared to for the year ended december  our title operations capture ratio was for the year ended december   as compared to for the year ended december  as a result of our initiative to increase the penetration of the sale of our financial services products to our home buying customers  we began to see an increase in our capture ratios during the fourth quarter of we currently expect this trend to continue into financial services expenses increased to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the increase in financial services expenses of is primarily attributable to the increased revenues and the expansion into new markets 
ebitda during the year ended december   we generated ebitda of million as compared to million during the year ended december  the increase in ebitda is primarily a result of million in severance and merger related charges and a million loss on the early retirement of debt incurred during the year ended december   as compared to severance charges of million incurred during the year ended december  fiscal year compared to fiscal year net income decreased to million or per share during the year ended december  from million or per share during the year ended december  income from continuing operations decreased to million or per share during the year ended december  from million or per share during the year ended december  the decrease in income from continuing operations is attributable to a decrease in homebuilding pretax income to million during the year ended december  from million during the year ended december  the decrease in homebuilding pretax income was partially offset by an increase in financial services pretax income to million during the year ended december  from million during the year ended december  total revenues decreased to billion during the year ended december  from billion during the year ended december  the decrease of is attributable to a decline in homebuilding revenues which was offset by an increase in financial services revenues 
our provision for income taxes remained consistent at during the year ended december  from the year ended december  homebuilding homebuilding revenues decreased to billion during the year ended december  from billion during the year ended december  the decrease of was due to a decline in revenues from home sales  to billion in the year ended december  from billion during the year ended december   which was offset by an increase in revenues from land sales  to million from million during the same periods 
home deliveries decreased to  during the year ended december  from  during the year ended december  the decrease in home deliveries and revenue from home sales was primarily attributable to a decline in the number of communities in which we were actively marketing during the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   and a weakening in housing demand in the texas and west regions 
these factors were partially offset by a strong housing demand in florida 
at the beginning of the year ended december   we were actively marketing in communities 
as a result of our prior strategic decision to consolidate our home sales activities and reduce our homesite acquisitions during the year ended december  and throughout the first half of the year ended december   our active communities declined to a low of in june in the second half of the year ended december   we began to increase the number of communities in which we were marketing  both through organic growth and through acquisition 
consequently  at december  we were actively marketing in communities 
however  due to a lag time between the date we begin marketing homes in a community and the date that we begin to deliver homes  home deliveries from these new communities did not begin to contribute to our home sales revenue until the end of during the year ended december   our texas region generated revenues from home sales of million on  home deliveries as compared to revenues of million on home deliveries of  during the year ended december  the weakening in demand in this market also caused an increase in the level of incentives offered which is reflected in the decline in the average sales price per home delivered to  during the year ended december  from  during the year ended december  additionally  our west region experienced a decline in revenues from home sales to million on home deliveries during the year ended december  from million on  home deliveries during the year ended december  the decline in revenues in the west region is primarily due to a decline in the average number of active selling communities during the first part of the year ended december   as compared to the prior year  and a continued weakness in demand in our colorado markets 
this softness in the market caused us to increase incentives offered to homebuyers resulting in a slight decrease in the average sales price per home delivered  to  in the year ended december  from  in the year ended december  these declines in revenue from the texas and west regions were partially offset by an increase in revenues generated in our florida region to million on  home deliveries during the year ended december  from million on  home deliveries during the year ended december  the revenue increase in this region is primarily due to the increase in our average sales price per home delivered to  during the year ended december  from  during the year ended december  additionally  we generated revenue from home sales of million as a result of our acquisition of ds ware homes in the year ended december  our average sales price per home delivered increased to  during the year ended december  as compared to  during the year ended december  the increase is primarily attributable to increases in our florida and mid atlantic regions  where we have continued to realize higher average sales prices from steady demand for product 
the increase in average sales price in these regions was partially offset by declines in our texas and west regions  where  during the year ended december   we experienced significant increases in incentives provided to homebuyers as compared to the year ended december  homebuilding cost of sales decreased to billion during the year ended december  from billion during the year ended december  the decline of is attributable to the decline in the number of home deliveries offset by an increase in cost of land homesite sales 
our gross margin on home sales decreased to during the year ended december  as compared to during the year ended december  the decline in gross margin is primarily attributable to increased incentives and an increase in the average homesite cost per closing  partially offset by an increase in our gross margin on options and upgrades 
sg a expenses increased by to million during the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  as a percentage of homebuilding revenues  sg a expenses increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the increase in sg a expenses is primarily attributable to increases in compensation  information technology  insurance and professional fees 
depreciation and amortization expenses decreased to million during the year ended december  from million during the year ended december  the decrease of million is primarily due to the elimination of goodwill amortization as a result of the adoption of sfas effective january  if we had not recorded goodwill amortization expense during the year ended december   it would have resulted in an increase in net income per common share for the year ended december  of 
during the year ended december  we incurred million in severance and merger related charges as compared to million in the year ended december  these charges include severance accrued related to the termination of executives who were employed by either us or engle homes prior to the merger 
also  in connection with our merger with engle homes  we incurred approximately million in legal  consulting and advisory fees 
during the year ended december   in connection with our offering of the june senior notes and the june senior subordinated notes  we recognized a loss on the early retirement of debt of million 
this charge relates to the exit fees incurred and the write off of unamortized deferred finance costs associated with the then existing borrowings 
financial services financial services revenues increased to million during the year ended december  from million during the year ended december  the increase of is primarily attributable to an increase in the mortgage and title operations capture of our home sale deliveries 
the increase in the capture ratio of our mortgage operations is due primarily to the expansion into the texas region 
financial services expenses increased to million during the year ended december  from million during the year ended december  the increase of is primarily attributable to increased expenses incurred in connection with our expansion of the financial services operations 
discontinued operations during march  we committed to a plan to dispose of wesbrooke to eliminate operating redundancies in our south florida market and to strengthen our financial position 
pursuant to this plan of disposition  we would sell of the common stock of westbrooke 
on april   we signed a definitive agreement for the sale of westbrooke to standard pacific corp 
standard pacific for million in cash 
this sale was completed on april  in addition  standard pacific satisfied million of westbrooke s debt that included million of intercompany liabilities owed to us 
upon completion of this sale  we realized a gain of million 
we have determined that in accordance with sfas  as of march   the criteria to classify the westbrooke assets as held for sale were met 
results of westbrooke s operations have been classified as discontinued operations  and prior periods have been restated 
selected financial data of our discontinued operations are as follows for the years ended december  and dollars in thousands revenues income from discontinued operations  net of taxes income from discontinued operations per common share ebitda during the year ended december   we generated ebitda of million as compared to million during the year ended december  the decline in ebitda is primarily a result of million in severance and merger related charges incurred during the year ended december  as compared to million incurred during the year ended december  and a million loss on the early retirement of debt associated with our refinancing 
excluding these unusual charges  ebitda during the year ended december  would have been million as compared to million during the year ended december  the decline of primarily relates to the decline in our homebuilding pretax income  after excluding these unusual charges  during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  the decline in our homebuilding pretax income during the year ended december  was partially offset by an increase in our financial services pretax income 
financial condition  liquidity and capital resources consolidated statement of financial condition and related data the following table includes selected consolidated statement of financial condition and other information dollars in thousands year ended december  cash unrestricted inventory total assets homebuilding borrowings total borrowings stockholders equity ratio of homebuilding borrowings to total assets ratio of homebuilding borrowings to capital total borrowings include homebuilding borrowings and financial services borrowings 
capital includes homebuilding borrowings and stockholders equity 
capital excludes financial services borrowings 
discussion of financial condition  liquidity and capital resources sources and uses of cash our homebuilding operations primary uses of cash have been for land acquisitions  construction and development expenditures  and sg a expenditures 
our sources of cash to finance these requirements have been primarily cash generated from operations  cash from our financing activities both debt and equity issuances and cash borrowed under our credit facilities 
our financial services operations primarily use cash to fund mortgages  prior to their sale  and to pay for sg a expenditures 
we rely primarily on internally generated funds  which include the proceeds generated from the sale of mortgages  and from the mortgage operations warehouse line of credit to fund these operations 
at december   we had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of million as compared to million at december  during the year ended december   cash used in operating activities was million as compared to cash provided by operating activities of million for the year ended december  this decrease is primarily a result of an increase in inventory of million  excluding the impact of our acquisitions  as compared to a million increase in inventory for the year ended december  this increase in inventory is part of our strategy to increase the number of active communities and our land positions 
during the year ended december   including the impact of our acquisitions  our controlled homesites increased to approximately  from  cash used in investing activities was million during the year ended december   as compared to million during the year ended december  the increase in the use of cash in investing activities is primarily due to the acquisitions made during the year ended december  and the payment of million in additional consideration for acquisitions made in and additionally  we have had net additions to property and equipment of million during the year ended december   as compared to million during the year ended december  this increase relates primarily to increases in model furnishings caused by our significant number of new communities at the end of as compared to the end of and capitalized software costs incurred in connection with our information systems conversion 
on february   we acquired the net assets of the james construction company  a homebuilder operating in the greater denver  colorado area  for approximately million in cash 
in addition  we are obligated to pay an additional million to the sellers over a two year period 
on february   we acquired the net assets of trophy homes  inc  a homebuilder operating in las vegas  nevada  and certain homesites for approximately million in cash 
in addition  if certain targets are met regarding home deliveries during and  we will be obligated to pay up to an additional million to the sellers over a two year period 
of this amount  we paid million of additional consideration during the year ended december  our ratio of homebuilding borrowings to total assets was at december   as compared to at december  our ratio of homebuilding borrowings to capital was at december   as compared to at december  the improvement in both of these ratios is primarily due to the recent completion of our public offering of common stock 
on november   we sold  pursuant to an underwritten public offering  million shares of our common stock at a price of per share 
the net proceeds of the offering to us were million  after deducting offering costs and underwriting fees of million 
the offering proceeds were used to pay outstanding indebtedness under our revolving credit facility and for general working capital purposes 
in connection with our offering of common stock  technical olympic sa sold approximately million of shares of our common stock  including  shares sold pursuant to the underwriters exercise of their over allotment option 
as a result of these transactions  technical olympic sa has reduced its ownership of us to 
financing activities during  we increased our total borrowings from million at december  to million at december   which included an increase in homebuilding borrowings from million to million 
we used these new borrowings to fund our increased land supply  our acquisitions and the operating costs associated with establishing an infrastructure to support our anticipated growth 
we initially funded these costs through borrowings under our revolving credit facility and then  as market conditions permitted  we issued fixed rate long term notes and common stock to refinance these borrowings and reduce the outstanding balance under our revolving credit facility 
on february   we issued million of senior notes due at a price of of the principal amount plus interest accrued since january  the net proceeds of approximately million were primarily used to repay amounts outstanding under our credit facility 
the february senior notes were issued pursuant to an indenture with substantially the same terms and conditions as the indenture pursuant to which we issued the million of senior notes due that were issued in june on april   we issued an additional million of our senior subordinated notes due at a price of of the principal amount plus interest accrued since january  the net proceeds of approximately million were used to repay amounts outstanding under our credit facility 
these additional debt securities were issued under the same indenture pursuant to which we issued the million of senior subordinated notes due that we issued in june interest on our outstanding senior notes and senior subordinated notes is payable on january and july of each year 
the senior notes are guaranteed by all of our material domestic subsidiaries 
the senior notes rank pari passu in right of payment with all of our existing and future unsecured senior debt and senior in right of payment to the senior subordinated notes and any future subordinated debt 
the senior subordinated notes rank pari passu in right of payment with all of our existing and future unsecured senior subordinated debt and are guaranteed on a senior subordinated basis by all of our material domestic subsidiaries 
the indentures governing the senior and senior subordinated notes require us to maintain a minimum net worth and place certain restrictions on our ability  among other things  to incur additional debt  pay or make dividends or other distributions  sell assets  enter into transactions with affiliates  and merge or consolidate with other entities 
the interest rates on our outstanding senior and senior subordinated notes are higher than the interest rates that we were paying on the outstanding amounts under old debt instruments and under our revolving credit facility 
as a result of the higher interest rates  we anticipate that interest incurred will exceed the amounts which would have been incurred under the prior borrowings 
therefore  the increased interest incurred will have an effect on gross margins in future periods 
our revolving credit facility permits us to borrow up to the lesser of i million  or ii our borrowing base calculated in accordance with the revolving credit facility agreement minus our outstanding senior debt  and to issue letters of credit up to million 
in addition  we have the right to increase the size of the facility to provide for up to an additional million of revolving loans  subject to meeting certain requirements 
the revolving credit facility expires on june  as of december   we had drawn down million and had issued letters of credit of million and as a result  had million in availability under the revolving credit facility 
loans outstanding under the facility may be base rate loans or eurodollar loans  at our election 
base rate loans accrue interest at a rate per annum equal to i an applicable margin plus ii the higher of a citibank  na s base rate  b plus the three week average of the reserve adjusted three month certificate of deposit rate and c plus the federal funds rate 
eurodollar loans accrue interest at a rate per annum equal to i an applicable margin plus ii the reserve adjusted eurodollar rate for the interest period 
applicable margins will be adjusted based on the ratio of our liabilities to our tangible worth 
at december   our loans outstanding under the revolving credit facility accrued interest at a rate of per annum 
the revolving credit facility requires us to maintain specified financial ratios regarding leverage  interest coverage  consolidated tangible net worth and certain operational measurements and satisfy certain financial condition tests 
the revolving credit facility also places certain restrictions on  among other things  our ability to incur additional debt or liens  pay or make dividends or other distributions  sell assets  enter into transactions with affiliates and merge or consolidate with other entities 
the revolving credit facility also restricts our ability to issue additional secured debt  subject to certain exceptions 
the revolving credit facility is secured by a first priority perfected lien on all capital stock of subsidiaries owned by us 
our obligations under the revolving credit facility are guaranteed by all our domestic subsidiaries subject to certain limited exceptions 
to fund the origination of residential mortgage loans  our subsidiary  preferred home mortgage company preferred home entered into a million revolving warehouse line of credit  which we refer to as our warehouse line of credit 
the warehouse line of credit is comprised of a credit facility the phmc credit facility providing for revolving loans of up to million  subject to meeting borrowing base requirements based on the value of collateral provided and mortgage loan purchase and sale agreements the purchase facility which provide for the purchase by the lender of up to million in mortgage loans generated by preferred home 
at no time may the amount outstanding under the facility plus the amount of purchased loans pursuant to the purchase and sale agreements exceed million 
the warehouse line of credit expires on december  as of december   we had million outstanding under the warehouse line of credit 
the phmc credit facility bears interest at the eurodollar rate plus 
amounts outstanding under the purchase facility bear interest at the eurodollar rate plus 
as of december   our loans outstanding under the warehouse line of credit accrued interest at a blended rate of per annum 
the warehouse line of credit is secured by funded mortgages which are pledged as collateral and requires preferred home to maintain certain financial ratios and minimums 
we have entered into a keep well agreement in favor of the lender which obligates us to provide financial support to preferred home  if necessary  in order for preferred home to maintain such financial ratios and minimums 
we believe that as a result of our offering of common stock during november  our offering of senior notes in february and senior subordinated notes in april and the increase in our revolving credit facility  we will have adequate financial resources  including cash from operations and availability under the revolving credit facility and the warehouse line of credit  to meet our current and anticipated working capital and land acquisition and development needs based on current market conditions 
however  there can be no assurance that the amounts available from such sources will be sufficient 
if we identify new acquisition opportunities  or if our operations do not generate sufficient cash from operations at levels currently anticipated  we may need to seek additional debt or equity financing to operate and expand our business 
at december   the amount of our annual debt service payments was million 
this amount included annual debt service payments on the senior and senior subordinated notes of million and interest payments on the revolving credit facility  the warehouse line of credit  and other notes of million based on the balances outstanding as of december  the amount of our annual debt service payments on the revolving credit facility fluctuates based on the principal outstanding under the facility and the interest rate 
an increase or decrease of in interest rates will change our annual debt service payments by million per year 
the revolving credit facility terminates in june at which time we will be required to repay all outstanding principal 
under certain circumstances  we may extend the facility in one year increments  for up to two additional years 
the following summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commitments as of december  payment due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term liabilities reflected on the registrant s balance sheet under gaap total backlog as of december   we had  homes in backlog representing million in revenue  as compared to  homes in backlog representing million in revenue as of december  the increase in revenue in backlog of is primarily attributable to the homes in backlog of our recent acquisitions as well as increased sales activity in several of our existing markets 
our average selling price of homes in backlog has declined slightly to  as of december  from  as of december   as a result of our product diversification 
dividends we did not declare or pay any dividends during the years ended december  and we paid a dividend of per share of common stock on a pre restatement basis and per share on a restated basis during the year ended december  million in the aggregate 
prior to its merger with us  engle homes made net distributions of million during the year ended december  and million during year ended december  recent accounting pronouncements in april  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 reporting gains and losses from extinguishment of debt  which rescinded sfas no 
 no 
 and no 
and amended sfas no 
the new standard addresses the income statement classification of gains or losses from the extinguishment of debt and criteria for classification as extraordinary items 
we adopted sfas no 
during in november  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin 
fin elaborates on the existing disclosure requirements for most guarantees  including loan guarantees such as standby letters of credit 
it also clarifies that at the time a company issues a guarantee  the company must recognize an initial liability for the fair value  or market value  of the obligations it assumes under the guarantee and must disclose that information in its interim and annual financial statements 
the provisions related to recognizing a liability at inception of the guarantee for the fair value of the guarantor s obligations do not apply to product warranties 
the initial recognition and initial measurement provisions apply on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  the adoption of the initial recognition and initial measurement provisions of fin did not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  which amends sfas no 
the new standard provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
it also requires prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the affect of the method used on reported results 
we have not elected to change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
we adopted the disclosure provisions of sfas no 
in our first fiscal quarter ending march  in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities 
interpretation no 
addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities vies which have one or both of the following characteristics the equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated support from other parties  which is provided through other interests that will absorb some or all of the expected losses of the entity  or the equity investors lack one or more of the following essential characteristics of a controlling financial interest a the direct or indirect ability to make decisions about the entities activities through voting rights or similar rights  or b the obligation to absorb the expected losses of the entity if they occur  which makes it possible for the entity to finance its activities  or c the right to receive the expected residual returns of the entity if they occur  which is the compensation for the risk of absorbing the expected losses 
interpretation no 
is applied immediately to vies created after january  pursuant to fasb revision to interpretation no 
fsp  a public entity need not apply the provisions of interpretation no 
to an interest held in a vie or a potential vie until the end of the first interim or annual period ending after march   if the vie was created before february   and the public entity has not issued financial statements reporting that vie as consolidated in accordance with interpretation no 
generally  in the homebuilding industry  homebuilders will enter into option contracts for the purchase of land or homesites with land sellers and third party financial entities  some of which may qualify as vies  as a method of acquiring developed homesites 
we believe that interpretation no 
must be evaluated as it relates to these and similar types of arrangements 
in applying interpretation no 
to our homesite option contracts  estimates regarding cash flows and other assumptions have to be made 
we believe that our critical assumptions are reasonable based on historical evidence and industry practice 
based on our analysis of contracts entered into after january   we determined that we are the primary beneficiary of certain of these homesite option contracts 
consequently  interpretation no 
requires us to consolidate the assets homesites at their fair value  although we have no legal title to the assets  our maximum exposure to loss is limited to the deposits or letters of credits placed with these entities  and creditors  if any  of these entities have no recourse against us 
the effect of the consolidation was to increase inventory by million  excluding deposits of million which had been previously recorded  with a corresponding increase to consolidated land bank obligations in the accompanying consolidated statement of financial condition as of december  in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas no 
establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas no 
is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  our quarter ended september  with the exception of an indefinite deferral relating to application to limited life entities 
we do not believe that the implementation of sfas no 
will have a material impact on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
seasonality of operations the homebuilding industry tends to be seasonal  as generally there are more homes sold in the spring and summer months when the weather is milder  although the rate of sales contracts for new homes is highly dependent on the number of active communities and the timing of new community openings 
we operate primarily in the southwest and southeast  where weather conditions are more suitable to a year round construction process than in other parts of the country 
because new home deliveries trail new home contracts by several months  we typically have a greater percentage of home deliveries in the fall 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as a result of the senior and senior subordinated notes offerings  million of our outstanding borrowings are based on fixed interest rates 
we are exposed to market risk primarily related to potential adverse changes in interest rates on our existing construction loans  warehouse line of credit and revolving credit facility 
the interest rates relative to these borrowings fluctuate with the prime and libor lending rates  both upwards and downwards 
we have not entered into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
as of december   we had an aggregate of approximately million drawn under our bank loan arrangements that are subject to changes in interest rates 
an increase or decrease of in interest rates will change our annual debt service payments by million per year as a result of our bank loan arrangements that are subject to changes in interest rates 
the following table presents the future principal payment obligations and weighted average interest rates associated with our long term debt instruments assuming our actual level of long term debt indebtedness as of december  expected maturity date thereafter fair value in thousands liabilities long term debt fixed rate fixed rate revolving loan  variable rate at december  variable rate  warehouse line of credit at december  other homebuilding borrowings at various interest rates ranging from to at december  our operations are interest rate sensitive 
overall housing demand is adversely affected by increases in interest rates 
if mortgage interest rates increase significantly  this may negatively affect the ability of homebuyers to secure adequate financing 
higher interest rates also increase our borrowing costs because  as indicated above  our bank loans will fluctuate with the prime and libor lending rates  both upwards and downwards 
we may be adversely affected during periods of high inflation  primarily because of higher land and construction costs 
in addition  inflation may result in higher interest rates 
this may significantly affect the affordability of permanent mortgage financing for prospective purchasers  which in turn adversely affects overall housing demand 
in addition  this may increase our interest costs 
we attempt to pass through to our customers any increases in our costs through increased selling prices and  to date  inflation has not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
however  there is no assurance that inflation will not have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations
