item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following is management s discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations of atlantic american corporation atlantic american or the company and its subsidiaries for each of the three years in the period ended december  this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere herein 
atlantic american is an insurance holding company whose operations are conducted through a group of regional insurance companies american southern insurance company and american safety insurance company together known as american southern  association casualty insurance company and association risk management general agency  inc together known as association casualty  georgia casualty surety company georgia casualty  and bankers fidelity life insurance company bankers fidelity 
each operating company is managed separately based upon the geographic location or the type of products offered  although management is conforming information systems  policies and procedures  products  marketing and other functions between association casualty and georgia casualty to create a southern regional property and casualty operation 
critical accounting estimates the accounting and reporting policies of atlantic american and its subsidiaries are in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and  in management s belief  conform to general practices within the insurance industry 
the following is an explanation of the company s accounting policies and the resultant estimates considered most significant by management 
these accounting policies inherently require significant judgment and assumptions and actual results could differ from management s initial estimates 
atlantic american does not expect that changes in the estimates determined using these policies would have a material effect on the company s financial condition or liquidity  although changes could have a material effect on its consolidated results of operations 
unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense comprised of the company liabilities at december  this obligation includes an estimate for unpaid losses on claims reported prior to december   future development on those reported claims  unpaid ultimate losses on claims incurred prior to december  but not yet reported to the company and unpaid claims adjustment expense for reported and unreported claims incurred prior to december  quantification of loss estimates for each of these components involves a significant degree of judgment and estimates may vary  materially  from period to period 
estimated unpaid losses on reported claims are developed based on historical experience with similar claims by the company 
future development on reported claims  estimates of unpaid ultimate losses incurred prior to december  but not yet reported to the company  and estimates of unpaid claims adjustment expense are developed based on the company s historical experience using actuarial methods to assist in the analysis 
the company s actuarial staff develops ranges of estimated future development on reported and unreported claims as well as loss adjustment expenses using various methods including the paid loss development method  the reported loss development method  the paid bornhuetter ferguson method  the reported bornhuetter ferguson method  the berquist sherman method and a frequency severity method 
any single method used to estimate ultimate losses has inherent advantages and disadvantages due to the trends and changes affecting the business environment and the company s administrative policies 
further  a variety of external factors  such as legislative changes  medical inflation  and others may directly or indirectly impact the relative adequacy of liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expense 
the company s approach is the selection of an estimate of ultimate losses based on comparing results of a variety of reserving methods  as opposed to total reliance on any single method 
unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses are generally reviewed quarterly for significant lines of business  and when current results differ from the original assumptions used to develop such estimates  the amount of the company s recorded liability for unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses is adjusted 
future policy benefits comprised of the company s total liabilities at december  these liabilities relate to life insurance products and are based upon assumed future investment yields  mortality 
table of contents rates  and withdrawal rates after giving effect to possible risks of adverse deviation 
the assumed mortality and withdrawal rates are based upon the company s experience 
if actual results differ from the initial assumptions  the amount of the company s recorded liability could require adjustment 
deferred acquisition costs comprised of the company s total assets at december  deferred acquisition costs are commissions  premium taxes  and other costs that vary with and are primarily related to the acquisition of new and renewal business and are generally deferred and amortized 
the deferred amounts are recorded as an asset on the balance sheet and amortized to income in a systematic manner 
traditional life insurance and long duration health insurance deferred policy acquisition costs are amortized over the estimated premium paying period of the related policies using assumptions consistent with those used in computing the related liability for policy benefit reserves 
the deferred acquisition costs for property and casualty insurance and short duration health insurance are amortized over the effective period of the related insurance policies 
deferred policy acquisition costs are expensed when such costs are deemed not to be recoverable from future premiums for traditional life and long duration health insurance and from the related unearned premiums and investment income for property and casualty and short duration health insurance 
assessments of recoverability for property and casualty and short duration health insurance are extremely sensitive to the estimates of a subsequent year s projected losses related to the unearned premiums 
projected loss estimates for a current block of business for which unearned premiums remain to be earned may vary significantly from the indicated losses incurred in any given calendar year 
receivables are amounts due from reinsurers  insureds and agents and comprised of the company s total assets at december  allowances for uncollectible amounts are established  as and when a loss has been determined probable  against the related receivable 
annually  the company and or its reinsurance broker perform an analysis of the credit worthiness of the company s reinsurers 
failure of reinsurers to meet their obligations due to insolvencies or disputes could result in uncollectible amounts and losses to the company 
insured and agent balances are evaluated periodically for collectibility 
losses are recognized when determined on a specific account basis and a general provision for loss is made based on the company s historical experience 
cash and investments comprised of the company s total assets at december  substantially all investments are in bonds and common and preferred stocks  which are subject to significant market fluctuations 
the company carries all investments as available for sale and accordingly at their estimated market values 
on occasion  the value of an investment may decline to a value below its amortized purchase price and remain at such value for an extended period of time 
when an investment s indicated market value has declined below its cost basis for a period of time  generally  not less than nine months  the company evaluates such investment for other than a temporary impairment 
if other than a temporary impairment is deemed to exist  then the company will write down the amortized cost basis of the investment to a more appropriate value 
while such write down does not impact the reported value of the investment in the company s balance sheet  it is reflected as a realized investment loss in the company s consolidated statements of operations 
deferred income taxes comprised less than of the company s total liabilities at december  deferred income taxes reflect the effect of temporary differences between assets and liabilities that are recognized for financial reporting purposes and the amounts that are recognized for tax purposes 
these deferred income taxes are measured by applying currently enacted tax laws and rates 
valuation allowances are recognized to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
in assessing the likelihood of realization  management considers estimates of future taxable income and tax planning strategies

the contract was not renewed in accordingly  in there was a higher effective percent of premiums ceded to premiums written than in american southern produces much of its business through contracts with various states and municipalities  some of which represent significant amounts of revenue 
these contracts  which last from one to three years  are periodically subject to competitive renewal quotes and the loss of a significant contract could have a material adverse effect on the business or financial condition of american southern and the company 
in an effort to increase the number of programs underwritten by american southern and to insulate it from the loss of any one program  american southern is continually evaluating new underwriting programs

the performance of an insurance company is often measured by the combined ratio 
the combined ratio represents the percentage of losses  loss adjustment expenses and other expenses that are incurred for each dollar of premium earned by the company 
a combined ratio of under represents an underwriting profit while a combined ratio of over indicates an underwriting loss 
the combined ratio is divided into two components  the loss ratio the ratio of losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred to premiums earned and the expense ratio the ratio of expenses incurred to premiums earned
