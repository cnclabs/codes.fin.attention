overview we believe that lynx therapeutics  inc is a leader in the development and application of novel genomics analysis solutions 
our massively parallel signature sequencing  or mpss  instruments analyze millions of dna molecules in parallel  enabling genome structure characterization at what we believe to be an unprecedented level of resolution 
as applied to gene expression analysis  mpss provides comprehensive and quantitative digital information important to modern systems biology research in the pharmaceutical  biotechnology and agricultural industries 
gene expression refers to the number of genes and the extent a cell or tissue expresses those genes  and represents a way to move beyond dna sequence data to understand the function of genes  the proteins that they encode and the role they play in health and disease 
systems biology is an approach in which researchers seek to gain a complete molecular understanding of biological systems in health and disease 
we believe that our mpss generates a complete  accurate and quantitative analysis of the transcriptome  which is the full complement of activated genes  messenger rnas or transcripts in a particular tissue at a particular time  to enable systems biology 
transcriptome analysis provides information about all of the genes that are expressed in a biological sample 
mpss generates simultaneously  from a million or more megaclone  our unique and proprietary cloning procedure  micro beads  gene sequence information that uniquely identifies a sample s dna molecules without the need for individual conventional sequencing reactions and produces a comprehensive quantitative profile of gene expression in cells or tissues 
mpss is capable of finding and identifying genes that are expressed at low levels in the cell  beyond the normal sensitivity levels of microarrays  which are small glass or silicon wafers with tens of thousands of dna molecules arrayed on the surface for subsequent analysis and are the current leading tool for gene expression analysis on the market 
as a result  lynx believes that mpss provides a highly reproducible  quantitative digital readout for the activity of virtually every gene in a biological sample 
additionally  unlike microarrays  which are limited to the genes represented on them  mpss does not require advance knowledge of genes or sequences and  therefore  has broad potential commercial applicability to humans  animals  plants and other commercially important organisms 

table of contents our current business model is primarily focused on providing genomics discovery services  such as gene expression analysis and genomic sequencing using mpss 
our commercialization strategies  tactics and target customers for mpss generally involve expanding our work with scientific thought leaders and genomics researchers and gaining additional customers in the pharmaceutical  biotechnology and agricultural industries 
megaclone  our unique and proprietary cloning procedure  is the dna cloning technology that underlies mpss 
megaclone transforms a biological sample containing millions of dna molecules into one made up of millions of micro beads  which are microscopic beads of latex  each of which carries approximately  copies of one of the dna molecules in the sample

industry background the publication of the human genome was a milestone in the history of genetics and genomics 
genetic differences between people and populations can have a significant biological impact  including a major influence on health 
however  the remaining challenge for researchers in industry and academia alike is to explore the multitude of genomic variations and to discover  from the analysis of these differences  the functions of genes and their roles in health and disease 
researchers in industry and academia alike are exploring the multitude of genomic sequence and epigenetic variations of individuals and populations for a better understanding of the role of genes and gene expression in the human body  suggesting new ways to tackle disease and ultimately to the discovery of new diagnostics and therapies 
it is this work  post genome sequencing  that is expected to lead to commercial opportunities and ultimately to the discovery of new therapies and diagnostics for unmet medical needs and to provide the basis for the emerging fields of pharmacogenomics the identification and assessment of genes that are predictive of the efficacy and or toxicity of drug compounds or that may correlate drug responses to the genotype  or genetic makeup  of an individual  and individualized patient therapy personalized medicine 
many diseases result from a malfunction of the genetically programmed protective response to insults  such as trauma  infection  stress and or inherited mutant genes and or deleterious combinations of common variants of a number of genes 
that malfunction may result in inadequate  misguided or exaggerated gene expression  unfolding a complex pathogenic process that may resolve itself  linger chronically or evolve with increasingly destructive effects in a manner quite removed from  and even independent of  the original insult 
complex traits often play a significant role in disease  these are due to interactions between the environment and common variants of many genetic factors sometimes including defective  mutant genes 
by analyzing which genes are expressed in a cell or tissue  the level of expression can illustrate which physiological pathways are active in the cell and to what degree 
by understanding when and where abnormal gene expression occurs and the changes in expression that a drug can cause  the physiological pathways implicated in disease and drug action can be pinpointed 
this knowledge could be used to help discover drug targets  screen drug leads  predict a compound s toxic effects  anticipate pharmacological responses to drug leads and tailor clinical trials to the specific needs of subgroups within a population 
by recognizing gene expression patterns  researchers  and ultimately physicians  may also be able to determine which treatments are likely to be effective for a specific condition and which may be ineffective or harmful 
genomics approaches to therapeutics discovery seek to identify genes connected to the origin of a disease 
searches to identify such genes generally are laborious and involve a very large amount of conventional dna sequencing to identify genes or gene fragments 
this knowledge of genes is only a first step 
while it may pave the way for the development of better diagnostics  it may not necessarily lead to a successful therapy 
for example  while a particular gene  or absence of a gene  may predispose a person to a cancer  an entirely different set of genes is likely to govern the tumor and its metastases 
hence  in addition to understanding the cause of disease  it is important to understand entire networks of genes and their functions in both healthy and diseased states in order to identify the optimal targets for therapy 
one current approach to genomics research is based on the study of gene expression and regulation of gene expression in cells in differing states or conditions 
gene expression in a cell consists of transcription  the process that converts the genetic information encoded in the double stranded dna of a gene into mrna or transcripts  and translation  the process that converts the genetic information encoded in mrna transcripts into a specific protein molecule 
at any one time  any particular human cell expresses thousands of genes 
a different number of 
table of contents copies of each mrna transcript will be present in each biological sample depending upon the particular cell  its function and its environmental conditions at the time 
thus  a cell will contain  at any one time  tens of thousands of different transcripts  in various quantities  for a total on the order of one million or more transcripts 
elucidating gene function involves not only determining which genes are expressed in a healthy or diseased tissue  but also requires determining which of the altered transcripts or transcript levels cause a disease rather than result from the disease 
in general  only the most abundant transcripts are currently accessible using conventional methods 
in addition  conventional methods are dependent on separating and cloning double stranded dna copies cdna of each individual mrna transcript  or cdna  prior to analysis 
thus  by conventional methods  it is impractical to obtain a comprehensive  high resolution analysis of gene expression across one million or more transcripts in cells of interest to the researcher 
epigenomics is the genome wide study of epigenetic effects that are distinct from changes to the primary dna sequence mutations 
cells are impacted by epigenetic structural changes that can lead to changes in control of gene expression  either gene silencing or gene activation 
epigenomics and genome structure play a major role in the regulation of gene expression and disease 
indeed  most cancers involve the epigenetic silencing of genes that normally control cell proliferation 
chemical modifications  such as methylation  and the patterns of protein binding are interdependent and ultimately determine in any given cell which genes will be expressed when and to what degree 
for example  cancer cells often contain a variety of genome structure alterations  some subtle  some dramatic  that contribute to the onset and progression of disease through their influence on gene expression 
the major forms of epigenetic modification occurring in human tumors are dna methylation and histone deacetylation 
comprehensive knowledge of the structure and state of the genome  and quantifying the activity level of all genes offers great promise to the understanding of disease  as well as to the prospect for early detection through diagnostics and treatment through novel  precisely targeted therapeutics and personalized medicine 
our solution we have developed a powerful genome analysis system  a high throughput dna sequencing process  massively parallel signature sequencing mpss technology  which permits the characterization of up to two million targeted dna molecules in a single assay 
each of our mpss machines has  times the capacity of any other commercially available dna sequencing process at less than th the cost per dna molecule analyzed 
this capacity and the resulting economy enable a variety of biological analyses at previously unachievable levels of precision and completeness 
furthermore  our mpss technology provides digital data based on actual dna sequence information for many biological processes where imprecise analogue fluorescent readouts are the current standard such as expression profiling with dna microarrays 
we believe that mpss expression profiling generates a complete  accurate and quantitative analysis of the transcriptome to enable systems biology 
transcriptome analysis provides information about all the genes that are expressed in a biological sample 
mpss expression analysis generates simultaneously  from millions of megaclone micro beads  dna sequence information that uniquely identifies a sample s transcripts without the need for individual conventional sequencing reactions and produces a comprehensive quantitative profile of gene expression in cells or tissues 
mpss analysis is capable of finding and identifying genes using a process involving the targeted capture of short dna fragments derived from each message expressed in a cell  all within a single sample 
this allows for detection and quantitation of virtually all genes that are expressed  particularly those at low levels in the cell that are beyond the normal sensitivity levels of microarrays 
as a result  we believe that mpss analysis provides a highly reproducible  quantitative digital readout for the activity of virtually every gene in a biological sample 
additionally  unlike microarrays  mpss gene expression analysis does not require advance knowledge of genes or sequences and  therefore  has broad potential commercial applicability to humans  animals  plants and other commercially important organisms 
our commercialization strategies  tactics and target customers our commercialization strategies  tactics and target customers for mpss gene expression analysis generally involve expanding our work with scientific thought leaders and genomics researchers and gaining additional customers in the pharmaceutical  biotechnology and agricultural industries 
additionally  our business development 
table of contents efforts include collaborating with it and other companies that we believe can help design the software and other tools necessary to understand the large  complex mpss based data sets required to enable systems biology 
expanding our genomics discovery services business our current business model is primarily focused on providing mpss genomics discovery services such as gene expression analysis and genomic sequencing to research institutions and pharmaceutical  biotechnology and agricultural companies 
research institutes we believe that scientific thought leaders affiliated with research institutes can provide an immediate  significant and enduring source of revenue  both directly from their institutes and from access to labs doing genomics research in the larger scientific research community 
more broadly  we believe that we will benefit by having mpss data placed in the public domain by these researchers 
the scientific thought leaders should provide public and very visible exposure and validation of mpss through their commentary and publications in scientific journals 
pharmaceutical  biotechnology and agricultural companies pharmaceutical  biotechnology and agricultural customers are an integral component of our business development focus and commercialization efforts 
with the assumed accessibility to data sets containing gene expression information for cells or tissues and sequence information for genomes for comparative purposes stemming from our work with scientific thought leaders and it companies  we expect that pharmaceutical  biotechnology and agricultural companies will engage us to produce a comprehensive quantitative profile of gene expression in cells or tissues and genomic sequencing for their specific interests  such as in diseased  abnormal or induced states or conditions 
in these arrangements  we could provide information content for each company s specific internal programs 
we believe that mpss gene expression analysis can become the technology of choice to accelerate drug discovery by identifying and validating drug targets and identifying pathways and mode of action  accelerate drug development through lead which is a representative of a compound series with sufficient potential to progress to a drug development program qualification and optimization which is the synthetic modification of a biologically active compound to fulfill all of the necessary properties required for clinical usefulness by improving the success rate of getting products into clinical testing and to the market by patient group stratification which is the division or arrangement of patients into representative subject populations within the clinical trial and toxicology  and enable discovery of biomarkers which is a biochemical feature that can be used to measure the progress of disease or the effects of treatment for diagnostics and pharmacogenomics 
we believe that most of the important drug targets cannot be reliably monitored by gene expression methods other than mpss 
the revenue sources from genomics discovery service arrangements may include technology access and services fees from performing mpss analyses and providing mpss data 
additionally  takara bio inc has licensed from us the right to use our technologies to provide genomics discovery services and to manufacture and sell microarrays containing content identified by our technologies in specific geographic territories 
in december and september  lynx sold to takara two and three mpss instruments  respectively  for takara s use in providing genomics discovery services in their licensed territories 
our technologies and applications massively parallel signature sequencing technology our mpss technology addresses the need to generate sequence information from millions of dna fragments 
at this extremely large scale  our mpss approach eliminates the need for individual sequencing reactions and the physical separation of dna fragments required by conventional sequencing methods 
mpss uses proprietary instruments and reagents developed by us 

table of contents mpss enables the simultaneous identification of all the dna molecules in a sample 
mpss uses flow cells  which are glass plates that are micromachined  or fabricated  to very precise  small dimensions  to create a grooved chamber for immobilizing microbeads in a planar microarray  which is a two dimensional  dense ordered array of dna samples 
with mpss  one million or more megaclone micro beads are fixed in a single layer array in a flow cell  so solvents and reagents can be washed over the micro beads in each cycle of the process 
our proprietary protocols elicit from the megaclone micro beads sequence dependent fluorescent responses  which are recorded by a charged coupled device  or ccd  camera after each cycle 
the process produces short signature  or identifying  sequences  or more nucleotides long  without requiring fragment separation and separate sequencing reactions as in conventional dna sequencing approaches 
we have developed proprietary instrumentation and software to automate the delivery of reagents and solutions used in our sequencing process and to compile  from the images obtained at each cycle  the signature sequences that result from each experiment 
we believe mpss has the following advantages over conventional dna sequencing methods it sequences dna molecules on as many as one million or more megaclone beads simultaneously  it eliminates the need for individual sequencing reactions and gels  it identifies each of the dna molecules by a unique signature sequence  it produces a comprehensive quantitative profile of gene expression in cells or tissues of interest  and it identifies even the rarest expressed genes 
lynx currently has operational proprietary mpss instruments 
megaclone technology megaclone  our unique and proprietary cloning procedure  underlies our mpss technology 
megaclone transforms a biological sample containing millions of dna molecules into one made up of millions of micro beads  which are microscopic beads of latex  each of which carries approximately  copies of one of the dna molecules in the sample 
in contrast to conventional cloning  in which an individual dna molecule is selected from a sample and amplified into many copies for analysis or identification  we can capture on one set of micro beads clones of nearly all the dna sequences that characterize a sample 
once attached to the micro beads  these clones can be handled and subjected to experiments and analyses all at the same time 
megaclone thereby enables many analyses or characterizations to be conducted that would otherwise be too cumbersome or onerous to conduct using conventional procedures where each clone must be addressed individually 
megaclone is a process that uses a proprietary library of approximately million short synthetic dna sequences  called tags  and their complementary anti tags  to uniquely mark and process each dna molecule in a sample 
each unique tag is a permanent identifier of the dna molecule it is attached to  and all of the tagged molecules in a sample are amplified together to create multiple copies of the tagged molecules 
we use another proprietary process to generate five micron diameter micro beads  each of which carries multiple copies of a short anti tag dna sequence complementary to one of the million tags 
then  we collect the amplified tagged dna molecules onto the micro beads through hybridization of the tags to the complementary anti tags 
each micro bead carries on its surface enough complementary anti tags to collect approximately  identical copies of the corresponding tagged dna molecule 
by this process  each tagged target dna molecule in the original sample is converted into a micro bead carrying about  copies of the same sequence 
therefore  in a few steps  our megaclone technology can transform a complex mixture of more than a million individual dna molecules into a usable format that provides the following benefits substantially all the different dna molecules present in a sample typically more than one million are represented in the final micro bead collection  
table of contents these million or more dna molecules can be analyzed simultaneously in various applications  and the need for storing and handling millions of individual dna clones is eliminated 
megaclone is the foundation for our genome wide analytical applications  principally mpss gene expression analysis and other mpss genome functional assays under development

table of contents axaron bioscience ag  formerly basf lynx bioscience ag in  lynx and basf established axaron bioscience ag  a joint venture company in heidelberg  germany 
axaron began operations in and is employing our technologies in its neuroscience  toxicology and microbiology research programs 
upon the establishment of axaron  we contributed access to our technologies to axaron in exchange for an initial equity ownership in axaron 
basf  by committing to provide research funding to axaron of dm million or approximately million based on a december exchange rate over a five year period beginning in  received an initial equity ownership in axaron 
in  basf agreed to provide an additional million in research funding to axaron  of which million was paid to us for technology assets related to a central nervous system program 
in the period since the joint venture was established  management and employees increased their equity ownership in axaron to  thereby reducing the ownership of lynx and basf to and  respectively 
in june  we extended our technology licensing agreement with axaron 
the license extends axaron s right to use our proprietary mpss and megasort technologies nonexclusively in axaron s neuroscience  toxicology and microbiology programs until december  the agreement also positions axaron to apply our technologies to specific disorders in the neuroscience field 
under the terms of the agreement  we received a million technology license fee from axaron 
we intend to furnish to axaron  initially without charge and later for a fee  proprietary reagents and additional mpss instruments for use in axaron s research programs 
in  lynx and basf agreed to continue their support of axaron s growth  including an increase in the capital of axaron 
we made an additional investment of million in axaron  which maintained our ownership interest in axaron at approximately 
given our ownership share of axaron and our ability to exercise significant influence over axaron s operating and accounting policies  we have accounted for the investment under the equity method in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no

we may receive additional payments from axaron over the remaining term of the technology licensing agreement from the sale to axaron of proprietary reagents and additional mpss instruments for use in axaron s research programs 
we have no on going financial commitment to axaron 
competition competition among entities attempting to identify the genes associated with specific diseases and to develop products based on such discoveries is intense 
we face  and will continue to face  competition from pharmaceutical  biotechnology and agricultural companies  such as affymetrix  inc  celera genomics group  gene logic  inc  and genome therapeutics corporation  academic and research institutions and government agencies  both in the united states and abroad 
several entities are attempting to identify and patent randomly sequenced genes and gene fragments  while others are pursuing a gene identification  characterization and product development strategy based on positional cloning 
we are aware that certain entities are using a variety of gene expression analysis methodologies  including chip based systems  to attempt to identify disease related genes 
in addition  numerous pharmaceutical companies are developing genomic research programs  either alone or in partnership with our competitors 
competition among such entities is intense and is expected to increase 
in order to successfully compete against existing and future technologies  we will need to demonstrate to potential customers that our technologies and capabilities are superior to those of our competitors 
many of our competitors have substantially greater capital resources  research and development staffs  facilities  manufacturing and marketing experience  distribution channels and human resources than we do 
these competitors may discover  characterize or develop important genes  drug targets or drug leads  drug discovery technologies or drugs in advance of our customers or us or that are more effective than those developed by our collaborators and customers or us 
they may also obtain regulatory approvals for their drugs more rapidly than our collaborators or customers will  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
moreover  our competitors may 
table of contents obtain patent protection or other intellectual property rights that could limit our rights or our collaborators and customers abilities to use our technologies or commercialize therapeutic  diagnostic or agricultural products 
we also face competition from these and other entities in gaining access to cells  tissues and nucleic acid samples for use in our discovery programs 
intellectual property we are pursuing a strategy designed to obtain united states and foreign patent protection for our core technologies 
our long term commercial success will be dependent in part on our ability to obtain commercially valuable patent claims and to protect our intellectual property portfolio 
as of december   we owned or controlled issued patents and pending patent applications in the united states and foreign countries relating to our genomics and proteomics technologies 
in addition to acquiring patent protection for our core analysis technologies  as part of our business strategy  we may file for patent protection on sets of genes  both known and newly discovered  that have diagnostic or prognostic applications  novel genes that may serve as drug development targets  genetic maps and sets of genetic markers  such as snps  that are associated with traits or conditions of medical or economic importance 
however  there is substantial uncertainty regarding the availability of such patent protection 
patent law relating to the scope of claims in the technology field in which we operate is still evolving 
the degree to which we will be able to protect our technology with patents  therefore  is uncertain 
others may independently develop similar or alternative technologies  duplicate any of our technologies and  if patents are licensed or issued to us  design around the patented technologies licensed to or developed by us 
in addition  we could incur substantial costs in litigation if we are required to defend ourselves in patent suits brought by third parties or if we initiate such suits 
with respect to proprietary know how that is not patentable and for processes for which patents are difficult to enforce  we rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect our interests 
we intend to maintain several important aspects of our technology platform as trade secrets 
while we require all employees  consultants  collaborators  customers and licensees to enter into confidentiality agreements  we cannot be certain that proprietary information will not be disclosed or that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information

these risks should be read in conjunction with the other information set forth in this report 
we have a history of net losses 
we expect to continue to incur net losses  and we may not achieve or maintain profitability 
we have incurred net losses each year since our inception in  including net losses of approximately million for the year ended december   million in and million in as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
net losses may continue for at least the next several years as we proceed with the commercialization and additional development of our technologies 
the presence and size of these potential net losses will depend  in part  on the rate of growth  if any  in our revenues and on the level of our expenses 
our research and development expenditures and general and administrative costs have exceeded our revenues to date 
research and development expenses may increase due to spending for ongoing technology development and implementation  as well as new applications 
we will need to generate significant additional revenues to achieve profitability 
even if we do increase our revenues and achieve profitability  we may not be able to sustain profitability 
our ability to generate revenues and achieve profitability depends on many factors  including our ability to continue existing customer relationships and enter into additional corporate collaborations and agreements  
table of contents our ability to expand the scope of our products and services into new areas of pharmaceutical  biotechnology and agricultural research  our customers and collaborators abilities to develop diagnostic  therapeutic and other commercial products from the application of our technologies  and the successful clinical testing  regulatory approval and commercialization of such products by our customers and collaborators 
the time required to reach profitability is highly uncertain 
we may not achieve profitability on a sustained basis  if at all 
we will need additional funds in the future  which may not be available to us 
we have invested significant capital in our scientific and business development activities 
our future capital requirements will be substantial as we conduct our operations  and will depend on many factors including the progress and scope of our research and development projects  payments received under our customer  license and collaborative agreements  our ability to establish and maintain customer  license and collaborative arrangements  the progress of the development and commercialization efforts under our customer  license and collaborative agreements  the costs associated with obtaining access to biological samples and related information  and the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights 
we have experienced losses since our inception  including a net loss of million for the year ended december  net losses may continue for at least the next several years as we proceed with the commercialization and additional development of our technologies

we believe that with the funds raised in march  our current cash  cash equivalents and restricted cash  along with cashflows to be generated from customers  collaborators and licensees will be sufficient to enable us to meet our projected operating and capital requirements through at least december  we may seek additional financing  as needed  through arrangements with customers  collaborators and licensees and equity or debt offerings 
if we raise additional capital by issuing equity or convertible debt securities  our existing stockholders may experience substantial dilution 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available on satisfactory terms  or at all 
if we are unable to secure additional financing on reasonable terms  or are unable to generate sufficient new sources of revenue through arrangements with customers  collaborators and licensees  we will be forced to take substantial restructuring actions  which may include significantly reducing our anticipated level of expenditures  the sale of some or all of our assets  or obtaining funds by entering into financing or collaborative agreements on unattractive terms  or we will not be able to fund operations 
our technologies are new and unproven and may not allow our customers  collaborators or us to identify genes  proteins or targets for drug discovery 
you must evaluate us in light of the uncertainties and complexities affecting an early stage genomics company 
our technologies are new and unproven 
the application of these technologies is in too early a stage to determine whether it can be successfully implemented 
these technologies assume that information about gene expression and gene sequences may enable scientists to better understand complex biological processes and  therefore  provide us with increased commercial opportunities for our products 
our technologies also depend on the successful integration of independent technologies  each of which has its own development risks 
relatively few therapeutic 
table of contents products based on gene discoveries have been successfully developed and commercialized 
our technologies may not enable our customers  collaborators or us to identify genes  proteins or targets for drug discovery 
to date  neither our customers nor we have identified any targets for drug discovery based on our technologies 
we are dependent on our customers and collaborators and will need to find additional customers and collaborators in the future to develop and commercialize diagnostic or therapeutic products 
our strategy for the development and commercialization of our technologies and potential products includes entering into collaborations  customer agreements or licensing arrangements with pharmaceutical  biotechnology and agricultural companies and research institutes 
we do not have the resources to develop or commercialize diagnostic or therapeutic products on our own 
if we cannot negotiate additional collaborative arrangements or contracts on acceptable terms  or at all  or if such collaborations or relationships are not successful  we may never become profitable 
we have derived substantially all of our revenues from corporate collaborations  customer agreements and licensing arrangements 
revenues from such agreements depend upon continuation of the related relationships  our performance of genomics discovery services  the achievement of milestones and royalties derived from future products developed from our research and technologies 
to date  we have received  and expect to continue to receive in the future  a significant portion of our revenues from a small number of collaborators  customers and licensees  as shown on the following table year ended december  takara bio inc ei dupont de nemours and company basf ag bayer cropscience geron corporation institute of molecular and cell biology if we fail to perform genomics discovery services or successfully achieve milestones or our collaborators fail to develop successful products  we will not earn the revenues contemplated under such agreements 
if our collaborators  customers or licensees do not renew existing agreements  we lose one of these collaborators  customers or licensees  we do not attract new collaborators  customers or licensees or we are unable to enter into new collaborative  customer or license agreements on commercially acceptable terms  our revenues may decrease  and our activities may fail to lead to commercialized products 
our dependence on collaborations  agreements or licenses with third parties subjects us to a number of risks 
we have limited or no control over the resources that such third parties may choose to devote to our joint efforts 
our collaborators  customers or licensees may breach or terminate their agreements with us or fail to perform their obligations thereunder 
further  our collaborators  customer or licensees may elect not to develop products arising out of our agreements or may fail to devote sufficient resources to the development  manufacture  marketing or sale of such products 
while we do not currently compete directly with any of our customers and collaborators  some of our customers and collaborators could become our competitors in the future if they internally develop dna analysis technologies or if they acquire other genomics companies and move into the genomics industry 
we will not earn the revenues contemplated under our customer and collaborative arrangements  if our customers and collaborators do not develop commercially successful products using our technologies  develop competing products  preclude us from entering into collaborations with their competitors  fail to obtain necessary regulatory approvals  or terminate their agreements with us 

table of contents we depend on a single supplier to manufacture flow cells used in our mpss technology 
flow cells are glass plates that are micromachined  or fabricated to very precise  small dimensions  to create a grooved chamber for immobilizing micro beads in a planar microarray  which is a two dimensional  dense ordered array of dna samples 
we use flow cells in our mpss technology 
we currently purchase the flow cells used in our mpss technology from a single supplier  although the flow cells are potentially available from multiple suppliers 
while we believe that alternative suppliers for flow cells exist  identifying and qualifying new suppliers could be an expensive and time consuming process 
our reliance on outside vendors involves several risks  including the inability to obtain an adequate supply of required components due to manufacturing capacity constraints  a discontinuance of a product by a third party manufacturer or other supply constraints  reduced control over quality and pricing of components  and delays and long lead times in receiving materials from vendors 
we operate in an intensely competitive industry with rapidly evolving technologies  and our competitors may develop products and technologies that make ours obsolete 
the biotechnology industry is highly fragmented and is characterized by rapid technological change 
in particular  the area of genomics research is a rapidly evolving field 
competition among entities attempting to identify genes and proteins associated with specific diseases and to develop products based on such discoveries is intense 
many of our competitors have substantially greater research and product development capabilities and financial  scientific and marketing resources than we do 
we face  and will continue to face  competition from pharmaceutical  biotechnology and agricultural companies  as well as academic research institutions  clinical reference laboratories and government agencies 
some of our competitors  such as affymetrix  inc  celera genomics group  gene logic  inc  and genome therapeutics corporation may be attempting to identify and patent randomly sequenced genes and gene fragments and proteins  pursuing a gene identification  characterization and product development strategy based on positional cloning  which uses disease inheritance patterns to isolate the genes that are linked to the transmission of disease from one generation to the next  and using a variety of different gene and protein expression analysis methodologies  including the use of chip based systems  to attempt to identify disease related genes and proteins 
in addition  numerous pharmaceutical  biotechnology and agricultural companies are developing genomics research programs  either alone or in partnership with our competitors 
our future success will depend on our ability to maintain a competitive position with respect to technological advances 
rapid technological development by others may make our technologies and future products obsolete 
any products developed through our technologies will compete in highly competitive markets 
our competitors may be more effective at using their technologies to develop commercial products 
further  our competitors may obtain intellectual property rights that would limit the use of our technologies or the commercialization of diagnostic or therapeutic products using our technologies 
as a result  our competitors products or technologies may render our technologies and products  and those of our collaborators  obsolete or noncompetitive 
if we fail to adequately protect our proprietary technologies  third parties may be able to use our technologies  which could prevent us from competing in the market 
our success depends in part on our ability to obtain patents and maintain adequate protection of the intellectual property related to our technologies and products 
the patent positions of biotechnology companies  including our patent position  are generally uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions 
we will be able to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that our proprietary technologies are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets 
the laws of some foreign 
table of contents countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the us  and many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending their proprietary rights in foreign jurisdictions 
we have applied and will continue to apply for patents covering our technologies  processes and products  as and when we deem appropriate 
however  third parties may challenge these applications  or these applications may fail to result in issued patents 
our existing patents and any future patents we obtain may not be sufficiently broad to prevent others from practicing our technologies or from developing competing products 
furthermore  others may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or design around our patents 
in addition  our patents may be challenged or invalidated or fail to provide us with any competitive advantage 
we also rely on trade secret protection for our confidential and proprietary information 
however  trade secrets are difficult to protect 
we protect our proprietary information and processes  in part  with confidentiality agreements with employees  collaborators and consultants 
however  third parties may breach these agreements  we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach or our trade secrets may still otherwise become known by our competitors 
in addition  our competitors may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information 
litigation or third party claims of intellectual property infringement could require us to spend substantial time and money and adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize our technologies and products 
our commercial success depends in part on our ability to avoid infringing patents and proprietary rights of third parties and not breaching any licenses that we have entered into with regard to our technologies 
other parties have filed  and in the future are likely to file  patent applications covering genes  gene fragments  proteins  the analysis of gene expression and protein expression and the manufacture and use of dna chips or microarrays  which are tiny glass or silicon wafers on which tens of thousands of dna molecules can be arrayed on the surface for subsequent analysis 
we intend to continue to apply for patent protection for methods relating to gene expression and protein expression and for the individual disease genes and proteins and drug discovery targets we discover 
if patents covering technologies required by our operations are issued to others  we may have to rely on licenses from third parties  which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
third parties may accuse us of employing their proprietary technology without authorization 
in addition  third parties may obtain patents that relate to our technologies and claim that use of such technologies infringes these patents 
regardless of their merit  such claims could require us to incur substantial costs  including the diversion of management and technical personnel  in defending ourselves against any such claims or enforcing our patents 
in the event that a successful claim of infringement is brought against us  we may need to pay damages and obtain one or more licenses from third parties 
we may not be able to obtain these licenses at a reasonable cost  or at all 
defense of any lawsuit or failure to obtain any of these licenses could adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize our technologies and products and thus prevent us from achieving profitability 
we have limited experience in sales and marketing and thus may be unable to further commercialize our technologies and products 
our ability to achieve profitability depends on attracting collaborators and customers for our technologies and products 
there are a limited number of pharmaceutical  biotechnology and agricultural companies and research institutes that are potential collaborators and customers for our technologies and products 
to market our technologies and products  we must develop a sales and marketing group with the appropriate technical expertise 
we may not successfully build such a sales force 
if our sales and marketing efforts fail to be successful  our technologies and products may fail to gain market acceptance 
our sales cycle is lengthy  and we may spend considerable resources on unsuccessful sales efforts or may not be able to enter into agreements on the schedule we anticipate 
our ability to obtain collaborators and customers for our technologies and products depends in significant part upon the perception that our technologies and products can help accelerate their drug discovery and genomics efforts 
our sales cycle is typically lengthy because we need to educate our potential collaborators and customers and sell the benefits of our products to a variety of constituencies within such companies 
in addition  we may be required to negotiate agreements containing terms unique to each collaborator or customer 
we may expend 
table of contents substantial funds and management effort without any assurance that we will successfully sell our technologies and products 
actual and proposed consolidations of pharmaceutical companies have negatively affected  and may in the future negatively affect  the timing and progress of our sales efforts 
the loss of key personnel or the inability to attract and retain additional personnel could impair the growth of our business 
we are highly dependent on the principal members of our management and scientific staff 
the loss of any of these persons services might adversely impact the achievement of our objectives and the continuation of existing customer  collaborative and license agreements 
in addition  recruiting and retaining qualified scientific personnel to perform future research and development work will be critical to our success 
there is currently a shortage of skilled executives and employees with technical expertise  and this shortage is likely to continue 
as a result  competition for skilled personnel is intense and turnover rates are high 
competition for experienced scientists from numerous companies  academic and other research institutions may limit our ability to attract and retain such personnel 
we depend on our president and chief executive officer  kevin p 
corcoran  the loss of whose services could have a material adverse effect on our business 
although we have an employment agreement with mr 
corcoran in place  currently we do not maintain key person insurance for him or any other key personnel 
we use hazardous chemicals and radioactive and biological materials in our business 
any claims relating to improper handling  storage or disposal of these materials could be time consuming and costly 
our research and development processes involve the controlled use of hazardous materials  including chemicals and radioactive and biological materials 
our operations produce hazardous waste products 
we cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or discharge and any resultant injury from these materials 
we may be sued for any injury or contamination that results from our use or the use by third parties of these materials  and our liability may exceed our insurance coverage and our total assets 
federal  state and local laws and regulations govern the use  manufacture  storage  handling and disposal of hazardous materials 
compliance with environmental laws and regulations may be expensive  and current or future environmental regulations may impair our research  development and production efforts 
ethical  legal and social issues may limit the public acceptance of  and demand for  our technologies and products 
our collaborators and customers may seek to develop diagnostic products based on genes or proteins 
the prospect of broadly available gene based diagnostic tests raises ethical  legal and social issues regarding the appropriate use of gene based diagnostic testing and the resulting confidential information 
it is possible that discrimination by third party payors  based on the results of such testing  could lead to the increase of premiums by such payors to prohibitive levels  outright cancellation of insurance or unwillingness to provide coverage to individuals showing unfavorable gene or protein expression profiles 
similarly  employers could discriminate against employees with gene or protein expression profiles indicative of the potential for high disease related costs and lost employment time 
finally  government authorities could  for social or other purposes  limit or prohibit the use of such tests under certain circumstances 
these ethical  legal and social concerns about genetic testing and target identification may delay or prevent market acceptance of our technologies and products 
although our technology does not depend on genetic engineering  genetic engineering plays a prominent role in our approach to product development 
the subject of genetically modified food has received negative publicity  which has aroused public debate 
adverse publicity has resulted in greater regulation internationally and trade restrictions on imports of genetically altered agricultural products 
claims that genetically engineered products are unsafe for consumption or pose a danger to the environment may influence public attitudes and prevent genetically engineered products from gaining public acceptance 
the commercial success of our future products may depend  in part  on public acceptance of the use of genetically engineered products  including drugs and plant and animal products 

table of contents if we develop products with our collaborators  and if product liability lawsuits are successfully brought against us  we could face substantial liabilities that exceed our resources 
we may be held liable  if any product we develop with our collaborators causes injury or is otherwise found unsuitable during product testing  manufacturing  marketing or sale 
although we have general liability and product liability insurance  this insurance may become prohibitively expensive or may not fully cover our potential liabilities 
inability to obtain sufficient insurance coverage at an acceptable cost or to otherwise protect us against potential product liability claims could prevent or inhibit our ability to commercialize products developed with our collaborators 
healthcare reform and restrictions on reimbursements may limit our returns on diagnostic or therapeutic products that we may develop with our collaborators 
if we successfully validate targets for drug discovery  products that we develop with our collaborators based on those targets may include diagnostic or therapeutic products 
the ability of our collaborators to commercialize such products may depend  in part  on the extent to which reimbursement for the cost of these products will be available from government health administration authorities  private health insurers and other organizations 
in the us  third party payors are increasingly challenging the price of medical products and services 
the trend towards managed healthcare in the us  legislative healthcare reforms and the growth of organizations such as health maintenance organizations that may control or significantly influence the purchase of healthcare products and services  may result in lower prices for any products our collaborators may develop 
significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved healthcare products 
if adequate third party coverage is not available in the future  our collaborators may fail to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on their investment in research and product development 
our facilities are located near known earthquake fault zones  and the occurrence of an earthquake or other catastrophic disaster could cause damage to our facilities and equipment  which could require us to cease or curtail operations 
our facilities are located near known earthquake fault zones and are vulnerable to damage from earthquakes 
we are also vulnerable to damage from other types of disasters  including fire  floods  power loss  communications failures and similar events 
if any disaster were to occur  our ability to operate our business at our facilities would be seriously  or potentially completely  impaired 
in addition  the unique nature of our research activities could cause significant delays in our programs and make it difficult for us to recover from a disaster 
the insurance we maintain may not be adequate to cover our losses resulting from disasters or other business interruptions 
accordingly  an earthquake or other disaster could materially and adversely harm our ability to conduct business 
our stock price may be extremely volatile 
we believe that the market price of our common stock will remain highly volatile and may fluctuate significantly due to a number of factors 
the market prices for securities of many publicly held  early stage biotechnology companies have in the past been  and can in the future be expected to be  especially volatile 
for example  during the two year period from january  to december   the closing sales price of our common stock as quoted on the nasdaq national market and nasdaq smallcap market fluctuated from a low of to a high of per share 
in addition  the securities markets have from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that may be unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
the following factors and events may have a significant and adverse impact on the market price of our common stock fluctuations in our operating results  announcements of technological innovations or new commercial products by us or our competitors  release of reports by securities analysts  developments or disputes concerning patent or proprietary rights  developments in our relationships with current or future collaborators  customers or licensees  and 
table of contents general market conditions 
many of these factors are beyond our control 
these factors may cause a decrease in the market price of our common stock  regardless of our operating performance 
our securities have been transferred from the nasdaq national market to the nasdaq smallcap market  which has subjected us to various statutory requirements and may have adversely affected the liquidity of our common stock  and a failure by us to meet the listing maintenance standards of the nasdaq smallcap market could result in delisting from the nasdaq smallcap market 
effective may   a nasdaq qualifications panel terminated our nasdaq national market listing and transferred our securities to the nasdaq smallcap market 
in order to maintain the listing of our securities on the nasdaq smallcap market  we must be able to demonstrate compliance with all applicable listing maintenance requirements 
in the event we are unable to do so  our securities will be delisted from the nasdaq stock market 
with our securities listed on the nasdaq smallcap market  we face a variety of legal and other consequences that will likely negatively affect our business including  without limitation  the following we may have lost our exemption from the provisions of section of the california corporations code  which imposes aspects of california corporate law on certain non california corporations operating within california 
as a result  i our stockholders may be entitled to cumulative voting and ii we may be subject to more stringent stockholder approval requirements and more stockholder favorable dissenters rights in connection with certain strategic transactions  the state securities law exemptions available to us are more limited  and  as a result  future issuances of our securities may require time consuming and costly registration statements and qualifications  due to the application of different securities law exemptions and provisions  we have been required to amend our stock option plan  suspend our stock purchase plan and must comply with time consuming and costly administrative procedures  the coverage of lynx by securities analysts may decrease or cease entirely  and we may lose current or potential investors 
in addition  we are required to satisfy various listing maintenance standards for our common stock to be quoted on the nasdaq smallcap market 
if we fail to meet such standards  our common stock would likely be delisted from the nasdaq smallcap market and trade on the over the counter bulletin board  commonly referred to as the pink sheets 
this alternative is generally considered to be a less efficient market and would seriously impair the liquidity of our common stock and limit our potential to raise future capital through the sale of our common stock  which could materially harm our business 
anti takeover provisions in our charter documents and under delaware law may make it more difficult to acquire us or to effect a change in our management  even though an acquisition or management change may be beneficial to our stockholders 
under our certificate of incorporation  our board of directors has the authority  without further action by the holders of our common stock  to issue  additional shares of preferred stock from time to time in series and with preferences and rights as it may designate 
these preferences and rights may be superior to those of the holders of our common stock 
for example  the holders of preferred stock may be given a preference in payment upon our liquidation or for the payment or accumulation of dividends before any distributions are made to the holders of common stock 
any authorization or issuance of preferred stock  while providing desirable flexibility in connection with financings  possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes  could also have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock or making it more difficult to remove directors and effect a change in management 
the preferred stock may have other rights  including economic rights senior to those of our common stock  and  as a result  an issuance of additional preferred stock could lower the market value

provisions of delaware law may also discourage  delay or prevent someone from acquiring or merging with us 
item properties in february  we entered into a noncancelable operating lease for facilities space of approximately  square feet in two buildings in hayward  california 
currently  our corporate headquarters  principal research and development facilities and production facilities are located in one of the two buildings 
the remaining space will be developed and occupied in phases  depending on our growth 
the lease runs through december we have an option to extend the lease for an additional five year period  subject to certain conditions 
we have leased approximately  square feet of additional space in one of the buildings for further expansion purposes 
in june  lynx gmbh entered into a noncancelable operating lease for facilities space of approximately  square feet in heidelberg  germany  to house its operations 
the lease was terminated as of december  upon termination  we are obliged to pay the remaining unamortized balance of tenant improvements financed by the landlord over the term of the lease 
additionally  we may be required to pay up to approximately euro  or approximately  based on a december  exchange rate for the costs necessary to alter the facilities space to permit or enable another party to lease such space 
now that the lease is terminated  we estimate that the total payments  including possible alteration costs  will be approximately  in august  we entered into a noncancelable operating lease for facilities that expired on july  in  we entered into an agreement to sublease a portion of this space  and in  through a subsequent agreement  subleased the remaining portion of the facility 
the term of the sublease ran through july rent from the sublease was sufficient to cover the rent and other operating expenses incurred by us under the terms of the lease

overview we believe that lynx therapeutics  inc lynx or the company is a leader in the development and application of novel genomics analysis solutions 
our massively parallel signature sequencing  or mpss  instruments analyze millions of dna molecules in parallel  enabling genome structure characterization at what we believe to be an unprecedented level of resolution 
as applied to gene expression analysis  mpss provides comprehensive and quantitative digital gene expression information important to modern systems biology research in the pharmaceutical  biotechnology and agricultural industries 
gene expression refers to the number of genes and the extent a cell or tissue expresses those genes  and represents a way to move beyond dna sequence data to understand the function of genes  the proteins that they encode and the role they play in health and disease 
systems biology is an approach in which researchers seek to gain a complete molecular understanding of biological systems in health and disease 
we have incurred net losses each year since our inception in as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million  including a net loss of million in net losses may continue for at least the next several years as we proceed with the commercialization and additional development of our technologies 
the presence and size of these potential net losses will depend  in part  on the rate of growth  if any  in our revenues and on the level of our expenses 
our cash and cash equivalents have decreased from million as of december  to million as of december   which includes restricted cash of million 
in march  we raised an additional million through the sale of common stock 
we believe that with the funds raised in march  we will have sufficient funding to meet our projected operating and capital requirements through at least december  in addition  we are considering various options to raise additional funds  which will be required to allow us to continue our business activities beyond these options include securing additional equity financing and obtaining new collaborators and customers 
if we raise additional capital by issuing equity or convertible debt securities  our existing stockholders may experience substantial dilution 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available on satisfactory terms  or at all 
if we are unable to secure additional financing on reasonable terms  or are unable to generate sufficient new sources of revenue through arrangements with customers  collaborators and licensees  we will be forced to take substantial restructuring actions  which may include significantly reducing our anticipated level of expenditures  the sale of some or all of our assets  or obtaining funds by entering into financing or collaborative agreements on unattractive terms  or we will not be able to fund operations 

table of contents to date  we have received  and expect to continue to receive in the future  a significant portion of our revenues from a small number of collaborators  customers and licensees  as shown on the following table 
year ended december  takara bio inc ei dupont de nemours and company basf ag bayer cropscience geron corporation institute of molecular and cell biology revenues in each quarterly and annual period have in the past  and could in the future  fluctuate due to the timing and amount of any technology access fees and the period over which the revenue is recognized  the level of service fees  which is tied to the number and timing of biological samples received from our collaborators and customers  as well as our performance of the related genomics discovery services on the samples  the timing of achievement of milestones and the amount of related payments to us  and the number  type and timing of new  and the termination of existing  agreements with collaborators  customers and licensees 
our operating costs and expenses include cost of service fees and other  research and development expenses and general and administrative expenses 
cost of services fees and other includes primarily the costs of direct labor  materials and supplies  outside expenses  equipment and overhead incurred by us in performing our genomics discovery services for  and the costs of reagents and instruments sold to  our collaborators  customers and licensees 
research and development expenses include the costs of personnel  materials and supplies  outside expenses  equipment and overhead incurred by us in our technology and application development and process improvement efforts 
research and development expenses may increase due to spending for ongoing technology development and implementation  as well as new applications  primarily for mpss 
general and administrative expenses include the costs of personnel  materials and supplies  outside expenses  equipment and overhead incurred by us primarily in our administrative  business development  legal and investor relations activities 
general and administrative expenses may increase in support of our research and development  commercial and business development efforts 
we account for our investment in axaron bioscience ag  a company owned primarily by basf ag and us  using the equity method 
for the years ended december  and  our pro rata share of axaron s losses was approximately million and million  respectively 
as of december   we employed full time employees  of which were engaged in production and research and development activities 
in january  we implemented a reduction of approximately of our total workforce  or people 
the groups affected primarily by this action included research and development personnel based at lynx therapeutics gmbh in germany and our proteomics group in california 
in march  we implemented another reduction of approximately of our total workforce  or people which included positions in all functions of the company s business 
the workforce reductions were intended to further focus our financial and human resources on expanding the commercial use of mpss 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes 
the items in our financial statements requiring significant estimates and judgments include determining the useful lives of fixed assets for depreciation and amortization calculations  assumptions for valuing options and warrants and estimated lives of license and collaborative agreements related to deferred revenue 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
revenue recognition technology access fees have generally resulted from upfront payments from collaborators  customers and licensees who are provided access to lynx s technologies for specified periods 
we receive service fees from 
table of contents collaborators and customers for genomics discovery services performed by us on the biological samples they send to lynx 
collaborative research revenues are payments received under various agreements and include such items as milestone payments 
milestone payments are recognized as revenue pursuant to collaborative agreements upon the achievement of specified technology developments  representing the culmination of the earnings process 
other revenues include the proceeds from the sale of technology assets  the sale of proprietary instruments and reagents  and grant revenue 
technology access and license fees are deferred and recognized as revenue on a straight line basis over the noncancelable term of the agreement to which they relate 
payments for services and or materials provided by lynx are recognized as revenues when earned over the period in which the services are performed and or materials are delivered  provided that no other consequential obligations  refunds or credits to be applied to future work exist 
revenues from the sale of technology assets are recognized upon the transfer of the assets to the purchaser 
revenues from the sales of instruments and reagents are recognized upon shipment to the customer 
inventory inventory is stated at the lower of cost which approximates first in  first out cost or market 
the balances at december  and december  were classified as raw materials and consisted primarily of reagents and other chemicals to be utilized while performing genomics discovery services  plus services in process 
services in process include direct material  direct service labor  overhead and other direct costs 
market is net realizable value  which  for services in process  is the estimated selling price  less costs to complete the service 
for raw materials  it is replacement cost or the cost of acquiring similar products from our vendors  as adjusted for our assessment of excess or obsolete materials 
while cost is readily determinable  estimates of market value involve significant estimates and judgments about the future 
we initially record our inventory at cost and each quarter evaluate the difference  if any  between cost and market 
the determination of the market value of inventories is primarily dependent on estimates of future demand for our services  which in turn is based on other market estimates such as technological change  competitor actions and estimates of future selling prices 
we record write downs for the amount that cost of inventory exceeds our estimated market value 
no adjustment is required when market value exceeds cost 
inventory  including allocated services labor and overhead  used in providing genomics discovery services and for reagent sales is charged to cost of services fees and other as consumed 
reagents and chemicals purchased for internal development purposes are charged to research and development expense as incurred 
investments in equity securities as of december   we held an approximate equity interest in axaron bioscience ag 
in  we made a capital investment in axaron of approximately million 
we account for our equity investment in axaron using the equity method in accordance with accounting principles board no 
opinion  the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock because our ownership is greater than and we have the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating  investing and financing decisions of axaron 
under the equity method  we record our pro rata share of axaron s income or losses and adjust the basis of our investment accordingly 
although we have the ability to exercise significant influence over the operations of axaron  we may choose not to exercise such influence or may not have influence over certain operating matters 
consequently  axaron s operating results could differ significantly from our expectations and our pro rata share of axaron s income or losses that we record in the future could be material 

table of contents results of operations year ended december  and revenues revenues for the year ended december  were million  compared to revenues of million for the year ended december  revenues for included technology access fees and service fees of million  license fees from axaron  a related party  of million and collaborative research and other revenues of million  including million related to the sale of three mpss instruments to takara 
in addition to the million related to the sale of the instruments  we received a cash payment of approximately million from takara related to an amendment of our existing collaboration with them 
in the third quarter of  we met the research and development obligations under the collaboration agreement  as amended  related to amounts that we have been paid by takara  including those amounts that we had recorded previously as deferred revenue 
accordingly  we recognized such amounts  aggregating approximately million  as revenue in the third quarter of revenues for included technology access fees and services fees of million  license fees of million from axaron  a related party  and million of collaborative research and other revenue  primarily from the sale of certain of lynx s technology assets to geron corporation and the sale of mpss instruments to takara 
our revenues have historically fluctuated from quarter to quarter and year to year and may continue to fluctuate in future periods due primarily to our service fees  which are impacted principally by the timing and number of biological samples received from existing customers and collaborators  as well as our performance of related services on these samples 
additionally  the number  type and timing of new collaborations and agreements and the related demand for  and delivery of  our services or products will impact the level of future revenues 
operating costs and expenses our total operating costs and expenses were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  cost of services fees and other were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   and reflect primarily the costs of providing our genomics discovery services and the cost of mpss instruments sold to takara 
research and development expenses were million  compared to million in the decrease in research and development expenses in reflects a decrease in materials consumed in research and development efforts and lower personnel expenses  primarily resulting from the workforce reductions that occurred in the first quarter of and the second quarter of our research and development efforts in were directed primarily toward the expansion of the commercial applications of  and process improvements for  mpss 
in january  we discontinued our development work on our proteomics technology  protein profiler  which was intended to provide high resolution analysis of complex mixtures of proteins from cells or tissues 
proteomics is the study of the number of proteins and the extent to which they are expressed in cells or tissues 
in april  we discontinued our development effort on megatype  a technology that was being developed to permit the comparison of collected genomes of two populations and enable the detection and recovery of dna fragments with the single nucleotide polymorphisms  or snps  that distinguish these two populations 
snps are single nucleotide variations  or differences occurring in a single subunit of dna or rna  in the genetic code that occur on average at every  bases along the three billion nucleotides in the human genome 
the primary reason for discontinuing our development efforts on both protein profiler and megatype was to focus our financial and human resources on expanding the commercial use of mpss  which we believe will have the greatest commercial value to us 
we anticipate that our research and development expenses may increase due primarily to efforts directed toward the expansion of the commercial applications of  and process improvements for  mpss 
these research and development efforts assume that information about gene expression and gene sequences may enable scientists to 
table of contents better understand complex biological processes and  therefore  provide us with increased commercial opportunities for our mpss 
relatively few therapeutic products based on gene discoveries have been successfully developed or commercialized 
because of these risks and uncertainties  we cannot predict when or whether we will successfully complete the development of mpss and related technologies or the ultimate costs of such efforts

we had a state net operating loss carryforward of approximately million  which will expire in the years through deferred tax assets related to carryforwards at december  include approximately million associated with stock option activity for which any subsequently recognized tax benefits will be credited directly to stockholders equity 
as of december   we also had federal and california research and development and other tax credit carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively 
the federal research and development credit will expire at various dates from through  if not utilized 
the california research and development credits do not expire 
utilization of our net operating loss may be subject to substantial annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations provided by the internal revenue code and similar state provisions 
such an annual limitation could result in the expiration of the net operating loss before utilization

in october  we entered into a loan and security agreement with a financial institution  comerica bank california  for an equipment line of credit of up to million with a draw down period of one year 
under the initial advance  we drew down million in november related to the purchase of equipment made in previous periods 
we granted comerica bank california a security interest in all items we financed under this agreement 
the initial advance under the loan to finance the purchase of equipment made in previous periods has a term of months from the date of advance and bears interest at a rate of 
in may  we renegotiated the terms of the agreement  which now require that we maintain a minimum cash balance of restricted cash and cash equivalents in an account at comerica bank california of at least of the principal balance under loans outstanding under this agreement until comerica bank california receives payment in full of all outstanding obligations 
as of december   the balance of restricted cash was approximately million 
as of december   the principal balance under loans outstanding under this agreement was approximately million 
we believe that we are in compliance with all terms of the loan agreement 
in late  we entered into a financing agreement with a financial institution  transamerica business credit corporation  under which we drew down million during for the purchase of equipment and certain other capital expenditures 
in september  lynx obtained additional financing of approximately million under an amendment to the original financing agreement 
we granted the lender a security interest in all items financed by it under this agreement 
each draw down under the loan has a term of months from the date of the draw down 
as of december   the principal balance under loans outstanding under this agreement was million 
the draw down period under the agreement expired on march  our contractual obligations for the next five years and thereafter are as follows payments due by period contractual obligations less than year years years after years total in thousands operating leases equipment loans total contractual cash obligations we plan to use available funds for ongoing commercial and research and development activities  working capital and other general corporate purposes and capital expenditures 
we expect capital investments during will be less than million and will be comprised primarily of expenditures for capital equipment required in the normal course of business 
we intend to invest our excess cash in investment grade  interest bearing securities 
we have obtained funding for our operations primarily through sales of preferred and common stock  payments received under contractual arrangements with customers  collaborators and licensees and interest income 
consequently  investors in our equity securities and our customers  collaborators and licensees are significant sources of liquidity for us 
therefore  our ability to maintain liquidity is dependent upon a number of uncertain factors  including but not limited to the following our ability to advance and commercialize further our technologies  our ability to generate revenues through expanding existing collaborations  customer and licensee arrangements and obtaining significant new customers  collaborators and licensees  and the receptivity of capital markets toward our equity or debt securities 
the cost  timing and amount of funds required for specific uses by us cannot be precisely determined at this time and will be based upon the progress and the scope of our commercial and research and development activities  payments received under customer  collaborative and license agreements  our ability to establish and maintain customer  collaborative and license agreements  costs of protecting intellectual property rights  legal and administrative costs  additional facilities capacity needs  and the availability of alternate methods of financing 

table of contents we have incurred net losses each year since our inception in as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million  including a net loss of million in net losses may continue for at least the next several years as we proceed with the commercialization and additional development of our technologies 
the presence and size of these potential net losses will depend  in part  on the rate of growth  if any  in our revenues and on the level of our expenses 
our cash and cash equivalents have decreased from million as of december  as of december   our cash and cash equivalents were million  which includes restricted cash of million

the financing included the sale of  shares of newly issued shares of common stock at per share and the issuance of warrants to purchase  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share 
also  in march  we reduced our headcount by to employees 
we believe that with the funds raised in march  our current cash  cash equivalents and restricted cash  along with cash flows to be generated from customers  collaborators and licensees will be sufficient to enable us to meet our projected operating and capital requirements through at least december  we may seek additional financing  as needed  through arrangements with customers  collaborators and licensees and equity or debt offerings 
if we raise additional capital by issuing equity or convertible debt securities  our existing stockholders may experience substantial dilution 
there can be no assurance that additional financing  if required  will be available on satisfactory terms  or at all 
if we are unable to secure additional financing on reasonable terms  or are unable to generate sufficient new sources of revenue through arrangements with customers  collaborators and licensees  we will be forced to take substantial restructuring actions  which may include significantly reducing our anticipated level of expenditures  the sale of some or all of our assets  or obtaining funds by entering into financing or collaborative agreements on unattractive terms  or we will not be able to fund operations 
recent accounting pronouncements in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity sfas 
the sfas establishes standards for classifying and measuring as liabilities certain financial instruments that embody obligations of the issuer and have characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
the sfas is effective for all financial instruments created or modified after may   and to other instruments for periods beginning after june  the adoption of sfas did not have a material effect on our results of operations or financial position 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities 
in general  a variable interest entity is a corporation  partnership  trust  or any other legal structure used for business purposes that either a does not have equity investors with voting rights or b has equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities 
fin requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity s activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns or both 
the consolidation requirements of fin apply immediately to variable interest entities created after january  the consolidation requirements apply to older entities in the first fiscal year or interim period ending after march  certain of the disclosure requirements apply in all financial statements issued after january   regardless of when the variable interest entity was established 
we do not believe the adoption of fin will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in november  the emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus regarding eitf issue  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
the consensus addresses not only when and how an arrangement involving multiple deliverables should be divided into separate units of accounting  but also how the arrangement s consideration should be allocated among separate units 
the pronouncement is effective for revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june  the adoption of eitf issue did not have a material effect on our results of operations or financial position 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk short term investments the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while  at the same time  maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we invest in highly liquid and high quality debt securities 
our investments in debt securities are subject to interest rate risk 
to minimize the exposure due to adverse shifts in interest rates  we invest in short term securities and maintain an average maturity of less than one year 
as a result  we do not believe we are subject to significant interest rate risk 
foreign currency rate fluctuations the functional currency for our german subsidiary is the euro 
our german subsidiary s accounts are translated from the euro to the us dollar using the current exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date  for balance sheet accounts  and using the average exchange rate during the period  for revenues and expense accounts 
the effects of translation are recorded as a separate component of stockholders equity 
our german subsidiary conducted its business primarily in euros 
exchange gains and losses arising from these transactions are recorded using the actual exchange differences on the date of the transaction 
we have not taken any action to reduce our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  such as options or futures contracts  with respect to transactions with our german subsidiary or transactions with our european collaborators and customers
