overview we are developing novel biological products for profound neuropsychiatric disorders and autoimmune diseases 
our therapeutic product candidates are secretin for schizophrenia and anxiety disorders  uridine for bipolar disorder and ctla ig and protein a for autoimmune diseases 
each of these products represents a novel approach to therapy which may provide better outcomes for patients than existing drugs 
our business strategy is to maintain full commercial rights to our product candidates through proof of principle clinical studies after which we may seek corporate partners for further development and marketing 
we partially fund the development of our proprietary therapeutic product candidates with the profits derived from the sales of our specialty pharmaceutical products 
this will enable us to independently advance our product candidates while at the same time minimize our operating losses 
critical accounting policies and estimates the securities and exchange commission requires that reporting companies discuss their most critical accounting policies and estimates in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the sec indicated that critical accounting policies and estimates are those policies and estimates important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and operating results and requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we have identified the policies and estimates below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 
the notes to the financial statements included in this report on form k include a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition we apply staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition sab no 
to our revenue arrangements 
we generate product revenues from the sale of our rprotein a products to customers in the pharmaceutical and process chromatography industries  and from the sale of secreflo tm to hospital based gastroenterologists 
in accordance with sab no 
 we recognize revenue related to product sales upon shipment of the product to the customer as long as there is persuasive evidence of a sale  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is probable 
additionally  during fiscal and we generated non product revenues from sponsored research and development projects under a small business innovation research sbir phase i grant 
research revenue is recognized as earned under cost plus fixed fee contracts  or on a straight line basis over the term of contract  which approximates when work is performed and costs are incurred 
research expenses in the accompanying statements of operations include funded and unfunded expenses 
impairment analysis of long lived assets during  under the terms of our september licensing agreement with chirhoclin  inc we made a milestone payment to chirhoclin that consisted of  in cash and  shares of our common stock 
we have recorded the fair value of the shares issued   and the cash paid of  as a long term intangible asset 
see note of our consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
beginning in april  we began to amortize this intangible asset to cost of revenue over the remaining term of the license  approximately seven years 
in october  we commenced commercial shipment of secreflo tm  our synthetic version of the porcine hormone secretin 
we amortized  and  during the years ended march  and at march   in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we performed an impairment analysis of this intangible asset in order to determine if an impairment loss existed and should be recognized 
the impairment analysis consisted of an evaluation of the expected cash flows from the sale of secreflo tm over the term of the expected life of secreflo tm and also included various assumptions and estimates concerning selling price  cost and volume of unit sales 
on june   we received a letter of termination from chirhoclin disputing our termination of the licensing agreement for secreflo tm and indicating that due to alleged material breaches by us  chirhoclin terminated the licensing agreement 
in accordance with its purported termination  chirhoclin requested that we stop marketing the product immediately  and we believe it is probable that chirhoclin will attempt to no longer supply us with this product 
although it is our belief that chirhoclin is obligated to continue to supply product after our february termination  based on chirhoclin s notice of termination  we believe it is probable that sales of secreflo tm will be limited to current inventory on hand 
accordingly we have recorded an impairment charge of  in our results of operations for the year ended march  for more information on our arbitration proceeding with chirhoclin  please see legal proceedings 
use of estimates we prepare our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
these principles require that we make estimates and use assumptions that affect the reporting of our assets and our liabilities as well as the disclosures that we make regarding assets and liabilities and income and expense that are contingent upon uncertain factors as of the reporting date 
the actual payments  and thus our actual results  could differ from our estimates 
results of operations fiscal year ended march  compared with fiscal year ended march  total revenue total revenue for the fiscal was  compared to  in fiscal  a decrease of  or 
during fiscal year  product sales of rprotein a decreased to  from sales of  in fiscal sales of rprotein a were negatively impacted by manufacturing problems experienced by one of our significant customers and the timing of regulatory approvals received for monoclonal antibodies that use rprotein a in their manufacturing process 
sales of secreflo tm increased to  in fiscal from sales of  during fiscal we began selling secreflo tm during the second half of fiscal our revenues are subject to significant quarterly fluctuations based on the timing of large scale production orders of rprotein a 
cost of revenue cost of revenue for fiscal and was approximately  and  respectively  reflecting a decrease of  or 
gross profit in fiscal and was  or and  or  respectively 
this decrease in costs and decrease in gross profit is attributable to lower sales and change in product mix of rprotein a and secreflo tm 
although we terminated our licensing agreement with our secreflo tm supplier in february  royalty costs associated with sales of secreflo tm have been recorded in cost of revenue for all of fiscal operating expenses total operating expenses for fiscal and were approximately  and  respectively  an increase of  or during research and development expenses for fiscal and were approximately  and  respectively  an increase of  or 
during fiscal research and development expenses included increased manufacturing costs of clinical materials of  costs associated with the evaluation of our therapeutic candidates in clinical trials increased by  in fiscal personnel and related costs increased  and licensing costs also increased  as we expanded our clinical development during fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses sg a for fiscal and were approximately  and  respectively  an increase of  or 
costs for professional and administrative fees  including patent  legal and insurance premiums  increased  during fiscal in addition  marketing and distribution expenses increased  during fiscal as a result of a full year of sales of secreflo tm and the reimbursement of premarketing and launch expenses during fiscal during fiscal  we recognized a non cash charge associated with the termination of the secreflo tm license agreement 
this charge records an impairment loss related to the license fee  included as a long term asset in the accompanying balance sheet of approximately  recognizing the potential loss of future sales of secreflo tm once current inventory is depleted 
investment income investment income for fiscal and was approximately  and  respectively  a decrease of  or in this decrease is attributable to lower interest rates during fiscal as compared to fiscal we expect interest income to vary based on changes in the amount of funds invested and fluctuation of interest rates 
fiscal year ended march  compared with fiscal year ended march  total revenue total revenue for the fiscal was  as compared to  in fiscal  an increase of  or 
during fiscal year we commenced selling secreflo tm  a diagnostic product that is marketed in the us to hospital based gastroenterologists 
sales of secreflo tm were  for the six months of sales during the year ended march  in addition  rprotein a sales increased to  for fiscal year from  in fiscal this increase in rprotein a sales is attributable to increased demand from value added resellers who incorporate our rprotein a products into their proprietary antibody purification systems  which they sell to the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industry 
cost of revenue cost of revenue for fiscal and  was approximately  and  respectively  reflecting an increase of  or 
this increase is due primarily to increased costs associated with the increase in volume of product shipments and costs associated with the launch of secreflo tm 
gross profit in fiscal and was  or and  or  respectively 
this increase in gross profit is due primarily to a change from period to period in the mix of rprotein a product sales and the commencement of secreflo tm sales 
operating expenses total operating expenses for fiscal and were approximately  and  respectively  an increase of  or during research and development expenses for fiscal and were approximately  and  respectively  a decrease of  or 
this decrease was largely attributable to a decrease in clinical material expenses of  partially offset by an increase in personnel costs of  external research expenses of  and clinical trial expenses of  incurred during fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses sg a for fiscal and were approximately  and  respectively  an increase of  or 
this increase is largely attributable to litigation expenses of  and increased personnel costs of  in addition  costs for professional and administrative fees  including recruiting  consulting  investor relations and insurance premiums  increased  we also incurred one time costs in fiscal associated with the move to our new facility of  investment income investment income for fiscal and was approximately  and  respectively  a decrease of  or in this decrease is attributable to lower average funds available for investment and lower interest rates during fiscal as compared to fiscal liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations primarily through sales of equity securities and revenues derived from product sales and government grants 
our revenue for the foreseeable future will be limited to our product revenue related to rprotein a and secreflo tm 
given the uncertainties related to pharmaceutical product development  we are currently unable to reliably estimate when  if ever  our therapeutic product candidates will generate revenue and cash flows 
we rely on a single supplier  chirhoclin  inc  for our secreflo tm product 
in february  we terminated our licensing agreement with chirhoclin for breach 
we believe we have the right  in accordance with the terms of the licensing agreement  to recover certain payments made to chirhoclin  totaling approximately million  from chirhoclin s share of royalties on sales of secreflo tm and that chirhoclin is obligated to continue to supply secreflo tm and that we retain the right to sell secreflo tm until such payments have been recovered 
if this supplier is unwilling or unable to supply product as a result  our revenues and future cash flows will be negatively impacted offset by a decrease in costs associated with this product 
for more information about the arbitration proceeding regarding secreflo tm  please see legal proceedings 
at march  we had cash and marketable securities of  compared to  at march  our operating activities in used cash of approximately  consisting of the net loss from operations for the year of  a decrease in accounts payable of  and an increase in accounts receivable of  these uses of cash were offset by non cash charges of  for depreciation and amortization  an impairment charge of  and  associated with issuance of warrants  common stock and stock options 
in addition  uses of cash included a decrease in inventory of  a decrease in prepaid expenses of  and an increase in accrued expenses of  during fiscal  we purchased  of capital equipment  consisting of equipment and leasehold improvements 
on may   we issued and sold  shares of our common stock to the riverview group  llc for an aggregate consideration of  repligen received net proceeds of approximately million after deducting the expenses of the transaction 
these proceeds will be used to continue the development of our proprietary product programs 
we plan to continue to invest in key research and development activities 
we expect to continue to incur operating losses for the immediate future 
we expect to incur a similar level of expenses in fiscal as those incurred in fiscal  net of the impairment charge of  recorded in fiscal our future capital requirements include  but are not limited to  continued investment in our research and development programs  capital expenditures primarily associated with purchases of equipment and continued investment in our intellectual property estate 
during fiscal of our research and development expenses were outsourced to third parties 
the outsourcing of such services provides us flexibility to discontinue or increase spending depending on the success of our research and development programs 
while we are generally able to forecast our overall spending  we are unable to predict with certainty costs associated with our existing legal proceedings 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any special purpose entities or off balance sheet financing arrangements 
as of march   we had the following fixed obligations and commitments payments due by period less than more than total year years years years in thousands operating lease obligations   purchase obligations contractual obligations total     our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the following o the success of our clinical studies  o the scope of and progress made in our research and development activities  o the success of any proposed financing efforts  and o the ability to sustain sales of our specialty pharmaceutical products 
we believe that we have sufficient resources to satisfy our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the next twenty four months 
should we need to secure additional financing to meet our future liquidity requirements  we may not be able to secure such financing  or obtain such financing on favorable terms because of the volatile nature of the biotechnology marketplace 
at march   we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately  and research and development credit carryforwards of approximately  to reduce future federal income taxes  if any 
the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards will expire at various dates  beginning in  if not used
