us household products business was disappointing 
the company experienced sales declines in all us household products due to increased competition within and around the categories we compete in  decreased customer promotional activity  losses in distribution of carpet fresh and x  and increased advertising and promotional discounts for automatic toilet bowl cleaners  which are recorded as offsets to sales 
the company instituted a price increase in the us market for certain lubricants and household products during the first quarter of the year 
several of our key customers responded with decreased promotional activity  which had an adverse impact on sales primarily in the second quarter for several of our brands  most notably wd the adverse impact that the price increase had on promotional activity subsided in the third and fourth quarters 
the company completed the acquisition of the line of products in the uk during the third quarter 
this brand gives us a presence in the carpet and household cleaner market in the uk  and will enable us to leverage an introduction of the company s other household product formulations under the brand name  as it is a recognized brand by consumers in the uk market 
operating expenses were up for the year  primarily due to increased foreign exchange rates year over year  along with increased advertising and promotional activity  professional services  freight  insurance  and a variety of other items 
as planned  the investment in advertising and promotional activity increased for the year as compared to the prior year to support the long term health of the company s brands

please refer to the discussion under segment results included later in this section for further detailed results by segment 
changes in foreign currency rates compared to the prior fiscal year contributed to the growth of sales 
the current fiscal year results translated at last year s exchange rates would have produced sales of million 
therefore  the impact of the change in foreign exchange rates year over year positively affected sales by million  or 
by product line  sales of the lubricants wd and in one increased million or on a worldwide basis  with hand cleaner sales of lava and solvol down by million  or  and sales of the household cleaners carpet fresh  no vac  x  flushes  spot shot and down in total by million  or over the prior year period 
sales of the line of products contributed million to sales in the fiscal year gross profit gross profit was million  or of sales in fiscal year  compared to million  or of sales in the prior fiscal year 
the increase in gross margin percentage is due to the effect of the us price increase and other supply chain savings  offset by increased advertising and promotional discounts  the mix of products sold and increased cost of components  raw materials and finished goods 
the increase in pricing of certain products in the us added to gross margin percentage compared to the prior year 
the overall impact of advertising and promotional discounts on the gross margin percentage  which include coupon redemptions  consideration and allowances given to retailers for space in their stores  consideration and allowances given to obtain favorable display positions in retailer s stores  co operative advertising and other promotional activity  was in fiscal compared to in the prior fiscal year 
therefore  the increase in advertising and promotional discounts had a negative effect of on the gross profit margin percentage 
net changes in product mix and other supply chain costs resulted in a decrease in gross margin percentage 
the timing of certain promotional activities and shifts in product mix may continue to cause significant fluctuations in gross margin from period to period 
although the company experienced savings of certain supply chain costs in the first half of fiscal year  our product costs have been adversely affected by the increased cost of components  raw materials and finished goods 
the company continues to actively manage the general upward trend of costs in the market 
note that the company s gross margins may not be comparable to those of other entities  since some entities include all costs related to distribution of their products in cost of product sold  whereas we exclude the portion associated with amounts paid to third parties for distribution to our customers from our contract packagers  and include these costs in selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses sg a for fiscal year increased to million from million for the prior fiscal year 
the increase in sg a is attributable to a number of items including million increase related to changes in exchange rates  million increase in professional fees  primarily due to additional legal and accounting related to regulatory compliance  million related to increased insurance costs  million related to expenses associated with the th anniversary of the company  million net increase in employee costs  including salary increases and additional staffing in europe compared to the prior year  million increase in freight costs  million increase in investor relations activities  and million increase in other items including office overhead expenses  offset by a million decrease in bonus costs and a million decrease in commissions associated with the decline in sales to the grocery trade channel 
as a percentage of sales  sg a increased to in fiscal year as compared to in fiscal year  primarily attributable to those items listed above 
as previously mentioned above under highlights  the company increased focus and commitment to innovation during the fiscal year however  research and development expenses decreased from million in the prior year to million this year as a result of certain events occurring in the last quarter of the fiscal year 
in light of high customer demand  as well as the company s own confidence in two new products  further planned research was bypassed  resulting in the early launch of these products 
research and developments costs were also down due to decisions made in the fourth quarter to terminate the development of certain ideas late in their cycle and to replace them with projects in an earlier  less costly  development stage 
these events reflect the normal cycles of product research and development 
the company anticipates that research and development costs will return to historical levels in fiscal year advertising and sales promotion expenses advertising and sales promotion expenses increased to million in fiscal year  up from million for the prior fiscal year and  as a percentage of sales  increased to in fiscal  from in fiscal year the increase is mainly related to additional television advertising with increased product demos  coupon space and print media 
as a percentage of sales  advertising and sales promotion expenses may fluctuate period to period based upon the type of marketing activities employed by the company  as the cost of certain promotional activities are required to be recorded as reductions to sales  and others remain in advertising and sales promotion expenses 
investment in global advertising and sales promotional expenses for fiscal year is expected to be in the range of to of net sales 
loss on write off of non compete agreement the million loss on the write off of a non compete agreement in fiscal year relates to an agreement with a former independent sales representative

accordingly  the remaining million book value of this asset was determined to be impaired and was written off during the second quarter of fiscal year amortization expense amortization expense was million in fiscal year compared to  in the prior fiscal year 
the current year expense relates to five months of amortization of a definite lived intangible asset over its year life

provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes was of taxable income for the fiscal years ended august  and this reflects an adjustment to the current year tax rate from the previous in the third quarter  associated with a change in the projected annual tax rate due to tax benefits expected from foreign tax planning in the fourth quarter 
the company was unable to achieve the projected benefits in the current year and is expecting a slightly higher tax rate in fiscal year net income net income was million  or per share on a fully diluted basis for the fiscal year ended august   compared to million  or per share for the prior fiscal year

the company had an increase in pricing in the us of certain lubricants and household products in the first quarter of fiscal year the increase was implemented to help offset increased insurance costs  legal and regulatory costs  freight  cost of goods and the cost of special packaging and logistics required in order to meet the needs of customers 
this price increase added to sales in the us during the fiscal year ended august the sales of lubricants were essentially flat compared to last fiscal year due to reduced promotional activity by several large customers  which was related to the price increase instituted by the company in the first quarter of the fiscal year 
the impact of the price increase on promotional activity subsided during the second half of the year  and the company does not expect the impact to affect fiscal year promotional activity 
household product sales in fiscal year were down compared to the prior fiscal year due to declines in the us  partially offset by growth in canada 
sales in the us decreased by million  or  with growth in canada of million  or 
the decrease in the us is due to decreased sales of all brands for several reasons 
these reasons include a variety of competitive factors within and among their product categories  including increased advertising and promotional discounts for automatic toilet bowl cleaners and reduced promotional activity by our customers compared to the prior fiscal year 
this category is expected to remain challenging in fiscal year carpet fresh and x have experienced declining sales due to a variety of competitive factors 
although sales of the carpet fresh brand have declined due to losses in distribution  the brand has increased dollar share of the grocery segment 
competitive product introductions have affected the sales and market share of x the company repositioned the x product  highlighting a proven claim that x produces more effective results compared to the leading products in the category

for this region  of the sales in fiscal year came from the us  and came from canada and latin america  compared to the distribution in fiscal  when of sales came from the us  and came from canada and latin america

all of our direct markets  with the exception of france and italy  showed growth in the fiscal year 
in france  sales were flat in local currency due to declining automotive shelf space at key grocery retailers 
in italy  fiscal year sales were down in local currency due to the transition of staff in the sales team during the second quarter of fiscal year the uk market benefited from improved relationships with key customers  the result of the past reorganization of the sales team

category shelf space continually expands and contracts with the introduction of new products in both related and unrelated categories

critical accounting policies the company s results of operations and financial condition  as reflected in the company s consolidated financial statements  have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
management uses historical experience and other relevant factors when developing estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions are continually evaluated 
note to the company s consolidated financial statements includes a discussion of significant accounting policies 
the accounting policies discussed below are the ones management considers critical to an understanding of the company s consolidated financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on our judgment 
the company s financial results may have been different if different assumptions had been used or other conditions had prevailed 
the company s critical accounting policies have been reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors 
revenue recognition sales are recognized as revenue at the time of delivery when risk of loss and title pass to the customer 
management must make judgments and certain assumptions in the determination of when delivery occurs 
through an analysis of end of period shipments  the company determines an average time of transit that is used to estimate the time of delivery 
differences in judgments or estimates  such as the lengthening or shortening of the estimated delivery time used  could result in material differences in the amounts or timing of revenue recognition 
sales are recorded net of allowances for damaged goods returns  trade promotions  coupons and cash discounts

the company offers on going trade promotion programs with customers  and consumer coupon programs that require the company to estimate and accrue the expected costs of such programs 
programs include cooperative marketing programs  shelf price reductions  coupons  rebates  consideration and allowances given to retailers for space in their stores  consideration and allowances given to obtain favorable display positions in the retailer s stores and other promotional activity 
costs related to rebates  co operative advertising  and other promotional activity are recorded upon delivery of products to customers 
costs related to coupon offers are based upon historical redemption rates and are recorded as incurred  when coupons are circulated 
estimated sales incentives are calculated and recorded at the time related sales are made and are based primarily on historical rates and consideration of recent promotional activities 
we review our assumptions and adjust our reserves quarterly 
our financial statements could be materially impacted if the actual promotion rates fluctuate from the standard rate 
allowance for doubtful accounts the preparation of financial statements requires our management to make estimates and assumptions relating to the collectibility of our accounts receivables 
management specifically analyzes historical bad debts  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
accounting for income taxes current income tax expense is the amount of income taxes expected to be payable for the current year 
a deferred income tax liability or asset is established for the expected future tax consequences resulting from the differences in financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
a valuation allowance is provided if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the company establishes accruals for certain tax contingencies when  despite the belief that the company s tax return positions are fully supported  the company believes that certain positions may be challenged and that the company s positions may not be fully sustained 
the tax contingency accruals are adjusted in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the progress of tax audits  case law  and emerging legislation 
the company s tax contingency accruals are reflected as a component of accrued liabilities 
us income tax expense is provided on remittances of foreign earnings and on unremitted foreign earnings that are not indefinitely reinvested 
where unremitted foreign earnings are indefinitely reinvested  no provision for federal and state tax expense is made 
valuation of long lived assets  intangible assets and goodwill the company assesses the impairment of identifiable intangibles  long lived assets and related goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
for goodwill and intangibles determined to have indefinite lives  impairment is reviewed at least annually under the guidance of sfas no 
 during our second fiscal quarter of each year unless there are indicators during an interim period that assets may have become impaired 
in addition  intangible assets with indefinite lives are evaluated quarterly to determine whether events and circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment include the following significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  decreased market capitalization relative to net book value  unanticipated technological change or competitive activities  loss of key distribution  loss of key personnel  and acts by government and courts 
when there is indication that the carrying value of intangibles  long lived assets or related goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators  an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying value amount of the asset is not recoverable and its carrying amount exceeds its fair value 
transactions with related parties vml was formed in april  at which time the company acquired a capital and membership interest 
the capital interest vests over a five year period 
since formation  vml has served as the company s contract manufacturer for certain household products  and acts as a warehouse distributor for other product lines of the company 
although vml has begun to expand its business to other customers  the company continues to be its largest customer 
the company has the right to sell its interest in vml to the owner  and the owner also has the right to purchase the company s interest 
vml makes profit distributions to the company and the owner on a discretionary basis in proportion to each party s respective interest 
the company s investment in vml is accounted for using the equity method of accounting  and its equity in vml earnings is recorded as a component of cost of products sold  as vml acts primarily as a contract manufacturer to the company 
the company recorded equity earnings related to its investment in vml of million  million  and million for the fiscal years ended august    and respectively 
the company s maximum exposure to loss as a result of its involvement with vml was million as of august  this amount represents the balance of the company s equity investment in vml  which is included in other long term assets on the company s balance sheet 
the company s investment in vml as of august  was million 
product purchased from vml was approximately million  million  and million during the fiscal years ended august   and  respectively 
the company had product payables to vml of million and million at august  and august   respectively 
the company had formerly guaranteed vml s million line of credit  however  the guarantee was removed effective may  item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk the company is exposed to a variety of risks  including foreign currency fluctuations 
in the normal course of its business  the company employs established policies and procedures to manage its exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency values and changes in the market value of its investments 
the company s objective in managing its exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations is to reduce the impact of adverse fluctuations in earnings and cash flows associated with foreign currency exchange rate changes 
accordingly  the company s uk subsidiary utilizes forward contracts to limit its exposure on converting cash balances maintained in euros into british sterling 
the company regularly monitors its foreign exchange exposures to ensure the overall effectiveness of its foreign currency hedge positions 
however  there can be no assurance the company s foreign currency hedging activities will substantially offset the impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates on its results of operations and financial position 
while the company engages in foreign currency hedging activity to reduce its risk  for accounting purposes  none of the foreign exchange contracts are designated as hedges 
interest rate risk as of august   the company has a million  fixed rate term loan  and a million balance remaining on an original million  fixed rate term loan  along with a million revolving line of credit 
only the million revolving line of credit is subject to interest rate fluctuations  with a variable interest rate based on the libor rate plus 
as of august   there was no balance outstanding under the revolving line of credit 
the company s interest rate risk on the outstanding line of credit balance is based upon the fluctuation in the libor rate 
any significant increase in the libor rate could have a material effect on interest expense incurred on any borrowings outstanding on the line of credit 
other risk factors component supply risk the company depends upon its suppliers for the supply of the primary components for its wd brand and other products 
such components are subject to significant price volatility beyond the control or influence of the company 
petroleum products  of which wd and in one are comprised  have had significant price volatility in the past  and may in the future 
rising oil prices can also impact the company s cost of transporting its products 
the company has historically been successful in managing its component costs and product pricing to maintain historical gross margins 
additionally  the company has generally found alternate sources of constituent chemicals for its products readily available 
as component and raw material costs are the main contribution to cost of goods sold for all of the company s products  any significant fluctuation in the costs of components could also have a material impact on the gross margins realized on the company s products 
specifically  future can prices are exposed to fluctuation resulting from tariffs on steel  therefore any significant increase or decrease in steel tariffs could have a significant impact on the costs of purchasing cans and the company s cost of goods 
in the event there is more significant price volatility or higher component costs generally  the company may not be able to maintain  or may choose not to maintain  its gross margins by raising its product prices without affecting demand and unit sales 
increases in the prices for the components could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results  financial position and cash flows 
reliance on supply chain the company s contract manufacturers rely upon two key vendors for the supply of empty cans used in the production of wd  carpet fresh  in one  and spot shot products 
additionally  the company relies on single manufacturers for the production of flushes and x automatic toilet bowl cleaners  x liquid cleaners  carpet fresh powder and its lava bar soap 
the loss of any of these suppliers or manufacturers could temporarily disrupt or interrupt the production of the company s products 
the company does not have direct control over the management or business of the primary contract manufacturers utilized in the manufacturing of the company s products  except indirectly through terms as negotiated in contracts with those manufacturers 
should the terms of doing business with the company s primary contract manufacturers change  the company s cost structure may be impacted  which could have a direct impact on the company s profit margins 
competition the market for the company s products is highly competitive and is expected to be increasingly competitive in the future 
the company s products compete both within their own product classes as well as within product distribution channels  competing with many other products for store placement and shelf space 
competition in international markets varies by country 
the company is aware of many competing products  some of which sell for lower prices  however  the company relies on the awareness of its brands among consumers  the value offered by those brands as perceived by consumers  and its unique platform of multiple distribution channels as its primary competitive strategies 
these considerations as well as increased competition generally could result in price reductions  reduced gross margins  and a loss of market share  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results  financial position and cash flows 
in addition  many of the company s competitors have significantly greater financial  technical  product development  marketing and other resources 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors or that competitive pressures faced by the company will not materially adversely affect its business  operating results  financial position and cash flows 
political and economic risks the company s domestic and international operations are exposed to the risk of political and economic uncertainties 
changes in political and economic conditions may affect product cost  availability  distribution  pricing  purchasing  and consumption patterns 
while the company seeks to manage its business in consideration of these risks  there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in doing so 
as the company s sales extend to various countries around the globe  financial results in affected areas are exposed to a higher degree of risk 
examples of regions currently exposed to such types of risk include latin america  the middle east  and parts of asia 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to successfully mitigate against current and future risk associated with political and economic uncertainties  or that the risks faced by the company will not materially adversely affect its business  operating results  financial position and cash flows 
as sales grow within various regions around the world  the company s exposure to this risk will increase 
business risks with the trend toward consolidation in the retail marketplace  the company s customer base is shifting toward fewer  but larger  customers who purchase in larger volumes 
a large percentage of the company s sales are to mass retail customers 
sales to one of these customers accounted for approximately of the company s net sales in fiscal year the spot shot brand is presently sold to two major customers 
each customer accounts for approximately of total spot shot net sales 
the loss of  or reduction in  orders from any of the company s most significant customers could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and its financial results 
large customers also seek price reductions  added support  or promotional concessions 
in response to this trend  the company has had to expand its use of customer and market specific promotions and allowances  which has negatively impacted and will continue to impact  the company s ability to maintain existing profit margins 
in addition  the company is subject to changes in customer purchasing patterns 
these types of changes may result from changes in the manner in which customers purchase and manage inventory levels  or display and promote products within their stores 
other potential factors such as customer disputes regarding shipments  fees  merchandise condition or related matters may also impact operating results 
the company also faces the risk of diminishing product categories or shifts within these categories 
currently  the company faces challenges related to its household product brands 
household products have short differentiated life cycles and often need continuous innovation to address consumers changing needs and tastes 
as a result of the dynamic nature of these product categories  the ability to understand consumer preferences and innovate is key to the company s ongoing success 
in the event that the company is unable to meet consumer preferences through innovation  its brands and product offerings may be at risk of impairment 
operating results and net earnings may not meet expectations the company cannot be sure that its operating results and net earnings will meet its expectations 
if the company s assumptions and estimates are incorrect or do not come to fruition  or if the company does not achieve all of its key goals  then the company s actual performance could vary materially from its expectations 
the company s operating results and net earnings may be influenced by a number of factors  including the following the introduction of new products and line extensions by the company or its competitors  the company s ability to control its internal costs and the cost of raw materials  the effectiveness of the company s advertising  marketing and promotional programs  changes in product pricing policies by the company or its competitors  changes of accounting policies  the ability of the company to achieve business plans  including volume growth and pricing plans  despite high levels of competitive activity  the ability to maintain key customer relationships  the ability of major customers and other creditors to meet their obligations as they come due  the ability to successfully manage regulatory  tax and legal matters  including resolution of pending matters within current estimates  the ability of the company to attract and retain qualified personnel  and expenses for impairment of goodwill  trademarks and other intangible assets and equity investments in excess of projections 
regulatory risks the company is subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations that impose various environmental controls on its business operations  including among other things  the discharge of pollutants into the air and water  the handling  use  treatment  storage and clean up of solid and hazardous wastes  and the investigation and remediation of soil and groundwater affected by hazardous substances 
such laws and regulations may otherwise relate to various health and safety matters that impose burdens upon the company s operations 
these laws and regulations govern actions that may have adverse environmental effects and also require compliance with certain practices when handling and disposing of hazardous wastes 
these laws and regulations also impose strict  retroactive and joint and several liability for the costs of  and damages resulting from  cleaning up current sites  past spills  disposals and other releases of hazardous substances 
the company believes that its expenditures related to environmental matters have not had  and are not currently expected to have  a material adverse effect on its financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
however  the environmental laws under which the company operates are complicated and often increasingly more stringent  and may be applied retroactively 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that the company will not be required to make additional expenditures to remain in or to achieve compliance with environmental laws in the future or that any such additional expenditures will not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
some of the company s products have chemical compositions that are controlled by various state  federal and international laws and regulations 
the company complies with these laws and regulations and seeks to anticipate developments that could impact the company s ability to continue to produce and market its products 
the company invests in research and development to maintain product formulations that comply with such laws and regulations 
there can be no assurance that the company will not be required to alter the chemical composition of one or more of the company s products in such a way that will not have an adverse effect upon the product s efficacy or marketability 
a delay or other inability of the company to complete product research and development in response to any such regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
a focus on environmental regulations relating to volatile organic compounds vocs resulted in a change in the formulation of the wd product in the majority of countries where the product is sold  whereby co was chosen as the aerosol propellant in as a result of this change  the cost of manufacturing wd was increased and the company increased its selling prices to partially offset the additional cost 
in the event of future increases in product cost  the company may not be in a position to raise selling prices  and therefore an increase in costs could have an adverse effect on the company s profitability 
vocs are regulated by the california air resources board carb 
current carb regulations required a reformulation of the companies multi purpose lubricants 
on november   the company obtained approval for variance with regulations relating to the voc content in its multipurpose lubricants from the carb 
the variance gave the company an extension of one year to research and develop effective formulas with lower voc content for its multipurpose lubricants 
the company has successfully reformulated its multipurpose lubricants to be in full compliance with carb regulation 
the reformulation has resulted in increased product costs 
in conjunction with the review of the state budget  california gave carb the approval to enforce a fee based system which would allow it to collect fees from those it governs on the voc issues 
these fees will go into carb s operating budget and help cover shortfalls  and are said to be based on the amount of vocs a company s product puts into the state s atmosphere 
if a similar voc policy is adopted by other states  the potential impact of fees charged could be material to the company 
generally  the manufacture  packaging  storage  distribution and labeling of the company s products and the company s business operations all must comply with extensive federal  state  and foreign laws and regulations 
it is possible that the government will increase regulation of the transportation  storage or use of certain chemicals  to enhance homeland security or protect the environment and that such regulation could negatively impact raw material supply or costs 
success of acquisitions since  the company has acquired the household product brands spot shot  flushes  x  carpet fresh  and the company believes that its recent acquisitions provide opportunities for growth for all of the company s brands as well as increased efficiencies and cost savings in management  operations and marketing 
however  if the company is not able to successfully integrate acquired products  the company may not be able to maximize these opportunities 
rather  the failure to integrate these acquired businesses because of difficulties in the assimilation of operations and products  the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  the loss of key employees or other factors  could materially adversely affect the company s financial results 
one of the company s strategies is to increase its sales volumes  earnings and the markets it serves through acquisitions of other businesses in the united states and internationally 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to identify  acquire  or profitably manage additional companies or operations or that it will be able to successfully integrate future acquisitions into its operations 
in addition  there can be no assurance that companies or operations acquired will be profitable at their inception or that they will achieve sales levels and profitability that justify the investments made 
increased use of debt financing the company has historically paid out a large part of its earnings to stockholders in the form of regular quarterly dividends 
the recent acquisitions have been funded to a large extent by new debt 
in order to service the new debt  the company will be required to use its income from operations to make interest and principal payments required by the terms of the loan documents 
in addition  the company is required by covenants within the loan documents to maintain certain financial ratios and compliance with other financial terms 
the company believes that the increased income from operations derived from the acquired businesses will fully cover the new debt service requirements 
in fiscal years and  the company announced reductions to its regular quarterly dividend from to per share in april and from to per share in july reducing the annual dividend since april from to 
in order to make more of its cash flow available for debt service requirements 
however  if operating income is not sufficient to properly service the debt or otherwise allow the company to maintain compliance with the terms of its loans  the company could be required to seek additional financing through the issuance of more debt or the sale of equity securities  or the company might be required to further reduce dividends 
the increased debt service obligations could result in lower earnings for the company if anticipated gross and net margins are not maintained for the company s new and existing business lines 
protection of intellectual property the company relies on trademark  trade secret  patent and copyright laws to protect its intellectual property 
the company cannot be sure that these intellectual property rights will be successfully asserted in the future or that they will not be invalidated or circumvented 
in addition  laws of some of the foreign countries in which the company s products are or may be sold do not protect the company s intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
the failure of the company to protect its proprietary information and any successful intellectual property challenges or infringement proceedings against the company could make it less competitive and could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
the company frequently defends its brands from counterfeits across asia through legal and enforcement actions 
in addition  the company has introduced uniquely shaped packaging that the company believes will reduce the ability of counterfeits to imitate the company s products 
volatility in the insurance market the company re evaluates its insurance coverage annually 
trends in the insurance industry suggest that such contracts may be much more expensive  less protective or even unavailable 
in such a case the company may decide to increase levels of self insurance  thereby undertaking additional risk 
product liability and other litigation risks the use of the company s products may expose the company to liability claims resulting from such use 
the company maintains product liability insurance that it believes will be adequate to protect the company from material loss attributable to such claims but the extent of such loss could exceed available limits of insurance or could arise out of circumstances under which such insurance coverage would be unavailable 
other business activities of the company may also expose the company to litigation risks  including risks that may not be covered by insurance 
if successful claims are asserted by third parties against the company for uninsured liabilities or liabilities in excess of applicable insured limits of coverage  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 
marketing distributor relationships the company distributes its products throughout the world in one of two ways the direct distribution model  where products are sold directly by the company to wholesalers and retailers in the us  us  canada  australia and a number of other countries  and the marketing distributor model  where products are sold to exclusive marketing distributors who in turn sell to wholesalers and retailers 
a marketing distributor represents the company in its particular market and works with the company to develop and implement plans to increase brand awareness and distribution 
in many countries throughout the world  the marketing distributor model provides the company with a representative who has extensive local market knowledge 
the company relies on the efforts and knowledge of its marketing distributors to successfully achieve the optimal level of penetration for its brands in each market 
from time to time  the company has experienced changes with respect to its marketing distributor relationships 
there is a risk that changes in such marketing distributor relationships that are not managed successfully could result in a disruption in one or more of the affected markets and that such disruption could have an adverse material effect on the company s business  operating results  financial position and cash flows 
forward looking statements the private securities litigation reform act of provides a safe harbor for certain forward looking statements 
this report contains forward looking statements  which reflect the company s current views with respect to future events and financial performance 
these forward looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties 
the words aim  believe  expect  anticipate  intend  estimate and other expressions that indicate future events and trends identify forward looking statements 
actual future results and trends may differ materially from historical results or those anticipated depending upon factors including  but not limited to  the near term growth expectations for heavy duty hand cleaners and household products in the americas  the impact of changes in product distribution  competition for shelf space  plans for product and promotional innovation  the impact of in one professional on the growth of the in one brand  the impact of customer mix and raw material costs on gross margins  the impact of promotions on sales  the rate of sales growth in the asia pacific region  direct european countries and eastern europe  the expected gross profit margin  the expected amount of future advertising and promotional expenses  the effect of future income tax provisions and expected tax rates  the amount of future capital expenditures  foreign exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates  the effects of  and changes in  worldwide economic conditions  and legal proceedings
