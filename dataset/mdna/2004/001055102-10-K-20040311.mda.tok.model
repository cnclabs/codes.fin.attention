item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations aflac incorporated the parent company and its subsidiaries the company primarily sell supplemental health and life insurance in the united states and japan 
the company s insurance business is marketed and administered through american family life assurance company of columbus aflac  which operates in the united states aflac us and as a branch in japan aflac japan 
most of aflac s policies are individually underwritten and marketed at worksites through independent agents  with premiums paid by the employee 
our insurance operations in the united states and our branch in japan service the two markets for our insurance business 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a is intended to inform the reader about matters affecting the financial condition and results of operations of aflac incorporated and its subsidiaries for the three year period ended december  as a result  the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements and notes 
this md a is divided into five primary sections 
in the first section  we discuss our critical accounting estimates 
we then follow with a discussion of the results of our operations on a consolidated basis and by segment 
the third section presents an analysis of our financial condition as well as a discussion of market risks of financial instruments 
in the capital resources and liquidity section  we address the availability of capital and the sources and uses of cash 
we then conclude by discussing risk factors that may impact our business in the forward looking information section 
critical accounting estimates we prepare our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the estimates discussed below are critical to an understanding of aflac s results of operations and financial condition 
the preparation and evaluation of these critical accounting estimates involve the use of various assumptions developed from management s analysis and judgments 
the application of these critical accounting estimates determines the values at which of our assets and of our liabilities are reported and thus have a direct effect on net earnings and shareholders equity 
subsequent experience or use of other assumptions could result in significantly different results 
investments our investments in debt and equity securities include both publicly issued and privately issued securities 
for privately issued securities  we receive pricing data from external sources that take into account each security s credit quality and liquidity characteristics 
we also routinely review our investments that have experienced declines in fair value to determine if the decline is other than temporary 
these reviews are performed with consideration of the facts and circumstances of an issuer in accordance with the securities and exchange commission sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 accounting for non current marketable equity securities  statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  and related guidance 
the identification of distressed investments  the determination of fair value if not publicly traded  and the assessment of whether a decline is other than temporary involve signifi cant management judgment and require evaluation of factors including but not limited to exh

deferred policy acquisition costs and policy liabilities aflac products are generally long duration fixed benefit indemnity products 
as such  our products are accounted for under the requirements of sfas no 
 accounting and reporting by insurance enterprises 
we make estimates of certain factors that affect the profitability of our business in order to match expected policy benefits and expenses with expected policy premiums 
these assumptions include persistency  morbidity  mortality  investment yields and expenses 
if actual results mirror the assumptions used in establishing policy liabilities and the deferral and amortization of acquisition costs  profits will emerge as a level percentage of premium revenue 
however  because actual results will vary from the assumptions  profits as a percentage of premium revenue will vary from year to year 
we measure the adequacy of our policy reserves and recoverability of deferred policy acquisition costs dac annually by performing gross premium valuations on our business 
our testing indicates that our insurance liabilities are adequate and that our dac is recoverable 
deferred policy acquisition costs under the requirements of sfas no 
 certain costs of acquiring new business are deferred and amortized over the policy s premium payment period in proportion to anticipated premium income 
future amortization of dac is sensitive to our estimates of persistency  interest and future premium revenue at the time of policy issuance 
however  the unamortized balance of dac reflects the actual persistency to date 
as presented in the following table  the ratio of dac to annualized premium in force has been relatively stable for aflac us and has trended down for aflac japan over the last three years

exh table of contents policy liabilities our policy liabilities  which are determined in accordance with sfas no 
and actuarial standards of practice  include two primary components future policy benefits and unpaid policy claims  which account for and of total policy liabilities as of december   respectively 
the future policy benefit liability provides for claims that will occur in the future and is generally calculated as the present value of future expected benefits to be incurred less the present value of future expected net benefit premiums 
we calculate future policy benefits based on assumptions of morbidity  mortality  persistency and interest established at the time a policy is sold 
the assumptions used in the calculations are closely related to those used in developing the gross premiums for a policy 
as required by gaap  we also include a provision for adverse deviation  which is intended to accommodate adverse fluctuations in actual experience 
unpaid policy claims include those claims that have been incurred and are in the process of payment as well as an estimate of those claims that have been incurred but have not yet been reported to us 
we compute unpaid policy claims on an undiscounted basis using statistical analyses of historical claims payments  adjusted for current trends and changed conditions 
assumptions underlying the estimate of unpaid policy claims are updated regularly and incorporate our historical experience as well as other data that provides information regarding our outstanding liability 
claims incurred under aflac s policies are generally reported and paid in a relatively short timeframe 
they are sensitive to frequency and severity of claims 
they are not  however  subject to health care inflation  since benefits are based on a fixed indemnity 
our claims experience is primarily related to the demographics of our policyholders 
in computing the estimate of the unpaid policy claim liability  we consider many factors including the benefits and amounts available under the policy  the volume and demographics of the policies exposed to claims  and internal business practices  such as incurred date assignment and current claim administrative practices 
we monitor these conditions closely and make adjustments to the liability as actual experience emerges 
claim levels are generally stable from period to period  however  fluctuations in claim levels may occur 
in calculating the unpaid policy claim liability  we do not calculate a range of estimates 
however  if current period claims were to change by  we would expect the unpaid policy claim liability to change by approximately million 
our claims review indicated that we experienced a decline in the average number of hospital days associated with the typical cancer treatment period in japan 
we believe the average number of days declined primarily due to changes in financial incentives provided to hospitals by the government sponsored health care system in japan to shorten the average hospital stay 
however  our claims statistics also indicated that the declines in the average number of days per hospitalization were generally offset by an increase in the frequency of hospitalizations associated with the treatment of cancer 
this shift reduced current period claims and will increase future period claims 
exh 
aflac incorporated form k 
exh table of contents in recognition of the results of our claims review  we modified our estimates of unpaid policy claims and future policy benefits 
in  we transferred million from aflac japan s unpaid policy claims to the liability for future policy benefits to reflect the anticipated decrease in the number of days per hospitalization for the current treatment period and the associated increase in the expected number of future hospitalizations 
this transfer had no effect on net earnings

we do not purchase securities with the intent of generating capital gains or losses 
however  investment gains and losses may be realized as a result of changes in the financial markets and the creditworthiness of specific issuers of fixed maturity securities 
the realization of investment gains and losses is independent of the underwriting and administration of our insurance products  which are the principal drivers of our profitability 
the large realized investment losses in related primarily to the sale of our investment in parmalat 
following several credit ratings downgrades of its debt  we sold all of our holdings in parmalat and realized a pretax loss of million 
we also sold our investment in levi strauss at a pretax loss of million 
these investment losses and other investment transactions in the normal course of business decreased pretax earnings by million after tax  million  or 
per diluted share 
in  we recognized pretax impairment losses of million 
these impairment losses were primarily related to the corporate debt security of a japanese issuer and various equity securities we believe experienced other than temporary declines in fair value 
these impairment losses and other investment transactions in the normal course of business decreased pretax earnings by million after tax  million  or 
per diluted share 
in  we recognized pretax impairment losses of million 
these impairment losses were primarily related to the corporate debt securities of a us issuer and a european issuer  both of which experienced credit rating downgrades  and our investment in two human resource service companies

exh table of contents cross currency swaps we entered into cross currency swap agreements to effectively convert our dollar denominated senior debt obligation  which matures in  into a yen denominated obligation see notes and of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the effect of issuing fixed rate  dollar denominated debt and swapping it into fixed rate  yen denominated debt has the same economic impact on aflac as if we had issued straight yen denominated debt of a like amount 
the accounting treatment for cross currency swaps is different from issuing yen denominated samurai notes 
sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  requires that the change in the fair value of the interest rate component of the cross currency swap be reflected in the income statement 
the change in fair value is determined by relative dollar and yen interest rates and has no cash impact on our results of operations 
additionally  we have the ability to retain the cross curren cy swaps until their maturity 
at maturity  the swaps fair value and their initial contract fair value will be equal and the cumulative impact of gains and losses from the changes in fair value of the interest component will be zero 
the amounts are reported in other income in the consolidated statements of earnings 
see notes and of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
nonrecurring items in december  the members of the life insurance policyholder protection corporation approved the financial services agency s fsa proposal  which required the industry to contribute an additional billion yen approximately million using the december  exchange rate to japan s policyholder protection fund 
our estimated share of the assessment decreased net earnings by million 
per diluted share 
this charge is included in acquisition and operating expenses in the consolidated statement of earnings 
foreign currency translation aflac japan s premiums and most of its investment income are received in yen 
claims and expenses are paid in yen  and we primarily purchase yen denominated assets to support yen denominated policy liabilities 
these and other yen denominated financial statement items are translated into dollars for financial reporting purposes 
we translate aflac japan s income statement from yen into dollars using an average exchange rate for the reporting period  and we translate its balance sheet using an end of period exchange rate 
however  it is important to distinguish between translating and converting foreign currency 
except for a limited number of transactions  we do not actually convert yen into dollars 
due to the relative size of aflac japan  fluctuations in the yen dollar exchange rate can have a significant effect on our reported results 
in periods when the yen weakens  translating yen into dollars causes fewer dollars to be reported 
when the yen strengthens  translating yen into dollars causes more dollars to be reported 
consequently  yen weakening has the effect of suppressing current period results in relation to the comparable prior period  while yen strengthening has the effect of magnifying current period results in relation to the comparable prior period 
as a result  we view foreign currency translation as a financial reporting issue for aflac and not an economic event to our company or shareholders 
because the effect of translating yen into dollars distorts the rate of growth of our operations  management evaluates aflac s financial performance excluding the impact of foreign currency translation

exh table of contents income taxes our combined us and japanese effective income tax rates on net earnings were in  in and in total income taxes were million in  compared with million in and million in japanese income taxes on aflac japan s results accounted for most of our income tax expense 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on income taxes 
earnings projections to comply with the sec s new reporting requirements  we were required to change the format that we use to communicate earnings guidance 
previously  we communicated earnings guidance on the basis of operating earnings per diluted share growth  excluding the effect of foreign currency translation 
we now communicate earnings guidance based on net earnings per diluted share growth 
our guidance involves projections of net earnings 
however  items that cannot be predicted or that are outside of management s control may have a significant impact on actual results 
therefore  our projections of net earnings include certain assumptions to reflect the limitations that are inherent in projections of net earnings 
in the context of a forward looking discussion  the impact of foreign currency translation on our results of operations is inherently unpredictable 
therefore  our projections of net earnings assume no impact from foreign currency translation for a given period in relation to the comparable prior period 
furthermore  as discussed previously  we do not purchase securities with the intent of generating capital gains or losses 
therefore  we do not attempt to predict realized investment gains and losses  which include impairment charges  as their ultimate realization will be the result of market conditions that may or may not be predictable 
as a result  our projections of net earnings assume no realized investment gains or losses in future periods 
net earnings are also impacted by the change in the fair value of the interest rate component of our cross currency swaps  which is determined based on relative dollar and yen interest rates 
similar to foreign currency exchange rates  yen and dollar interest rates are also inherently unpredictable 
consequently  our projections of net earnings assume no impact from the change in the fair value of the interest rate component of our cross currency swaps 
finally  because nonrecurring items represent the financial impact of items that have not occurred within the past two years and are not expected to occur within the next two years  we do not attempt to predict their occurrence in future periods 
prior to the required change in disclosure requirements  our upwardly revised objective for had been to increase operating earnings per diluted share by  excluding the impact of currency translation 
the equivalent objective using our new earnings projection format would have been to increase net earnings per diluted share  to  utilizing the assumptions discussed above 
based on net earnings per diluted share of  adjusted for realized investment losses a loss of

furthermore  these requirements direct a public business enterprise to report a measure of segment profit or loss  certain revenue and expense items  and segment assets 
we measure and evaluate our insurance segments financial performance using operating earnings on a pretax basis 
we define segment operating earnings as the profits we derive from our operations before realized investment gains and losses  the change in the fair value of the interest rate component of cross currency swaps  and nonrecurring items 
we believe that an analysis of segment operating earnings is vitally important to an understanding of the underlying profitability drivers and trends of our insurance business 
furthermore  because a significant portion of ou r business is conducted in japan  we believe it is equally important to understand the impact of translating japanese yen into us dollars 
aflac japan aflac japan  which operates as a branch of aflac  is the principal contributor to consolidated earnings

exh table of contents aflac japan pretax operating earnings changes in aflac japan s pretax operating earnings and profit margins are primarily affected by investment yields  morbidity  mortality  persistency and expense levels 
an ongoing shift in our product mix to products with lower loss ratios and favorable claim trends on some lines of business contributed to the decline in the benefit ratio 
we expect the benefit ratio to continue to decline in future years primarily reflecting the shift to newer products and riders 
our persistency has declined only slightly over the last three years 
the operating expense ratio has declined over the last two years 
we expect the operating expense ratio to be relatively stable in the future 
the expansion of the profit margins during the past three years was largely attributable to the declining benefit ratio  which is partially offset by the effect of low investment yields 
lower investment yields affect our profit margins by reducing the spread between investment yields and required i nterest on policy reserves related to our older blocks of policies in force see table and discussion on page the following table presents a summary of operating results for aflac japan

rider max accounted for of total sales in  in  and in after a difficult year in  rider max sales improved in  primarily as a result of conversions from the original term policy to the newly introduced whole life version 
conversions also impacted total sales results for rider max but not as much as they did in conversion activity accounted for approximately of total rider max sales in  compared with in for policy conversions  new annualized premium sales include only the incremental annualized premium amount over the original term policy 
we expect that the effect of conversions on total new annualized sales will continue to decline in future periods

during  the number of licensed sales associates rose to approximately  compared with  at december  the growth of licensed sales associates resulted from agency recruitment

our actions primarily are centered on enhancing our distribution system by expanding the sales management infrastructure that supports our sales force 
we increased the number of sales territories from five to seven and we also increased the number of state  regional and district sales coordinators 
we anticipate additional coordinator expansion in the future

analysis of financial condition our financial condition has remained strong in the functional currencies of our operations during the last two years 
the yen dollar exchange rate at the end of each period is used to translate yen denominated balance sheet items to us dollars for reporting purposes

the stronger yen increased reported investments and cash by billion  total assets by billion  and total liabilities by billion  compared with the amounts that would have been reported for if the exchange rate had remained unchanged from year end market risks of financial instruments our financial instruments are exposed primarily to two types of market risks 
they are currency risk and interest rate risk 
during  we liquidated the majority of our equity investments and therefore no longer consider equity price risk to be material 
currency risk the functional currency of aflac japan s insurance operation is the japanese yen 
all of aflac japan s premiums  claims and commissions are received or paid in yen as are most of its investment income and other expenses 
furthermore  most of aflac japan s investments  cash and liabilities are yen denominated 
when yen denominated securities mature or are sold  the proceeds are generally reinvested in yen denominated securities 
aflac japan holds these yen denominated assets to fund its yen denominated policy obligations 
in addition  aflac incorporated has yen denominated notes payable and cross currency swaps related to its senior notes 
although we generally do not convert yen into dollars  we do translate financial statement amounts from yen into dollars for financial reporting purposes 
therefore  the translation of the reported amounts is affected by foreign currency fluctuations 
we report unrealized foreign currency translation gains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive income 
on a consolidated basis  we attempt to match yen denominated assets to yen denominated liabilities in order to minimize the exposure of our shareholders equity to foreign currency translation fluctuations 
we accomplish this by investing a portion of aflac japan s investment portfolio in dollar denominated securities see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements and by the parent company s issuance of yen denominated debt and use of cross currency swaps see notes and of the notes to the consolidated financial statements

this primarily occurs when we transfer funds from aflac japan to aflac us  which is done annually 
the exchange rates prevailing at the time of transfer will differ from the exchange rates prevailing at the time the yen profits were earned 
generally  these repatriations have represented an amount less than of aflac japan s prior year fsa based earnings 
a portion of the repatriation may be used to service aflac incorporated s yen denominated notes payable and the remainder is converted into dollars 
interest rate risk our primary interest rate exposure is a result of the effect of changes in interest rates on the fair value of our investments in debt securities 
we use modified duration analysis  which measures price percentage volatility  to estimate the sensitivity of our debt securities fair values to interest rate changes 
for example  if the current duration of a debt security is  then the fair value of that security will increase by approximately if market interest rates decrease by basis points  assuming all other factors remain constant

these securities total million at amortized cost and have an average yield of 
these maturities will contribute to a continued decline in our overall portfolio yield 
currently  when our debt securities mature  the proceeds may be reinvested at a yield below that of the interest required for the accretion of policy benefit liabilities on policies issued in earlier years 
however  the investment yield on new investments has exceeded interest requirements on policies issued in recent years 
since  premium rates on new business have been increased several times to help offset the lower available investment yields 
also in recent years  our strategy of developing and marketing riders as attachments to our older policies has helped offset the negative investment spread 
and despite the negative investme nt spreads  adequate overall profit margins still exist in aflac japan s aggregate block of business because of profits that have emerged from changes in mix of business and favorable experience from mortality  morbidity  and expenses

exh table of contents investments and cash our investment philosophy is to maximize investment income while emphasizing liquidity  safety and quality 
our investment objective  subject to appropriate risk constraints  is to fund policyholder obligations and other liabilities in a manner that enhances shareholders equity 
we seek to meet this objective through a diversified portfolio of fixed income investments that reflects the characteristics of the liabilities it supports 
aflac invests primarily within the debt securities markets 
our investment activities expose us to credit risk  which is a consequence of extending credit and or carrying investment positions 
however  we continue to adhere to prudent standards for credit quality 
we accomplish this by considering our product needs and the overall objectives of aflac incorporated  in addition to credit risk 
our investment policy requires that all securities be rated investment grade at the time of purchase 
in evaluating the initial rating  we look at the overall senior issuer rating  the explicit rating for the actual issue or the rating for the security class  and the appropriate naic designation from the securities valuation office svo 
in addition  we perform extensive internal credit reviews to ensure that we are consistent in applying rating criteria for all of our securities

see capital resources and liquidity on page for additional information 
we have investments in both publicly issued and privately issued securities 
however  the status of issuance should not be viewed as an indicator of liquidity or as a limitation on the determination of fair value 
the outstanding amount of a particular issuance  as well as the level of activity in a particular issuance and the state of the market  including credit events and the interest rate environment  affect liquidity regardless of type of issuance 
we routinely assess the fair value of all of our investments 
this process includes evaluating quotations provided by outside securities pricing sources and or compiled using data provided by external debt and equity market sources  as described more fully in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements

aflac japan s investments in yen denominated privately issued securities consist primarily of non japanese issuers  which helps reduce our exposure to japanese corporate issuers 
these non japanese issuers are willing to issue yen denominated securities with longer maturities  thereby allowing us to improve our asset liability matching and our overall investment returns 
most of our privately issued securities are issued under medium term note programs and have standard documentation commensurate with credit ratings  except when internal credit analysis indicates that additional protective and or event risk covenants are required 
we use specific criteria to judge the credit quality of both existing and prospective investments 
furthermore  we use several methods to monitor these criteria  including credit rating services and internal credit analysis

however  our holdings of below investment grade securities have increased somewhat in recent years as the overall credit environment has deteriorated 
in the event of a credit rating downgrade to below investment grade status  we do not automatically liquidate our position 
however  if the security is in the held to maturity portfolio  we immediately transfer it to the available for sale portfolio so that the security s fair value and its unrealized gain loss are reflected on the balance sheet 
once we designate a security as below investment grade  we begin a more intensive monitoring of the issuer 
we do not automatically recognize an impairment for the difference between fair value and carrying value 
our investment management starts by reviewing its credit analysis 
included in this process are an evaluation of the issuer  its current credit posture and an assessment of the future prospects for the company 
we then obtain fair value information from at least three independent pricing sources 
upon determining the fair value  we move our focus to an analysis of whether or not the decline in fair value  if any  is other than temporary 
for securities with a carrying value in excess of fair value  investment management then reviews the issue based on our impairment policy to determine if the investment should be impaired and or liquidated 
the assessment of whether a decline is other than temporary requires significant management judgment and is discussed mo re fully in the critical accounting estimates section on page exh

funding by the life insurance industry is generally made over a ten year period

due to their infrequency  we treat these charges as nonrecurring items 
we review the estimated liability for policyholder protection fund contributions annually and report any adjustments in aflac japan s operating earnings 
in  we received a formal proposal regarding additional funding for the lippc 
the proposal  which was drafted by the fsa  extended the japanese government s pledge to enact fiscal safety net measures of up to billion yen until march  and required the industry to contribute an additional billion yen to the lippc 
these funds will be used to support policyholder obligations of failed life insurance companies 
despite our vote against the proposal  it passed when members of the lippc voted in as a result  we recorded an after tax charge of million  or 
per diluted share  for our estimated portion of the additional industry contribution 
during  the japanese government and the insurance industry agreed to extend the time over which the industry s contribution to the lippc would be paid 
as a result  we accrued an additional billion yen  or million  to reflect our revised estimate of required contributions 
under insurance guaranty association laws in most us states  insurance companies doing business in those states can be assessed for policyholder losses up to prescribed limits that are incurred by insolvent companies with similar lines of business 
such assessments have not been material to us in the past 
we believe that future assessments relating to companies in the united states currently involved in insolvency proceedings will not materially impact our financial position or results of operations

these securities will not be available to us persons or entities 
for additional information  see discussion on page under notes payable 
we believe outside sources for additional debt and equity capital  if needed  will continue to be available 
the principal sources of cash for our insurance operations are premiums and investment income 
the primary uses of cash by our insurance operations are policy claims  commissions  operating expenses  income taxes and payments to the parent company for management fees and dividends 
both the sources and uses of cash are reasonably predictable 
our investment objectives provide for liquidity through the purchase of investment grade debt securities 
aflac insurance policies generally are not interest sensitive and therefore are not subject to unexpected policyholder redemptions due to investment yield changes 
also  the majority of aflac s policies provide fixed benefit amounts rather than reimbursement for actual medical costs and therefore generally are not subject to the risks of medical cost inflation 
consolidated cash flows we translate operating cash flows for aflac japan s yen denominated items into us dollars using weighted average exchange rates

exh table of contents regulatory restrictions aflac is domiciled in nebraska and is subject to its regulations 
the nebraska insurance department imposes certain limitations and restrictions on payments of dividends  management fees  loans and advances by aflac to the parent company 
the nebraska insurance statutes require prior approval for dividend distributions that exceed the greater of the net gain from operations  which excludes net realized investment gains  for the previous year determined under statutory accounting principles  or of statutory capital and surplus as of the previous year end 
in addition  the nebraska insurance department must approve service arrangements and other transactions within the affiliated group 
these regulatory limitations are not expected to affect the level of management fees or dividends paid by aflac to the parent company 
a life insurance company s statutory capital and surplus is determined according to rules prescribed by the national association of insurance commission ers naic  as modified by the insurance department in the insurance company s state of domicile 
statutory accounting rules are different from gaap and are intended to emphasize policyholder protection and company solvency 
the continued long term growth of our business may require increases in the statutory capital and surplus of our insurance operations 
aflac s insurance operations may secure additional statutory capital through various sources  such as internally generated statutory earnings or equity contributions by the parent company from funds generated through debt or equity offerings 
the naic s risk based capital formula is used by insurance regulators to facilitate identification of inadequately capitalized insurance companies 
the formula evaluates insurance risk  business risk  asset risk and interest rate risk by weighing the types and mixtures of risks inherent in the insurer s operations 
aflac s naic risk based capital ratio remains high and reflects a very strong capital and surplus position 
currently  the naic has ongoing regulatory initiatives relating to revisions to the risk based capital formula as well as numerous initiatives covering insurance products  investment s  and other actuarial and accounting matters 
we believe that we will continue to maintain a strong risk based capital ratio and statutory capital and surplus position in future periods 
in addition to restrictions by us insurance regulators  the fsa may not allow transfers of funds from aflac japan if the transfers would cause aflac japan to lack sufficient financial strength for the protection of policyholders 
the fsa maintains its own solvency standards  a version of risk based capital requirements 
aflac japan s solvency margin ratio significantly exceeds regulatory minimums

in and  expenses allocated to aflac japan were million and were million in during  aflac japan also remitted profits of million billion yen to aflac us  compared with million billion yen in and million billion yen in for additional information on regulatory restrictions on dividends  profit transfers and other remittances  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
for the japanese reporting fiscal year ended march   aflac japan adopted a new japanese statutory accounting standard regarding fair value accounting for investments 
previously  debt securities were generally reported at amortized cost for fsa purposes 
under the new accounting standard  aflac japan s debt securities have been classified as either available for sale or held to maturity  similar to gaap investment classifications 
under this new regulatory accounting standard  the unrealized gains and losses on debt securities available for sale are reported in fsa capital and surplus and reflected in the solvency margin ratio 
this new accounting standard may result in significant fluctuations in fsa equity  aflac japan s solvency margin ratio and amounts available for annual profit repatriation
