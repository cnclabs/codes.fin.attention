item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation beginning on page in our office furniture components group  we will continue striving to develop new products  providing opportunities to supply more components to customers 
we also expect to continue making strategic acquisitions that add new products or expand operations into new regions of the world 
overview of the aluminum products segment segment groups business units aluminum products aluminum die casting tool die our aluminum products segment is the leading independent producer of non automotive aluminum die castings in north america 
we also produce some zinc and magnesium die castings 
we work with customers from the design concept stage to market introduction and then through the product lifecycle to refine the product and reduce cost 
we sell aluminum  zinc and magnesium die cast components to a diverse group of customers that manufacture industrial and consumer products 
our customers include gas barbeque grill manufacturers diesel and small engine builders motorcycle  truck  off road and recreational vehicle including all terrain vehicles and snowmobiles and automobile makers manufacturers of outdoor lighting fixtures  cable line amplifiers  wireless communications systems and other cable and telecommunication products consumer appliance and power tool manufacturers computer  electronic and electric motor producers 
table of contents we also manufacture and refurbish dies also known as molds or tools for all types and sizes of die casting machines 
these are sold to customers that buy our die castings and to other die cast manufacturers 
we also provide extensive machining  coating  finishing  sub assembly and other value added services related to the die cast components that we sell 
key strategies market share growth is a major focus 
we plan to continue to pursue large users of castings  work to provide more products used by customers who make some of their aluminum components  and look for opportunities to expand into new markets where die cast components are used 
we plan to continue striving to develop technology that allows opportunities for growth in new markets 
finally  we are committed to establishing a global presence  enabling us to supply customers as they take more production overseas 
acquisitions may play a part in accomplishing these plans 
overview of the industrial materials segment segment groups business units industrial materials wire wire drawing wire products steel rod tubing steel tubing the industrial materials segment produces steel rod  drawn wire and welded steel tubing as well as specialty wire products 
drawn wire and welded steel tubing are important raw materials that are widely used to manufacture our products 
about of the drawn wire and about of the welded steel tubing that we produce is used to manufacture other products within the company 
for example  wire is used to make bedding and furniture components commercial fixtures and point of purchase displays automotive seating components welded steel tubing is used in many of the same products including motion furniture mechanisms store fixtures  displays  shelving and storage products atv  rv and snowmobile accessories currently  our wire mills use over  tons of steel rod each year 
in  we acquired the assets of a steel rod mill in sterling  illinois  which is expected to provide a more consistent supply of quality steel rod for the industrial materials segment 
we expect the rod mill to produce about  tons annually  nearly all of which will be used by leggett businesses 
after the start up phase  the mill operated profitably during the second half of the mill produces only a few sizes and types of rod improving the mill s operating efficiency 
we plan to operate the mill s electric furnace which has a capacity of about one million tons during off peak times to reduce energy costs 
the mill is located near a steel scrap market that over the long term should provide consistent supply to the mill 
the rod mill is also located reasonably close to our wire mills 
in addition to supplying a portion of our own raw material needs  we sell drawn wire and welded steel tubing to a diverse group of industrial customers  including bedding and furniture makers automotive interior manufacturers 
table of contents lawn and garden equipment manufacturers recreational equipment eg atv and rv producers mechanical spring makers we also produce specialty wire products such as wire ties used by cotton gins to tie bales of cotton wire tying heads used by waste recyclers and solid waste removal businesses to bale materials shaped wire used by automotive companies and medical supply businesses key strategies the core strategy of our wire and tubing businesses is to efficiently supply other leggett businesses raw material requirements 
we expect growth  to a large extent  will occur as our internal requirements expand  both domestically and abroad 
we also expect to grow as we work with customers on programs that improve their efficiency for example  packaging multiple components supplied by our other businesses 
finally  we will expand our capabilities to add value through the forming  shaping  and welding of our wire and tube 
this may occur through start up operations or acquisitions 
overview of the specialized products segment segment groups business units specialized products automotive automotive machinery machinery our specialized products segment manufactures components for the automotive industry and designs  builds and sells specialized machinery and equipment 
in the automotive group  we manufacture lumbar systems for automotive seating including manual  way power  way power  massage systems  and memory options seat suspension systems automotive control cable systems  such as shift cables  cruise control cables  seat belt cables  accelerator cables  seat control cables  and latch release cables primary customers for these products are automobile seating manufacturers 
in the machinery group  we primarily manufacture highly automated quilting machines for fabrics used to cover mattresses and other home furnishings coilers used to shape wire into various types of springs industrial sewing machines material handling systems wide format digital printing equipment other products for factory automation the primary customers for these products are bedding manufacturers 
we also design and produce some of these specialized products for our own use 

table of contents key strategies in our automotive group  we plan to continue the focus on research and development  looking for ways to improve the function and cost of our products 
the introduction of new capabilities and products creates the potential for us to expand into new markets 
growing our global presence to serve developing markets and to expand our sourcing options will remain a key objective  as will assisting our customers with vendor consolidation to reduce the complexity and cost of their supply chain 
our machinery group designs and manufactures equipment that is used to produce the proprietary innersprings we develop for our bedding customers 
in most cases  this equipment is not available in the marketplace 
providing this support is a critical strategy for our machinery operations  and also for our bedding operations 
in addition  we will continue striving to develop technology to improve efficiency in our own plants as well as those of our customers 
acquisitions and divestitures in the past years  approximately two thirds of our sales growth has come through acquisitions 
our typical acquisition is a small  private  profitable  entrepreneurial company 
our acquisition targets are usually either complementary to our existing businesses  or companies that allow us to secure quality raw material supply 
over the past ten years  the average acquisition target has had annual revenues between and million  making the risk from any single acquisition low 
in our history  we have completed only four acquisitions of businesses with annual sales greater than million 
we do not follow a fixed timetable for buying companies 
rather  we aim to be opportunistic by taking advantage of circumstances as they arise 
as a result  the pace and size of acquisitions in any given year could be significantly more or less than the average seen over the longer term 
in july  we completed our fourth largest acquisition in the history of the company  purchasing the assets of rhc spacemaster  one of our store fixture competitors 
we expect these operations to add at least million in annualized sales 
in total  we acquired businesses during representing approximately million in annualized sales 
the acquired businesses are expected to add annualized sales within our segments as follows residential furnishings million commercial fixturing components million specialized products million we also sold two businesses during  including one lumber company and one tubing fabrication facility 
annualized sales associated with the two divested businesses were approximately million

foreign operations the percentages of our trade sales from products manufactured outside the united states for the previous three years are shown in the table below 
year percent 
table of contents the majority of our international operations  measured by trade sales  are in canada  europe and mexico 
the canadian operations primarily manufacture innersprings for mattresses  fabricated wire for the bedding  furniture and automotive industries  and cut to size bed frame lumber 
we manufacture shelving for retailers  wire and steel storage systems and racks for the interior of service vans and utility vehicles  point of purchase displays for retailers  as well as chair frames and bases  table bases and office chair controls  and plastic injection moldings 
we also make lumbar supports for automotive seats and other automotive and furniture seat components 
our foreign operations in europe produce  among other things  innersprings for mattresses  fabric for industrial and residential uses  various wire products  office chair mechanisms and automotive lumbar seating systems 
we also sell machinery and equipment designed to manufacture innersprings for mattresses and other bedding related components 
finally  we have one operation in europe that designs and distributes point of purchase displays for retailers 
the mexican operations primarily manufacture innersprings and wire grid tops for mattresses  fabricated wire for the bedding industry  and fabric for industrial and residential uses 
we produce aluminum die castings and provide machining  sub assembly and other value added services related to aluminum die castings 
we also produce commercial shelving  material handling equipment  and automotive control cable systems 
we have an increasing asian presence 
prior to  we owned three production facilities in china 
two of these plants produce mattress innersprings for sale into the chinese market 
the third plant produces machinery and replacement parts for machines used in the bedding industry 
in  we began operations in our fourth plant  a facility to manufacture recliner mechanisms and various bases for upholstered furniture 
this plant has initially sold products to furniture manufacturers in china who produce upholstered furniture for export and to some leggett operations on an inter company basis  but will also position us to sell into the local market as the demand for furniture grows in china 
in  we also added four manufacturing facilities in china 
one facility produces small electric motors primarily used in lumbar systems for automotive seating 
another manufactures cables for these lumbar systems 
a third produces innersprings for mattresses and sofa cushions  while the fourth facility manufactures innersprings and bedding machinery 
we also purchased an assembler and distributor of automotive lumbar supports and seat suspension grids in south korea 
finally  our ornamental bed unit imports finished beds from asia for sale in the united states 
many other business units of the company have long standing  well established relationships with suppliers in asia for components and finished products 
our strategy regarding international expansion is two fold 
first  we are striving to find opportunities in countries to manufacture components and sub assemblies for a variety of our existing components customers 
second  we have pursued a strategy  establishing small operations in select countries where we believe we may expand as demand grows 
our international operations face the risks associated with any operation in a foreign state 
these risks include the nationalization of private enterprises political instability in certain countries differences in foreign laws that make it difficult to protect intellectual property and enforce contract rights credit risks 
table of contents increased costs due to tariffs  customs and shipping rates potential problems obtaining raw materials  including the availability of electricity  and shipping products during times of crisis or war foreign currency fluctuation such risks could result in increases in costs  reduction in profits  the inability to do business and other adverse effects

table of contents sales by product line the following table shows the approximate percentages of our sales to external customers by product line for the last three years product line bedding components residential furniture components finished consumer products other residential furnishing products store displays  fixtures storage products office furnishings plastic components aluminum products wire  wire products steel tubing automotive products specialized machinery distribution of products our products are sold and distributed primarily through the company s sales personnel 
however  many of our businesses have relationships and agreements with sales representatives and distributors 
we do not believe any of these agreements or relationships would  if terminated  have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition or results of operations of the company 
raw materials we use a variety of raw materials in manufacturing our products 
some of the most important raw materials include steel scrap steel rod woven and non woven fabrics aluminum angle iron coil and sheet steel rough green lumber textile scrap foam chemicals and foam scrap plastic resin the raw materials for many of our businesses are supplied by our own facilities 
for example  steel rod is used to produce steel wire  which we use to produce innersprings and box springs for mattresses  displays  shelving and racks for retail customers  and automotive seating systems 
our own wire drawing mills supply nearly all of our requirements for steel wire 
the steel rod produced at our rod mill in sterling  illinois currently supplies roughly half of our current rod requirements 
we also produce welded steel tubing and dimension lumber both for our own consumption and for sale to customers outside the company 
we believe that worldwide supply sources are available for all the raw materials used by the company 
however  the availability of steel is becoming an issue 
worldwide steel rod production capacity has been 
table of contents reduced in recent years due to bankruptcies of domestic steel producers 
at the same time  worldwide demand for steel is increasing  driving prices for steel scrap and rod significantly higher 
steel scrap and rod represent about of our steel purchases 
although some uncertainty over steel availability exists  we believe that we are better positioned than many of our competitors to secure supply because of our financial strength and purchasing leverage 
we have experienced higher raw material costs most notably steel during the past two years 
we purchase about million tons of steel annually  accounting for approximately of our cost of goods sold 
as of mid march  market prices for purchase of steel including scrap  rod  rolled and angle iron are running dollars per ton above prices seen during the summer of the majority of the increase in steel prices has occurred since november 
most steel vendors have rescinded previous contracts  and moved to day pricing 
the company has announced or implemented steel related price increases in most segments 
the future pricing of steel is uncertain  but could increase significantly in even beyond current levels 
the degree to which we are able to mitigate or recover these escalating costs is a significant factor influencing earnings 
customers we serve thousands of customers worldwide  sustaining many long standing business relationships 
no single customer accounted for more than five percent of the company s consolidated revenues in our top ten customers accounted for less than eighteen percent of the company s consolidated revenues in patents and trademarks leggett holds approximately  patents and has approximately in process for its various product lines 
we have registered over trademarks  with more than in process 
no single patent or group of patents  or trademark or group of trademarks  is material to our business as a whole 
examples of our most significant trademarks include semi flex  lok fast and dyna lock boxspring components and foundations mira coil  lura flex and superlastic mattress innersprings nova bond and rollout insulators for mattresses adjustamagic adjustable electric beds wallhugger recliner chairs super sagless motion and sofa sleeper mechanisms no sag sinuous wire tack jump and patternlink quilting machines hanes fiber materials schukra  pullmaflex and flex o lators automotive products masterack  amco and rhc spacemaster fixtures and displays spuhl mattress innerspring manufacturing machines gribetz and porter quilting and sewing manufacturing machines research and development we maintain research  engineering and testing centers in carthage  missouri  and also do research and development work at many of our other facilities 
we are unable to precisely calculate the cost of research and development because the personnel involved in product and machinery development also spend portions of their time in other areas 
however  we believe the cost of research and development was approximately million in  million in  and million in 
table of contents employees we have approximately  active employees  of which approximately  are engaged in production 
of the total active employees  roughly  are international employees 
approximately of our employees are represented by labor unions 
we did not experience any material work stoppage related to the negotiation of contracts with labor unions during management is not aware of any circumstances likely to result in a material work stoppage related to the negotiation of contracts with labor unions during the largest group of employees  approximately  works in the residential furnishings segment 
approximately  employees work in commercial fixturing components  while approximately  employees work in specialized products 
roughly  work in the aluminum products segment and approximately  are employed by our industrial materials segment 
competition many companies offer products that compete with those manufactured and sold by leggett 
the number of competing companies varies by product line  but the markets for our products are highly competitive in all aspects 
a number of our customers manufacture components similar to ours for their own use 
the primary competitive factors in our business include price  product quality and innovation  and customer service 
in certain of our markets a portion of us manufacturing is moving overseas 
we face increasing competition from foreign competitors  especially those in asia who supply component parts to our customers chinese and asian manufacturing facilities 
we have  and continue to develop  significant asian supply sources 
we also have  and continue to develop  a manufacturing presence in asia 
our asian facilities manufacture products for asian markets as well as for our customers in other parts of the world 
we believe we are the largest independent manufacturer in north america of the following components for residential furniture and bedding retail store fixtures and point of purchase displays components for office furniture non automotive aluminum die castings drawn steel wire automotive seat support and lumbar systems bedding industry machinery for wire forming  sewing and quilting seasonality our business is not significantly seasonal as a whole

table of contents environmental regulation the company s various operations are subject to federal  state  and local laws and regulations related to the protection of the environment 
environmental regulations include those relating to air and water emissions  underground storage tanks  waste handling  and the like 
we have established policies to ensure that our operations are conducted in keeping with good corporate citizenship and with a positive commitment to the protection of the natural and workplace environments 
while we cannot forecast policies that may be adopted by various regulatory agencies  management believes that compliance with these various laws and regulations will not have a material adverse effect on the competitive position  capital expenditures  consolidated financial condition or results of operations of the company 
capital expenditures for environmental control facilities were million in  million in and

introduction leggett platt is a fortune  global  multi industry  diversified manufacturer 
we conceive  design and produce a broad variety of engineered components and products that can be found in virtually every home  office  retail store  and automobile 
we provide very little product directly to consumers  but instead serve a broad array of manufacturers and retailers 
our products are often hidden within  and vital to  our customers products 
key attributes that contribute to our success include low cost operations  high quality products  vertical integration  innovation  customer service  financial strength  and long lived relationships with customers 
we are north america s leading independent manufacturer of a components for residential furniture and bedding  b retail store fixtures and point of purchase displays  c components for office furniture  d non automotive aluminum die castings  e drawn steel wire  f automotive seat support and lumbar systems  and g bedding industry machinery for wire forming  sewing and quilting 
our operations are influenced by broad economic factors including interest rates  housing turnover  employment levels  and consumer sentiment  all of which impact consumer spending on durable goods which drives demand for our components and products 
we are also impacted by trends in business capital spending  as about one third of our sales relates to this segment of the economy 
heading into  most of these indicators are favorable and improving 
performance in will be heavily influenced by three factors the amount of same location sales growth  our degree of success at recovering escalating steel and other raw material costs  and the extent of improvement in our fixture display operations 
management is devoting significant attention to these areas 
we are anticipating full year same location sales growth to accelerate  as typically occurs following economic downturns 
this expectation is heavily influenced by our strong fourth quarter sales  and the increased demand that our markets are currently experiencing 

table of contents steel prices are increasing rapidly as we enter this basic material represents nearly of our cost of goods sold 
demand for steel is high  and supply is tight  leading to sharp cost increases since last summer 
late in  we began passing along price increases to recover these costs 
improving performance of our fixture display operations is a high priority heading into these factors and others are discussed below 
results of operations discussion of consolidated results vs 
sales increased  and at billion  were a record for the company 
same location sales increased  or million  due to currency rate changes as overall volume was flat 
net earnings decreased  or million  to million 
factors contributing to this decline include the weakening of the us dollar against other major currencies about million after tax  increased energy costs about million after tax  and unusually high obsolete and slow moving inventory reserves about million after tax 
earnings also decreased from unabsorbed overhead in businesses with lower production levels  operating inefficiency in certain locations  and increased steel costs 
partially offsetting these negative factors were higher sales  lower restructuring costs million after tax  reduced bad debt expense million after tax  and income tax rate reductions 
the income tax rate reduction  from in to in  primarily resulted from the realization of foreign tax credit carryforwards 
vs 
earnings increased on essentially flat same location sales 
sales totaled billion  an increase of from same location sales increased  or million  for the full year 
net earnings increased million to million 
reduced expenses account for the bulk of the earnings improvement 
on january   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which required that goodwill no longer be amortized to earnings  but instead be tested periodically for impairment 
this change contributed about million to net earnings 
other cost decreases resulted from continuing improvements in operating efficiency  lower restructuring costs  and reduced expenses for energy about million after tax  bad debts million after tax  and interest million after tax 
higher raw material costs notably steel and stiff price competition in some business units partially offset these improvements 
major trends and uncertainties late in  leggett began experiencing rapid and significant steel cost increases  and these increases have accelerated in early as of mid march  market prices for purchase of steel including scrap  rod  rolled  and angle iron are running dollars per ton above prices seen during the summer of the majority of the increase in steel prices has occurred since november 
we purchase million tons of steel each year  accounting for nearly of our cost of goods sold 
cost increases of this magnitude significantly affect our profitability 
we have recently announced or implemented selling price increases in most segments to recover these higher costs 
the future pricing of steel is uncertain at this point 
the degree to which the company is able to mitigate or recover these escalating costs is a major factor impacting future results 
availability of steel is also becoming an issue 
worldwide steel production capacity declined in recent years due to bankruptcies of domestic steel producers 
at the same time  worldwide demand for steel is increasing  driving prices significantly higher 
although some uncertainty over steel availability exists  we believe we are 
table of contents better positioned than our competitors to secure supply 
steel scrap and rod represent about of our steel purchases this material is converted to wire  which is the raw material used by many of our operations 
half of the steel rod we use comes from our own mill  helping ensure supply 
in addition  our financial strength and purchasing leverage are advantages many of our competitors don t enjoy 
natural gas prices during were higher on average than in while we don t believe this rate of increase will continue  some uncertainty exists 
we ended with prices locked in on about of our domestic and canadian natural gas requirements through june these hedge prices averaged per mmbtu 
in certain of our markets  a portion of us manufacturing is moving overseas 
as that occurs  we must establish operations in new regions of the world to continue supplying our customers 
currently  the largest influence on our markets is coming from china 
at the end of  leggett operated eight chinese facilities 
generally  we can produce components at a lower cost in the us however  as our customers move the production of their finished products overseas  we must be located nearby to supply them efficiently 
in addition to our own facilities in china  we have strong relationships with many asian suppliers 
as we continue to expand internationally  more facilities are operated in foreign countries resulting in increased exposure to foreign currencies 
leggett currently hedges only a modest amount of these exposures with derivative instruments 
significant changes in the us dollar to foreign currencies could impact future results 
the recent weakening of the us dollar  primarily against the canadian dollar  contributed to s earnings decline 
some of our canadian operations sell to us customers in us dollars but incur their costs in canadian dollars 
these operations have experienced margin deterioration in price increases have been implemented in some of these operations  but us competitors  who are not experiencing this impact  make raising prices more difficult 
in october  we announced increased attention to our poorly performing fixture display operations 
this tactical plan aims to accomplish improved operating efficiency  better adherence to standard costs  tighter inventory controls  cost reductions  and more competent staffing 
the success of this plan could have a significant impact on future operating results 
additional comments regarding the impact of margin improvements in these businesses are included later in this discussion 
in the last half of  the company began to see improving trends in many of its businesses 
all five segments reported increases in same location sales in the fourth quarter  and we expect these improvements to continue in additional comments regarding these recent trends are included in the discussion of segment results that follows 
discussion of segment results a description of the products included in each segment  along with segment financial data  appear in note k of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
following is a comparison of ebit margins segment ebit divided by segment total sales residential furnishings commercial fixturing components aluminum products industrial materials specialized products 
table of contents residential furnishings vs 
sales increased  or million  as same location sales gained 
most operating units experienced a rebound in customer demand in the second half of the year 
full year improvements were reported in several categories  including upholstered furniture components  ornamental and adjustable beds  and carpet underlay 
sales from foreign operations also increased for the year  in part from currency impacts  as foreign currencies now convert to more us dollars 
these gains were partially offset by sales declines in our fiber operations 
sales in our us bedding components businesses also decreased for the full year due to weak demand in early beginning in june  demand improved and our bedding components operations posted growth during the second half of the year 
ebit decreased  or million  as higher steel and energy costs  impacts from the weaker us dollar  and unabsorbed overhead from lower production rates at us bedding components operations during the first half of the year more than offset the benefit from increased sales

ebit increased  or million  partially due to higher sales and cost improvement efforts 
sales of upholstered furniture components increased significantly  but these gains were tempered by flat sales in bedding and other product categories 
elimination of million of goodwill amortization  partial reversal of canadian lumber duty accruals  reduced bad debt expense  lower energy costs  and lower restructuring costs contributed to the ebit improvement 
higher raw material costs in steel  lumber and chemicals partially offset these improvements 
commercial fixturing components vs 
sales increased  or million  due to incremental sales from acquisitions  offset slightly by a decrease in same location sales 
although certain major retailers continued with new store openings and refurbishments in  most continued at reduced capital spending levels 
demand for office furniture components also remained at very low levels throughout however  modest improvements occurred in this market late in the year 
in july  we purchased the assets of rhc spacemaster  a producer of store fixtures 
this acquisition should add at least million to annual revenues and is expected to be modestly profitable in the first full year 
ebit for the segment decreased million  or  primarily due to inventory write downs  the weakening of the us dollar  higher steel costs  operational inefficiency  and price competition 
lower restructuring costs offset some of these negative factors 
in the third quarter of  the company announced a focused management effort to improve the operating efficiency and margins of the fixture display portion of this segment 
vs 
sales decreased as incremental sales from recent acquisitions were unable to overcome the  or million  decline in same location sales 
markets for both retail fixtures and office furniture components were down approximately from peak levels in however  the company gained market share in its fixture display business  owing in part to the financial difficulties of some competitors brought about by the tough conditions the industry faced in recent years

sales decreased million or 
same location sales increased  but three recent divestitures reduced sales by million 
no acquisitions were made during new programs for castings used in motorcycles  small engines  and large appliances represented the majority of the same location sales increase 
these gains were partially offset by a decline in sales of barbeque grill castings 
ebit increased million  or  partially due to same location sales growth 
lower restructuring and non recurring charges benefited ebit by approximately million  but were offset by an unfavorable change in sales mix 
vs 
sales increased million  or 
this gain reflected an increase in same location sales  partially offset by three divestitures 
there were no acquisitions during the year 
the same location sales growth was primarily attributable to new programs with existing and new customers  as overall market demand did not improve appreciably 
ebit increased  or million  primarily reflecting the same location sales increases 
cost management efforts  reduced goodwill amortization expense of million  and lower energy costs also benefited ebit 
these improvements were partially offset by restructuring costs of million and non recurring inventory and equipment obsolescence charges of million 
higher raw material cost and minor impacts from start up inefficiency associated with new business also reduced ebit 
the divestitures did not have a material impact on earnings 
industrial materials vs 
sales decreased  or million  reflecting a reduction in same location sales 
the sales decline resulted from weakness in many of our end markets  including wire demand from bedding manufacturers in the first half of  and tubing demand for atv s and accessories 
certain markets began to recover late in the year  and volumes improved  particularly in the wire drawing operations 
ebit decreased  or million  due to lower sales and production volume  and higher steel and energy costs 
these factors were partially offset by the elimination of start up costs associated with the sterling rod mill  lower restructuring charges  and a gain from the sale of a tubing fabrication business 
vs 
sales increased  primarily due to acquisitions  with same location sales increasing 
ebit declined  or million 
the majority of the ebit decline for the year resulted from increased steel prices 
these increases began in the second quarter as a result of tariffs imposed on foreign steel 
we experienced delays in implementing price increases in certain businesses  but by late  the majority of the increases had been passed along to customers 
additional ebit declines resulted from costs associated with the start up of the sterling rod mill and further restructuring efforts 
reduced bad debt expense and lower amortization benefited ebit slightly 
specialized products vs 
sales increased  or million  largely from a gain in same location sales 
new automotive programs  increased shipments of bedding machinery during the second half of  and currency rates positively impacted sales

vs 
sales increased  mainly from a increase in same location sales 
ebit increased million  or  due to higher automotive sales and elimination of million of goodwill amortization  partially offset by reduced sales volume in our machinery operations 
the strong performance of our automotive businesses was due primarily to additional market penetration and strong demand for lumbar and seat components 
critical accounting policies and estimates as more fully disclosed in note a of the notes to consolidated financial statements  we have adopted numerous accounting policies from among acceptable alternatives 
management must make many critical estimates or assumptions when preparing financial statements 
our major estimates and assumptions are discussed below 
the first group of comments addresses estimates that impact our earnings each year  and later  we identify and discuss major estimates that impact earnings less frequently 
the most critical estimates and assumptions impacting our ongoing results are credit losses costs related to worker s compensation  automobile  product and general liability  property  and medical programs inventory losses from obsolescence income taxes with respect to credit losses  our customers are diverse  but many are small to medium sized companies and some are highly leveraged 
bankruptcy can occur with some of these customers relatively quickly and with little warning  particularly in a changing economic environment  adding to the difficulty in estimating credit losses 
worker s compensation  automobile  product and general liability  property  and medical insurance costs may require an extended period after the actual loss occurred before the exact amount of the cost is known 
estimates of these costs over that period  which in some cases is several years  will vary from the final amount 
we carry insurance for individual losses that exceed a certain amount specified for each program 
changing customer specifications  technology  customer bankruptcy and other factors result in inventory losses that are difficult to estimate precisely 
at any financial statement date  the impact of these factors on inventory value may not be completely known 
income taxes are recorded by the company at rates in effect in the various tax jurisdictions in which it operates 
the company has tax loss carryforwards in certain jurisdictions and foreign tax credit carryforwards for us tax purposes 
valuation reserves are established against these future potential tax benefits based on management s estimate of their ultimate realization 
actual realization of these benefits may vary from management s estimates 
also  management has made certain assumptions about the distribution of earnings from subsidiaries which may not be accurate in the future  thereby affecting the tax impact of such earnings 
finally  ultimate resolution of issues raised by ongoing tax audits is not predictable and could affect the company s tax liabilities 
our accounting estimates of these costs and losses are based on available actuarial estimates  prior experience and close monitoring of each exposure 
we believe our reserves for these potential losses are adequate 

table of contents the next group of comments addresses estimates that may occasionally impact our earnings 
the most significant of these estimates are goodwill and asset impairments unusual litigation and claims plant restructurings and closings losses related to these items are recognized when specific facts which affect the estimate are known 
goodwill impairment is formally assessed annually  as required by sfas no 
 and also when we experience significant negative deviations from the assumptions underlying the fair market valuation of each reporting unit 
asset impairments are monitored by periodically focusing on underperforming locations with insufficient cash flows 
many assumptions about the future are necessary in the determination of fair market value for each of our eleven reporting units as defined by sfas no 

the key assumptions are discount rate  organic sales growth  ebit margins  capital expenditure requirements  and working capital requirements 
no goodwill impairment has been determined to date for any of our reporting units 
the key assumptions are re evaluated annually  or more frequently if significant changes become apparent  using management s most recent assessment of the performance potential of each reporting unit 
recent performance of the reporting unit is an important factor  but not the only factor  in management s annual assessment 
fair market values calculated for each reporting unit may go up or down each year based on a re evaluation of the key assumptions 
the company s fixture display operations have experienced deterioration in profitability over the past few years  in part due to external market factors  but also due to unsatisfactory internal performance 
the company is responding with a strategic initiative aimed at improving operating efficiency  integrating recent acquisitions  cutting costs  and restoring margins 
this endeavor may require changing the business model  raising prices or walking away from certain customer relationships  and shutting down or consolidating certain production facilities 
about million of the company s goodwill is associated with these operations 
in order to avoid possible future impairment of this goodwill  margins must improve 
the company has not recorded any significant losses for litigation and claims in the last three years  and management is not aware of any significant unrecorded exposures 
we record restructuring or plant closing losses when specific actions have been implemented and the liability incurred 
no significant income is reflected in the financial statements for the reversal of restructuring or plant closing losses accrued in a prior period 
capital resources and liquidity leggett serves a variety of industries that have different capital expenditure and working capital requirements 
we have sufficient capital resources to meet our current operating needs  and also to support future growth 
we attempt to achieve a balance between debt and equity  striving to minimize the total cost of capital  without excessive leverage 
leggett maintains a target for long term debt of of total capitalization 
short term liquidity we rely on cash flow from operations as our primary source of capital 
despite depressed net earnings for the last three years  we have been able to mitigate the impact on cash flow by reducing capital spending and acquisitions  and focusing on working capital management 
also  in we took advantage of historically low interest rates by issuing fixed rate debt with maturities of and years 
as a result  we have been able to increase cash and equivalents to a level that provides adequate liquidity to finance ongoing operations  pay down debt maturing in the near term  and fund a portion of our future growth 

table of contents cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million for  and  respectively 
the decrease in cash provided by operating activities during and compared to primarily reflects a slowing of working capital decreases  partially offset by increased earnings 
total working capital increased in  primarily from higher cash balances  currency impacts  and acquisitions 
year end accounts receivable increased due to strong december sales 
working capital levels vary by segment  with aluminum products and commercial fixturing components requirements generally higher than company averages 
accounts receivable balances in these segments are typically higher due to the longer credit and collection time required to service certain customers of the aluminum die casting and fixture display businesses 
these same businesses also require higher inventory investments due to the custom nature of their products  longer manufacturing lead times in certain cases  and the needs of many customers to receive large volumes of product within short periods of time 
total capitalization the following table shows leggett s total capitalization at the end of the three most recent years 
the table also shows the amount of unused committed credit available through our revolving bank credit agreements  current maturities of long term debt  the amount of cash and cash equivalents  and the ratio of earnings to fixed charges

table of contents this next table shows the calculation of long term debt as a percent of total capitalization  net of cash and current maturities  at december  and we believe that adjusting this measure for cash and current maturities more appropriately reflects financial leverage  since cash is readily available to repay debt 
these adjustments also enable meaningful comparisons to historical periods 
prior to the second quarter of  current debt maturities were essentially zero  and prior to the third quarter of  cash balances were much smaller 
dollar amounts in millions long term debt current debt maturities cash and cash equivalents net debt  after adjustments total capitalization current debt maturities cash and cash equivalents total capitalization  after adjustments debt to total capitalization before adjustments after adjustments total debt increased million from year end  primarily due to the issuance of million in year notes at a coupon rate in march  and the issuance of million in year notes at a coupon rate in june we issued this debt to take advantage of current low interest rates and to extend maturities 
these increases were offset by debt repayments of approximately million 
in the first quarter of  we also liquidated an interest rate swap agreement and received million in cash proceeds 
the proceeds from the notes and liquidation of the swap agreement will be used for repayment of existing debt approximately million comes due through the first quarter  stock repurchases  the financing of future acquisitions  and other general corporate purposes 
obligations having scheduled maturities are the primary source of leggett s debt capital 
at the end of  these obligations consisted primarily of our medium term notes 
our public debt currently carries a moody s rating of a and a standard poor s rating of a 
we have maintained an a rating on our debt for over a decade 
the secondary source of leggett s debt capital consists of a million commercial paper program supported by million in revolving credit agreements 
leggett has had no commercial paper outstanding during the last three years 
to further facilitate the issuance of debt capital  million remains available under our million shelf registration 
we believe that we have sufficient unused committed credit to ensure that future capital resources are adequate for our ongoing operations and growth opportunities 
additional details of long term debt are discussed in note f of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
uses of capital resources the company s investments to modernize and expand manufacturing capacity totaled million in the last three years 
in  management anticipates capital spending will approximate million  primarily for maintaining and expanding production capacity 
during the last three years  the company employed million of cash net of cash acquired in acquisitions 
in  businesses were acquired for million in 
table of contents cash net of cash acquired 
we also assumed million of acquired companies debt and other liabilities 
of the acquisitions in  nine should add about million in annual sales to residential furnishings  three should contribute approximately million to commercial fixturing components  and three should increase specialized products sales by around million 
additional details of acquisitions are discussed in note b of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
segment details are shown in note k of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
cash dividends on the company s common stock in the last three years totaled million and increased at an compounded annual rate 
our long term target for dividend payout is approximately one third of the prior three years average earnings 
calculated in the same manner as our target  dividend payout was in  in and in as earnings recover  we expect to move back toward the dividend payout target 
company purchases of its common stock net of issuances totaled million in  million in  and million in these purchases were made primarily to replace shares issued in employee stock plans 
each year  the board of directors authorizes management  at its discretion  to buy up to two million shares of leggett stock for use in employee benefit plans or for other purposes 
this authorization is continuously replenished as shares acquired are reissued 
in addition  management is authorized  again at its discretion  to repurchase any shares issued in acquisitions 
at the end of the third quarter  the board of directors authorized management to repurchase up to an additional million shares of leggett stock 
the board of directors has continued this authorization for an additional period expiring in september as of december   we had acquired approximately million shares under this authorization 
a specific repurchase schedule has not been established under this authorization 
the amount and timing of purchases will depend on economic and market conditions  acquisition activity  and other factors 
the following table summarizes leggett s future contractual obligations and commercial commitments payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years after years dollar amounts in millions long term debt operating leases purchase obligations other long term obligations total contractual cash obligations long term debt excludes million of market value adjustments related to interest rate swap agreements and includes million of capitalized leases 
the long term debt payment schedule presented above could be accelerated if the company was not able to make its principal and interest payments when due 
however  we believe we have sufficient capital resources to satisfy these obligations 
purchase obligations primarily include open short term days purchase orders that arise in the normal course of operating the company s facilities 
restructuring activity during  leggett divested two small operations  and closed or consolidated six other facilities 
results of operations for include charges of approximately million relating to these activities  offset by a 
table of contents million gain on the sale of a tubing fabrication business 
certain other facilities are currently being reviewed and may be consolidated or closed during we anticipate only modest restructuring charges from these activities  in line with those recognized the past few years 
during  we announced the divestiture or closure of seven operations 
three of these facilities were in the aluminum products segment  two were in commercial fixturing components  and two were in residential furnishings 
in september  we sold our remaining aluminum smelting facility and a tool die operation  and in november  we sold a small die casting plant 
leggett also announced the closing of two fixture display facilities  the largest of which served the telecom industry 
finally  we closed two fiber operations in our residential furnishing segment 
restructuring charges related to these activities totaled million 
during we closed or consolidated operations 
seven of these facilities were in residential furnishings  including four fiber operations  two foam businesses  and one small bedding components plant 
in commercial fixturing components  two fixture display operations were consolidated into other facilities  and another was sold 
a wire drawing plant in industrial materials was closed 
and finally  in specialized products  we closed a small automotive operation in europe 
restructuring charges totaled million in restructuring liabilities are not material to the company s balance sheet 
adjustments of previously established accruals relating to restructuring activities have been negligible 
seasonality the percent of consolidated net sales by quarter  excluding the impact of acquisitions  is as follows for the last three years first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter year the company does not experience significant seasonality  however  as indicated in the above table  quarter to quarter sales can vary in proportion to the total year by about 
the timing of acquisitions and economic factors in any year can distort the underlying seasonality in certain of our businesses 
in each of the three years presented  the economic slowdown impacted our various businesses and normal seasonality was likely somewhat distorted 
nevertheless  for the company as a whole  the second and third quarters have proportionately greater sales  while the first and fourth quarters are generally lower 
residential furnishings typically has the strongest sales in the second and third quarters due to increased consumer demand for bedding and furniture during the late summer and fall months 
commercial fixturing components generally has heavy third quarter sales of its store fixtures products  with the first and fourth quarters normally lower 
this aligns with the industry s normal construction cycle  and the opening of new stores and completion of remodeling projects in advance of the holiday season 
aluminum products sales are proportionately greater in the first two calendar quarters due to typically stronger spring and early summer demand for barbeque grills 
industrial materials sales peak in the third and fourth quarters from higher demand for bedding products and seasonal demand for wire ties used for baling cotton which is typically harvested in the early fall 
specialized products has relatively little quarter to quarter variation in sales  although the automotive business is somewhat heavier in the second and fourth quarters of the year and somewhat lower in the third quarter  due to model changeovers and plant shutdowns in the automobile industry during the summer
