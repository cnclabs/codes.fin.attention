item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations our current operations our operations consist of wholly owned casino resorts and investments in two other casino resorts  including las vegas  nevada bellagio  mgm grand las vegas  the mirage  ti  new york new york  boardwalk  and monte carlo owned 
other domestic the primm valley resorts buffalo bill s  primm valley resort and whiskey pete s in primm  nevada  beau rivage in biloxi  mississippi  mgm grand detroit  borgata owned in atlantic city  new jersey 
international mgm grand australia in darwin  northern territory  australia we operate in one segment  the operation of casino resorts  which includes offering gaming  hotel  dining  entertainment  retail and other resort amenities 
slightly over half of our net revenues are derived from gaming activities  a lower percentage than many of our competitors  as our operating philosophy is to provide a complete resort experience for our guests  including non gaming amenities which command a premium price based on their quality 
we generate a majority of our net revenues and operating income from our las vegas strip resorts 
in  over of our net revenues and operating income was generated by wholly owned las vegas strip resorts 
we believe that we own the premier casino resorts on the las vegas strip  and a main focus of our strategy is to continually reinvest in these resorts to maintain that competitive advantage 
our concentration on the las vegas strip exposes us to certain risks outside of our control  such as competition from other las vegas strip resorts  including a major new competitor expected to open in  and the impact from potential expansion of gaming in california 
this concentration also exposes us to risks related to tourism and the general economy  including national and global economic conditions and terrorist attacks or other global events 
key performance indicators as a resort based company  our operating results are highly dependent on the volume of customers at our resorts  which in turn impacts the price we can charge for our hotel rooms and other amenities 
we also generate a significant portion of our operating income from the high end gaming segment  which can cause variability in our results 
key performance indicators related to revenue are gaming revenue indicators table games drop and slot handle volume indicators  win or hold percentage  which is not fully controllable by us 
our normal table games win percentage is in the range of to of table games drop and our normal slot win percentage is in the range of to of slot handle  hotel revenue indicators hotel occupancy volume indicator  average daily rate adr  price indicator  revenue per available room revpar  a summary measure of hotel results  combining adr and occupancy rate 
most of our revenue is essentially cash based  through customers wagering with cash or paying for non gaming services with cash or credit cards 
our resorts  like many in the industry  generate significant operating cash flow 
our industry is capital intensive and we rely heavily on the ability of our resorts to generate operating cash flow to repay debt financing  fund maintenance capital expenditures and provide excess cash for future development 
our results of operations do not tend to be seasonal in nature  though a variety of factors can affect the results of any interim period  including the timing of major las vegas conventions  the amount and timing of marketing and special events for our high end customers  and the level of play during major holidays  including new year and chinese new year 

table of contents overall outlook we have invested heavily in our existing operations in and  and expect to continue to do so in our las vegas strip resorts require ongoing capital investment to maintain their competitive advantages 
we believe the investments in additional non gaming amenities we made in and our planned spending in will further position our resorts to capitalize on the expected continued economic recovery 
borgata  which opened in july  will have a more meaningful impact on our operating results in  given a full year of operations 
mgm grand detroit operates in an interim casino facility  and we have plans to develop a permanent casino resort  though our ability to do so is currently limited pending resolution of certain litigation 
we expect the permanent casino resort to cost approximately million  a significant amount of which may be invested in and we have made several strategic agreements to take advantage of currently proposed gaming law reforms in the united kingdom 
the timing of adoption of these reforms  if they are adopted at all  is uncertain 
however  we believe that the gaming market in the uk would be profitable assuming a reasonable tax and regulatory structure  and a market in which our style of resorts and our management expertise would provide us with a competitive advantage 
in january  we announced the proposed acquisition of wembley plc 
if completed  this acquisition would provide us with a gaming facility in rhode island  allowing us to further diversify into the northeast united states  a gaming market we consider to be under served 
wembley also owns several greyhound tracks in the united kingdom  which could provide sites for additional casino development  subject to the same risks and uncertainties as our other potential investments in the united kingdom 
we also own two premium casino development sites in existing markets  one on the las vegas strip between bellagio and monte carlo and one at renaissance pointe in atlantic city  adjacent to borgata 
the timing or extent of any development on these sites is uncertain 
summary financial results the following table summarizes our results of operations year ended december  percentage percentage change change in thousands  except per share data net revenues operating income income from continuing operations diluted income from continuing operations per share income from continuing operations decreased in due to lower operating income and higher interest expense resulting from lower capitalized interest and  to a lesser extent  increased borrowings 
our long term debt increased approximately  primarily in the fourth quarter  in order to fund capital investments and share repurchases 
in  income from continuing operations increased as a result of the significant one time expenses incurred in  along with stable payroll expenses as a result of restructuring activity in late and a significantly lower provision for doubtful accounts 
also contributing to the increase in was significantly lower interest expense  as variable interest rates decreased in and we reduced long term debt by approximately in results on a per share basis were positively impacted by a lower weighted average number of shares outstanding  particularly in this is the result of share repurchases throughout and 
table of contents operating results the following table includes key information about our operating results year ended december  percentage percentage change change in thousands net revenues operating expenses casino and hotel operations general and administrative corporate expense preopening  restructuring and property transactions  net depreciation and amortization income from unconsolidated affiliates operating income on a consolidated basis  the most important factors and trends contributing to our operating performance over the last three years have been the significant impacts of the attacks of september  business levels before the attacks were very strong  despite a weakening united states economy 
the impact of the attacks caused a significant drop in leisure travel and contributed to the weakening economy and stock market declines experienced in and into  the restructuring of operations in response to the attacks  which positively impacted operating results due to generally lower staffing levels  the war with iraq and the outbreak of sars in asia  both of which negatively impacted leisure travel and our high end gaming business in late and early  the new labor contract covering our las vegas strip employees since mid  which calls for significant annual wage and benefits increases through  the current economic recovery in the united states  which began to impact our operations in the latter half of and should continue to positively affect our results in as a result of the above trends  our net revenues increased in  including a higher percentage increase in the second half of the year  while increasing only in new york new york experienced a increase in net revenues due to the addition of zumanity  the newest show from cirque du soleil  which opened in august and other amenities  including a new irish pub  nine fine irishmen  which opened in july bellagio s revenues were flat despite the negative effects of sars and the iraq war in early and having of its standard rooms out of service in the fourth quarter 
bellagio s revpar increased for the year  but on a base of fewer rooms due to an ongoing project to remodel all of bellagio s standard rooms 
bellagio s other indicators were also strong  including a increase in slot revenues 
similarly  net revenues increased at mgm grand las vegas  with a higher rate of increase in the second half of due to increased non gaming spending and the addition of several new food and beverage outlets 
our operating income in decreased  due primarily to higher payroll and benefits expenses  which constitutes slightly over half of our casino and hotel operations and general and administrative expenses 
total payroll and benefits was up  largely due to a increase in health insurance costs  along with higher salaries and wages 
our contract with the culinary union covering approximately  of our las vegas employees became effective june  the contract calls for increases in wages and health and welfare contributions of per year over the five year term of the contract 
the increase in payroll and benefits was partially offset by higher income from unconsolidated affiliates after borgata opened in july 
table of contents operating income at bellagio decreased in due to the additional impact of the standard room remodel project 
new york new york s operating income increased as a result of the contribution of zumanity and other new amenities 
mgm grand las vegas experienced a decline in operating income in however  excluding restructuring charges related to restaurant leases  preopening and start up expenses related to new amenities  and property transactions related to the construction of a new theatre  this resort s operating income would have increased 
mgm grand las vegas results will benefit from the theatre  which will house a show by cirque du soleil opening in mid beau rivage s operating income increased significantly over due to the positive impact of a remodeled and expanded buffet as well as several other new restaurants opened during and the conversion of a floor of standard rooms into suites 
also  beau rivage recorded a charge of million in for property damage related to tropical storm isidore  while no such costs were incurred in corporate expense increased in due primarily to increased development activities and increased property taxes on the renaissance pointe land in atlantic city  new jersey 
in  our operating income increased 
a large factor in the increase was the significant one time expenses incurred in in relation to the september  attacks  including restructuring charges and asset impairment charges 
excluding the impact of these charges and preopening and start up expenses  operating income increased  largely due to stable payroll expenses as a result of restructuring activity in late  and a significantly lower provision for doubtful accounts 
operating results detailed revenue information the following table presents detail of our net revenues year ended december  percentage percentage change change in thousands casino revenues  net table games slots other casino revenues  net non casino revenue rooms food and beverage entertainment  retail and other non casino revenues less promotional allowances table games revenues decreased in  even with a slightly higher hold percentage  resulting from the impacts of the september attacks on our foreign high end customers and the impacts of the united states economy on our national customers 
table games revenues decreased in  as a slightly lower hold percentage and the impact of the iraq war and sars outbreak in early were not fully offset by strong volume levels over the latter half of slot revenues increased substantially in both and improvements were the result of enhanced marketing programs  the impact of our players club rewards program  which was implemented in our major resorts over and  and the implementation of cashless gaming technology in a majority of slot machines at our major resorts now offer ticket in  ticket out technology through international game technology s ez pay system 
slot win percentages were consistent among all three periods 
non casino revenue increased in primarily due to increased occupancy at our resorts  which also drives the level of spending at food and beverage  entertainment and retail outlets 
in addition  we were able to increase the pricing for our rooms and other non gaming amenities 
our hotel results began to improve notably in the latter half of  particularly at our las vegas strip resorts 
for the year ended december  revpar at our las vegas strip resorts was compared to in  an increase of

we expect preopening expenses to decrease in since there will be no preopening expenses related to borgata 
restructuring costs credit consisted of the following year ended december  in thousands contract termination costs september attacks siegfried roy show closure the mirage reversal of contract termination costs other in  our primary restructuring activities included closing two marketing offices and terminating the related leases  terminating a lease agreement with a restaurant tenant at mgm grand las vegas  and closing the siegfried roy show  which resulted in a charge for employee severance costs 
in december  we recorded a restructuring credit of million related to a lease contract termination accrual originally recorded in june as we determined that payment under this obligation was not probable 
we recorded million of restructuring charges in december related to contract termination costs for a restaurant lease and the efx show at mgm grand las vegas 
during the third and fourth quarters of  management responded to a decline in business volumes caused by the september attacks by implementing cost containment strategies which included a significant reduction in payroll and a refocusing of several of our marketing programs 
approximately  employees on a full time equivalent basis were laid off or terminated  resulting in a million charge against earnings  primarily related to the accrual of severance pay  extended health care coverage and other related costs in connection with these personnel reductions 
as a result of improving business levels and our success at re hiring a substantial number of previously laid off or terminated employees  management determined in the second quarter of that a portion of the remaining accrual was no longer necessary 
this resulted in a restructuring credit of million in property transactions  net consisted of the following year ended december  in thousands gain on sale of north las vegas land siegfried roy theatre write down the mirage write down of atlantic city boardwalk land held for sale tropical storm isidore damage beau rivage write off of detroit development costs impairment of assets to be disposed of demolition costs other net losses on asset sales or disposals 
table of contents in  we sold acres of land in north las vegas  nevada near shadow creek for approximately million  resulting in the million gain reflected above 
prior to  we classified gains and losses on routine assets sales or disposals as a non operating item at some resorts and as an operating item at other resorts 
we believe the preferable presentation of these items is as an element of operating income 
prior period statements have not been reclassified as such transactions were not material in the prior periods 
until  demolition costs were typically capitalized as part of new construction 
we began expensing demolition costs on major construction projects as incurred on january   and are accounting for this change in policy prospectively 
demolition costs were not material in prior periods 
demolition costs in relate to preparation for the bellagio standard room remodel  bellagio expansion and new theatre at mgm grand las vegas 
impairments of assets to be disposed of in consisted primarily of assets related to the former efx show and restaurants closed during at mgm grand las vegas 
in  tropical storm isidore caused property damage at beau rivage totaling million  including clean up costs 
the amount of the write down for damaged assets was determined based on the net book value of the assets and engineering estimates 
in connection with the revised development agreement in detroit  we wrote off million  which was the net book value of previously incurred development costs associated with the riverfront permanent casino site million  offset by previously accrued obligations no longer required under the revised development agreement million 
the write down of the atlantic city boardwalk land resulted from a reassessment of the fair value of the land subsequent to the september attacks 
the revised carrying value was based on comparable sales data adjusted for the impact of legislation authorizing large scale gaming in the state of new york  which we believe had a negative impact on real estate values on the atlantic city boardwalk 
the remaining charge of million relates to several assets abandoned during the quarter in response to the september attacks  primarily in progress construction projects which we terminated after the attacks 
non operating results the following table summarizes information related to interest on our long term debt year ended december  in thousands interest cost less capitalized interest interest expense  net cash paid for interest  net of amounts capitalized average total debt balance billion billion billion weighted average interest rate interest cost decreased in from due to lower debt balances in and lower market interest rates  which affect the rate we pay on our credit facilities 
interest capitalized declined from million in to million in  due to the lower debt balances and interest rates described above  and due to our october decision to suspend development of our wholly owned atlantic city development project 
capitalized interest decreased in due to the suspension of development in atlantic city in late and the mid cessation of interest capitalization on the company s investment in borgata  which opened on july  the following table summarizes information related to our income taxes year ended december  in thousands income from continuing operations before income tax income tax provision effective income tax rate cash paid for income taxes 
table of contents the effective income tax rate in was lower than in due to the reversal of certain tax reserves as a result of completion of irs audits for certain prior tax years and expiration of the irs statutes of limitations on other years 
excluding the reversal  our effective income tax rate was in both periods 
the decrease in our effective income tax rate in was the result of higher income before taxes 
the items causing a difference between the federal statutory rate and our effective income tax rate  primarily non deductible expenses and state and foreign income taxes  have not varied significantly between years 
in  taxes paid increased from prior years  primarily due to payments made to settle irs audits of prior years 
excluding these payments  our taxes paid have generally been significantly lower than our income tax provision 
this is primarily due to accelerated tax depreciation and the utilization of tax credits  primarily for alternative minimum tax paid in prior years 
we utilized the last of these credits in  and we expect that our cash paid for taxes will increase accordingly in liquidity and capital resources cash flows summary our cash flows consisted of the following year ended december  in thousands net cash provided by operations investing cash flows capital expenditures investments in unconsolidated affiliates other net cash used in investing activities financing cash flows net borrowing repayment under bank credit facilities issuance of long term debt purchase of treasury stock other net cash used in financing activities net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents cash flows operating activities trends in our operating cash flows tend to follow trends in our operating income  excluding non cash charges  since our business is primarily cash based 
cash flow from operations in decreased from  resulting from the decrease in operating income and higher cash paid for taxes 
in  cash flow from operations increased  but not to the same extent as operating income  primarily because operating income in included significant non cash charges 
at december  and  we held cash and cash equivalents of million and million 
we require a certain amount of cash on hand to operate our resorts 
beyond our cash on hand  we utilize a company wide cash management system to minimize the amount of cash held in banks 
funds are swept from accounts at our resorts daily into central bank accounts  and excess funds are invested overnight or are used to repay borrowings under our bank credit facilities

at december   the shelf registration statement has million in remaining capacity for the issuance of future debt or equity securities 
any future public offering of securities under the shelf registration statement will only be made by means of a prospectus supplement 
other factors affecting liquidity in january  we completed the sale of the golden nugget subsidiaries  resulting in net cash proceeds to us of million

off balance sheet arrangements our off balance sheet arrangements consist primarily of investments in unconsolidated affiliates  which currently consist of our investments in monte carlo and borgata 
we have not entered into any transactions with special purpose entities  nor have we engaged in any derivative transactions other than straightforward interest rate swaps 
our joint venture and unconsolidated affiliate investments allow us to realize the benefits of owning a full scale resort in a manner that minimizes our initial investment 
we have not guaranteed financing obtained by the ventures  nor are there any other provisions of the venture agreements which are unusual or subject us to risks to which we would not be subjected if we had full ownership of the resort

we have generated over million in operating cash flow in each of the past three years  which included deductions for interest payments  tax payments and certain contractually committed payments reflected in the above table  including operating leases  employment agreements and entertainment agreements 
we expect to generate a similar level of operating cash flow in assuming operating cash flow is used to fund the remaining contractual commitments of approximately million to million  we would have at least million of operating cash flow available for other planned expenditures

critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements 
to prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  we must make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements

allowance for doubtful casino accounts receivable marker play represents a significant portion of the table games volume at bellagio  mgm grand las vegas and the mirage 
our other facilities do not emphasize marker play to the same extent  although we offer markers to customers at those casinos as well  with the exception of mgm grand australia  where northern territory legislation prohibits marker play 
we maintain strict controls over the issuance of markers and aggressively pursue collection from those customers who fail to pay their marker balances timely 
these collection efforts are similar to those used by most large corporations when dealing with overdue customer accounts  including the mailing of statements and delinquency notices  personal contacts  the use of outside collection agencies and civil litigation 
markers are generally legally enforceable instruments in the united states 
at december  and  approximately and  respectively  of our casino accounts receivable was owed by customers from the united states 
markers are not legally enforceable instruments in some foreign countries  but the united states assets of foreign customers may be reached to satisfy judgments entered in the united states 
a significant portion of our casino accounts receivable is owed by casino customers from the far east 
at december  and  approximately and  respectively  of our casino accounts receivable was owed by customers from the far east 
we maintain an allowance  or reserve  for doubtful casino accounts at all of our operating casino resorts 
the provision for doubtful accounts  an operating expense  increases the allowance for doubtful accounts 
we regularly evaluate the allowance for doubtful casino accounts 
at resorts where marker play is not significant  the allowance is generally established by applying standard reserve percentages to aged account balances 
at resorts where marker play is significant  we apply standard reserve percentages to aged account balances under a specified dollar amount and specifically analyze the collectibility of each account with a balance over the specified dollar amount  based on the age of the account  the customer s financial condition  collection history and any other known information 
we also monitor regional and global economic conditions and forecasts to determine if reserve levels are adequate 

table of contents the collectibility of unpaid markers is affected by a number of factors  including changes in currency exchange rates and economic conditions in the customers home countries 
because individual customer account balances can be significant  the allowance and the provision can change significantly between periods  as information about a certain customer becomes known or as changes in a region s economy occur 
the following table shows key statistics related to our casino receivables at december  in thousands casino accounts receivable allowance for doubtful casino accounts receivable allowance as a percentage of casino accounts receivable median age of casino accounts receivable days days days percentage of casino accounts outstanding over days the allowance percentage increased in as a result of the impact of the september attacks on our customers traveling patterns and the global economy  as well as the impacts of declines in the united states stock markets through and during  the united states stock markets continued to decline  but we experienced better than anticipated receivable collections on certain customer accounts during  which resulted in a reversal of previously recorded bad debt provision in the third quarter of in the fourth quarter of we recorded an additional reversal of bad debt provision as we again experienced better than expected collections 
the current strength in the united states economy and recent united states stock market gains have also caused us to positively adjust our outlook on collectibility of domestic accounts receivable 
the above economic and collection trends are reflected in the improved quality of our receivables statistics in the above table 
our reserve percentage at december  is lower than it has been since the events of september   though still higher than the periods preceding september  at december   a basis point change in the allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of casino accounts receivable would change net income by million  or per share 
fixed asset capitalization and depreciation policies property and equipment are stated at cost 
maintenance and repairs that neither materially add to the value of the property nor appreciably prolong its life are charged to expense as incurred 
depreciation and amortization are provided on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
we account for construction projects in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for costs and initial rental operations of real estate projects 
when we construct assets  we capitalize direct costs of the project  including fees paid to architects and contractors  property taxes  and certain costs of our design and construction subsidiary  mgm mirage design group 
we must make estimates and assumptions when accounting for capital expenditures 
whether an expenditure is considered a maintenance expense or a capital asset is a matter of judgment 
when constructing or purchasing assets  we must determine whether existing assets are being replaced or otherwise impaired  which also may be a matter of judgment 
our depreciation expense is highly dependent on the assumptions we make about our assets estimated useful lives 
we determine the estimated useful lives based on our experience with similar assets  engineering studies  and our estimate of the usage of the asset 
whenever events or circumstances occur which change the estimated useful life of an asset  we account for the change prospectively 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 capitalization of interest cost sfas  interest cost associated with major development and construction projects is capitalized as part of the cost of the project 
interest is typically capitalized on amounts expended on the project using the weighted average cost of our outstanding borrowings  since we typically do not borrow funds directly related to a development project 
capitalization of interest starts when construction activities  as defined in sfas  begin and ceases when construction is substantially complete or development activity is suspended for more than a brief period 

table of contents whether we capitalize interest on a project depends in part on management s actions 
in january  we announced that our near term development focus would be on the atlantic city market 
as a result  we suspended the capitalization of interest on our las vegas strip project until the development process for that project is further advanced 
interest capitalized on this project was million in in october  we announced the suspension of development activities on our wholly owned project on the renaissance pointe land in atlantic city 
in connection with that announcement  we stopped capitalizing interest associated with the project 
interest capitalized on this project for the years ended december  and was million and million  respectively 
impairment of long lived assets we evaluate our property and equipment and other long lived assets for impairment in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 
for assets to be disposed of  we recognize the asset at the lower of carrying value or fair market value less costs of disposal  as estimated based on comparable asset sales  solicited offers  or a discounted cash flow model 
for assets to be held and used  we review for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist 
we then compare the estimated future cash flows of the asset  on an undiscounted basis  to the carrying value of the asset 
if the undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying value  no impairment is indicated 
if the undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the carrying value  then an impairment is recorded based on the fair value of the asset  typically measured using a discounted cash flow model 
if an asset is still under development  future cash flows include remaining construction costs 
all recognized impairment losses  whether for assets to be disposed of or assets to be held and used  are recorded as operating expenses 
there are several estimates  assumptions and decisions in measuring impairments of long lived assets 
first  management must determine the usage of the asset 
to the extent management decides that an asset will be sold  it is more likely that an impairment may be recognized 
assets must be tested at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows exist 
this means that some assets must be grouped  and management has some discretion in the grouping of assets 
future cash flow estimates are  by their nature  subjective and actual results may differ materially from our estimates 
on a quarterly basis  we review our major long lived assets to determine if events have occurred or circumstances exist that indicate a potential impairment 
we estimate future cash flows using our internal budgets 
when appropriate  we discount future cash flows using our weighted average cost of capital  developed using a standard capital asset pricing model 
whenever an impairment loss is recorded  or a test for impairment is made  we discuss the facts and circumstances with the audit committee 
see results of operations for discussion of write downs and impairments recorded in  and in october  we announced the temporary suspension of our development activities on our wholly owned project on the renaissance pointe land in atlantic city 
in connection therewith  we reviewed the land for potential impairment  and determined no impairment was indicated 
in december  in connection with our agreement with turnberry associates whereby we are required to contribute land to the venture  we reviewed the land for potential impairment  and determined no impairment was indicated 
in june  we entered into an agreement to sell the golden nugget subsidiaries 
the fair value less costs to sell exceeds the carrying value  therefore no impairment was indicated 
in february  we entered into an agreement to sell mgm grand australia 
the fair value less costs to sell exceeds the carrying value  therefore no impairment was indicated 
other than the above items  we are not aware of events or circumstances that would cause us to review any material long lived assets for impairment 
income taxes we are subject to income taxes in the united states  and in several states and foreign jurisdictions in which we operate 
we account for income taxes according to statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas 
sfas requires the recognition of deferred tax assets  net of applicable reserves  related to net operating loss carryforwards and certain temporary differences 
the standard requires recognition of a future tax benefit to the extent that realization of such benefit is more likely than not 
otherwise  a valuation allowance is applied 

table of contents at december   we had million of deferred tax assets and billion of deferred tax liabilities 
except for certain new jersey state net operating losses and certain other new jersey state deferred tax assets  we believe that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets are fully realizable because of the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences and future projected taxable income 
the valuation allowance at december  related to the new jersey deferred tax assets was million 
our income tax returns are subject to examination by the internal revenue service irs and other tax authorities 
we regularly assess the potential outcomes of these examinations in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and our income tax liabilities 
to determine necessary reserves  we must make assumptions and judgments about potential actions by taxing authorities  partially based on past experiences 
our estimate of the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental  and we believe we have adequately provided for any reasonable and foreseeable outcomes related to uncertain tax matters 
when actual results of tax examinations differ from our estimates  we adjust the income tax provision and our tax reserves in the period in which the examination issues are settled 
in december  we settled the irs audit of the company s and tax returns  which did not result in a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
during  we filed amended returns for tax years subsequent to to reflect the impact of the irs audits of the through tax years on those subsequent years 
in the fourth quarter of  the statutes of limitations expired for the through tax years  resulting in a reduction of our tax reserves of million and a corresponding reduction in our provision for income taxes 
the tax returns for years after are subject to possible future examination 
a portion of our tax reserves was assumed in the mirage acquisition 
the irs audit of the tax returns of mirage through the merger date was settled in august  resulting in a payment to the irs of million  including interest 
these matters had been previously reserved for  so the settlement had no impact on our income tax provision or our results of operations 
any future adjustments to the acquired mirage tax reserves will be recorded as an adjustment to goodwill 
accounting principles adopted in classification of gains and losses as extraordinary items in april  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 rescission of fasb statements   and  amendment of fasb statement  and technical corrections as of april sfas 
the key provision of sfas that affects us rescinds the existing rule that all gains or losses from the extinguishment of debt should be classified as extraordinary items 
instead  such gains and losses must be analyzed to determine if they meet the criteria for extraordinary item classification based on the event being both unusual and infrequent 
we adopted sfas beginning january  prior period losses were analyzed to determine if they met the criteria to be classified as extraordinary items 
our prior period losses were reclassified as an element of income from continuing operations 
costs associated with exit or disposal activities in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas 
sfas requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan  as previously required under eitf issue examples of costs covered by the standard include lease termination costs and certain employee severance costs associated with a restructuring  discontinued operation  plant closing  or other exit or disposal activity 
sfas is to be applied prospectively to exit or disposal activities initiated after december  we adopted sfas beginning january  the adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
the time between our commitment to an exit or disposal plan and when costs are actually incurred is typically short 

table of contents guarantee obligations in november  the fasb issued its interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin 
fin requires that future guarantee obligations be recognized as liabilities at inception of the guarantee contract 
it also increases the disclosures required for current and future guarantee obligations 
we have included the disclosures required by fin in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements 
we adopted the initial recognition provisions of fin beginning january  the adoption of this interpretation did not have a material impact on our results of operation or financial position 
stock based compensation in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure sfas 
sfas increases the disclosure requirements for companies which do not voluntarily adopt the fair value based accounting for employee stock compensation prescribed in statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation on a retroactive basis 
sfas also requires companies to present the pro forma disclosures in interim financial statements 
we have included the annual disclosures required by sfas in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements  and began presenting the required interim disclosures in recently issued accounting standards there are no accounting standards issued before december  but effective after december  which are expected to have a material impact on our financial reporting 
market risk market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 
our primary exposure to market risk is interest rate risk associated with our long term debt 
we attempt to limit our exposure to interest rate risk by managing the mix of our long term fixed rate borrowings and short term borrowings under our bank credit facilities and commercial paper program 
in the third quarter of  we entered into three interest rate swap agreements  designated as fair value hedges  which effectively convert million of our fixed rate debt to floating rate debt 
under the terms of these agreements  we make payments based on specified spreads over six month libor  and receive payments equal to the interest payments due on the fixed rate debt 
the interest rate swap agreements qualify for the shortcut method allowed under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 which allows an assumption of no ineffectiveness in the hedging relationship 
as such  there is no income statement impact from changes in the fair value of the hedging instruments 
the following table provides information about our interest rate swaps as of december  maturity date august  february  notional value million million estimated fair value average pay rate average receive rate interest rates are determined in arrears 
these rates have been estimated based on implied forward rates in the yield curve 
as of december   after giving effect to the interest rate swaps discussed above  long term fixed rate borrowings represented approximately of our total borrowings 
assuming a basis point change in libor  our annual interest cost would change by approximately million
