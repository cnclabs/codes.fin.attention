discussion of critical accounting policies in the ordinary course of business  we have made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of results of operations and financial condition in the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that the following discussion addresses our critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition 
valuation of inventory we value our inventories at the lower of cost or market using the weighted average cost method that approximates the first in  first out fifo method 
management has evaluated the current level of inventories in comparison to planned sales volume and other factors and  based on this evaluation  has recorded adjustments to inventory and cost of goods sold for estimated decreases in inventory value 
these adjustments are estimates  which could vary significantly  either favorably or unfavorably  from actual results if future economic conditions  consumer demand and competitive environments differ from our expectations 
we are not aware of any events or changes in demand or price that would indicate to us that our inventory valuation may be materially inaccurate at this time 
valuation of long lived assets long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to future net cash flows estimated by us to be generated by these assets 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
we are not aware of any events or changes in circumstances that would indicate to us that our long lived assets are impaired or that would require an impairment consideration at this time 

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth selected items from our statements of operations as a percentage of our net sales for the periods indicated fiscal year statement of operations data net sales costs of sales gross profit selling and administrative litigation settlement depreciation and amortization operating income premium discount and unamortized financing fees related to redemption of debt interest expense  net income before income tax expense income tax expense net income fiscal compared to fiscal net sales 
net sales increased by million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this growth reflected an increase of million in same store sales and an increase of million in new store sales  which resulted from the opening of new stores during fiscal and new stores during fiscal the remaining variance was attributable to net sales from closed stores 
same store sales increased for fiscal versus fiscal the increase in same store sales was primarily attributable to higher sales in each of our three major product categories of footwear  hard goods and apparel

gross profit increased by million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal gross profit margin was in fiscal compared to in fiscal we were able to achieve higher gross profit margins primarily due to improved selling margins in each of our three major product categories  partially offset by a increase in occupancy and distribution center costs when measured as a percentage of sales 
selling and administrative 
selling and administrative expenses increased by million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase was driven by a million increase in store related expenses primarily resulting from the need to support our store growth  increased employee health benefit costs  increased workers compensation costs and higher credit and debit card fees related to increased use of credit and debit cards by our customers 
our advertising expenses increased by million due to our store growth and a printing cost credit recorded in the third quarter of fiscal during fiscal  legal  audit  and public liability insurance  including directors and officers insurance  increased by million versus fiscal largely as a result of our public company reporting requirements after our ipo in these absolute and percentage increases in selling and administrative expenses were not as high as they otherwise might have been  because during fiscal we incurred expenses in connection with our ipo

provision for income taxes was million for fiscal and million for fiscal the company accrues taxes at the statutory tax rate  which is reevaluated on an ongoing basis by management

gross profit increased by million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal gross profit margin was in fiscal compared to in fiscal we were able to achieve higher gross profit margins primarily due to improved selling margins in the majority of our product categories  including favorable comparisons throughout our footwear and apparel categories 
improved margins in our skate category after the sale of excess scooter inventory in fiscal was the primary factor resulting in improved margins in our hard goods categories 

table of contents selling and administrative 
selling and administrative expenses increased by million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase was primarily due to a million increase in store related expenses associated with supporting increased sales  new store openings and increased employee health benefit costs and increased expenses due to electric utility rate increases in our california markets 
other factors impacting the increase included an increase of million in advertising costs that resulted primarily from advertising expenditures for the new stores opened in and the new stores opened in and higher insurance related costs of million primarily related to increased directors and officers insurance premiums after our ipo

interest expense  net included expenses related to those senior discount notes of million in fiscal versus million in fiscal income taxes 
provision for income taxes was million for fiscal and million for fiscal our effective income tax rate was for fiscal and for fiscal the effective rate is subject to ongoing evaluation by management 
liquidity and capital resources our principal liquidity requirements are for working capital and capital expenditures 
we fund our liquidity requirements with cash flow from operations and borrowings under our credit facility 
net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal was million  million and million  respectively 
the increases for fiscal versus fiscal and fiscal versus fiscal primarily reflected increased net income after adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities which was partially offset by increased working capital requirements between periods 

table of contents capital expenditures for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal were million  million  and million  respectively 
we expect capital expenditures for fiscal to range from to million 
we expect to spend to million primarily to fund the opening of approximately to new stores  store improvements and remodelings  warehouse and headquarters improvements and computer hardware and software expenditures 
in addition  we anticipate spending approximately to million of the anticipated million of total capital spending requirements for our planned new distribution center  which is expected to be operational in to months 
net cash used in financing activities in fiscal was million versus net cash used in financing activities of million in fiscal and million in fiscal as of december   we had borrowings of million and letter of credit commitments of million outstanding under our revolving credit facility and million of our senior notes outstanding 
these balances compare to borrowings of million and letter of credit commitments of million outstanding under our credit facility and million of our senior notes outstanding as of december  as of december   we had borrowings of million and letter of credit commitments of million outstanding under our credit facility  million of our senior notes outstanding and million of our senior discount notes outstanding 
we redeemed million face value of our senior notes in the first quarter of fiscal  and million face value in the fourth quarter of fiscal using borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
we repurchased million face value of our senior notes and million face value of our senior discount notes during the first quarter of and wholly redeemed the remainder of our senior discount notes following the consummation of our ipo during the third quarter of fiscal we repurchased an additional million of our senior notes during the last quarter of fiscal during fiscal we repurchased million face value of our senior discount notes 
we had cash of million  million and million at december   december   and december  respectively 
we believe we will be able to fund our future cash requirements for operations from operating cash flows  cash on hand and borrowings under our credit facility 
we believe these sources of funds will be sufficient to continue our operations and planned capital expenditures and satisfy our scheduled payments under debt obligations for at least the next twelve months 
however  our ability to satisfy such obligations depends upon our future performance  which in turn is subject to general economic conditions and regional risks  and to financial  business and other factors affecting our operations  including factors beyond our control 
see risk factors 
our principal future obligations and commitments as of december   excluding periodic interest payments  include the following payments due by period total year years years after years in thousands long term debt operating lease commitments revolving credit facility letters of credit total long term debt consists of our senior notes that mature on november  we expect to repay our senior notes by the maturity date using a combination of drawings under our credit facility  an expansion or replacement of our credit facility and the issuance of debt or equity securities 
the senior notes are general unsecured obligations  which rank senior in right of payment to all of our existing and future subordinated indebtedness and pari passu in right of payment with all of our current and future unsubordinated indebtedness  subject to the security interests that have been granted in substantially all of our assets in connection with our credit facility 

table of contents operating lease commitments consist principally of leases for our retail store facilities  distribution center and corporate offices 
these leases frequently include options which permit us to extend the terms beyond the initial fixed lease term 
we intend to renegotiate those leases as they expire 
payments for these lease commitments are provided for by cash flows generated from operations 
we had a non amortizing million revolving credit facility  which was amended and restated in the first quarter of fiscal to a three year non amortizing million revolving credit facility 
the credit facility may be terminated by the lenders by giving at least days prior written notice before any anniversary date  commencing with its anniversary date on march  we may terminate the credit facility by giving at least days prior written notice  provided that if we terminate prior to march   we must pay an early termination fee 
unless it is terminated  the credit facility will continue on an annual basis from anniversary date to anniversary date beginning on march  the facility is secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all of our assets 
the credit facility bears interest at various rates based on our performance  with a floor of libor plus or the jp morgan chase bank prime lending rate and a ceiling of libor plus or the jp morgan chase bank prime lending rate plus and is secured by trade accounts receivable  merchandise inventory and general intangible assets including trademarks and trade names 
at december   loans under the credit facility bear interest at a rate of libor at december  plus or the jp morgan chase bank prime lending rate at december  
an annual fee of  payable monthly  is assessed on the unused portion of the amended and restated credit facility 
on december   we had million in libor and prime lending rate borrowings and letters of credit of million outstanding 
our maximum eligible borrowing available under the credit facility is limited to of the aggregate value of eligible inventory during november through february and of the aggregate value of eligible inventory during the remaining months of the year 
available borrowings over and above actual libor and prime rate borrowings and letters of credit outstanding on the credit facility amounted to million at december  our credit facility and the indenture governing our senior notes contain various financial and other covenants  including covenants that require us to maintain various financial ratios  restrict our ability to incur indebtedness or to create various liens and restrict the amount of capital expenditures that we may incur 
our credit facility and the indenture governing our senior notes also restrict our ability to engage in mergers or acquisitions  sell assets or pay dividends 
we are currently in compliance with all covenants under our credit facility and the indenture governing our senior notes 
if we fail to make any required payment under our credit facility or the indenture governing our senior notes or if we otherwise default under these instruments  our debt may be accelerated under these instruments 
this acceleration could also result in the acceleration of other indebtedness that we may have outstanding at that time 
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to meet our obligations and commitments  we will be required to refinance or restructure our indebtedness or raise additional debt or equity capital 
additionally  we may be required to sell material assets or operations or delay or forego expansion opportunities 
we might not be able to effect these alternative strategies on satisfactory terms  if at all 
seasonality we experience seasonal fluctuations in our net sales and operating results 
in fiscal  we generated of our net sales and of our operating income in the fourth fiscal quarter  which includes the holiday selling season as well as the peak winter sports selling season 
as a result  we incur significant additional expenses in the fourth fiscal quarter due to higher purchase volumes and increased staffing 
if we miscalculate the demand for our products generally or for our product mix during the fourth fiscal quarter  our net sales could decline  resulting in excess inventory  which could harm our financial performance 
because a substantial portion of our operating income is derived from our fourth fiscal quarter net sales  a shortfall in expected fourth fiscal quarter net sales could cause our annual operating results to suffer significantly

forward looking statements this document includes certain forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of such forward looking statements relate to  among other things  our financial condition  our results of operations  our growth strategy and the business of our company generally 
in some cases  you can identify such statements by terminology such as may  will  should  expects  plans  anticipates  believes  intends or other such terminology 
these forward looking statements involve risks  uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results in future periods to differ materially from forecasted results 
these risks and uncertainties include  without limitation  the risk factors set forth below and elsewhere in this report and other risks and uncertainties more fully described in our other filings with the securities and exchange commission 
we caution that the risk factors set forth in this report are not exclusive 
we disclaim any obligation to revise or update any forward looking statement that may be made from time to time by us or on our behalf 
risk factors that may affect future results and market price of our common stock set forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents we file with the securities and exchange commission are risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward looking statements contained in this report 
risks related to our business we are highly leveraged  future cash flows may not be sufficient to meet our obligations and we might have difficulty obtaining more financing 
we have a substantial amount of debt 
as of december   the aggregate principal amount of our outstanding indebtedness was approximately million 
our highly leveraged financial position means a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations will be required to service our indebtedness  our ability to obtain financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures and general corporate purposes might be impeded  and we are more vulnerable to economic downturns and our ability to withstand competitive pressures is limited 
if our business declines  our future cash flow might not be sufficient to meet our obligations and commitments 
if we fail to make any required payment under our credit facility or indenture  our debt may be accelerated under these instruments 
in addition  in the event of bankruptcy or insolvency or a material breach of any covenant contained in one of our debt instruments  our debt may be accelerated 
this acceleration could also result in the acceleration of other indebtedness that we may have outstanding at that time 

table of contents if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to meet our obligations and commitments  we will be required to refinance or restructure our indebtedness or raise additional debt or equity capital 
additionally  we may be required to sell material assets or operations or delay or forego expansion opportunities 
these alternative strategies might not be effected on satisfactory terms  if at all 
the terms of our debt instruments impose operating and financial restrictions on us  which may impair our ability to respond to changing business and economic conditions 
the terms of our debt instruments impose operating and financial restrictions on us  including  among other things  restrictions on our ability to incur additional indebtedness  create or allow liens  pay dividends  engage in mergers  acquisitions or reorganizations or make specified capital expenditures 
for example  our ability to engage in the foregoing transactions will depend upon  among other things  our level of indebtedness at the time of the proposed transaction and whether we are in default under our financing agreements 
as a result  our ability to respond to changing business and economic conditions and to secure additional financing  if needed  may be significantly restricted  and we may be prevented from engaging in transactions that might further our growth strategy or otherwise benefit us without obtaining consent from our lenders 
in addition  our credit facility is secured by a first priority security interest in our trade accounts receivable  merchandise inventories  service marks and trademarks and other general intangible assets  including trade names 
in the event of our insolvency  liquidation  dissolution or reorganization  the lenders under our debt instruments would be entitled to payment in full from our assets before distributions  if any  were made to our stockholders 
if we are unable to successfully implement our controlled growth strategy or manage our growing business  our future operating results could suffer 
one of our strategies includes opening profitable stores in new and existing markets 
our ability to successfully implement our growth strategy could be negatively affected by any of the following suitable sites may not be available for leasing  we may not be able to negotiate acceptable lease terms  we might not be able to hire and retain qualified store personnel  and we might not have the financial resources necessary to fund our expansion plans 
in addition  our expansion in new and existing markets may present competitive  distribution and merchandising challenges that differ from our current challenges 
these potential new challenges include competition among our stores  added strain on our distribution center  additional information to be processed by our management information systems and diversion of management attention from ongoing operations 
we face additional challenges in entering new markets  including consumers lack of awareness of us  difficulties in hiring personnel and problems due to our unfamiliarity with local real estate markets and demographics 
new markets may also have different competitive conditions  consumer tastes and discretionary spending patterns than our existing markets 
to the extent that we are not able to meet these new challenges  our net sales could decrease and our operating costs could increase 
because our stores are concentrated in the western united states  we are subject to regional risks 
our stores are located in the western united states 
because of this  we are subject to regional risks  such as the economy  weather conditions  power outages  electricity costs and earthquakes and other natural disasters specific to the states in which we operate 
for example  particularly in southern california where we have a high concentration of stores  seasonal factors such as unfavorable snow conditions  such as those that occurred in the winter of  inclement weather or other localized conditions such as flooding  fires such as the major fires in  earthquakes or electricity blackouts could harm our operations 
state and local regulatory compliance  such as the recent rise in california s workers compensation costs  also can impact our financial results 
if the region were to suffer an economic downturn or other adverse regional event  our net sales and profitability and our ability to implement our planned expansion program could suffer 

table of contents several of our competitors operate stores across the united states and thus are not as vulnerable to these regional risks 
if we lose key management or are unable to attract and retain the talent required for our business  our operating results could suffer 
our future success depends to a significant degree on the skills  experience and efforts of steven g 
miller  our chairman  president and chief executive officer  and other key personnel who are not obligated to stay with us 
the loss of the services of any of these individuals could harm our business and operations 
in addition  as our business grows  we will need to attract and retain additional qualified personnel in a timely manner and develop  train and manage an increasing number of management level sales associates and other employees 
competition for qualified employees could require us to pay higher wages and benefits to attract a sufficient number of employees  and increases in the federal minimum wage or other employee benefits costs could increase our operating expenses 
if we are unable to attract and retain personnel as needed in the future  our net sales growth and operating results may suffer 
our hardware and software systems are vulnerable to damage that could harm our business 
our success  in particular our ability to successfully manage inventory levels  largely depends upon the efficient operation of our computer hardware and software systems 
we use management information systems to track inventory information at the store level  communicate customer information and aggregate daily sales information 
these systems and our operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquake  fire  flood and other natural disasters  power loss  computer systems failures  internet and telecommunications or data network failure  operator negligence  improper operation by or supervision of employees  physical and electronic loss of data or security breaches  misappropriation and similar events  and computer viruses 
any failure that causes an interruption in our operations or a decrease in inventory tracking could result in reduced net sales and profitability 
if our suppliers do not provide sufficient quantities of products  our net sales and profitability could suffer 
we purchase merchandise from over vendors 
although we did not rely on any single vendor for more than of our total purchases during the fiscal year ended december   our dependence on principal suppliers involves risk 
our largest vendors collectively accounted for of our total purchases during the fiscal year ended december  if there is a disruption in supply from a principal supplier or distributor  we may be unable to obtain merchandise that we desire to sell and that consumers desire to purchase 
in addition  a significant portion of the products that we purchase  including those purchased from domestic suppliers  are manufactured abroad 
a vendor could discontinue selling products to us at any time for reasons that may or may not be in our control 
our net sales and profitability could decline if we are unable to promptly replace a vendor who is unwilling or unable to satisfy our requirements with a vendor providing equally appealing products 
because all of our stores rely on a single distribution center  any disruption could reduce our net sales 
we currently rely on a single distribution center in fontana  california 
any natural disaster or other serious disruption to this distribution center due to fire  earthquake or any other cause could damage a significant portion of our inventory and could materially impair both our ability to adequately stock our stores and our net sales and profitability 
if the security measures used at our distribution center do not prevent inventory theft  our gross margin may significantly decrease 
in august  we entered into a two year lease for an additional  square foot satellite distribution center to handle seasonal merchandise and returns 
we recently extended the lease on the satellite distribution center until the end of february in addition  
table of contents because of limited capacity at the current distribution center  we will need to build a replacement distribution center in the next to months 
any disruption to  or delay in  this process could harm our future operations 
because equity owners of a significant stockholder of one of our competitors serve on our board of directors and the board of directors of such competitor  there may be conflicts of interest 
green equity investors  lp  an affiliate of leonard green partners  lp  holds approximately of the outstanding common stock of the sports authority  inc  one of our competitors 
john g 
danhakl  an equity owner of leonard green partners  lp  currently serves on our board of directors 
jonathan d 
sokoloff  an equity owner of leonard green partners  lp and a former member of our board of directors  currently serves on the sports authority  inc s board of directors 
mr 
danhakl may have conflicts of interest with respect to certain matters affecting us  including the pursuit of certain business opportunities presented to leonard green partners  lp all potential conflicts may not be resolved in a manner that is favorable to us 
we believe it is impossible to predict the precise circumstances under which future potential conflicts may arise and therefore intend to address potential conflicts on a case by case basis 
under delaware law  directors have a fiduciary duty to act in good faith and in what they believe to be in the best interest of the corporation and its stockholders 
such duties include the duty to refrain from impermissible self dealing and to deal fairly with respect to transactions in which the directors  or other companies with which such directors are affiliated  have an interest 
recently enacted and proposed changes in securities laws and regulations are likely to increase our costs 
the sarbanes oxley act of the act that became law in july  as well as new rules and regulations subsequently implemented by the securities and exchange commission the sec  have required and will require changes in some of our corporate governance practices 
the act also requires the sec to promulgate additional new rules on a variety of subjects 
in addition to final rules and rule proposals already made by the sec  nasdaq has proposed revisions to its requirements for companies that are quoted on the nasdaq stock market  inc s national market 
we expect these new rules and regulations to increase our legal and financial compliance costs and to make some activities more difficult  time consuming and or costly 
we also expect these new rules and regulations to make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance  and we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage 
these new rules and regulations could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors  particularly to serve on our audit committee  and qualified executive officers 
risks related to our industry a downturn in the economy may affect consumer purchases of discretionary items  which could reduce our net sales 
in general  our sales represent discretionary spending by our customers 
discretionary spending is affected by many factors  including  among others  general business conditions  interest rates  inflation  consumer debt levels  the availability of consumer credit  taxation  electricity power rates  unemployment trends and other matters that influence consumer confidence and spending 
our customers purchases of discretionary items  including our products  could decline during periods when disposable income is lower or periods of actual or perceived unfavorable economic conditions 
if this occurs  our net sales and profitability could decline 
seasonal fluctuations in the sales of sporting goods could cause our annual operating results to suffer significantly 
we experience seasonal fluctuations in our net sales and operating results 
in fiscal  we generated of our net sales and of our operating income in the fourth fiscal quarter  which includes the holiday selling season as well as the peak winter sports selling season 
as a result  we incur significant additional expenses in the fourth fiscal quarter due to higher purchase volumes and increased staffing 
if we 
table of contents miscalculate the demand for our products generally or for our product mix during the fourth fiscal quarter  our net sales could decline  resulting in excess inventory  which could harm our financial performance 
because a substantial portion of our operating income is derived from our fourth fiscal quarter net sales  a shortfall in expected fourth fiscal quarter net sales could cause our annual operating results to suffer significantly 
intense competition in the sporting goods industry could limit our growth and reduce our profitability 
the retail market for sporting goods is highly fragmented and intensely competitive 
we compete directly or indirectly with the following categories of companies other traditional sporting goods stores and chains  mass merchandisers  discount stores and department stores  such as wal mart  kmart  target  kohl s  jc penney  and sears  specialty sporting goods shops and pro shops  such as the athlete s foot and foot locker  sporting goods superstores  such as the sports authority  inc  and its other operating units  oshman s  sportmart and gart sports company  and internet retailers 
some of our competitors have a larger number of stores and greater financial  distribution  marketing and other resources than we have 
two of our major competitors  the sports authority  inc and gart sports company including its other operating units  oshman s and sportmart  completed a merger in august and now operate under the name the sports authority  inc in addition  if our competitors reduce their prices  it may be difficult for us to reach our net sales goals without reducing our prices 
as a result of this competition  we may also need to spend more on advertising and promotion than we anticipate 
if we are unable to compete successfully  our operating results will suffer 
we may incur costs from litigation or increased regulation relating to products that we sell  particularly firearms 
we sell products manufactured by third parties  some of which may be defective 
if any product that we sell were to cause physical injury or injury to property  the injured party or parties could bring claims against us as the retailer of the product 
our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover every claim that could be asserted against us 
if a successful claim were brought against us in excess of our insurance coverage  it could harm our business 
even unsuccessful claims could result in the expenditure of funds and management time and could have a negative impact on our business 
in addition  our products are subject to the federal consumer product safety act  which empowers the consumer product safety commission to protect consumers from hazardous sporting goods and other articles 
the consumer product safety commission has the authority to exclude from the market certain consumer products that are found to be hazardous 
similar laws exist in some states and cities in the united states 
if we fail to comply with government and industry safety standards  we may be subject to claims  lawsuits  fines and negative publicity that could harm our operating results 
in addition  we sell firearms and ammunition  products associated with an increased risk of injury and related lawsuits 
sales of firearms and ammunition have historically represented less than of our annual net sales 
we may incur losses due to lawsuits relating to our performance of background checks on firearms purchases as mandated by state and federal law or the improper use of firearms sold by us  including lawsuits by municipalities or other organizations attempting to recover costs from firearms manufacturers and retailers relating to the misuse of firearms 
in addition  in the future there may be increased federal  state or local regulation  including taxation  of the sale of firearms in both our current markets as well as future markets in which we may operate 
commencement of these lawsuits against us or the establishment of new regulations could reduce our net sales and decrease our profitability 

table of contents if we fail to anticipate changes in consumer preferences  we may experience lower net sales  higher inventory markdowns and lower margins 
our products must appeal to a broad range of consumers whose preferences cannot be predicted with certainty 
these preferences are also subject to change 
our success depends upon our ability to anticipate and respond in a timely manner to trends in sporting goods merchandise and consumers participation in sports 
if we fail to identify and respond to these changes  our net sales may decline 
in addition  because we often make commitments to purchase products from our vendors up to six months in advance of the proposed delivery  if we misjudge the market for our merchandise  we may over stock unpopular products and be forced to take inventory markdowns that could have a negative impact on profitability 
terrorism and the uncertainty of war may harm our operating results 
terrorist attacks or acts of war may cause damage or disruption to us and our employees  facilities  information systems  vendors  and customers  which could significantly impact our net sales  costs and expenses and financial condition 
the threat of terrorist attacks since september  continues to create many economic and political uncertainties 
the potential for future terrorist attacks  the national and international responses to terrorist attacks and other acts of war or hostility may cause greater uncertainty and cause our business to suffer in ways that we currently cannot predict 
military action taken by the united states and its allies in iraq or elsewhere could have a short or long term negative economic impact upon the financial markets and our business in general
