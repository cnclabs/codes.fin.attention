this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
please see risks related to our business and disclosure regarding forward looking statements elsewhere in this form k 
overview our return to profitability in fiscal after several years of losses is directly related to an increase in the level of exploration for domestic oil and natural gas reserves by the petroleum industry since the increased level of exploration is a function of higher prices for oil and natural gas 
as a result of the increase in domestic exploration spending  we have experienced an increased demand for our seismic data acquisition and processing services 
while we can make no assurances as to future levels of domestic exploration or commodity prices  we believe opportunities exist for us to expand our position as the leading provider of seismic data acquisition services in the lower states of the united states 
we continue to focus on increasing revenues and profitability 
our revenues are affected by the level of client demand for our services  the pricing for our services that we negotiate with our clients  and the productivity of our data acquisition crews  including crew downtime related to inclement weather or delays in acquiring land access permits 
consequently  our successful efforts to negotiate more favorable weather protection provisions in our master service contracts  to mitigate access permit delays  and to improve overall crew productivity  may contribute to growth in our revenues 
although our clients may cancel their supplemental service agreement with us on short notice  we believe we currently have a sufficient order book to sustain operations at full capacity well into fiscal fiscal highlights our financial performance for fiscal significantly improved when compared to our financial performance for fiscal due to the following principal factors in response to increased utilization  we added capacity to existing crews and fielded three additional data acquisition crews 
these additions were funded primarily from cash flow and cash reserves and helped to increase our revenues during fiscal as result of increased demand for our services  we saw price improvements and more favorable contract terms in our agreements with clients 
these factors helped improve our revenues during fiscal approximately per share of our earnings for fiscal were due to a deferred income tax benefit resulting from our elimination of a valuation allowance on a deferred tax asset generated from net operating loss carryforwards 
we believe that our past five profitable quarters and a continued favorable environment for our services will now enable us to use the deferred tax asset 

table of contents fiscal year ended september  versus fiscal year ended september  operating revenues 
our operating revenues increased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal as a result of increased demand for our services  price improvements in the markets for our services and the negotiation of favorable contract provisions 
we began fiscal with six data acquisition crews 
the seventh crew was added in march and the eighth and ninth crews were fielded in the fourth quarter of fiscal approximately  of our revenue is related to a negotiated release from contract performance by one customer 
the release was at the request of the client  and did not involve any performance issues 
operating costs 
our operating expenses increased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal due to the start up and ongoing expenses of the three new crews added during the year 
general and administrative expenses were of revenues in fiscal as compared to in fiscal the reduction in the percentage of general and administrative expenses to revenues in fiscal reflects our relatively fixed operating costs and the increase in our revenues during this period 
general and administrative expenses are expected to increase to support expanded field operations and to assimilate sarbanes oxley reporting requirements 
in fiscal  we increased our allowance for doubtful accounts by  in response to the increase in business activity and accounts receivable 
historically  we have had no significant write offs of trade accounts receivable  however  we believe that it is prudent to increase the allowance for doubtful accounts in response to the business from new customers that the increases in the prices of oil and natural gas have generated 
we recognized  of depreciation expense in fiscal as compared to  in fiscal our depreciation expense is expected to increase in fiscal as a result of our significant capital expenditures in fiscal approximately of the fiscal capital expenditures occurred in the fourth quarter 
during fiscal we will reflect a full year of depreciation expense for these fourth quarter capital expenditures 
our total operating costs for fiscal were  an increase of from fiscal primarily due to the factors described above 
taxes 
because of our past five profitable quarters and the continued favorable environment for our services  we believe that we will now be able to fully use our net operating loss carryforwards 
approximately per share of our reported earnings for fiscal resulted from a deferred income tax benefit resulting from the elimination of a valuation allowance on our deferred tax asset generated from these net operating loss carryforwards 
current tax expense reflects alternative minimum tax amt calculated on net income not eligible for offset by amt loss carryforwards 
fiscal year ended september  versus fiscal year ended september  operating revenues 
our operating revenues increased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal principally as a result of increased demand for our services 
we began fiscal with five crews and increased to six operating crews in november 
during the months of may  june and july  our production was severely impaired by rain and we operated five crews during this time 
during fiscal  we saw slight price improvements for our services and were able to maintain the price improvements gained in fiscal operating costs 
our operating expenses increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal due to the start up expenses associated with activating a crew  our expanded operations geographically within the contiguous united states  and an increased demand for dynamite energy sources  which require an expensive drilling component  and for the use of helicopters to achieve efficient operations 
the last two factors are reimbursable out of pocket expenses and are reported in both our revenue and expense lines 
our general and administrative expenses were of revenues in fiscal as compared to in fiscal we increased our allowance for doubtful accounts by  in fiscal in response to working for new clients in new areas 
however  relatively favorable prices for crude oil and natural gas benefited our clients and  therefore  helped us in the collection of accounts receivable 
we recognized  of depreciation expense in fiscal  an increase of from fiscal the increase in depreciation expense reflects our increase in capital expenditures during fiscal and  principally for recording equipment 
our total operating costs for fiscal were  an increase of from fiscal primarily due to the factors described above 
the year over year increase in our revenues of as compared to the year over year increase in our operating expenses of reflects the high proportion of relatively fixed total operating expenses  including personnel costs of active crews  inherent in our business 
taxes 
we recorded a deferred tax expense due to an increase in the income tax valuation allowance 
the tax expense is related to the tax effect of the unrealized loss on investments recorded in other comprehensive income 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources cash flows 
net cash provided by operating activities was  for fiscal   for fiscal and  for fiscal these amounts primarily reflect results of operations offset by changes in working capital components 
the increase in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal resulted primarily from the increase in net income 
net cash used in investing activities was  in fiscal and  in fiscal net cash provided from investing activities was  in fiscal these results primarily represent capital expenditures and activity in the short term investment portfolio 
capital expenditures were made with cash generated from operations and short term investments 
net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal was  and reflects proceeds from the exercise of stock options by officers and other key employees 
capital expenditures 
capital expenditures during fiscal were  which was used to acquire additional recording channels  energy source units  three new seismic acquisition crews and maintenance capital requirements 
we have budgeted capital expenditures of approximately  in fiscal year  of which approximately will be used to complete the fiscal crew expansions  approximately will be used to add a tenth seismic acquisition crew in january and the remainder will be used for maintenance capital requirements 
we continually strive to supply market demand with technologically advanced d data acquisition recording systems and leading edge data processing capabilities 
we maintain equipment in and out of service in anticipation of increased future demand for our services 
capital resources 
historically  we have relied on cash generated from operations  cash reserves and short term borrowings from commercial banks to fund our working capital requirements and  to some extent  capital expenditures 
we believe that our capital resources  including our short term investments and cash flow from operations are adequate to meet our current operational needs 
we believe we will be able to finance our fiscal capital requirements through these same sources and by securing a line of credit from a commercial bank 
on november   we received a commitment letter from a bank for a revolving line of credit of up to  to be secured by our accounts receivable 
the commitment letter is subject to conditions  including that we negotiate a loan agreement acceptable to the bank and to us 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to satisfy these conditions or obtain the line of credit 
we are also evaluating other financing sources 
other than the commitment letter discussed above  we do not currently have any financing arrangements 
off balance sheet arrangements as of september   we had no off balance sheet arrangements 
effect of inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition during the past three years 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make certain assumptions and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
because of the use of assumptions and estimates inherent in the reporting process  actual results could differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition 
our services are provided under cancelable service contracts 
in the case of a cancelled service contract  we recognize revenue and bill our client for services performed up to the date of cancellation 
we also receive reimbursements for certain out of pocket expenses under the terms of our master service contracts 
we record amounts billed to clients in revenue at the gross mount including out of pocket expenses that are reimbursed by the client 
in some instances  we bill clients in advance of the services performed 
in those cases  we recognize the liability as deferred revenue 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we prepare our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable based on our past experience of historical write offs  our current customer base and our review of past due accounts 
the inherent volatility of the energy industry s business cycle can cause swift and unpredictable changes in the financial stability of our customers 

table of contents impairment of long lived assets 
we review long lived assets for impairment when triggering events occur suggesting deterioration in the assets recoverability or fair value 
recognition of an impairment charge is required if future expected net cash flows are insufficient to recover the carrying value of the asset 
our forecast of future cash flows used to perform impairment analysis includes estimates of future revenues and future gross margins 
if we are unable to achieve these cash flows  our estimates would be revised potentially resulting in an impairment charge in the period of revision 
depreciable lives of property  plant and equipments 
our property  plant and equipment is capitalized at historical cost and depreciated over the useful life of the asset 
our estimation of this useful life is based on circumstances that exist in the seismic industry and information available at the time of the purchase of the asset 
as circumstances change and new information becomes available these estimates could change 
we amortize these capitalized items using the straight line method 
stock based compensation 
in accordance with the accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  we do not record compensation for stock options or other stock based awards that are granted to employees or non employee directors with an exercise price equal to or above the common stock market price on the grant date 
recently issued accounting pronouncements the financial accounting standards board fasb has announced it will require all public companies to expense the fair value of employee stock awards 
the final requirements will be effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the impact to our financial statements will be in the form of additional compensation expense upon the award of any stock options 
the amount of the compensation expense we will recognize is dependent on the value of our common stock and the number of options we award 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the primary sources of market risk include fluctuations in commodity prices which effect demand for and pricing of our services and interest rate fluctuations 
at september   we had no indebtedness 
our short term investments were fixed rate and we do not necessarily intend to hold them to maturity  and therefore  the short term investments expose us to the risk of earnings or cash flow loss due to changes in market interest rates 
as of september   the carrying value of our investments approximates fair value 
we have not entered into any hedge arrangements  commodity swap agreements  commodity futures  options or other derivative financial instruments 
we do not currently conduct business internationally so we are generally not subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk
