critical accounting policies financial reporting release no 
requires all companies to include a discussion of critical accounting policies or methods used in the preparation of financial statements 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements for a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
we believe the following are some of the more critical judgment areas in the application of our accounting policies that currently affect our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
general the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
the most significant estimates and assumptions relate to restructuring charges  impairment of goodwill  intangibles and other long lived assets  income taxes  pensions  asset retirement obligations and contingencies related to litigation and environmental matters 
actual amounts could differ significantly from these estimates 
restructuring activities the company recorded restructuring charges  net of adjustments  of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
these charges and adjustments were made in connection with detailed repositioning and restructuring plans approved by the board  which provided for a series of cost reduction initiatives to further streamline operations  strengthen the company s competitive position and provide a platform for future growth 
the charges associated with these plans included estimates for employee severance costs  plant closure and related environmental costs and the settlements of various contractual obligations resulting from these repositioning and restructuring actions 
when it is determinable that the actual costs differ from the original estimates  adjustments  either additional charges or reversals  are made to the remaining restructuring reserves at that time 
impairment of long lived and intangible assets the company evaluates long lived assets  including goodwill and other intangible assets  annually or when events occur or circumstances change that may result in a potential impairment 
judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on legal factors  market conditions and operational performance of acquired businesses 
if impairment indicators are present  the company is required to assess the recoverability of these assets 
in assessing the recoverability of the company s goodwill and other intangible assets  the company must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to adjust the impairment charges for these assets 
the company recorded asset impairments of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
income taxes the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
the statement also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
at december  and  the company had deferred tax assets  net of valuation allowances  in excess of deferred tax liabilities of million and million  respectively 
at december  and  management determined that it is more likely than not that million and million  respectively  of certain deferred tax assets  primarily foreign jurisdiction net operating loss carryforwards  will not be realized  requiring the company to establish a valuation allowance for those amounts 
the company evaluates on a quarterly basis its ability to realize its deferred tax assets by assessing its valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of such allowance  if necessary 
the factors used to assess the likelihood of realization are the company s forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to support realization of certain deferred tax assets 
failure to achieve forecasted taxable income might affect the ultimate realization of certain deferred tax assets 
factors that may affect the company s ability to achieve sufficient forecasted taxable income include  but are not limited to  increased competition  general economic conditions  a decline in sales or earnings  loss of market share or delays in product availability 
in addition  the company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audits in these jurisdictions 
these audits can involve complex issues  which may require an extended period of time to resolve 
in management s opinion  adequate provisions for income taxes have been made 
defined benefit pension plans the company sponsors various non contributory and contributory defined benefit pension plans which have significant pension benefit costs developed from actuarial valuations 
inherent in these valuations are key assumptions including discount rates  expected return on plan assets and rates of increases in compensation levels 
the company is required to consider current market conditions  including changes in interest rates and plan asset investment returns  in determining these assumptions 
at october  the annual plan measurement date  appropriate changes were made in the key assumptions for the plans 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements for detail of these assumptions 
the company currently expects pension costs to decrease by approximately million to million in compared to the company has no funding requirements for as actuarially determined for the us plans 
although there were no funding requirements for  the company made a voluntary contribution of  shares of company treasury stock  or million  to the us qualified plan during the second quarter of in the third quarter of  the company made an additional discretionary cash contribution to the us qualified plan of million 
company contributions to the non us plan in are expected to be approximately million  in line with amounts 
an increase in either the discount rate or expected return on plan assets of one fourth of percentage point  holding all other assumptions constant  would decrease the company s pension expense by million and million  respectively 
correspondingly  a decrease in these assumptions of one fourth of percentage point  holding all other assumptions constant  would increase the company s pension expense by million and million  respectively 
asset retirement obligations the company currently has legal obligations to close bromine supply and disposal wells at the end of the assets useful lives 
the company carries these obligations at their fair value as determined under statement of financial accounting standards sfas  accounting for asset retirement obligations  aro which was adopted as of january  the statement requires that upon recognition of a liability  the cost is capitalized as part of the related long lived asset and allocated to expense over the useful life of the asset 
upon adoption  the company recorded an increase in plant and equipment  net of related accumulated depreciation  of million and recognized an asset retirement obligation of million  resulting in a charge to income reported as a cumulative effect of an accounting change of million  net of income taxes 
the calculation of fair value requires the company to make certain estimates  including the amount and timing of future cash outflows and appropriate discount rates 
changes in certain estimates resulted in an adjustment to reduce the asset retirement obligation by million 
additional adjustments may be required in the future if the estimated costs and timing of closure activities changes 
contingencies the company is subject to legal proceedings  lawsuits and other claims related to environmental  labor  product and other matters 
the company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes related to these matters  as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of reserves required  if any  for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each individual issue 
the company records a reserve when management considers the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome probable and when a reasonable estimate of the liability can be made 
at december   the company had accrued million and million related to litigation and environmental liabilities  respectively  related to continuing operations 
these accruals are estimates and may change in the future as new developments arise as changes are made in settlement strategy 
results of operations the following table sets forth the percentage relationship to net sales of certain income statement items for the company s continuing operations year ended december net sales cost of products sold gross profit margin selling  general and administrative expenses asset impairments operating income loss interest income expense net other income expense net income loss before income taxes income taxes credit income loss from continuing operations before income taxes and cumulative effect of accounting change the following table provides details of amounts for asset impairments  restructuring charges and certain other significant items reflected in the company s operating results in  and this information should be referenced when reading the results of operations section below

income tax expense credit for the year ended december  amounted to a credit of million or an effective tax rate of compared to an expense of million or an effective tax rate of in the prior year 
the effective rate benefited from a favorable ruling from the internal revenue service irs regarding certain income tax issues related to the company s federal income tax filings 
as a result of this decision and through evaluation of its remaining reserves  the company released million to earnings through income taxes credits in the third quarter of excluding this release to earnings in  the company s effective tax rate would have been 
income loss from continuing operations before cumulative effect of accounting change was million or per share in  as compared to million or per share in segment information the company has changed its reportable business segments as of the first quarter of in order to align the external presentation of results with the company s current management and operating structure 
the company continues to operate in three business segments polymer additives  specialty products formerly named water treatment and performance chemicals 
in addition  the agricultural products and bromine intermediates businesses  collectively referred to as the brominated performance products business  were reclassified from performance chemicals to the polymer additives business segment 
the remaining components of the performance chemicals segment are unaffected 
in addition  the water treatment segment has been renamed specialty products to include the company s recent acquisitions of specialty household cleaning products  which joins the company s swimming pool and industrial water sanitizers and related products 
the segment information for the year ended december  reported in the company s annual report on form k filed with the securities and exchange commission were presented in the previously existing business segments 
the following table provides a comparison of the business segments as reported on the form k as of december  and the realigned segment presentation beginning in the first quarter of business segments at december  business segments as of first quarter of polymer additives polymer additives flame retardants flame retardants polymer stabilizers polymer stabilizers agricultural products brominated performance products bromine intermediates brominated performance products water treatment specialty products recreational recreational industrial industrial household performance chemicals performance chemicals fire suppression fire suppression fluorine specialties fluorine specialties toxicological services toxicological services fine chemicals classified as discontinued operations fine chemicals classified as discontinued operations agricultural products brominated performance products bromine intermediates brominated performance products as a result of this realignment  segment results from the prior year have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation 
the company s three global segments polymer additives  specialty products and performance chemicals are strategic business units that offer products and services that are intended to satisfy specific customer requirements 
the units are organized and managed to deliver a distinct group of products  technology and services 
set forth below is a discussion of the operations of the company s business segments polymer additives  specialty products and performance chemicals 
the company evaluates business unit performance and allocates resources based on operating income  which represents net sales less cost of products sold and selling  general and administrative expenses  as well as cash flows and return on investment 
both polymer additives and specialty products use bromine as a raw material in their production processes 
bromine is transferred at cost from polymer additives to specialty products 
in addition  assets used in the production of bromine are allocated from polymer additives to specialty products based on the percentage of production consumed 
polymer additives the polymer additives business unit is a leading provider of flame retardants  polymer stabilizers and optical monomers and brings the most comprehensive product basket to the global marketplace 
polymer additives provides its customers an array of integrated polymer additive solutions that meet specific  well defined customer needs in a variety of products including consumer electronics  computers and business equipment  automotive  furniture  fibers  wire and cable  household appliances  communications equipment  building and construction materials  packaging  textiles  polymers  cosmetics and optical monomers 
net sales operating income loss net sales increased million or in the increase in sales in polymer stabilizers more than offset a decline in sales in flame retardants and brominated performance products 
overall selling prices for polymer additives were comparable year over year 
price increases in flame retardants were offset by pricing pressure in polymer stabilizers  which leveled off in the second half of the year 
sales volumes in polymer additives decreased sales by 
the business continues to focus on offering new innovative solutions in the marketplace 
the level of new product sales  defined by management as products introduced in the last five years  increased to million in from million in sales in polymer additives were favorably impacted year to date from the effects of foreign exchange 
operating income loss decreased million to million for the year 
included in operating income in are million of charges for asset impairment  restructuring and other significant items 
included in operating income in are million of charges for adjustments to reserves for previously recorded charges 
in addition  the decrease reflects the impact of higher raw material costs  lower sales volumes  the reduction of inventory levels and unfavorable manufacturing variances in in the bromine business 
operating results of polymer additives were also affected by a decline in sales of methyl bromide  an agricultural product  when compared to last year 
this decline reflects variations in customer order patterns and the phase down of sales of methyl bromide in accordance with the montreal protocol 
mandated production cuts began in and are expected to continue through unless legislation or other regulatory actions modify current phase down requirements 
specialty products the specialty products business unit is the world s leading provider of recreational water care products to the consumer 
biolab water additives  through its proprietary position in polymaleate chemistry  and as the world s foremost provider of bromine based biocides  is a leading supplier of antiscalants  corrosion inhibitors  dispersants  antifoams  hydantoin derivatives  formulated oxidizers and desalination solutions 
through its acquisitions of lime o sol and a m cleaning products in  the specialty products business entered the specialty household cleaning products business with the works brand of non abrasive bathroom cleaners  glass and surface cleaners  toilet bowl cleaners  drain openers and rust and calcium removers  as well as greased lightning and orange blast multipurpose cleaners 
net sales operating income specialty products net sales increased million or to million in the current year 
net sales attributable to the company s household products acquisitions see note to the consolidated financial statements were million or 
also contributing to the increase in sales were higher sales volumes of new products of and the favorable effects of foreign currency of  partially offset by a decline in price 
operating income for specialty products decreased million to million for the year included in are million of asset impairment charges  severance costs and headquarter relocation costs 
included in are reversals of million of previously recorded reserves for contract cancellation and other costs 
an unfavorable sales mix triggered by an unseasonably cool and rainy pool season in the northeast and mid central us contributed to the lower operating results in the current year 
in addition  the positive effects of acquisitions and foreign exchange were more than offset by the effects of a decrease in productivity  higher raw material costs and increased selling  general and administrative expenses to fund growth initiatives  in particular  the household products business 
performance chemicals the performance chemicals business unit  which includes wil laboratories  is a global supplier of fluorine based fire suppression agent fm  fluorine based intermediates and all phases of nonclinical toxicological testing to broad and diverse markets that include information technology  telecommunications  transportation  medical  automotive  electronics  photographic paper and films  rubber compounds  detergents  soil  crop and structural pest control  pharmaceuticals  and the chemical and biotechnology industry 
performance chemicals excludes the fine chemicals business as this business has been reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
net sales operating income net sales for performance chemicals decreased million or in the current year 
sales volumes decreased while pricing decreased by 
these decreases were slightly offset by the positive effects of foreign exchange 
sales at wil laboratories increased from the prior year due to increased volumes and a favorable service mix  while the company s fluorine based businesses continued to face weaknesses in pricing and volume based on the state of the information and telecommunication infrastructure spending levels 
operating income decreased million or in the current year 
operating income in included million of asset impairments and restructuring charges offset by a favorable litigation settlement of million 
the volume and price declines in the fluorine based business and higher spending to fund growth programs surrounding the fire suppression business negatively impacted operating income 
compared with continuing operations net sales increased to  million from  million in the prior year 
strong volume gains in the specialty products and polymer additives business units were offset by lower sales in performance chemicals related to the fluorine business and lower selling prices in the polymer additives and performance chemicals business units 
for the company as a whole  sales volumes increased while pricing was down 
gross profit margins increased to from in the prior year 
included in the gross profit margin in are million of repositioning activity costs as reflected in the table on page excluding these costs  gross profit margins increased to from 
the increase reflects the benefits realized from improved manufacturing efficiencies  lower raw material costs and productivity gains associated with the repositioning efforts undertaken in the second half of these items more than offset reduced selling prices in polymer additives and performance chemicals 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million to million 
as a percent of sales  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased from to 
these decreases reflect the benefits of repositioning efforts undertaken in the second half of  as well as lower information technology and legal spending  which more than offset higher pension and insurance costs 
included in and are net repositioning activity costs of million and million  respectively see note to the consolidated financial statements 
asset impairments in of million reflect additional impairments needed to complete actions undertaken in connection with the repositioning plan 
asset impairments in of million reflect the closure of three plants and impairment of goodwill in the polymer additives business unit as reflected in the table on page operating income loss was million compared to million in the prior year 
included in operating income in are million of restructuring charges and asset impairments offset by million of reversals of previously recorded repositioning items 
operating income in includes the effects of million of restructuring charges and other repositioning activities 
excluding the impact of restructuring charges and repositioning items  operating income increased million year over year 
this increase reflects the higher sales volumes  productivity gains  lower raw material costs and the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses  all of which more than offset lower selling prices 
interest income expense net decreased million to million in reflecting reduced net debt levels in the current year and the effects of an interest rate swap entered into during the first quarter of  which reduced interest expense by million in other income expense net decreased million from other expense net of million in the prior year to million in other income expense in included million of fixed asset write downs net of a reversal of million for litigation and other settlements 
included in the fixed asset write downs of million is a million impairment of the specialty products business unit s biolab corporate facility as a part of a management plan to move to a leased facility in the existing facility was sold in january other income expense in included one time charges of million see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in addition  as of january   the company ceased amortization of goodwill in accordance with the adoption of sfas no 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
goodwill amortization of million was recognized in the absence of million in goodwill amortization in other income expense net in was more than offset by lower earnings of affiliates and higher foreign exchange losses due to the weakening of the us dollar against the euro and the british pound 
income tax expense credit for the year ended december  amounted to an expense of million or an effective tax rate of compared to a credit of million or effective tax rate of in the prior year 
the effective income tax rate of was higher than the company s income tax rate due primarily to the increase in the valuation allowance and non deductible goodwill write offs related to the repositioning activities 
income loss from continuing operations was million or per share in  as compared to million or per share in set forth below is a discussion of the operations of the company s business segments polymer additives  specialty products and performance chemicals 
operating income  which is the income measure the company uses to evaluate business segment performance  represents net sales less costs of products sold and selling  general and administrative expenses 
both polymer additives and specialty products use bromine as a raw material in their production processes 
bromine is transferred at cost from polymer additives to specialty products 
in addition  assets used in the production of bromine are allocated from polymer additives to specialty products based on the percentage of production consumed 
polymer additives net sales operating income loss net sales increased million or in new product introductions and stronger end market demand drove an increase in sales volumes of 
this volume growth was partially offset by a decline in selling prices 
roughly one half of the volume growth  or million  is attributable to new product growth 
foreign exchange added to sales 
operating income loss increased million to million for the year 
excluding restructuring costs and asset impairments of million in and restructuring costs  asset impairments  inventory write downs  environmental remediation costs and other repositioning items of million included in operating income loss in see note to the consolidated financial statements  operating income increased million 
higher sales volumes and new product growth contributed million to the increase 
in addition  benefits derived from restructuring activities  lower raw material costs and focused productivity efforts added million 
these benefits more than offset the decrease in selling prices of million and the negative impact of foreign exchange of million in the current year 
specialty products net sales operating income specialty products net sales increased to million in the current year 
market penetration led by growing consumer acceptance of innovative product offerings and warmer weather patterns throughout most of the pool season drove the increase 
operating income increased from million in to million in included in are reversals of million of previously recorded reserves for contract cancellation and other costs 
excluding these reversals and restructuring charges  inventory write downs  contract cancellation costs and other repositioning items of million included in operating income in see note to the consolidated financial statements  operating income increased million 
the positive impact of higher sales volumes and the strength of the new product portfolio contributed million 
in addition  focused productivity efforts and lower raw material costs each added million 
acquisitions also added million 
the positive impact of these items more than offset the effect of slightly lower selling prices of million 
performance chemicals net sales operating income net sales decreased million or in the current year 
sales decreased from lower volumes and from a decline in selling prices  primarily in the fluorine business 
these decreases reflect the continued slow down in information technology and telecommunication infrastructure spending 
operating income decreased million or in the current year 
excluding restructuring charges  inventory write downs  environmental remediation costs and other repositioning items of million included in operating income in see note to the consolidated financial statements  operating income decreased million 
lower sales volumes contributed million to the decrease while lower selling prices added million to the decrease 
discontinued operations in  management  with the approval of the board of directors  committed to a plan to divest the company s fine chemicals business  previously a part of the performance chemicals business unit 
as a result of these actions and management s continued efforts to sell the business  the company reports fine chemicals as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
the halebank  uk site of the fine chemicals business was sold on december  resulting in a loss on sale of approximately  reported in other income expense net 
management s plans are to continue its efforts to sell the remaining fine chemicals site until a sale has been consummated 
in may  the company completed the sale of its energy services and products business unit  osca  to bj services company 
under the terms of the sale  bj services acquired all outstanding shares of osca  including the company s holding  for per share in cash  or million  resulting in a gain of million 
this transaction provided the company with net proceeds of approximately million  which was used to reduce the company s debt position 
as a result of this transaction  the company has reflected osca as discontinued operations in and net sales and operating income loss relating to discontinued operations for  and  are as follows year ended december net sales fine chemicals osca operating income loss fine chemicals osca included in operating income in were restructuring charges for fine chemicals consisting of asset impairments of million and million of charges for severance 
included in operating income for the fine chemicals business in are million of asset impairment charges and million of severance costs 
these charges were recorded in conjunction with the intended sale of the fine chemicals business 
fine chemicals net restructuring charges recorded in of million consisted of million of asset impairments  which included million of fixed asset impairments and million of impaired goodwill  million of severance costs  million of plant closure and environmental costs  and million of other costs 
the charges were undertaken as a part of a detailed repositioning plan approved by the company s board of directors in as of december   million of restructuring charges recorded in and million of restructuring charges recorded in remain to be spent 
there are no amounts outstanding related to the charges taken in or the major components of the remaining reserves relate to severance of million and million of plant closure and environmental costs 
plant closure and environmental costs have been allocated between accrued expenses and non current liabilities based on the anticipated timing of these expenditures 
outlook the company took actions in in order to meet current and future challenges by restructuring  creating critical strategic alliances  continuing the growth of new products and expanding the reach of the company s consumer products portfolio 
these actions helped the company emerge from a difficult year with optimism for the company s long term future 
new product growth the company has gone from virtually no revenue from new products five years ago in the industrial businesses polymer stabilizers  flame retardants and fluorine to approximately million in  and revenue is anticipated to reach million in specialty products new product revenues were million in and are anticipated to be approximately million in for the company as a whole  new product revenues are expected to reach of total revenues in raw material and energy costs the company s operating units are greatly impacted by price changes for raw material and energy costs 
increases in raw material costs reduced earnings by million in energy costs  primarily natural gas prices  increased operating costs by million in due to the magnitude of energy usage across the manufacturing processes of great lakes  a change in the price of natural gas mmbtus has an approximate impact on the company s earnings per share on an annual basis 
the company has entered into raw material contracts and certain financial instruments such that raw material costs for are anticipated to be at worst even with levels and the cost of natural gas in to be comparable with levels 
foreign exchange great lakes  as a multinational company  is exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates  primarily the euro and british pound in relation to the us dollar 
approximately of the company s external sales are invoiced from foreign locations  and approximately of the company s long lived assets reside in foreign locations 
in  foreign exchange rate fluctuations increased sales million or but had a negative impact on operating income of million 
as a result of the company closing two uk plants and entering into alternative sourcing arrangements in the fourth quarter of  the company s exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations has been reduced heading into while the company currently hedges certain portions of its foreign currency exposure  significant changes in foreign currency exchange rates in would impact both sales and operating income levels 
polymer additives the polymer additives business saw sluggish end market demand through most of however  in the fourth quarter of  polymer additives reported positive volume gains on a sequential basis reflecting stronger order patterns 
this does provide some evidence of an upturn in demand in key end markets such as electronics going into during  the polymer additives business was able to enact price increases on several of its products 
pricing in polymer additives continues to be challenging due to the effects of competition as well as the weak us dollar 
as a result  the business continues to focus on driving continuous productivity gains  executing restructuring plans  including the closure of three manufacturing facilities  expanding new product applications and increasing selling prices to help offset continued higher raw material and energy costs 
in  the company entered into a long term strategic sourcing agreement for elemental bromine and certain derivatives from dead sea bromine ltd 
the agreement will allow polymer additives to benefit from the scale and efficiency of the world s largest bromine manufacturing complex on the dead sea 
specialty products demand for recreational water care products is influenced by a variety of factors including seasonal weather patterns 
sales volumes in were hampered by an unseasonably cool and wet spring in the northeast and mid central regions of the united states 
while management does not anticipate a repeat of these weather conditions in  volumes in may be impacted by weather trends during the pool season 
in  the specialty products segment entered the consumer household products market through the acquisitions of lime o sol and a m products 
these acquisitions are leveraging specialty products brand and channel management  consumer marketing and product innovation to expand the company s reach into the consumer market 
expenditures were made in to integrate lime o sol and a m products into specialty products and to expand the markets for the works and greased lightning beyond the markets existing at the time of the acquisitions 
specialty products is working to further penetrate the market with these established products as well as new household products through multiple channels 
performance chemicals throughout  the fluorine based businesses of the performance chemicals segment continued to feel the effects of lower information technology infrastructure and telecommunications spending  which led to lower sales volumes and prices 
performance chemicals continues to work to increase market share through its total cost of ownership program that encourages companies to install fire suppression systems using the company s non residue  non ozone depleting fm product 
financial condition  liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents continuing operations at december  were million  which represents a decrease of million from million at year end cash provided by operating activities continuing operations was million in the current year compared to million in the prior year 
the current year decrease reflects the use of cash as a result of a decrease in earnings partially offset by working capital reductions in compared to prior year 
included in operating activities continuing operations in was a million cash contribution to the company s pension plan and approximately million of spending related to the company s  and repositioning plans 
spending in for and repositioning plans totaled million 
in addition  million of cash tax payments were made during  of which million related to prior year tax liabilities

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s operations are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and natural gas prices that could impact its results of operations and financial condition 
the company manages its exposure to these market risks through its regular operations and financing activities and  when deemed appropriate  by using derivative financial instruments in accordance with established policies and procedures 
the derivative financial instruments generally used include swaps  forward contracts and options 
the derivative financial instruments utilized by the company in its hedging activities are considered risk management tools and are not used for trading purposes 
in addition  derivative financial instruments are entered into with a diversified group of major financial institutions in order to limit the exposure of nonperformance on such instruments 
international operations  including us export sales  constitute a significant portion of the company s revenues and identifiable assets 
these operations result in a large volume of foreign currency commitment and transaction exposures and foreign currency net asset exposures 
at december  and  the company s primary net foreign currency market exposures were dispersed through various countries and primarily included the euro  the british pound and the japanese yen 
exposure to variability in currency exchange rates is mitigated  when possible  through the use of natural hedges  whereby purchases and sales in the same foreign currency and with similar maturity dates offset one another 
the amount of hedging activity and management of commitment and transaction exposures is coordinated at the corporate level 
hedges are set to mature concurrently with the estimated timing of settlement of the underlying transactions 
considering the company s operating profile  at december   the result of a uniform change in the value of the dollar relative to the currencies in which the company s sales are denominated would result in a change in operating income of approximately million 
a similar change in would have had approximately a million effect on operating income 
this calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the us dollar  and does not factor in any potential changes in sales levels or local currency prices that may result from changes in exchange rates 
the company uses commercial paper as a source of financing  which exposes the company to changes in short term interest rates 
the company manages its ratio of fixed to floating rate debt with the objective of achieving a mix that management believes is appropriate 
to manage this mix in a cost effective manner  the company  from time to time  enters into interest rate swap agreements in which it agrees to exchange various combinations of fixed and or variable interest rates based on agreed upon notional amounts that are supported by the company s current debt position 
in the first quarter of  the company entered into fixed to variable interest rate swaps to manage interest expense on million of fixed rate debt 
in the third quarter of  the company entered into an additional fixed to variable interest rate swap on million of fixed rate debt bringing the combined amount to million 
based on the company s debt position at december   a hypothetical change in interest rates of percentage point for a one year period would change income loss from continuing operations before income taxes by approximately million 
this analysis does not consider any effect that a change in interest rates would have on overall economic activity or management actions to mitigate interest rate changes 
as of december   the company had investments of million representing investment securities with maturities of three months or less 
a hypothetical change in interest rates of percentage point earned on these deposits for a one year period would change income before income taxes by million 
since the second quarter of  as part of its risk management strategy  the company has entered into fixed price swap and option contracts  including caps and floors  to manage its exposure to changes in natural gas prices 
these natural gas contracts obligate the company to make or receive a payment equal to the net change in the value of the contracts at their maturity 
such contracts are designated as hedges of the company s forecasted purchases through and are effective in hedging the company s exposure to changes in natural gas prices during this period 
the natural gas contracts that qualify as cash flow hedges under sfas are marked to market with unrealized gains and losses deferred through other comprehensive income loss and recognized in earnings when realized as an adjustment to cost of products sold 
the fair values of these contracts at december  and were immaterial to the company s consolidated financial position 
based on the company s natural gas exposure at december   a hypothetical change in natural gas prices for a one year period would change income before income taxes by approximately million 
this figure does not take into account the company s hedging programs
