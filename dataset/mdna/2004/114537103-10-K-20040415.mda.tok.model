critical accounting estimates in order to assist the reader to better understand our business and the financial statements contained in this document  the company informs you that preparation of the company s financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the company reviews its estimates on an ongoing basis and makes judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities based on a number of factors 
these factors include  but are not limited to  historical experience  guidance provided by outside experts and assumptions made by management that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the most significant areas involving management s judgments and estimates are described below 
revenue recognition 
the company recognizes revenue from sales of merchandise at the time of customer receipt 
in its direct to customer segment the company estimates delivery time to be approximately three days  therefore  it recognizes revenue in this segment on the third business day after shipment 
revenue is recognized net of estimated merchandise returns and allowances 
inventory reserves 
the company maintains information about its merchandise performance at the item level 
this level of detail enables the management team to assess the viability of each item and to estimate the company s ability to sell through each item 
the company recognizes the write down of slow moving or obsolete inventory in cost of sales when the write down is probable and estimable 
management s estimates can be affected by many factors  some of which are outside the company s control  which include but are not limited to  consumer buying trends and general economic conditions 
the company takes a physical inventory at least twice a year at its retail store locations and distribution center 
the second of these inventories is conducted near the end of the fiscal year 
the company maintains a reserve for inventory shrinkage for the periods between physical inventories 
management establishes this reserve based on historical results of previous physical inventories  shrinkage trends or other judgments that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances 
deferred tax assets 
the carrying value of the company s net deferred tax assets assumes that the company will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax 
table of contents jurisdictions  based on estimates and assumptions 
if these estimates and related assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to record a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets resulting in income tax expense in the company s consolidated statement of operations 
management evaluates the realizability of the deferred tax assets and assesses the need for valuation allowances periodically 
accounting for income taxes 
the company is periodically under audit by the united states federal  state and local tax authorities 
in evaluating the potential exposure with the various tax filing positions  the company accrues charges for possible exposures 
based on the annual evaluations of tax positions  management believes the company has appropriately filed its tax returns and accrued for possible exposures 
to the extent the company is able to prevail in matters for which accruals have been established or be required to pay amounts in excess of reserves  the company s effective tax rate in a given financial period might be materially impacted 
valuation of long lived assets 
the company reviews long lived assets for impairment at least annually or whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable or that the useful lives of these assets are no longer appropriate 
each impairment test is based on a comparison of the undiscounted net cash flows of individual stores  and consolidated net cash flows for long lived assets not identifiable to individual stores  to the recorded value of the asset 
significant judgments are made in projecting future cash flows and are based on a number of factors  including the maturity of the store  historical experience  recent trends and general economic assumptions 
if impairment is indicated  the asset is written down to its estimated fair value on a discounted cash flow basis 
while the company believes that its estimates of future cash flows are reasonable  different assumptions regarding such cash flows could materially affect the company s evaluations 
pension and other post retirement benefit plans 
the company sponsors defined benefit pension and other post retirement benefit plans 
major assumptions used in the accounting for these employee benefit plans include the discount rate  expected return on plan assets  rate of increase in employee compensation levels and health care cost increase projections 
assumptions are determined based on company data and appropriate market indicators  and are evaluated each year as of the plans measurement date 
a change in any of these assumptions may have a material effect on net periodic pension and post retirement benefit costs reported in the consolidated financial statements 
deferred catalog costs 
the company accounts for the costs associated with the production and distribution of its catalogs over the life of the catalog  which is estimated to be six months 
these costs are amortized over the life of the catalog based on the estimated sales curve over this time frame 
workers compensation and general liability insurance 
the company retains risk with respect to workers compensation and general liability claims up to a maximum of  per claim and  per claim  respectively 
the company retains risk with respect to aggregate claims up to a maximum of  during the policy year for both workers compensation and general liability claims 
the provision for estimated workers compensation and general 
table of contents liability claims includes estimates of the ultimate costs for both reported claims and claims incurred but not reported 
these estimates incorporate the company s past experience as well as other considerations

table of contents after a comprehensive review of the company s anticipated distribution requirements  management decided to upgrade its distribution systems and to physically expand its current distribution center in mexico  missouri 
the company segregated this project into three distinct phases systems upgrade  facility expansion and material handling systems 
in fiscal  phase i was completed with the enhancement of the current warehouse management system which was designed to increase the efficiency of receiving and shipping goods 
phase ii was completed in fiscal with the addition to the existing facilities of  square feet of high bay  high density space  bringing the total square footage of the distribution center to  during phase iii  which the company anticipates to be completed in fiscal  the current material handling system will be replaced with a state of the art material handing system designed to further enhance productivity by increasing automation and reducing the amount of physical handing of product 
during fiscal overflow from the direct marketing business was handled by a third party distribution center  which primarily handled internet order fulfillment for www 
brookstone 
com 
as of the close of fiscal the contract with this third party distributor was terminated 
in addition to this distribution center the company leased up to an additional  square feet in mexico  missouri to handle its distribution support functions 
the company anticipates being out of this leased space in the first half of fiscal nearly all of the company s inventory is received and distributed through this facility  which supports both the retail store and direct marketing distribution channels 
the company seeks to maintain an inventory of products in the distribution center that will ensure a sufficient supply for sale to customers 
distributions to stores are made  at a minimum  on a weekly basis predominantly via united parcel service ups 
distributions to direct marketing customers are made daily  predominantly via ups 
additionally  certain of the company s products are shipped direct to its customers by its vendors 
the facility also houses the company s direct marketing customer sales and contact center 
the company utilizes an outside customer sales and contact center to handle overflow order calls and to provide coverage during off peak hours 
efficient and effective logistics management is a primary focus for the company throughout the supply chain 
the company uses distribution control software and a sales and inventory management system 
these systems  along with the store based point of sale system and our direct marketing management system are designed to provide daily tracking of item activity and availability to the company s inventory allocation and distribution teams 
additionally  the company uses a sales forecasting and a distribution requirements planning client server based system 
this system is designed to generate weekly sales forecasts by sku by selling location to determine replenishment requirements and recommend optimal inventory purchases to the merchandise procurement team 

table of contents the company anticipates expending approximately million on phase iii of the expansion

the company anticipates spending approximately million associated with construction of the new headquarters facility in fiscal  which started construction in late fiscal in total  the company anticipates spending approximately million on the new headquarters 
including the capital expenditures listed above  the company anticipates making capital expenditures of approximately million in fiscal outlook important factors and uncertainties the private securities litigation reform act of the act provides a safe harbor for forward looking statements to encourage companies to provide prospective information about themselves without fear of litigation so long as the forward looking information is accompanied by meaningful cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward looking statement 
statements in this annual report on form k which are not historical facts  including statements about the company s or management s confidence or expectations  seasonality of the company s future sales and earnings  plans for opening new stores and other retail locations  introduction of new or updated products  opportunities for sales growth or cost reductions and other statements about the company s operational outlook  are forward looking statements subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to vary materially 
the following are important factors  among others  that should be considered in evaluating any part of this annual report on form k and these forward looking statements  as well as in evaluating the company s business prospects generally  and we hereby expressly qualify this annual report on form k and future filings with the sec unless and until we modify these cautionary statements in a future filing by the inclusion of these cautionary statements regarding future performance concentration of sales in winter holiday season 
a high percentage of the company s annual sales and all or substantially all of its annual income from operations have historically been attributable to the winter holiday selling season 
in addition  like many retailers  the company must make merchandising and inventory decisions for the winter holiday selling season well in advance of actual sales 
accordingly  unfavorable economic conditions and or deviations from projected demand for products during this season could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations for the entire fiscal year 
while the company has implemented certain measures to improve its results during periods outside of the winter holiday selling season  such as the opening of stores in airports and the development of gardeners eden stores  the company expects that its annual results of operations will remain dependent on the company s performance during the winter holiday selling season 
dependence on innovative merchandising 
successful implementation of the company s merchandising strategy depends on its ability to introduce in a timely manner new or updated products  which are affordable  functional in purpose  distinctive in quality and 
table of contents design and not widely available from other retailers 
if the company s products or substitutes for such products become widely available from other retailers especially mass retailers  department stores or discount retailers  demand for these products from the company may decline or the company may be required to reduce their retail prices 
if a competitor of the company were to offer for sale new and innovative products that the company did not offer for sale  customer demand for the company s goods could decline 
a decline in the demand for  or a reduction in the retail prices of  the company s important existing products can cause declines in the company s sales and profitability if the company is unable to introduce in a timely fashion new or replacement products of similar sales levels and profitability 
even with innovative merchandising  there remains a risk that the products will not sell at planned levels 
product risks 
although the company seeks to maintain quality standards at a high level  its products may have defects that could result in high rates of return  recalls or product liability claims 
such returns  recalls or claims could adversely affect profitability 
third parties may assert claims for patent or trademark infringement  or violation of other proprietary rights 
if successful  such claims could result in the inability to sell a particular product or  in the case of a settlement or royalty  adversely impact the profitability of the product and could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operation 
such claims could entail significant legal expenses even if they are ultimately determined to be meritless 
gardeners eden stores 
the gardeners eden stores represent an initiative by the company to develop a new store model focused on a market that is different from that of the traditional brookstone store  and to help decrease the concentration of sales in the winter holiday season by generating more sales in the spring and summer 
the success of this new model could vary based on a wide variety of factors including the selection of optimum locations  innovative merchandising  achieving profitability  accurate prediction of customer response in a new market  and the overall condition of the economy 
changes in legal or regulatory framework 
the company and its operations are subject to numerous laws  regulations and governmental policies and procedures on the international  federal  state and local levels  including  but not limited to  laws  regulations  policies  procedures  rulings  interpretations  or other governmental or quasi governmental practices  regarding corporate governance  commerce  customs  international trade  labor and employment  importation tax  securities  accounting  and other laws and regulations which are  or are found to be  applicable to the company 
changes to this legal and regulatory framework  or to any individual law or regulation  or governmental policy or procedure to which the company is now  or is determined to be in the future  is subject  could have a material impact on the company s business or result from operations 
new stores and temporary locations 
the company s ability to open new stores  including airport locations and the new gardeners eden concept stores  and to operate its temporary location program successfully depends upon  among other things  the company s capital resources and its ability to locate suitable sites  negotiate favorable 
table of contents rents and other lease terms and implement its operational strategy 
in addition  because the company s store designs must evolve over time so that the company may effectively compete for customers in top malls  airports and other retail locations  actual store related capital expenditures may vary from historical levels and projections based thereon due to such factors as the scope of remodeling projects  general increases in the costs of labor and materials and unusual product display requirements 
current retail locations 
the ten largest retail locations by sales volume in accounted for a disproportionate amount of total company retail sales during  however  the aggregate sales of the ten largest retail stores accounted for less than ten percent of the aggregate company retail sales 
the inability of the company to renew such leases or to remain in such locations and find suitable replacements in a timely manner without significant expense could have a material adverse impact on the company s retail sales and results from operations 
competition 
the company faces intense competition for customers  personnel and innovative products 
this competition comes primarily from other specialty retailers  department stores  discount retailers and direct marketers  including internet sites 
many of the company s competitors have substantially greater financial  marketing and other resources than the company 
retention of qualified employees 
the company s success depends upon its ability to attract and retain highly skilled and motivated  full time and temporary associates with appropriate retail experience to work in management and in its stores and temporary locations 
further  because of the limited time periods during which temporary locations are open each year  the availability of suitable associates for such locations is limited 
seasonal fluctuation of operating results 
the company s quarterly results of operations fluctuate based upon such factors as the amount and timing of sales contributed by new stores  the success of its temporary location program  capital expenditures and the timing and size of catalog mailings and associated expenses 
poor economic conditions 
the company s business has been and may in the future be impacted by economic conditions that tend to reduce the level of discretionary consumer spending 
these conditions include high interest rates  inflation  unemployment  stock market uncertainty  and low consumer confidence 
information and communications infrastructure 
the success of the company is dependent upon its computer hardware and software systems  and its telecommunications systems 
the internet portion of the direct marketing business relies heavily on the proper operation of these systems  as well as on the continued operation of the external components of the internet  to market goods and to receive and process orders 
the retail business utilizes point of sale computers located in the stores 
the company s headquarters and distribution center rely on a wide variety of applications to carry on the business 
these systems are subject to damage from natural disasters  power failures  hardware and software failures  security breaches  network failures  computer viruses and 
table of contents operator negligence 
should one of these systems fail or be inadequate to support future growth  the company s results could be materially and adversely impacted 
the company is also dependent on certain vendors of its key information systems 
should these vendors experience financial difficulties  the support of these key systems could be negatively impacted 
centralized distribution 
the company conducts the majority of its distribution operations and a significant portion of its direct marketing processing functions from multiple facilities in mexico  missouri 
a disruption in operations at the distribution center or its third party distributors may significantly increase the company s distribution costs and prevent goods from flowing to stores and customers 
the company utilizes third party carriers for its product shipments 
the distribution of products is vulnerable to disruption from employee strikes and labor unrest  in particular  potential strikes by ups employees and or longshoremen  which could increase costs and impede or restrict the supply of goods
