item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in management s discussion and analysis are the following sections overview of critical accounting policies results of operations and outlook for and beyond liquidity and capital resources commitments and off balance sheet arrangements other matters new accounting pronouncements in the discussions that follow  we will focus on two measures that we use to manage the business and to review the results of our operations 
those two measures are segment margin and available cash 
our profitability depends to a significant extent upon our ability to maximize segment margin 
segment margin is calculated as revenues less cost of sales and operating expense  and does not include depreciation and amortization 
a reconciliation of segment margin to income from continuing operations is included in our segment disclosures in note to the consolidated financial statements 
available cash is a non gaap liquidity measure calculated as net income with several adjustments  the most significant of which are the elimination of gains and losses on asset sales  except those from the sale of surplus assets  the addition of non cash expenses such as depreciation  and the subtraction of maintenance capital expenditures  which are expenditures to sustain existing cash flows but not to provide new sources of revenues 
for additional information on available cash and a reconciliation of this measure to cash flows from operations  see non gaap financial measure below 
overview of genesis energy  lp is a delaware limited partnership that is publicly traded on the american stock exchange 
we operate through genesis crude oil  lp  and its subsidiary partnerships  genesis pipeline texas  lp and genesis pipeline  usa  lp our operations are managed through our general partner  genesis energy  inc  a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of denbury resources inc the general partner holds a general partner interest and a limited partner interest and public unitholders hold an aggregate limited partner interest in genesis energy  lp we operate in three business segments crude oil gathering and marketing  crude oil pipeline transportation and co marketing 
our revenues are earned by selling crude oil and co and by charging fees for the transportation of crude oil on our pipelines 
our focus is on the margin we earn on these revenues  which is calculated by subtracting the costs of the crude oil  the costs of transporting the crude oil and co to the customer  and the costs of operating our assets 
our primary goal is to generate available cash for our unitholders 
this available cash is then distributed quarterly to our unitholders 
we are pleased with the progress we made in toward our goal of generating more stable sources of available cash 
two significant actions that we took in toward this goal were disposing of our texas gulf coast operations purchasing a co volumetric production payment and related marketing contracts 
during the fourth quarter of  we closed the sale of portions of our texas gulf coast operations to teppco crude pipeline  lp we also sold portions of our texas pipeline system that we idled in to blackhawk pipeline  lp we abandoned in place other portions of the texas pipeline system 
the sale of these operations was the result of an initiative we started in to evaluate our pipeline systems to determine which segments  if any  should be sold  idled or abandoned to reduce costs or risks of operation  and which segments we should invest in for future growth 
as a result of these actions we recorded a gain on the disposal of these discontinued operations of million 
the sale of the texas gulf coast operations to teppco benefited both parties almost immediately 
teppco realized benefits from integrating these assets into their existing south texas pipeline system 
by selling these assets  we reduced projected maintenance expenditures by million and eliminated potential risks to the continuation of our revenue stream that may have resulted from consolidation of pipeline assets in the area 
we believe that these assets had more long term strategic benefit to teppco than to us 
the pipeline segments sold to blackhawk were assets that we idled in due to declining volumes and or risks of operation 
we received no proceeds from this sale 
by making the sale to blackhawk  we eliminated costs of maintaining the assets 
blackhawk intends to convert the pipeline segments to natural gas service 
the segments we abandoned in place had not been in service since and this abandonment reduces our costs for monitoring and maintenance 
additionally  this abandonment helped to offset tax gains allocated to our unitholders from the sale to teppco 
the carbon dioxide co volumetric production payment we purchased enables us to commence a wholesale co marketing operation 
we acquired this production payment  as well as related long term co industrial sales contracts  from denbury 
while this co operation will have some seasonality  the cash flows from this operation will be much less volatile than those of our existing crude oil gathering and marketing operation 
the funds to acquire this production payment came from the million received from teppco for the sale of the texas gulf coast operations and the issuance of  limited partner units to our general partner in exchange for million 
our continuing operations did not perform as well as expected 
volatility in p plus market prices for crude oil has historically created fluctuations in our segment margins 
during  we experienced positive results when p plus market prices increased in the early part of the year  however  a precipitous decline in segment margin during the latter half of the year offset some of the segment margin earned in the first half of the year 
revenues from our pipeline transportation operations increased primarily due to tariff increases in and critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities  if any  at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
although we believe these estimates are reasonable  actual results could differ from those estimates 
significant accounting policies that we employ are presented in the notes to the consolidated financial statements see note summary of significant accounting policies 
critical accounting policies and estimates are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial results and positions 
these policies require management s judgment and often employ the use of information that is inherently uncertain 
our most critical accounting policies pertain to revenue and expense accruals  pipeline loss allowance recognition  depreciation  amortization and impairment of long lived assets and contingent and environmental liabilities 
these policies are discussed below 
revenue and expense accruals information needed to record our revenues is generally available to allow us to record substantially all of our revenue generating transactions based on actual information 
the accruals that we are required to make for revenues are generally insignificant 
we routinely make accruals for expenses due to the timing of receiving third party information and reconciling that information to our records 
these accruals can include some crude oil purchase costs and expenses for operating our assets such as contractor charges for goods and services provided 
for crude oil purchases transported on our trucks or our pipelines  we have access to the volumetric and pricing data so that we can record these transactions based on actual information 
accounting for crude oil purchases that involve third party transportation services sometimes require us to make estimates  as the necessary volumetric data is not available within the timeframe needed 
by balancing our crude oil purchase and sales volumes with the change in our inventory positions  we believe we can make reasonable estimates of the unavailable data 
the provisions of sfas no 
 as amended  require that estimates be made of the effectiveness of derivatives as hedges and the fair value of derivatives 
the actual results of the transactions involving the derivative instruments will most likely differ from the estimates 
we make very limited use of derivative instruments  however  when we do  we base these estimates on information obtained from third parties and from our own internal records 
we believe our estimates for revenue and expense items are reasonable  but there can be no assurance that actual amounts will not vary from estimated amounts 
pipeline loss allowance recognition numerous factors can cause crude oil volumes to expand and contract 
these factors include temperature of both the crude oil and the surrounding atmosphere and the quality of the crude oil  in addition to inherent imprecision of measurement equipment 
as a result of these factors  crude oil volumes fluctuate  which can result in losses in volumes of crude oil in the custody of the pipeline that belongs to the shippers 
in order to compensate the pipeline for bearing the risk of actual losses in volumes that occur  the pipeline generally has established in its tariffs the right to make volumetric deductions from the shippers for quality and volumetric fluctuations 
these deductions are referred to as pipeline loss allowances 
these allowances are compared to the actual volumetric gains and losses of the pipeline and the net gain or loss is recorded as revenue or expense  based on prevailing market prices at that time 
when net gains occur  the pipeline company has crude oil inventory 
when net losses occur  any recorded inventory on hand is reduced and the pipeline records a liability for the purchase of crude oil that it must make to replace the lost volumes 
inventories are reflected in the financial statements at the lower of the recorded value or the market value at the balance sheet date 
liabilities to replace crude oil are valued at current market prices 
the crude oil in inventory can then be sold  resulting in additional revenue if the sales price exceeds the inventory value 
future pipeline loss allowance revenue cannot be predicted  as it depends on factors beyond management s control such as the crude oil quality and temperatures  as well as crude oil market prices 
depreciation  amortization and impairment of long lived assets in order to calculate depreciation and amortization we must estimate the useful lives of our fixed assets at the time the assets are placed in service 
calculation of the useful life of an asset is based on our experience with similar assets 
experience  however  can cause us to change our estimates  thus impacting the future calculation of depreciation and amortization 
when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable  we review our assets for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we compare the carrying value of the fixed asset to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated from that asset 
estimates of future net cash flows include estimating future volumes  future margins or tariff rates  future operating costs and other estimates and assumptions consistent with our business plans 
should the undiscounted future cash flows be less than the carrying value  we record an impairment charge to reflect the asset at fair value 
liability and contingency accruals we accrue reserves for contingent liabilities including environmental remediation and potential legal claims 
when our assessment indicates that it is probable that a liability has occurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated  accruals are made 
our estimates are based on all known facts at the time and our assessment of the ultimate outcome  including consultation with external experts and counsel 
these estimates are revised as additional information is obtained or resolution is achieved 
in  we recorded an estimate of million for the potential liability for fines related to the crude oil spill in december from our mississippi pipeline system 
after assessing information obtained in meetings with the government  this estimate was increased to a total of million in we also make estimates related to future payments for environmental costs to remediate existing conditions attributable to past operations 
environmental costs include costs for studies and testing as well as remediation and restoration 
these estimates are sometimes made with the assistance of third parties involved in monitoring the remediation effort 
we have recorded an estimate for the additional costs expected to be incurred to complete the remediation of the site of the mississippi crude oil pipeline spill 
this estimate is based upon expectations of the additional work to be performed to meet regulatory requirements and restore the site 
because the costs of remediation and restoration for this spill are covered by insurance  we record a receivable from the insurers for a similar amount 
we believe our estimates for contingent liabilities are reasonable  but there can be no assurance that actual amounts will not vary from estimated amounts

segment margins from gathering and marketing operations are a function of volumes purchased and the difference between the price of crude oil at the point of purchase and the price of crude oil at the point of sale  minus the associated costs of aggregation and transportation 
the absolute price levels for crude oil do not necessarily bear a relationship to segment margin as absolute price levels normally impact revenues and cost of sales by equivalent amounts 
because period to period variations in revenues and cost of sales are not generally meaningful in analyzing the variation in segment margin for gathering and marketing operations  such changes are not addressed in the following discussion 
in our gathering and marketing business  we seek to purchase and sell crude oil at points along the distribution chain where we can achieve positive margins 
we generally purchase crude oil at prevailing prices from producers at the wellhead under short term contracts 
we then transport the crude along the distribution chain for sale to or exchange with customers 
additionally  we enter into exchange transactions with third parties  generally only when the cost of the exchange is less than the alternate cost we would incur in transporting or storing the crude oil 
in addition  we often exchange one grade of crude oil for another to maximize margins or meet contract delivery requirements 
prior to the first quarter of  we purchased crude oil in bulk at major pipeline terminal points 
these bulk and exchange transactions were characterized by large volumes and narrow profit margins on purchases and sales 
generally  as we purchase crude oil  we simultaneously establish a margin by selling crude oil for physical delivery to third party users  such as independent refiners or major oil companies 
through these transactions  we seek to maintain a position that is substantially balanced between crude oil purchases  on the one hand  and sales or future delivery obligations  on the other hand 
it is our policy not to hold crude oil  futures contracts or other derivative products for the purpose of speculating on crude oil price changes 
a significant factor affecting our gathering and marketing segment margins is the change in domestic production of crude oil 
short term and long term price trends impact the amount of capital that oil producers have available to maintain existing production and to invest in developing crude reserves  which in turn impacts the amount of crude oil that is available to be gathered and marketed by us and our competitors 
during the last two years  posted prices for west texas intermediate crude oil have ranged from a low near per barrel to a high of per barrel 
the volatility in prices over the last two years makes it very difficult to estimate the volume of crude oil available to purchase 
we expect to continue to be subject to volatility and long term declines in the availability of crude oil production for purchase 
crude oil prices in the united states are impacted by both international factors as well as domestic factors 
international factors such as wars and conflicts  instability of foreign governments  and labor strikes affect prices  as do the influences in the us of environmental regulations and the supply of domestic production 
an increase in the market price of crude oil does not impact us to the extent many people expect 
when market prices for oil increase  we must pay more for crude oil  but we normally are able to sell it for more 
most of our contracts for the purchase and sale of crude oil have components in the pricing provisions such that the price paid or received is adjusted for changes in the market price for crude oil 
often the pricing in a contract to purchase crude oil will consist of the market price component and a bonus  which is generally a fixed amount ranging from a few cents to several dollars 
typically the pricing in a contract to sell crude oil will consist of the market price component and a bonus that is not fixed  but instead is based on another market factor 
this floating bonus is usually the price quoted by platt s for wti p plus 
because the bonus for purchases of crude oil is fixed and p plus floats in the sales contracts  the margin on individual transactions can vary from month to month depending on changes in the p plus component 
p plus does not necessarily move in correlation with the price of crude oil in the market 
p plus is affected by numerous factors such as future expectations for changes in crude oil prices  such that crude oil prices can be rising  but p plus can be decreasing 
the table below shows the average p plus and the average posted price for west texas intermediate wti as posted by koch supply trading  lp by quarter in  and  based on the simple averaging of the monthly averages 
quarter p plus wti posting first second third fourth first second third fourth first second third fourth as can be seen from this table  changes in p plus do not necessarily correspond to changes in the market price of oil 
an example is the decline in p plus between the third and fourth quarters of when the wti posting increased 
this unpredictable volatility in p plus can create volatility in our earnings 
a few purchase contracts and some sale contracts also include a component for grade differentials 
the grade refers to the type of crude oil 
crude oils from different wells and areas can have different chemical compositions 
these different grades of crude oil will appeal to different customers depending on the processing capabilities of the refineries that ultimately process the crude oil 
we may buy crude oil under a contract where we considered the typical grade differences in the market when we set the fixed bonus 
if we then sell the oil under a contract with a floating grade differential in the formula  and that grade differential fluctuates  then we can experience an increase or decrease in our margin from that oil purchase and sale 
the table below shows the grade differential between west texas intermediate grade crude oil and west texas sour grade crude oil  using the monthly averages for each quarter of  and  and the differential between west texas intermediate grade crude oil and light louisiana sweet grade crude oil for the same periods 
wti wts wti lls quarter differential differential first second third fourth first second third fourth first second third fourth as can be seen from this table  the wti wts market differential varied from per barrel in the third quarter of to per barrel in second quarter of the wti lls market differential varied from a negative per barrel in the third quarter of to a positive in the first quarter of this volatility in grade differentials can affect the volatility of our gathering and marketing segment margin 
our purchase and sales contracts are primarily evergreen contracts  which means they continue from month to month unless one of the parties to the contract gives days notice of cancellation 
in order to change the pricing in a fixed bonus contract  we would have to give days notice that we want to cancel or renegotiate the contract 
this notice time requirement  therefore  means that at least a month will pass before the fixed bonus can be reduced to correspond with a decrease in the p plus component of the related sales contract 
in this case  our margin would be reduced until such a change is made 
because of the volatility of p plus  it is not practical to renegotiate every purchase contract for every change in p plus 
so segment margins from the sale of the crude oil may be volatile as a result of these timing differences 
another factor that can contribute to volatility in our earnings is inventory management 
generally contracts for the purchase of crude oil will state that we will buy all of the production for the month from a particular well 
we generally aggregate the volumes purchased from numerous wells and deliver it into a pipeline where we sell the crude oil to a third party 
while oil producers can make estimates of the volume of oil that their wells will produce in a month  they cannot state absolutely how much oil will be produced 
our sales contracts typically state a specific volume to be sold 
consequently  if a well produces more than expected  we will purchase volumes in a month that we have not contracted to sell 
these volumes are then held as inventory and are sold in a later month 
should the market price of crude oil fluctuate while we have these inventory volumes  we may have to recognize a loss in our financial statements should the market price fall below the cost of the inventory 
should market prices rise  then we will realize a gain when we sell the unexpected volume of inventory in a later month at higher prices 
we make every effort to limit our exposure to these price fluctuations by minimizing inventory volumes 
year ended december  as compared to year ended december  gathering and marketing segment margins decreased million or to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  a percent decrease in wellhead  bulk and exchange purchase volumes between and  resulting in a million decrease in segment margin  was the primary reason for this decrease 
factors offsetting this decrease were a million increase in segment margin due to an increase in the average difference between the price of crude oil at the point of purchase and the price of crude oil at the point of sale  and a million decrease in field operating costs  primarily from a million decrease in payroll and benefits  offset by a million increase in repair costs 
the decreased payroll related costs can be attributed to an approximate percent decrease in the wellhead volumes 
the increase in repair costs is attributable primarily to repairs at truck unloading stations 
although p plus declined significantly in the latter half of  the average for of per barrel was higher than the average for of per barrel 
this price increase was not enough however to offset the decline in volumes 
we changed our business model in to substantially eliminate our bulk and exchange activity due to the relatively low margins and high credit requirements for these transactions 
additionally  we reviewed our wellhead purchase contracts to determine whether margins under those contracts would support higher credit costs 
in some cases  contracts were cancelled 
these volume reductions began in late and continued into the first half of volumes beginning in the third quarter of have remained relatively stable at an average of  barrels per day 
for the fourth quarter of  daily volumes were  barrels 
the change in our business model was the primary reason crude oil gathering and marketing volumes decreased by 
field operating costs primarily consist of the costs to operate our fleet of trucks used to transport crude oil  and the costs to maintain the trucks and assets used in the crude oil gathering operation 
approximately of these costs are variable and decline when volumes decline 
such costs include payroll and benefits as drivers are paid on a commission basis based on volumes  maintenance costs for the trucks as we lease the trucks under full service maintenance contracts under which we pay a maintenance fee per mile driven  and fuel costs 
fixed costs include the base lease payment for the vehicle  insurance costs and costs for environmental and safety related items 
year ended december  as compared to year ended december  gathering and marketing segment margins increased million or to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  the factors increasing segment margin were an million increase in segment margin due to an increase in the average difference between the price of crude oil at the point of purchase and the price of crude oil at the point of sale  and an million decrease in credit costs primarily due to the reduction in bulk and exchange transactions 
largely offsetting these increases were a percent decrease in wellhead  bulk and exchange purchase volumes between and  resulting in a decrease in segment margin of million  and a million increase in field operating costs  primarily from a million increase in payroll and benefits  a million increase in repair costs  a million increase in vehicle lease costs  and a million increase in insurance costs 
the increased payroll related costs can be attributed to an increase in benefit costs and an increase in the miles driven in our trucks 
the increased lease costs are attributable to increases in the number of vehicles and in the miles driven 
the increase in repair costs is attributable primarily to repairs at truck unloading stations 
the increased insurance costs reflect a combination of changes in the insurance market and our loss history 
as discussed previously  we eliminated transactions with low margins and high credit costs 
these volume reductions were the primary reasons gathering and marketing volumes decreased by in the period 
outlook for and beyond volatility in p plus will continue 
during  we expect our crude oil gathering and marketing business to generate at least as much segment margin as it did in  however  no assurance can be made that this will occur 
our plans include increasing volumes by acquiring new production and production currently being gathered by other parties 
crude oil pipeline operations we operate three common carrier pipeline systems in a five state area 
we refer to these pipelines as our texas system  mississippi system and jay system 
volumes shipped on these systems for the last three years are as follows barrels per day pipeline system texas    mississippi    jay    in  we sold or abandoned significant portions of our texas system 
the segments we retained and continue to operate are from west columbia to webster  cullen junction to webster  and from webster to texas city  and webster to a shipper s facility in houston 
information on the segments sold or abandoned is discussed in the section discontinued operations below 
the following information pertains only to continuing operations 
volumes on our texas system averaged  barrels per day in the crude oil that enters our system comes to us at west columbia and cullen junction where we have connections to teppco s south texas system and at webster where we have a connection with another pipeline 
under the terms of our sale to teppco of portions of the pipeline  we have a joint tariff with teppco through september under which we earn per barrel on the majority of the barrels we deliver to the shipper s facilities and per barrel on heavier crude oil we deliver 
most of the volume being shipped on our texas system goes to three refineries on the texas gulf coast 
we are still shipping most of the same volumes that we were shipping before the sale to teppco  however our tariff revenue is much less than before the sale  as we ship the crude oil a shorter distance 
the mississippi system is best analyzed in two segments 
the first segment is the portion of the pipeline that begins in soso  ms and extends to liberty  ms 
at liberty  shippers can transfer the crude oil to a connection to capline  a pipeline system that moves crude oil from the gulf coast to refineries in the midwest 
the segment from soso to liberty has also been improved to handle the increased volumes produced by denbury and transported on the pipeline 
in order to handle future increases in production volumes in the area that are expected  we have made capital expenditures for tank  station and pipeline improvements and we will need to make further improvements 
see capital expenditures under liquidity and capital resources below 
the second segment of the pipeline from liberty to near baton rouge  la has been out of service since february  while a connecting carrier tested its pipeline 
the connecting carrier has decided not to reactivate its pipeline  so we will displace the crude oil in this segment with inhibited water until the connecting carrier either make repairs or we identify an alternative use for this segment 
the cost of this displacement is being paid for by the owner of the crude oil 
in  this segment made no contribution to pipeline revenues 
in and  this segment of pipeline contributed million and million  respectively  to pipeline revenues 
volumes on this segment in were over  barrels per day 
the jay pipeline system in florida alabama ships crude oil from fields with relatively short remaining production lives 
volumes have declined from an annual average of  per day in  to  in to  in many of the costs to operate our pipeline are fixed costs  including the costs of compliance with environmental regulations and the costs of insurance  so the decline in volumes has necessitated increases in tariffs 
the only shipper on the largest portion of the pipeline has agreed to tariff rate increases in and that have helped offset the declines in the volumes and increased costs of operating this pipeline 
historically  the largest operating costs in our crude oil pipeline segment have consisted of personnel costs  power costs  maintenance costs and costs of compliance with regulations 
some of these costs are not predictable  such as failures of equipment  or are not within our control  like power cost increases 
we perform regular maintenance on our assets to keep them in good operational condition to minimize any cost increases 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  pipeline segment margin decreased million or to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  the factors decreasing pipeline segment margin were a percent decrease in throughput between the two years  resulting in a revenue decrease of million  and a million increase in pipeline operating costs in in the third quarter we recorded an asset retirement obligation of million related to an offshore pipeline 
pipeline operating costs increased million for personnel and benefits costs related to addition as of operations staff in mississippi and additions of staff engineers  and million for costs associated with work vehicles for the new staff 
costs associated with maintenance of right of ways  including clearing of tree canopies  and costs for testing under pipeline integrity regulations increased a combined million 
in  we increased safety training for pipeline operations personnel at a cost of million 
insurance costs increased million due to the combination of insurance market conditions and our loss history 
other operating costs  including power costs increased a total of million 
partially offsetting these decreases were the following factors a percent increase in the average tariff on shipments resulting in a million increase in revenue  and a million increase in revenues from sales of pipeline loss allowance barrels primarily as a result of higher crude oil market prices resulting in more revenue on these volumes 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  pipeline segment margin increased million or to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  the factors increasing pipeline segment margin were a percent increase in the average tariff on shipments resulting in a million increase in revenue  and a million increase in revenues from sales of pipeline loss allowance barrels primarily as a result of revising pipeline tariffs to increase the amount of the pipeline loss allowance imposed on shippers  and the recognition of pipeline loss allowance volumes  measurement gains net of measurement losses  and crude quality deductions as inventory 
partially offsetting these increases were an percent decrease in throughput between the two years  resulting in a revenue decrease of million  and a million increase in pipeline operating costs in primarily due to greater expenditures for personnel and benefits  for maintenance of right of ways including clearing of tree canopies and costs associated with residential and commercial development around our pipelines  for testing under the pipeline integrity management regulations  for tank and station maintenance projects  for safety  training and related projects  for liability and property damage insurance  offset by lower costs for remote monitoring and control 
personnel and benefits costs increased million primarily as a result of additions to the operations staff in mississippi and costs associated with work vehicles for the new staff added million 
costs associated with maintenance of right of ways and testing under pipeline integrity regulations increased a combined million 
in  we increased safety training for our pipeline operations personnel at a cost of million 
additionally we undertook a project to add global positioning satellite information to our pipeline maps as required pursuant to pipeline safety regulations 
expenses incurred on this project in totaled million 
insurance costs increased by million due to the combination of insurance market conditions and our loss history 
our remote monitoring and control costs were lower by million as we completed the transition in early from a more expensive service 
outlook for and beyond after september  we may continue to provide capacity to transport crude oil on our texas system from webster to texas city and houston 
we expect to cease using the west columbia to webster segment and the cullen junction to webster segment for crude oil service  as volumes shipped do not support the costs we would expect to incur to test and repair those segments of pipeline under the integrity management regulations 
see discussion of the integrity management regulations in safety regulation under in item 
if we continue to ship crude oil from webster after september  we would expect that we will receive it at webster from new connections to other pipelines and receive less tariff income from those shipments than we are receiving under the current joint tariff with teppco 
we are also examining strategic opportunities to place the remaining segments in alternative service after the arrangement with teppco expires 
we expect that volumes may decline in as refiners on the texas gulf coast compete for crude oil with other markets connected to teppco s pipeline systems  however  those effects may not occur until the summer of when teppco finishes its integration and connection of the segments acquired from us 
as discussed above  the primary shipper on the segment of our mississippi pipeline from liberty to near baton rouge advised us in february that it does not have plans to reinstate shipments on this segment of pipeline 
we currently plan to temporarily idle this segment of pipeline by removing the crude oil from the line while we evaluate future plans for this segment 
any future plans in crude oil service will require sufficient volumes being available to be transported on this segment of pipeline to justify the costs to perform the integrity testing and possible upgrading that may be necessary as a result of that testing 
future plans for this segment may include transportation of petroleum products or natural gas 
denbury is the largest oil and gas producer in mississippi 
our mississippi pipeline is adjacent to several of denbury s existing and prospective oil fields 
there may be mutual benefits to denbury and us due to this common production and transportation area 
because of this relationship  we may be able to obtain certain commitments for increased crude oil volumes  while denbury may obtain the certainty of transportation for its oil production at competitive market rates 
as denbury continues to acquire and develop old oil fields using co based tertiary recovery operations  denbury would expect to add crude oil gathering and co supply infrastructure to these fields 
further  as the fields are developed over time  it may create increased demand for our crude oil transportation services 
the production shipped from oil fields surrounding our jay system is a combination of new fields with estimated short production lives and older fields that have been producing for twenty to thirty years and are in the late stages of economic life 
we believe that the highest and best use of the jay system would be to convert it to natural gas service 
we continue to review strategic alternatives with other parties in the region to explore this opportunity 
this initiative is in a very preliminary stage 
part of the process will involve finding alternative methods for us to continue to provide crude oil transportation services in the area 
while we believe this initiative has long term potential  it is not expected to have a substantial impact on us during or pipeline segment margins from continuing operations should remain flat or decline slightly in we expect volume increases on the mississippi system and the tariff increases on the jay system to substantially offset increases in fixed costs  including the costs for testing under the integrity management program 
carbon dioxide co operations in november  we acquired a volumetric production payment of bcf of co from denbury 
denbury owns trillion cubic feet of estimated proved reserves of co in the jackson dome area near jackson  mississippi 
in addition to the production payment  denbury also assigned to us three of their existing long term co contracts with industrial customers 
denbury owns the pipeline that is used to transport the co to our customers as well as to its own tertiary recovery operations 
the industrial customers treat the co and transport it to their own customers 
the primary industrial applications of co by these customers include beverage carbonation and food chilling and freezing 
based on denbury s experience  we can expect some seasonality in our sales of co  as the dominant months for beverage carbonation and freezing food are from april to october  when warm weather drives up demand for beverages and the approaching holidays increase demand for frozen foods 
the average daily mcf for each month in  and purchased under these contracts was as follows month january    february    march    april    may    june    july    august    september    october    november    december    the volumetric production payment entitles us to a maximum daily quantity of co of  million cubic feet mcf per day through december    mcf per day for the calendar years through  and  mcf per day beginning in until we have received all volumes under the production payment 
under the terms of a transportation agreement with denbury  denbury will process and deliver this co to our industrial customers and receive a fee from us of per mcf  subject to inflationary adjustments  for those transportation services 
the terms of the contracts with the industrial customers include minimum take or pay and maximum delivery volumes 
the maximum daily contract quantity per year in the contracts totals  mcf 
under the minimum take or pay volumes  the customers must purchase a total of  mcf per day whether received or not 
any volume purchased under the take or pay provision in any year can then be recovered in a future year as long as the minimum requirement is met in that year 
in the three years ended december   all three customers have purchased more than their minimum take or pay quantities  as can be seen in the table above 
the three industrial contracts extend through  and the sales contracts contain provisions for inflationary adjustments to sales prices based on the producer price index  with a minimum price 
during the two months we owned the co assets in  we earned revenues of million and segment margin of million 
we expect to generate approximately million of annual segment margin from this business during the first five years 
the purchase of these assets provides us with diversity in our asset base and a stable long term source of cash flow 
discontinued operations in the fourth quarter of  we sold a significant portion of our texas pipeline system and the related crude oil gathering and marketing operations to teppco crude oil  lp additionally we sold other segments of our texas pipeline system that had been idled in to blackhawk pipeline  lp  an affiliate of multifuels  inc 
we received no proceeds from the sale to blackhawk 
other remaining segments not sold to these parties were abandoned in place 
the sale of these assets was the result of an initiative started in to evaluate our pipeline systems to determine which segments  if any  should be sold  idled or abandoned to reduce costs and risks of operation 
as a result of this evaluation we determined that parts of our texas gulf coast operations were of more strategic value to teppco than to us 
we also determined that other segments of the texas gulf coast operations had little value and should be abandoned in place or sold to reduce costs or risks 
by selling these assets  we eliminated approximately million of capital expenditures that we might have had to make depending on the results of imp testing 
teppco paid us million for the assets it acquired 
we incurred transaction costs of million which reduced the net proceeds to million 
teppco also assumed responsibility for million of unpaid royalties related to the crude oil purchase and sale contracts it assumed 
we entered into various agreements with teppco including a a transitional services agreement whereby gelp will provide the use of certain assets that teppco did not acquire and pipeline monitoring services at least through april   and b a joint tariff agreement whereby teppco will invoice and collect and share with us the tariffs for transportation on the pipeline being sold and the segments we retained at least through october  we also agreed not to compete with teppco in a county area in texas surrounding the pipeline for a five year period 
we retained responsibility for environmental matters related to the operations sold to teppco for the period prior to the sale date  subject to certain conditions 
teppco will pay the first  for each environmental claim up to an aggregate of  we would be responsible for any environmental claim in excess of that amount up to an aggregate total of million 
teppco has purchased an environmental insurance policy for amounts in excess of our million responsibility and we reimbursed teppco for one half of the policy premium 
our responsibility to indemnify teppco for environmental matters in connection with this transaction will cease in ten years 
we do not expect the effects of this indemnification to have a material effect on our results of operations in the future 
during  we recorded million in termination benefits related to this sale 
these benefits included retention bonuses and severance pay for employees affected by the sale 
under the terms of the sale to blackhawk  we agreed to provide transition services through march  these transition services are not significant as the pipeline is idle 
we retained responsibility for any environmental matters related to the pipeline segments acquired by blackhawk through december   however that responsibility will cease in ten years 
operating results from the discontinued operations for the years ended december   and were as follows year ended december  revenues gathering and marketing    pipeline    total revenues    costs and expenses crude costs    field operating costs    pipeline operating costs    general and administrative depreciation and amortization    change in fair value of derivatives net gain on disposal of surplus assets impairment of long lived assets  total costs and expenses    operating income from discontinued operations   net proceeds from asset sales  net book value of assets sold  gain on disposal of assets  income from operations from discontinued texas system before minority interests    year ended december  compared with year ended december  revenues less crude costs and pipeline and field operating costs from discontinued operations in declined by million  with million of the decline resulting from crude oil gathering and marketing operations  and the remainder from pipeline operations 
margin from discontinued crude oil gathering and marketing operations declined due to the following an million decrease in margin due to an decrease in the average difference between the price of crude oil at the point of purchase and the price of crude oil at the point of sale  a percent decrease in wellhead  bulk and exchange purchase volumes between and  resulting in a million decrease in margin  and a million increase in field operating costs from termination benefits 
pipeline margin from discontinued operations decreased by million due to the following a percent decrease in the average tariff on shipments resulting in a million decrease in revenue  an percent decrease in throughput between the two years  resulting in a million revenue decrease  and a million increase in pipeline operating costs in included in the pipeline operating costs in is million for demolition and disposal costs for tanks and other equipment that were not sold and no longer had any use to us 
we chose to perform this demolition in to reduce the taxable gain that would be allocated to many of our unitholders from the sale to teppco 
also included in is million for termination benefits incurred as a result of the sale to teppco 
other operating costs increased a total of million 
these decreases were partially offset by a million increase in revenues from sales of pipeline loss allowance barrels primarily as a result of higher crude oil market prices 
general and administrative expenses include the direct costs of individuals involved only with the assets sold 
the decrease in these costs resulted from the termination of those persons from our employment as a result of the sale 
the increase in depreciation in as compared to resulted from the elimination of the remaining book value of assets not sold that no longer had any use to us 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  revenues less crude costs and pipeline and field operating costs from discontinued operations in declined by million 
this amount is the net result of a million decrease in margin from crude oil gathering and marketing operations  and a million increase in margin from pipeline operations 
margin from crude oil gathering and marketing operations declined due to the following a percent decrease in wellhead  bulk and exchange purchase volumes between and  resulting in a decrease in margin of million  and million increases in both field operating and credit costs 
partially offsetting these decreases was a million increase in margin due to a decrease in the average difference between the price of crude oil at the point of purchase and the price of crude oil at the point of sale 
pipeline margin increased by million due to the following a percent increase of in the average tariff on shipments resulting in a million increase in revenue  a percent increase in throughput between the two years  resulting in a million revenue increase  and an increase in revenues from sales of pipeline loss allowance barrels of million primarily as a result of higher crude oil market prices resulting in more revenue on these volumes 
partially offsetting these increases was a million increase in pipeline operating costs in these increases included a million increase in costs associated with maintenance of right of ways and testing under pipeline integrity regulations  tank and station maintenance expenses increased million and safety training for our pipeline operations personnel increased million 
insurance costs increased million and the mapping project added million to costs 
in  we recorded impairment of related to the assets that were sold or abandoned in this impairment reduced the depreciation recorded in other costs and interest year ended december  compared with year ended december  general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased million in from the level 
corporate governance costs including legal and consultant costs related to compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of  increased directors fees and higher directors and officers insurance costs added million 
other general and administrative costs increased by million 
two other factors contributing to this increase were the write off of million of unamortized legal and consultant costs related to credit agreement with citicorp and a non cash charge of million related to our new stock appreciation rights program for employees and directors see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the write off of unamortized costs was necessitated by the replacement of the citicorp credit facility in with a credit facility with fleet national bank 
under our bonus program  bonuses were eliminated unless distributions were being paid  which resulted in no accrual in we expect general and administrative expenses in to remain level with those of consultant costs related to the internal documentation and assessment provisions of the sarbanes oxley act are expected to increase over levels  offsetting the write off of credit facility costs 
change in fair value of derivatives 
we designated our contracts as normal purchases and sales under the provisions for that treatment in sfas no 
we did not engage in any derivative transactions during  and would expect to do so in only as needed 
during  the fair value of the partnership s net asset for derivatives decreased by million 
other operating charges 
in  we reached an agreement in principle with the federal and state regulatory authorities regarding the fines we would pay related to the spill that occurred in december in mississippi 
the cost to us under the agreement is expected to be million 
in the fourth quarter of we accrued million for this potential fine and in the third quarter of another million was accrued 
interest expense  net 
in  our net interest expense decreased by million 
the primary factor was a decrease in march of the size of our credit facility from million to million 
in  the larger amount of the credit facility resulted in higher commitment fees 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses decreased million in from the level 
changes in personnel costs primarily due to the elimination of bulk and exchange activities reduced general and administrative expenses million  and charges from our bonus program were million less in the remaining decrease of million is attributable to decreases in expenses for legal  tax and other professional services  offset by small increases in administrative insurance costs and contract labor costs 
depreciation  amortization and impairment 
depreciation and amortization expense decreased million in from the level 
as a result of the impairment of our pipeline assets in  the value to be depreciated was reduced 
the impairment recorded in was million and related primarily to goodwill 
change in fair value of derivatives 
as a result of the significant reduction in our bulk and exchange activities at december   and a review of contracts existing at december   we determined that substantially all of our contracts did not meet the requirement for treatment as derivative contracts under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities as amended and interpreted 
the contracts were designated as normal purchases and sales under the provisions for that treatment in sfas no 
as a result  the fair value of the partnership s net asset for derivatives decreased by million in net gain on disposal of surplus assets 
in  we disposed of our seats on the nymex for million  resulting in a gain of million 
the changes we made in our business model to reduce our bulk and exchange activities eliminated our reasons for owning the nymex seats 
additionally  in  we sold surplus land  a building and surplus vehicles  resulting in additional cumulative net gains of million 
in  we leased our tractor trailer fleet from ryder transportation services 
the majority of the existing fleet was sold in and cash proceeds of million and a gain of million in were realized in from this sale 
interest expense  net 
in  the partnership had an increase in its net interest expense of million 
in  the partnership paid commitment fees on the unused portion of its million facility with bnp paribas 
in the period  the partnership paid commitment fees on the unused portion of its credit facility of million in the first pat of the year and million thereafter 
the larger amount of the credit facility resulted in substantially higher commitment fees in liquidity and capital resources cash flows our primary sources of cash flows are operations  credit facilities  and in  proceeds from the sale of a portion of our operations 
additionally in  we issued limited partner interests to our general partner and received cash 
our primary uses of cash flows are capital expenditures and distributions 
a summary of our cash flows for the years ended december   and is as follows in thousands year ended december  cash provided by used in operating activities    investing activities    financing activities    operating 
net cash from operating activities for each year have been comprised of the following in thousands year ended december  net income    depreciation  amortization and impairment    gain on sales of assets  derivative related non cash adjustments   other non cash items   changes in components of working capital  net    net cash from operating activities    our operating cash flows are affected significantly by changes in items of working capital 
we have had situations where other parties have prepaid for purchases or paid more than was due  resulting in fluctuations in one period as compared to the next until the party recovers the excess payment 
while this happens infrequently  we did incorrectly receive million in that was not repaid until during the period while we were actively engaged in bulk and exchange activities  our cash flows were affected by the differences in the timing between receiving the cash effects of derivative transactions and recording those transactions in net income 
affecting all periods is the timing of capital expenditures and their effects on our recorded liabilities 
cash management in the crude oil gathering and marketing business functions as follows 
all purchases and sales are settled monthly with payment on the th of the following month 
we receive payment for sales by wire transfer on the th 
approximately of the obligations for purchases are also paid by wire transfer on the th 
the remaining of purchases are paid for by check 
these checks  primarily to royalty owners and small oil companies  generally take five or six days to clear our bank account 
this payment cycle provides several benefits to us 
we know that substantially all of our receivables for crude oil sales will be collected on the th 
we also defer payment until checks that were mailed clear our checking accounts 
our borrowings  and therefore our interest costs  are reduced for this short time period each month following the th 
similarly  tariffs are billed monthly and require payment ten days after the invoice date 
therefore collection of our pipeline accounts receivable is very rapid 
because shippers generally want to continue shipping  these receivables are generally paid quickly by our customers 
our accounts receivable settle monthly and collection delays generally relate only to discrepancies or disputes as to the appropriate price  volume or quality of crude oil delivered 
of the million aggregate receivables on our consolidated balance sheet at december   approximately million  or  were less than days past the invoice date 
investing 
cash flows used in investing activities in were million as compared to million in in we sold portions of our texas pipeline system as well as other assets for million net  and we expended million to acquire the co assets 
additionally we expended million for other capital improvements 
these expenditures included improvements on our mississippi pipeline system to handle increased volumes more efficiently and effectively  additions and improvements totaling approximately million on the texas assets sold to teppco in october and other equipment improvements 
in we expended million for property and equipment additions 
these expenditures included replacement of pipe in mississippi and texas and upgrades to pipeline stations in mississippi to handle larger volumes of crude oil throughput  including building new tanks 
offsetting these expenditures in  were sales of surplus assets from which we received million 
in early  we sold our two seats on the nymex for million as discussed above 
we also received million from the sale of excess land with a building 
in  we expended million for property and equipment  primarily in our pipeline operations 
we received million from the sale of tractors and trailers that were no longer needed as the fleet was replaced with new equipment leased from ryder transportation inc see additional detail on capital expenditures below 
financing 
in  financing activities provided net cash of million 
in november  our general partner acquired from us  newly issued common units and a proportionate general partner interest for million 
we also increased our outstanding debt by million 
we utilized million of these funds to pay fees related to the new credit facility with fleet national bank 
distributions to our partners utilized million 
net cash expended for financing activities was million in as compared to million in in we reduced long term debt outstanding at year end by million from the balance at december  we also paid a special distribution of per unit in december  which utilized million of cash 
in  we reduced debt by million from the balance at december   and paid four quarterly distributions in the amount of per unit each  which utilized million of cash 
capital expenditures a summary of our capital expenditures in the three years ended december    and is as follows in thousands year ended december  maintenance capital expenditures texas pipeline system    mississippi pipeline system   jay pipeline system crude oil gathering assets administrative assets total maintenance capital expenditures    growth capital expenditures mississippi pipeline system crude oil gathering assets co assets  total growth capital expenditures  total capital expenditures    maintenance capital expenditures in included a total of million for installation of pipeline satellite monitoring capabilities on all three systems 
administrative asset expenditures included computer hardware and software 
in the first half of  we continued to upgrade the west columbia to markham segment of our texas pipeline 
the expenditures on the mississippi system included additional improvements to the pipeline from soso to gwinville  where the crude oil spill had occurred in december  to restore this segment to service 
we also improved the pipeline from gwinville to liberty to be able to handle increased volumes on that segment by upgrading pumps and meters and completing additional tankage 
growth capital expenditures in included the acquisition of a condensate storage facility in texas that was subsequently sold to teppco and the acquisition of the co assets from denbury 
although we have no commitments to make capital expenditures  based on the information available to us at this time  we currently anticipate that our capital expenditures will be as follows in thousands maintenance capital expenditures texas system mississippi system  jay system other total   in  we expect the expenditures on our texas system to relate primarily to corrosion control and in and  to improvements to our control and monitoring system 
the maintenance capital expenditure estimates for our mississippi system include corrosion control expenditures  minor facility improvements and rehabilitation of the pipeline as a result of integrity management test results  as discussed below 
complying with department of transportation pipeline integrity management program imp regulations has been and will be a significant driver in determining the amount and timing of our capital expenditure requirements 
on march   the department of transportation promulgated the imp regulations 
the imp regulations require that we perform baseline assessments of all pipelines that could affect high consequence areas hca 
the integrity of these pipelines must be assessed by internal inspection  pressure test  or equivalent alternative technology 
an hca is defined as a a commercially navigable waterway  b an urbanized area that contains  or more people and has a density of at least  people per square mile  c other populated areas that contain a concentrated population  such as an incorporated or unincorporated city  town or village  and d an area of the environment that has been designated as unusually sensitive to oil spills 
due to the proximity of all of our pipelines to water crossings and populated areas  we have designated all of our pipelines as affecting hcas 
in accordance with the imp regulations  we prepared a written integrity management plan in that detailed our plans for testing and assessing each segment of the pipeline 
the imp regulations require that the baseline assessment be completed within seven years of march   with of the mileage assessed in the first three and one half years 
reassessment is then required every five years 
we expect to spend million in and million in for pipeline integrity testing that will be charged to pipeline operating expense as incurred 
as testing is completed  we are required to take prompt remedial action to address integrity issues raised by the assessment 
the rehabilitation action required as a result of the assessment and testing is expected to impact our capital expenditure program by requiring us to make improvements to our pipeline 
this creates a difficult budgeting and planning challenge as we cannot predict the results of pipeline testing until they are completed 
based on estimated improvements required from assessments made during and  we have estimated capital expenditures to be made during the imp assessment period from through these capital expenditure projections are based on very preliminary data regarding the cost of rehabilitation 
such capital expenditure projections have been updated to eliminate the segments of the texas system that were sold or abandoned in  and the projections will be updated as improved data is obtained 
during and  million and million in capital expenditures were spent for rehabilitation of the mississippi and texas pipeline systems 
based on actual experience during and applied to our written imp plan  we expect to spend million  million and million in  and  respectively  for pipeline rehabilitation on the mississippi system as a result of imp testing 
we currently do not expect to incur any rehabilitation expenditures on the other systems during this period 
expenditures on capital assets to grow the partnership will depend on our access to debt and capital discussed below in sources of future capital 
our focus will be on acquisitions that add stable cash flows to smooth out the volatility of the crude oil gathering business 
those acquisitions may include the acquisition of additional co assets from denbury and the construction of co and crude oil pipelines to access denbury s crude oil fields in mississippi 
denbury owns additional co industrial sales contracts that we might be able to purchase along with additional volume under our production payment 
we may also construct and operate co pipelines next to crude oil pipelines to supply denbury s fields with the co for tertiary recovery and then to move the resulting crude oil production to market 
we will also look for opportunities to acquire assets from other parties that meet our criteria for stable cash flows 
capital resources in march  we entered into a million three year credit facility with a group of banks with fleet national bank as agent fleet facility 
the fleet facility also has a sublimit for working capital loans in the amount of million  with the remainder of the facility available for letters of credit 
the key terms of the fleet facility are as follows letter of credit fees are based on the usage of the fleet facility in relation to the borrowing base and will range from to 
at december   the rate was 
the interest rate on working capital borrowings is also based on the usage of the fleet facility in relation to the borrowing base 
loans may be based on the prime rate or the libor rate  at our option 
the interest rate on prime rate loans can range from the prime rate plus to the prime rate plus 
the interest rate for libor based loans can range from the libor rate plus to the libor rate plus 
at december   we borrowed at the prime rate plus 
we pay a commitment fee on the unused portion of the million commitment 
this commitment fee is also based on the usage of the fleet facility in relation to the borrowing base and will range from to 
at december   the commitment fee rate was 
the amount that we may have outstanding cumulatively in working capital borrowings and letters of credit is subject to a borrowing base calculation 
the borrowing base is defined in the fleet facility generally to include cash balances  net accounts receivable and inventory  less deductions for certain accounts payable  and is calculated monthly 
collateral under the fleet facility consists of our accounts receivable  inventory  cash accounts  margin accounts and fixed assets 
the fleet facility contains covenants requiring a minimum current ratio  a minimum leverage ratio  a minimum cash flow coverage ratio  a maximum ratio of indebtedness to capitalization  a minimum ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  and limitations on distributions to unitholders 
we were in compliance with the fleet facility covenants at december under the fleet facility  distributions to unitholders and the general partner can only be made if the borrowing base exceeds the usage by certain amounts 
see additional discussion below under distributions 
at december   we had million outstanding under the fleet facility 
due to the revolving nature of loans under the fleet facility  additional borrowings and periodic repayments and re borrowings may be made until the maturity date of march  at december   we had letters of credit outstanding under the fleet facility totaling million  comprised of million and million for crude oil purchases related to december and january  respectively and million related to other business obligations 
outstanding letters of credit issued to denbury for the purchase of crude oil at december   totaled million  and are included in the million total above 
in february  denbury agreed to reduce by half its requirement to provide denbury with letters of credit for our crude oil purchases from them 
sources of future capital prior to  we funded our capital commitments from operating cash and borrowings under bank facilities 
in  we issued common units to our general partner for cash and sold assets to fund growth 
our plans for the future include a combination of borrowings and the issuance of additional common units to the public 
we have entered into discussions with fleet national bank regarding an expansion of our existing credit facility from million to million 
we would like to reduce the amount of the facility committed to letters of credit and working capital borrowings from million to million and have million available for acquisitions 
we are in discussions with fleet to determine the terms of the expanded facility 
we may consider raising capital through an equity offering of additional common units if we make acquisitions using an expanded credit facility 
any such proceeds could be used to reduce the outstanding balances under the credit facility thereby freeing up debt capacity to use for additional accretive acquisitions 
an equity offering would probably not occur before the fourth quarter of distributions as a master limited partnership  the key consideration of our unitholders is the amount of our distribution  its reliability and the prospects for distribution growth 
normally we distribute of our available cash within days after the end of each quarter to unitholders of record and to the general partner 
available cash consists generally of all of our cash receipts less cash disbursements adjusted for net changes to reserves 
the target minimum quarterly distribution mqd for each quarter is per unit 
for  we paid distributions of per unit million in total per quarter for the first three quarters 
for the fourth quarter of and for all of  we did not pay any regular quarterly distributions 
we did pay a special distribution of per unit million in total in december to help mitigate the tax effects of income allocations for that year 
beginning with the distribution for the first quarter of  we paid a regular quarterly distribution of per unit million in total per quarter 
for the fourth quarter of  we increased our quarterly distribution to per unit in total  which was paid in february under the fleet agreement  a provision requires that the borrowing base exceed the usage under the fleet agreement by at least million plus the distribution measured once each month in order for us to make a distribution for the quarter 
our general partner is entitled to receive incentive distributions if the amount we distribute with respect to any quarter exceeds levels specified in our partnership agreement 
under the quarterly incentive distribution provisions  the general partner generally is entitled to receive of any distributions in excess of per unit  of any distributions in excess of per unit and of any distributions in excess of per unit without duplication 
we have not paid any incentive distributions through december  the likelihood and timing of the payment of any incentive distributions will depend on our ability to make accretive acquisitions and generate cash flows from of those acquisitions 
we do not expect to make incentive distributions during we believe we will be able to sustain a regular quarterly distribution at per unit during we do not expect to be able to restore the distribution to the targeted minimum quarterly distribution level of per unit until however  if we exceed our expectations for improving the performance of the business  if our capital projects cost less than we currently estimate  or if our access to capital allows us to make accretive acquisitions  we may be able to restore the targeted minimum quarterly distribution sooner 
available cash before reserves for the year ended december   is as follows in thousands net income  depreciation and amortization  excluded gain from asset sales  cash proceeds in excess of gains on certain asset sales non cash charges maintenance capital expenditures  available cash before reserves  available cash a non gaap liquidity measure has been reconciled to cash flow from operating activities the gaap measure for the year ended december  below 
the non gaap financial measure of available cash is calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  with the exception of maintenance capital expenditures as used in our calculation of available cash 
maintenance capital expenditures are capital expenditures as defined by gaap to replace or enhance partially or fully depreciated assets in order to sustain the existing operating capacity or efficiency of our assets and extend their useful lives 
we believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures being utilized by management 
available cash is a liquidity measure used by our management to compare cash flows generated by the partnership to the cash distribution we pay to our limited partners and the general partner 
this is an important financial measure to our public unitholders since it is an indicator of our ability to provide a cash return on their investment 
specifically  this financial measure tells investors whether or not the partnership is generating cash flows at a level that can support a quarterly cash distribution to our partners 
lastly  available cash also referred to as distributable cash flow is a quantitative standard used throughout the investment community with respect to publicly traded partnerships 
several adjustments to net income are required to calculate available cash 
these adjustments include the addition of non cash expenses such as depreciation and amortization expense  miscellaneous non cash adjustments such as the addition of decreases or the subtraction of increases in the value of financial instruments  and the subtraction of maintenance capital expenditures 
see distributions above 
the reconciliation of available cash a non gaap liquidity measure to cash flow from operating activities the gaap measure for the year ended december   is as follows in thousands year ended december  cash flows from operating activities  adjustments to reconcile operating cash flows to available cash maintenance capital expenditures  proceeds from sales of certain assets  change in fair value of derivatives amortization of credit facility issuance fees  net effect of changes in operating accounts not included in calculation of available cash  available cash before reserves  commitments and off balance sheet arrangements contractual obligation and commercial commitments in addition to the fleet facility discussed above  we have contractual obligations under operating leases as well as commitments to purchase crude oil 
the table below summarizes our obligations and commitments at december  in thousands 
payments due by period less than after contractual cash obligations year years years years total long term debt   operating leases     pennzoil litigation settlement   mississippi oil spill fine   offshore pipeline removal unconditional purchase obligations   total contractual cash obligations     in december  our insurers settled litigation with pennzoil quaker state for million 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
we have recorded in accrued liabilities on our consolidated statement of operations the obligation for this settlement  and we have recorded the insurance reimbursement for this obligation in insurance receivable 
the settlement was funded in february  with certain insurance companies directly funding million of the payment and with our funding the remaining million 
we expect to receive reimbursement from the insurance company no later than may we expect to pay the estimated million fine related to the mississippi oil spill that occurred in see note to the consolidated financial statements during the second quarter of we expect to incur approximately million to remove an abandoned offshore pipeline during the second quarter of while the temporary funding of the litigation settlement and the payment of the fine and pipeline removal costs will increase our average outstanding debt during  we believe we have sufficient capacity under the fleet facility to meet these obligations 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements  special purpose entities  or financing partnerships  other than as disclosed in this section  nor do we have any debt or equity triggers based upon our unit or commodity prices 
other matters risk factors related to our business the success of our crude oil gathering  marketing and pipeline operations is dependent upon increases in the availability of crude oil supplies and our ability to secure those supplies 
securing additional supplies of crude oil from increased production by oil companies and by aggressive lease gathering efforts depends partially on the ability of oil producers to increase production 
factors affecting an increase in production can include the prevailing market price for oil  the exploration and production budgets of the major and independent oil companies  the depletion rate of existing reservoirs  the success of new wells drilled  environmental concerns  regulatory initiatives and other matters that are beyond our control 
the profitability of our crude oil gathering and marketing operations depends primarily on the volumes of crude oil we purchase and gather 
natural declines in crude oil production from depleting wells or volumes lost to competitors must be replaced by contracts for new supplies of crude oil so as to maintain the volumes of crude oil we purchase 
replacement of lost volumes of crude oil is particularly difficult in an environment where production is low and competition to gather available production is intense 
generally  because producers experience inconveniences in switching crude oil purchasers  such as delays in receipt of proceeds while awaiting the preparation of new division orders  producers typically do not change purchasers on the basis of minor variations in price 
thus  we may experience difficulty acquiring crude oil at the wellhead in areas where there are existing relationships between producers and other gatherers and purchasers of crude oil 
our operations are dependent upon demand for crude oil by refiners in the gulf coast and midwest 
any decrease in this demand could adversely affect our business 
this demand is dependent on the impact of future economic conditions  fuel conservation measures  alternative fuel requirements  government regulation or technological advances in fuel economy and energy generation devices  all of which could reduce demand 
we face intense competition in our crude oil gathering and marketing activities 
our competitors include independent gatherers  the major integrated oil companies and their marketing affiliates and other marketers of various sizes  financial resources and experience 
many of these competitors have capital resources many times greater than ours and control much greater supplies of crude oil 
we are exposed to the credit risk of our customers in the ordinary course of our crude oil gathering and marketing operations 
there can be no assurance that we have adequately assessed the credit worthiness of our existing or future counter parties or that there will not be an unanticipated deterioration in their credit worthiness  which could have an adverse impact on us 
in those cases where we provide division order services for crude oil purchased at the wellhead  we may be responsible for the distribution of proceeds to all parties 
in other cases  we pay all or a portion of the production proceeds to an operator who distributes these proceeds to the various interest owners 
these arrangements expose us to operator credit risk  and there can be no assurance that we will not experience losses in dealings with other parties 
the profitability of our crude oil pipeline operations depends on the volume of crude oil shipped by third parties and on our interconnections with other crude oil pipelines 
third party shippers do not have long term contractual commitments to ship crude oil on our pipelines 
a decision by a shipper to substantially reduce or cease to ship volumes of crude oil on our pipelines could cause a significant decline in our revenues 
additionally  in mississippi  we are dependent on interconnections with other pipelines to provide shippers with a market for their crude oil  and in texas  we are dependent on interconnections with other pipelines to provide shippers with transportation to our pipeline 
any reduction of throughput available to our shippers on these interconnecting pipelines as a result of testing  pipeline repair  reduced operating pressures or other causes could result in reduced throughput on our pipelines that would adversely affect our profitability 
fluctuations in demand for crude oil  such as caused by refinery downtime or shutdowns  can negatively affect our operating results 
reduced demand in areas we service with our pipelines can result in less demand for our transmission services 
our operations are subject to federal and state environmental and safety regulations and laws related to environmental protection and operational safety 
our crude oil gathering and pipeline operations are subject to the risk of incurring substantial environmental and safety related costs and liabilities 
these costs and liabilities could rise under increasingly strict environmental and safety laws  including regulations and enforcement policies  or claims for damages to property or persons resulting from our operations 
if we are unable to recover such resulting costs through greater margins  higher tariffs or insurance reimbursements  our cash flows and results of operations could be materially impacted 
the transportation and storage of crude oil results in a risk that crude oil and related hydrocarbons may be suddenly or gradually released into the environment  potentially causing substantial expenditures for a response action  significant government penalties  liability to government agencies for natural resources damages  liability to private parties for personal injury or property damages  and significant business interruption 
certain of our field and pipeline operating costs and expenses are fixed and do not vary with the volumes we gather and transport 
these costs and expenses may not decrease ratably or at all should we experience a reduction in our volumes gathered by truck or transmitted by our pipelines 
as a result  we may experience declines in segment margin and profitability should our volumes decrease 
our co operations are exposed to risks related to denbury s operation of their co fields  equipment and pipeline 
because denbury produces the co and transports the co to our customers  any long term failure of their operations could have an impact on our ability to meet our obligations to our co customers 
we have no other supply of co or method to transport it to our customers 
fluctuations in demand for co by our industrial customers could materially impact our profitability 
our customers are not contractually obligated to purchase volumes in excess of the take or pay amounts in the contracts 
the customers have processing facilities located at the delivery points on denbury s pipeline 
fluctuations in their demand due to market forces or operational problems could result in a reduction in our revenues from the sales of co the co supplied by denbury to us for our sale to our customers could fail to meet the quality standards in the contracts due to impurities or water vapor content 
if the co were below specifications  we could be contractually obligated to provide compensation to our customers for the costs incurred in raising the co quality to serviceable levels 
our wholesale co industrial marketing operations are dependent on three customers 
should one or more of those customers experience financial difficulties such that they fail to purchase their required minimum take or pay volume and fail to compensate us for the lost revenue  our profitability could be materially impacted 
the three customers appear to be credit worthy  however there can be no assurance that an unanticipated deterioration in their ability to meet their obligations to us might not occur 
newly acquired properties could expose us to environmental liabilities and increased regulatory compliance costs 
our business plan includes making acquisitions to increase our cash flows 
assets that we may acquire will likely have associated environmental liabilities  as well as required compliance with regulations such as the integrity management program for regulated pipelines 
although we will attempt to identify such exposures and address the associated costs through indemnities  purchase price adjustments or insurance  we may incur costs not covered by indemnity  insurance or reserves 
cash distributions are not guaranteed and may fluctuate with our performance and the establishment of reserves 
because distributions to our unitholders are dependent on the amount of cash we generate  distributions may fluctuate based on our performance 
the actual amount of cash that is available to be distributed each quarter will depend on numerous factors  some of which are beyond our control and the control of our general partner 
cash distributions are dependent primarily on cash flow  including cash flow from financial reserves and working capital borrowings  and not solely on profitability  which is affected by non cash items 
therefore  cash distributions might be made in periods when we record losses and might not be made during periods when we record profits 
the terms of our credit facility may limit our ability to borrow additional funds  make distributions to unitholders  or capitalize on business opportunities 
our credit facility includes limitations on our ability to make distributions to our unitholders and require approval of lenders to take certain actions 
any refinancing of our current indebtedness or any new indebtedness could have similar or greater restrictions 
our tax treatment depends on our status as a partnership for federal income tax purposes  as well as our not being subject to entity level taxation by states 
if the irs treats us as a corporation or we become subject to entity level taxation for state tax purposes  it could substantially reduce distributions to our unitholders and might reduce our ability to grow the business 
the after tax benefit of an investment in our common units depends largely on our being treated as a partnership for federal and state income tax purposes 
if we were classified as a corporation for federal income tax purposes  we would pay federal income tax on our income at the corporate rate 
some or all of the distributions made to unitholders would be treated as dividend income  and no income  gains  losses or deductions would flow through to unitholders 
treatment of us as a corporation would cause a material reduction in the anticipated cash flow and after tax return to the unitholders 
we believe a substantial number of our common units are held by entities that derive a tax benefit from investment in partnership type entities with large gross receipts 
should a change occur such that our revenues declined to a level that these investors might find alternative sources for this tax benefit other than by ownership in our common units  an adverse change in our unit price could take place 
this condition could occur at the same time that we would be growing our distribution or otherwise increasing the value of our common units to the general investing public 
crude oil contamination we were named one of the defendants in a complaint filed on january   in the th district court of harris county  texas  cause no 
pennzoil quaker state company pqs was seeking property damages  loss of use and business interruption suffered as a result of a fire and explosion that occurred at the pennzoil quaker state refinery in shreveport  louisiana  on january  pqs claimed the fire and explosion were caused  in part  by genesis selling to pqs crude oil that was contaminated with organic chlorides 
in december  our insurers settled this litigation for million 
we have recorded in accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet the obligation for this settlement  and  in insurance receivable  we have recorded the insurance reimbursement for this obligation 
the settlement was funded in february  with certain insurance companies directly funding million of the payment and million funded by us 
we expect to receive reimbursement from the insurance company no later than may for the portion funded by us 
the settlement of this litigation had no effect on our results of operations 
pqs is also a defendant in five suits brought by neighbors living in the vicinity of the pqs shreveport  louisiana refinery in the first judicial district court  caddo parish  louisiana  cause nos 
 a 
 b   a   a  and  c 
pqs has brought third party demand against genesis and others for indemnity with respect to the fire and explosion of january  we believe that the demand against genesis is without merit and intend to vigorously defend ourselves in this matter 
insurance we maintain insurance of various types that we consider adequate to cover our operations and properties 
the insurance policies are subject to deductibles that we consider reasonable 
the policies do not cover every potential risk associated with operating our assets  including the potential for a loss of significant revenues 
consistent with the coverage available in the industry  our policies provide limited pollution coverage  with broader coverage for sudden and accidental pollution events 
additionally  as a result of the events of september  the cost of insurance available to the industry has risen significantly  and insurers have excluded or reduced coverage for losses due to acts of terrorism and sabotage 
since september   warnings have been issued by various agencies of the united states government to advise owners and operators of energy assets that those assets may be a future target of terrorist organizations 
any future terrorist attacks on our assets  or assets of our customers or competitors could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we believe that we are adequately insured for public liability and property damage to others as a result of our operations 
however  no assurances can be given that an event not fully insured or indemnified against will not materially and adversely affect our operations and financial condition 
additionally  no assurance can be given that we will be able to maintain insurance in the future at rates that we consider reasonable 
new accounting pronouncements sfas in june   the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
this statement requires entities to record the fair value of a liability for legal obligations associated with the retirement obligations of tangible long lived assets in the period in which it is incurred 
when the liability is initially recorded  a corresponding increase in the carrying amount of the related long lived asset would be recorded 
over time  accretion of the liability is recognized each period  and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset 
upon settlement of the liability  an entity either settles the obligation for its recorded amount or incurs a gain or loss on settlement 
the standard was effective for us on january  with respect to our pipelines  federal regulations require us to purge the crude oil from our pipelines when the pipelines are retired 
our right of way agreements do not require us to remove pipe or otherwise perform remediation upon taking the pipelines out of service 
many of our truck unload stations are on leased sites that require that we remove our improvements upon expiration of the lease term 
for our pipelines  we are unable to reasonably estimate and record liabilities for the majority of our obligations that fall under the provisions of this statement because we cannot reasonably estimate when such obligations would be settled 
for the truck unload stations  the site leases have provisions such that the lease continues until one of the parties gives notice that it wishes to end the lease 
at this time we cannot reasonably estimate when such notice would be given and when the obligations to remove our improvements would be settled 
we will record asset retirement obligations in the period in which we determine the settlement dates 
in the third quarter of  we recorded an obligation to remove a pipeline from offshore waters as a result of this standard
