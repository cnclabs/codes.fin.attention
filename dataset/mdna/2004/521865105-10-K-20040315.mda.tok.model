in recent years  we have followed our customers and expanded our operations significantly in europe  south america  south africa and asia 
as a result of our efforts to expand our worldwide operations  our net sales outside of the united states and canada have grown from billion in to billion in strategy our principal objective is to expand our position as a leading global supplier and integrator of automotive interior systems  including seat systems  interior components and electrical systems 
we pursue this objective by focusing on the needs of our customers 
our customers face continuing competitive pressures to improve quality and functionality at a lower cost and to reduce time to market and capital needs 
these trends have resulted in automotive manufacturers outsourcing complete automotive interior systems 
we believe that the criteria for selection of automotive interior systems suppliers are not only cost  quality  technology  delivery and service but also  increasingly  worldwide presence and full service capabilities 
specific elements of our strategy include enhance strong relationships with our customers by focusing on customer service and quality 
we seek to be viewed as a partner  rather than as a supplier  to our customers 
we believe that strong relationships with our customers allow us to identify business opportunities and anticipate the needs of our customers in the early stages of vehicle design 
working closely with our customers in the early stages of designing and engineering automotive interior systems gives us a competitive advantage in securing new business 
in addition  we believe that strong design and engineering capabilities are critical to securing total interior integrator programs 
the keys to enhancing customer relationships are service and quality 
we work to maintain an excellent reputation with our customers for timely delivery and customer service and for providing world class quality at competitive prices

in recognition of our efforts  many of our facilities have won awards from the automotive manufacturers 
we intend to maintain and improve the quality of our products and services through our ongoing quality first initiative 
expand our business in asian markets and with asian automotive manufacturers worldwide 
our asian strategy includes expanding our business in asian markets and with asian automotive manufacturers worldwide expansion in asian markets 
the asian markets present growth opportunities  as automotive manufacturers expand production in this region to meet increasing demand 
in particular  china is quickly becoming one of the largest automotive markets in the world  with approximately million units produced in according to jd power and associates 
we seek to partner with chinese automotive manufacturers through supply and joint venture arrangements  and we are well positioned to take advantage of china s emerging growth 
we currently have eleven joint ventures in china  where the majority of our production is for the local market 
we are focused on our core competencies  including seating  electrical distribution systems  door panels and flooring and acoustics 
we also see opportunities for growth in korea  where we expanded our presence in the local market in through the acquisition of a majority interest in hanyil co  ltd  a seat supplier to hyundai 
we will seek to leverage this acquisition to grow our interior business beyond seats in korea 
asian automotive manufacturers 
asian automotive manufacturers are continuing to invest and expand their manufacturing operations in asia especially china  north america and europe 
we believe it is important to have a manufacturing footprint that aligns with our customers global presence 
in  we launched programs in north america with each of the three largest japanese automotive manufacturers 
additional launches are planned for and we currently have eighteen strategic joint ventures based in north america and asia serving our asian customers  including mazda  toyota  nissan  subaru  honda  mitsubishi  isuzu and hyundai 
in addition  many of our north american and european customers have made substantial investments in  or developed joint ventures with  asian automotive manufacturers  including general motors investments in daewoo motor  suzuki motor and isuzu motor  ford s investment in mazda  daimlerchrysler s investments in mitsubishi motors and hyundai motor  and renault s investment in nissan 
as a result of our strong customer relationships  strategic alliances and full service capabilities  we are well positioned to expand our business with asian automotive manufacturers  both in asia and elsewhere 
improve european business structure and expand european market share 
in europe  the automotive market is highly fragmented with significant overcapacity  making europe a difficult market for automotive manufacturers and suppliers alike 
we are continuing to improve our financial results in europe by focusing significant new product initiatives on seating  electronics and cockpit programs  where there are opportunities for significant scale and we have a strong competitive position 
we are also improving our overall business structure in europe by consolidating administrative functions and reducing manufacturing costs by relocating and expanding component production in countries with lower labor costs 
capitalize on systems and integration opportunities 
the same competitive pressures that led automotive manufacturers to outsource individual automotive interior components to independent suppliers have caused our customers to demand delivery of fully integrated automotive interior systems for new vehicle models 
as automotive manufacturers continue to seek ways to differentiate their vehicles in the marketplace  improve quality and reduce costs  we believe they will increasingly look to independent suppliers to act as total interior integrators  by managing the design  engineering  sourcing  manufacturing and delivery of the total automotive interior 
in  we were awarded the first ever total interior integrator program by general motors for the buick lesabre and cadillac deville models 
we intend to leverage our leadership position in total interiors  particularly in north america  to offer one stop interior solutions to our customers 
leverage electronic capabilities and invest in product technology and design capability 
consumers are demanding more in their automotive interiors  focusing on convenience  communication and safety  and automotive manufacturers increasingly view the vehicle interior as a major selling point to their customers 
because electronic and electrical distribution systems are an important part of automotive interior systems  we seek to take advantage of our capabilities in these areas to develop new products that respond to customer and consumer demands 
we will also continue to make investments in technology and design capability to support our existing products as well as our new product development efforts 
the focus of our research and development efforts is to identify new interior features that make vehicles safer  more comfortable and more attractive to consumers 
we believe that in order to effectively develop total automotive interiors  it is necessary to integrate the engineering  research  design  development and validation of all of the automotive interior systems 
we conduct extensive analysis and testing of consumer responses to automotive interior styling and innovations 
we also have state of the art acoustics testing and instrumentation and data analysis capabilities

in addition  our advanced technology center in southfield  michigan  provides us with the ability to integrate engineering  research  design  development and validation capabilities for all five automotive interior systems at one location 
maintain flexible and efficient cost structure 
we believe that our cost structure has one of the highest percentages of variable costs in the automotive supplier industry 
by maintaining low fixed costs  we are better able to withstand fluctuations in industry demand as well as changing competitive and macroeconomic conditions 
our variable cost structure is maintained  in part  through ongoing six sigma initiatives throughout the organization as well as initiatives to promote and enhance the sharing of technology  engineering  purchasing and capital investments across customer platforms and facility consolidation actions to align our business with changing market conditions 
strategic acquisitions 
we intend to selectively pursue strategic acquisitions  where appropriate  to expand or complement our existing business while maintaining a strong balance sheet 
we will focus on financially attractive acquisitions that strengthen our relationships with our customers  enhance our existing products  processes and technological capabilities or lower our costs 
we expect that any such acquisitions will be consistent with our core business of providing high quality automotive interior systems and components 
in particular  we may seek acquisitions that further our strategy of expanding our business in the asian markets and with asian automotive manufacturers or complement our focus in europe on seating and electronics 
products we conduct our business in three product operating segments seating  interior  and electronic and electrical 
the seating segment includes seat systems and components thereof 
the interior segment includes flooring and acoustic systems  door panels  instrument panels and cockpit systems  overhead systems and other interior products 
the electronic and electrical segment includes electronic and electrical distribution systems  primarily wire harnesses  wireless systems and interior control systems 
net sales by product segment for the year ended december  as a percentage of total net sales were as follows seating  interior and electronic and electrical 
for further information related to our reportable operating segments  see note  segment reporting  to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
seating 
the seating segment consists of the manufacture  assembly and supply of vehicle seating requirements 
seat systems typically represent approximately to of the total cost of an automotive interior 
we produce seat systems for automobiles and light trucks that are fully assembled and ready for installation 
seat systems are designed to achieve maximum passenger comfort by adding a wide range of manual and power features such as lumbar supports  cushion and back bolsters and leg and thigh supports 
as a result of our strong product design and product technology  we are a leader in designing seats with convenience features and enhanced safety 
for example  our protec self aligning head restraint is an advancement in front seat passive safety 
by reducing the space between the occupant s head and the headrest through use of a headrest system that moves with the occupant  the difference between the movement of the head and the shoulder area can be shortened in a rear impact collision  potentially reducing the risk of injury 
in addition  we are the exclusive manufacturer of a patented integrated restraint seat system that uses an ultra high strength steel tower and a split frame design to improve occupant comfort and convenience 
we have also developed occusense seats  which detect the size and weight of an occupant to control airbag deployment 
interior 
the interior segment consists of the manufacture  assembly and supply of interior systems and components 
interior products are designed to provide a harmonious and comfortable interior for the vehicle occupants as well as a variety of functional and safety features 
set forth below is a description of our principal interior products flooring and acoustic systems 
we have an extensive and comprehensive portfolio of sonotec acoustic products  including flooring systems and dash insulators 
carpet flooring systems generally consist of tufted or non woven carpet with a thermoplastic backcoating which  when heated  allows the carpet to be fitted precisely to the interior or trunk compartment of the vehicle 
additional insulation materials are added to provide noise  vibration and harshness resistance 
non carpeted flooring systems  used primarily in commercial and fleet vehicles  offer improved wear and maintenance characteristics 
the dash insulator separates the passenger compartment from the engine compartment and is the primary component for preventing engine noise and heat from entering the passenger compartment 

table of contents door panels 
door panels consist of several component parts  which are attached to a substrate by various methods 
specific components include vinyl or cloth covered appliqu s  armrests  radio speaker grilles  map pocket compartments  carpet and sound reducing insulation 
in addition  door systems often incorporate electronic and electrical distribution systems and products  including lock and latch  window glass  window regulators and audio systems as well as wire harnesses for the control of power seats  windows  mirrors and door locks 
instrument panels and cockpit systems 
the instrument panel is a complex system of coverings and foam  plastic and metal parts designed to house various components and act as a safety device for the vehicle occupant 
the cockpit system consists of  among other things  the instrument panel trim pad  structural subsystem  electrical distribution system  climate control  driver control pedals  steering controls and driver and passenger safety systems 
specific components of the cockpit system include instrument cluster gauges  cross car structure  electronic and electrical components  wiring harness  audio system  heating  ventilation and air conditioning module  air distribution ducts  air vents  the steering column and wheel and glove compartment assemblies 
airbag technologies also continue to be an important component of cockpit systems 
as a result of our research and development efforts  we have introduced cost effective  integrated  seamless airbag covers  which we believe will increase occupant safety as well as provide greater styling flexibility for the automotive manufacturer 
we have also developed spray pur  a seamless polyurethane coating for instrument panels  which enables us to eliminate visual seams 
this process will be used on the cadillac deville and buick lesabre models beginning in and the cadillac escalade beginning in we believe that future trends in instrument panels and cockpit systems will continue to focus on safety  leading to the introduction of innovations such as inflatable knee restraints and energy absorbing substructures 
overhead systems 
overhead systems consist of a headliner  lighting  visors  consoles  wiring and electronics as well as all other products located in the interior of the vehicle roof 
headliners consist of a substrate as well as a finished interior layer made of a variety of fabrics and materials 
while headliners are an important contributor to interior aesthetics  they also provide insulation from road noise and can serve as carriers for a variety of other components  such as visors  overhead consoles  grab handles  coat hooks  electrical wiring  speakers  lighting and other electronic and electrical products 
as the amount of electronic and electrical content available in vehicles has increased  headliners have emerged as an important carrier of technology since electronic features ranging from garage door openers to lighting systems are often optimally situated in the headliner 
electronic and electrical 
the migration from electrical distribution systems to electronic and electrical distribution systems is facilitating the integration of wiring  electronics and switch control products within the overall electrical architecture of a vehicle 
this migration will reduce the overall system cost and weight and improve reliability and packaging by optimizing the overall system architecture and eliminating a portion of the terminals  connectors and wires normally required for a conventional electrical distribution system 
our umbrella technology  intertronics  reflects our ability to integrate electronic products with automotive interior systems 
this technology is already having an impact on a number of new and next generation products 
for example  our integrated seat adjuster module has two dozen fewer cut circuits and five fewer connectors  weighs a half of a pound less and costs twenty percent less than a traditional seat wiring system 
in addition  our smart junction box combines traditional junction box function with electronic capabilities by incorporating electronic control functions traditionally located elsewhere in the vehicle 
our electronic and electrical products are grouped into three categories electronic and electrical distribution systems 
wire harness assemblies are a collection of terminals  connectors and wires that connect all of the various electronic electrical devices in the vehicle to each other and or to a power source 
terminals and connectors are components of wire harnesses and other electronic electrical devices that connect wire harnesses and electronic electrical devices 
fuse boxes are centrally located boxes in the vehicle that contain fuses and or relays for circuit and device protection as well as power distribution 
junction boxes serve as a connection point for multiple wire harnesses 
they may also contain fuses and relays for circuit and device protection 
smart junction boxes are junction boxes with integrated electronic functions  which eliminate interconnections and increase overall system reliability 
certain vehicles may have two or three smart junction boxes linked as a multiplexed buss line 
wireless systems 
the dual range dual function remote keyless entry system allows a single transmitter button to perform multiple functions depending upon the operator s distance from the vehicle 
the remote keyless entry and immobilizer unit combines the features of a remote keyless entry receiver and the immobilizer key reader into a single device 
custom key fobs use decorative molding to offer a wide variety of options in fob design patterns and colors  including textures  logos  text and translucent and glow in the dark colors 
the passive entry system allows the vehicle 
table of contents operator to unlock the door without using a key or physically activating the remote keyless entry fob 
the passive entry technology is imbedded in the fob so that a separate device is not required 
in addition  we have developed our tire pressure monitoring system and the related intellitire monitoring system  which alert drivers when tire pressure is low 
our tire pressure monitoring system has received awards for of ford s north american vehicles and several hyundai models beginning in some form of tire pressure monitoring system is expected to eventually be required on all new vehicles in the united states 
interior control systems 
the instrument panel center console control provides a control panel for the entertainment system  accessory switch functions  heating  ventilation and air conditioning 
the multifunction turn signal control consolidates various combinations of hazard lights  headlamps  parking lamps  fog lamps  wiper and washer  cruise control  high low headlamp beams and turn signal functions 
the integrated seat adjuster module combines seat adjustment  power lumbar support  memory function and seat heating into one package 
the integrated door control consolidates the controls for window lift  door lock  power mirror and seat heating 
lear s intertronic flip pack integrates electrical and interior components and performs all power seat and power door functions from two stacked panels  improving access for drivers 
the mechatronic lighting control module integrates electronic control logic and diagnostics with the headlamp switch 
other interior control system products include audio amplifiers  video modules and the floor mounted mediaconsole with a flip up screen that provides dvd and video game viewing for back seat passengers 
manufacturing a description of the manufacturing processes for each of our operating segments is set forth below 
seating 
our seating facilities use just in time manufacturing techniques  and products are delivered to the automotive manufacturers on a just in time basis 
these facilities are typically located near our customers manufacturing and assembly sites 
our seating facilities utilize a variety of methods whereby fabric is affixed to an underlying seat frame 
raw materials  including steel  aluminum and foam chemicals  used in our seat systems are generally readily available and obtained from multiple suppliers under various supply agreements 
leather  fabric and certain components are also purchased from multiple suppliers under supply agreements 
typically  our supply agreements last for at least one year and are terminable by us for breach or convenience 
some purchased components are obtained from our customers 
interior 
our interior systems process capabilities include injection molding  low pressure injection molding  blow molding  compression molding  rotational molding  urethane foaming and vacuum forming as well as various trimming and finishing methods 
raw materials  including resin and chemical products  which are formed and assembled into end products  are obtained from multiple suppliers  typically under supply agreements which last for at least one year and are terminable by us for breach or convenience 
in addition  we produce carpet at one north american plant 
smaller facilities are dedicated to specific groups of customers and are strategically located near their production facilities 
electronic and electrical 
electrical distribution systems are networks of wiring and associated control devices that route electrical power and signals throughout the vehicle 
wire harness assemblies consist of raw  coiled wire  which is automatically cut to length and terminated 
individual circuits are assembled together on a jig or table  inserted into connectors and wrapped or taped to form wire harness assemblies 
cell based manufacturing techniques are applied to manufacture products on a just in time basis 
all materials are purchased from suppliers  with the exception of a portion of the connectors that are produced internally 
certain materials are available from a limited number of suppliers 
supply agreements typically last for at least one year and are terminable by us for breach or convenience 
the assembly process is labor intensive  and as a result  production is generally performed in low labor cost sites in mexico  honduras  the philippines  eastern europe and north africa 
some of the principal components attached to the wiring harness assemblies that we manufacture include junction boxes  electronic control modules and switches 
junction boxes are manufactured in north america and europe with a proprietary  capital intensive assembly process  utilizing printed circuit boards purchased from selected suppliers 
proprietary processes have been developed to improve the function of these junction boxes in harsh environments  including high temperatures and humidity 
electronic control modules are assembled using high speed surface mount placement equipment in both north america and europe 
switches are assembled from electrical  mechanical and decorated plastic parts purchased in the united states  mexico and europe  using a combination of manual and automated assembly and test methods 
while we internally manufacture many of the components that are included within our automotive interior systems  a substantial portion of these components are furnished by independent  tier ii automotive suppliers and other vendors throughout the world 
in certain instances  it would be difficult and expensive for us to change suppliers of products and services that are critical to our 
table of contents business 
with the recent decline in automotive production and substantial and continuing pressures to reduce costs  certain of our suppliers have experienced  or may experience  financial difficulties 
we seek to carefully manage our supplier relationships to minimize any significant disruptions of our operations 
however  adverse developments affecting one or more of our major suppliers  including certain sole source suppliers  could negatively impact our operating results 
see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risk factors adverse developments affecting one or more of our major suppliers could harm our profitability 
customers we serve the worldwide automotive and light truck market  which produced over million vehicles in we have automotive interior content on over vehicle nameplates worldwide  and our automotive manufacturer customers including customers of our non consolidated joint ventures currently include bmw daewoo daimlerchrysler fiat ford gaz general motors honda hyundai kia mahindra mahindra porsche psa renault nissan subaru suzuki toyota volkswagen audi volvo during the year ended december   general motors and ford  the two largest automotive and light truck manufacturers in the world  and their respective affiliates accounted for approximately and  respectively  of our net sales

we receive blanket purchase orders from our customers 
these purchase orders generally provide for the supply of a customer s annual requirements for a particular vehicle model  rather than for the purchase of a specified quantity of products 
such supply relationships typically extend over the life of a vehicle model  with terms of up to ten years 
although purchase orders may be terminated at any time by our customers but not by us  such terminations have been minimal and have not had a material impact on our results of operations 
our primary risk is that an automotive manufacturer will produce fewer units of a vehicle model than anticipated 
in order to reduce our reliance on any one vehicle model  we produce automotive interior systems and components for a broad cross section of both new and more established models 
our net sales for the year ended december  were comprised of the following vehicle categories cars  including mid size  compact  luxury sport and full size  and light truck  including sport utility and pickup and other light truck 
our contracts with our major customers generally provide for an annual productivity cost reduction and provide for the recovery of increases in material and labor costs in rare instances 
historically  cost reductions through product design changes  increased productivity and similar programs with our suppliers have generally offset these customer imposed productivity cost reduction requirements  although no assurances can be given that we will be able to achieve such cost reductions in the future 
our cost structure is comprised of a high percentage of variable costs 
this structure provides us with additional flexibility during various economic cycles 
technology we believe that in order to develop effectively our total automotive interiors  it is necessary to integrate the engineering  research  design  development and validation of all of the automotive interior systems

other matters we are involved in certain other legal actions and claims arising in the ordinary course of business  including  without limitation  intellectual property matters  personal injury claims and employment matters 
although the outcome of any legal matter cannot be predicted with certainty  we do not believe that any of these other legal proceedings or matters in which we are currently involved  either individually or in the aggregate  will have a material adverse effect on our business  consolidated financial position or results of operations

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive overview we are the world s largest automotive interior systems supplier based on net sales 
our net sales have grown from billion for the year ended december  to billion for the year ended december  the major sources of this growth have been new program awards and the completion of the acquisition of ut automotive  inc ut automotive in may our customers are the major automotive manufacturers  including general motors  ford  daimlerchrysler  bmw  fiat  psa  volkswagen  renault nissan  toyota and subaru 
we have capabilities in all five principal segments of the automotive interior market seat systems  flooring and acoustic systems  door panels  instrument panels and cockpit systems  and overhead systems 
we are also one of the leading global suppliers of automotive electronic and electrical distribution systems 
as a result of these capabilities  we can offer our customers fully integrated automotive interiors  including electronic and electrical distribution systems 
in  we were awarded the first ever total interior integrator program by general motors for the buick lesabre and cadillac deville models 
as a total interior integrator  we work closely with the customer on the design and are responsible for the engineering  component module sourcing  manufacturing and delivery of the automotive interiors for these two full size passenger cars 
demand for our products is directly related to automotive vehicle production 
automotive sales and production can be affected by general economic conditions  labor relations issues  regulatory requirements  trade agreements and other factors 
in addition to overall automotive production  our operating results are significantly impacted by the commercial success of the vehicle platforms for which we supply products as well as the relative profitability of these platforms 
our operating results also depend on the market share of our customers 
general motors and ford and their respective affiliates together accounted for approximately of our net sales in excluding opel  saab  volvo  jaguar and land rover  which are affiliates of general motors or ford  general motors and ford accounted for approximately of our net sales in a significant loss of business with respect to these customers or with respect to any vehicle model for which we are a significant supplier could materially and negatively affect our operating results 
in  automotive production decreased by approximately in north america and approximately in western europe as compared to automotive production by general motors  ford and daimlerchrysler in north america  in the aggregate  declined by approximately 
in addition  production on several of our key platforms in western europe declined by more than the industry average 
automotive industry conditions in north america and europe continue to be challenging 
in north america  the industry is characterized by significant overcapacity  fierce competition and significant pension and healthcare liabilities for the domestic automotive manufacturers 
in europe  the market structure is highly fragmented with significant overcapacity 
historically  the majority of our sales have been derived from the us based automotive manufacturers in north america  as well as automotive manufacturers in western europe 
our ability to increase sales in the future will depend  in part  on our ability to increase our penetration of asian markets and our sales to asian automotive manufacturers 
see risk factors the loss of business from a major customer could reduce our sales and harm our profitability 
our customers require us to reduce costs and  at the same time  assume greater responsibility for the design  development  engineering and integration of interior products 
we seek to enhance our profitability by investing in technology  design capabilities and new product initiatives that respond to the needs of our customers and consumers 
our profitability is also dependent on our ability to implement product cost reductions in either our processes or those of our customers or to obtain similar reductions from our suppliers 
we continually evaluate alternatives to align our business with the changing needs of our customers and to lower the operating costs of our company 
this may include the realignment of our existing manufacturing capacity  facility closures or similar actions 
in evaluating our financial condition and operating performance  we focus primarily on profitable sales growth and cash flows of our operating segments as well as return on invested capital on a consolidated basis 
in addition to maintaining and expanding our business with our existing customers in our more established markets  our future profitable sales growth depends  in part  on our ability to expand our business in asian markets and with asian automotive manufacturers worldwide 
the asian markets present growth opportunities  as automotive manufacturers expand production in these markets to meet increasing demand 
we currently have eleven joint ventures in china and several other joint ventures dedicated to serving asian automotive manufacturers 
we will continue to seek ways to expand our business in asian markets and with asian automotive manufacturers worldwide 
our success in generating cash flow will depend  in part  on our ability to efficiently manage working capital 
working capital can be significantly impacted by the timing of cash flows from sales and purchases 
in addition  our 
table of contents cash flow is dependent on our ability to maintain a disciplined capital spending program 
we can strengthen our balance sheet by promoting a flexible cost structure and efficiently utilizing our asset base 
return on invested capital is a measure of the efficiency with which assets are deployed to increase earnings 
improvements in our return on invested capital will depend on our ability to maintain an appropriate asset base for our business and to increase productivity and operating efficiency

financial measures regarding each segment s income before interest  other expense and income taxes and income before interest  other expense and income taxes divided by net sales margin are not measures of performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
such measures are presented because we evaluate the performance of our reportable operating segments  in part  based on income before interest  other expense including minority interests in consolidated subsidiaries and equity in net income of affiliates and income taxes

facility consolidations we continually evaluate alternatives to align our business with the changing needs of our customers and to lower the operating cost of our company 
this may include the realignment of our existing manufacturing capacity  facility closures or similar actions 
in december  we initiated two significant actions to close or consolidate three of our us seating facilities 
as a result of phased out programs and uncompetitive cost structures  it is not economical for us to continue to operate these facilities as they currently exist 
the actions are expected to be completed in the second quarter of in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for settlements and curtailments of defined benefit pension plans and for termination benefits  we recorded charges of million in related to these actions for employee termination benefits required under related labor agreements 
in addition  we recorded asset impairment charges of million in related to these actions to write down machinery and equipment which is expected to be abandoned 
these charges are included in cost of sales in our consolidated statement of income for the year ended december  total facility consolidation costs associated with these actions are expected to be approximately million and are expected to be paid in however  the timing and amount of these costs may change based on labor negotiations and other factors 
restructuring plan in order to better align our operations and capacity in response to changes in global automotive production volumes and our improved operating efficiencies  we began to implement a restructuring plan in the fourth quarter of this restructuring plan was designed to consolidate certain of our operations and to enhance our long term competitive position 
as a result of this restructuring plan  we recorded pre tax charges of million in the fourth quarter of  including million recorded as cost of sales and million recorded as selling  general and administrative expenses

liquidity and financial condition our primary liquidity needs are to fund capital expenditures  service indebtedness and support working capital requirements 
our principal sources of liquidity are cash flows from operating activities and borrowing availability under our primary credit facilities 
a substantial portion of our operating income is generated by our subsidiaries 
as a result  we are dependent on the earnings and cash flows of and the dividends  distributions or advances from our subsidiaries to provide the funds necessary to meet our obligations 
there are no significant restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to lear 
cash flow net cash provided by operating activities was million in as compared to million in the net decrease in sold accounts receivable resulted in a million decrease in net cash provided by operating activities between periods 
in addition  net cash provided by operating activities decreased as a result of the net change in recoverable customer engineering and tooling  which was a use of million of cash in as compared to a source of million of cash in  reflecting both the timing of recoverable engineering and tooling expenditures and customer payments 
these reductions were more than offset by income before cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle  which improved by million between periods  and the net change in working capital items  which generated million of cash in the current year and used million of cash in the prior year 
increases in accounts receivable and accounts payable were a use of million of cash and a source of million of cash  respectively  in  reflecting the timing of payments received from our customers and made to our suppliers 
net cash used in investing activities was million in as compared to million in capital expenditures were million in as compared to million in this increase largely reflects a shift in new program expenditures from the first quarter of to the fourth quarter of in  capital expenditures related primarily to new programs 
net cash used in financing activities was million in as compared to million in net repayments of our long term debt were million in as compared to million in in addition  proceeds from the exercise of stock options increased by million between periods

we may choose to pay the purchase price in cash or  subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions  shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock 
if the notes are required to be repurchased  we currently expect to purchase the notes for cash 
under generally accepted accounting principles  the shares into which the notes are convertible will not be included in our calculation of diluted net income per share unless one of the contingent conversion events occurs  or it is expected that we will satisfy our obligation to purchase the notes with shares of our common stock 
accordingly  the notes are not included in our calculation of diluted net income per share 
we used the proceeds from the convertible note offering to repay indebtedness under the revolving portion of our primary credit facilities 
the offering of the notes was made pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements of the securities act of  as amended 
in june  a registration statement covering the resale of the notes and the common stock issuable upon their conversion was declared effective by the securities and exchange commission 
subsidiary guarantees our senior notes are guaranteed by the same subsidiaries that guarantee our primary credit facilities 
in the event that any such subsidiary ceases to be a guarantor under the primary credit facilities  such subsidiary will be released as a guarantor of the senior notes 
our senior notes are not secured by the pledge of the capital stock of any our subsidiaries 
covenants our senior notes contain covenants restricting our ability to incur liens and to enter into sale and leaseback transactions and restricting our ability to consolidate with  to merge with or into  or to sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets to  any person

therefore  an increase in interest rates would reduce our profitability 
see market risk sensitivity 
in addition to the obligations set forth above  we have capital requirements with respect to new programs 
we typically enter into agreements with our customers at the beginning of a given vehicle s life for the fulfillment of our customers purchasing requirements for the entire production life of the vehicle  with terms of up to ten years 
prior to being formally awarded a program  we work closely with our customers in the early stages of designing and engineering a vehicle s interior systems 
failure to complete the design and engineering work related to a vehicle s interior systems  or to fulfill a customer s contract  could adversely affect our business 
we also enter into agreements with suppliers to assist us in meeting our customers production needs 
these agreements are requirements based and do not include any minimum stated volumes 

table of contents we also have minimum funding requirements with respect to our pension obligations  which are expected to be million to million in our minimum funding requirements after will depend on several factors 
we also have payments due under our postretirement benefit plans 
we do not fund our postretirement benefit obligation 
rather  payments are made as costs are incurred by covered employees

off balance sheet arrangements asset backed securitization facility we have in place an abs facility  which provides for maximum purchases of adjusted accounts receivable of million 
as of december   no accounts receivable had been sold under this facility 
the level of funding utilized under this facility is based on the credit ratings of our major customers  the level of aggregate accounts receivable in a specific month and our funding requirements 
should our major customers experience reductions in their credit ratings  we may be unable  or elect not  to utilize the abs facility in the future 
should this occur  we would utilize our primary credit facilities to replace the funding currently provided by the abs facility 
during  our utilization of the abs facility versus other available credit facilities resulted in a savings of approximately million

common stock repurchase program in may  the board of directors approved a common stock repurchase program that permits the discretionary repurchase of up to million shares of our outstanding common stock over an initial period of months 
in  we repurchased  shares of our outstanding common stock at an average purchase price of per share 
the extent to which we will 
table of contents repurchase our common stock and the timing of such repurchases will depend upon prevailing market conditions  alternative uses of capital and other factors 
adequacy of liquidity sources we believe that cash flows from operations and availability under our primary credit facilities will be sufficient to meet our long term debt maturities  projected capital expenditures and anticipated working capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
however  our cash flows from operations  borrowing availability and overall liquidity are subject to risks and uncertainties 
please see executive overview  forward looking statements and risk factors 
market risk sensitivity in the normal course of business  we are exposed to market risk associated with fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and interest rates 
we manage these risks through the use of derivative financial instruments in accordance with management s guidelines 
we enter into all hedging transactions for periods consistent with the underlying exposures 
we do not enter into derivative instruments for trading purposes 
foreign exchange operating results may be impacted by our buying  selling and financing in currencies other than the functional currency of our operating companies transactional exposure 
we mitigate this risk by entering into forward foreign exchange  futures and option contracts 
the foreign exchange contracts are executed with banks that we believe are creditworthy 
gains and losses related to foreign exchange contracts are deferred and included in the measurement of the foreign currency transaction subject to the hedge 
gains and losses incurred related to foreign exchange contracts are generally offset by the direct effects of currency movements on the underlying transactions 
our most significant foreign currency transactional exposures relate to the mexican peso  the canadian dollar and the euro 
we have performed a quantitative analysis of our overall currency rate exposure as of december  the potential earnings benefit related to transactional exposures from a hypothetical strengthening of the us dollar relative to all other currencies for is approximately million 
the potential earnings decline related to transactional exposures from a similar strengthening of the euro relative to all other currencies for is approximately million 
as of december   foreign exchange contracts representing billion of notional amount were outstanding with maturities within one year 
as of december   the fair value of these contracts was approximately negative million 
a change in the value of the us dollar relative to all other currencies would result in a million change in the aggregated fair value of these contracts 
a change in the value of the euro relative to all other currencies would result in a million change in the aggregated fair value of these contracts 
there are certain shortcomings inherent in the sensitivity analysis presented 
the analysis assumes that all currencies would uniformly strengthen or weaken relative to the us dollar or euro 
in reality  some currencies may strengthen while others may weaken  causing the earnings impact to increase or decrease depending on the currency and the direction of the rate movement 
in addition to the transactional exposure described above  our operating results are impacted by the translation of our foreign operating income into us dollars translation exposure 
we do not enter into foreign exchange contracts to mitigate this exposure 
interest rates we use a combination of fixed and variable rate debt and interest rate swap contracts to manage our exposure to interest rate movements 
our exposure to variable interest rates on outstanding floating rate debt instruments indexed to us or european monetary union short term money market rates is partially managed by the use of interest rate swap contracts to convert variable rate debt to fixed rate debt  matching effective and maturity dates to specific debt instruments 
these interest rate swap contracts are executed with banks that we believe are creditworthy and are denominated in currencies that match the underlying debt instrument 
net interest payments or receipts from interest rate swap contracts are recorded as adjustments to interest expense in our consolidated statements of income on an accrual basis 
we have performed a quantitative analysis of our overall interest rate exposure as of december  this analysis assumes an instantaneous basis point parallel shift in interest rates at all points of the yield curve 
the potential adverse earnings impact from this hypothetical increase for is approximately million 
as of december   interest rate swap contracts representing million of notional amount were outstanding with maturity dates of may through may all of these contracts swap fixed rate debt for variable rate debt 
the fair value 
table of contents of these interest rate swap contracts is subject to changes in value due to changes in interest rates 
as of december   the fair value of these contracts was approximately negative million 
a basis point parallel shift in interest rates would result in a million change in the aggregated fair value of these contracts 
we have commodity price risk with respect to purchases of copper  leather  steel  resins  diesel fuel and natural gas 
this risk  where not offset by pricing adjustments with our customers  is managed through a combination of fixed price agreements  staggered contract maturities and commercial negotiations with our suppliers 
we may also pursue alternative commodities or alternative suppliers to mitigate this risk over time 
we generally have not used financial instruments to mitigate this risk

other matters pension and other postretirement benefit plans approximately of our active workforce is covered by defined benefit pension plans 
approximately of our active workforce is covered by other postretirement benefit plans 
pension plans provide benefits based on plan specific benefit formulas as defined by the applicable plan documents 
postretirement benefit plans generally provide for the continuation of medical benefits for certain eligible employees 
in addition  we have contractual arrangements with certain employees which provide for supplemental retirement benefits 
in general  pension obligations are funded based on legal requirements  tax considerations and local practice 
additional contributions may be made when we believe it is financially advantageous to do so and based on our other capital requirements 
we do not fund our postretirement benefit obligation 
as of december  based on a september  measurement date  our projected benefit obligations related to our pension and other postretirement benefit plans were million and million  respectively 
these obligations were valued using a weighted average discount rate of for domestic plans and for foreign plans 
discount rates are determined based on a review of the rates of return for high quality long term bonds  such as moody s long term aa bond index for domestic plans 
as of december  and  our unfunded pension obligation was million and million  respectively 
for the years ended december  and  pension expense was million and million  respectively  and was determined using a variety of actuarial assumptions 
pension expense was calculated using an expected return on plan assets of and for domestic plans and and for foreign plans in and  respectively 
the expected return on plan assets is determined based on several factors  including adjusted historical returns  historical risk premiums for various asset classes and target asset allocations within the portfolio 
adjustments made to the historical returns are based on recent returns in the equity and fixed income markets and the belief that deviations from historical returns are likely over the relevant investment horizon 
pension expense is estimated to be approximately million in this estimate is based on a discount rate of and and an expected return on plan assets of and for domestic and foreign plans  respectively 
actual expense is also dependent on various other factors related to the employees covered by these plans 
while we believe that these rates are currently reasonable  actuarial assumptions are reviewed periodically and adjusted when necessary 
adjustments to our actuarial assumptions could have a material adverse impact on our reported results of operations 
decreasing the discount rate by would have increased our pension obligation and our pension expense by approximately million and approximately million  respectively  as of and for the year ended december  decreasing the expected return on plan assets by would have increased our pension expense by approximately million for the year ended december  we expect to contribute approximately million to million to our domestic and foreign pension portfolios in contributions to our pension funds are consistent with minimum funding requirements of the relevant governmental authorities 
we may make contributions in excess of these minimums when we believe it is financially advantageous to do so and based on our other capital requirements 
in addition  our domestic postretirement benefit obligation may be impacted by the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of the act that was signed into law on december  the act introduces a prescription drug benefit under medicare medicare part d as well as a federal subsidy to sponsors of certain other postretirement benefit plans that provide prescription drug benefits at least actuarially equivalent to medicare part d 
the measurement of postretirement benefit obligation and net periodic postretirement benefit cost reflected in our consolidated financial statements and notes to the consolidated financial statements does not reflect the effects of the act 
we do not expect the effects of the act to have a material impact on our postretirement benefit obligation and our net periodic postretirement benefit cost 
specific authoritative guidance on the accounting for the federal subsidy is pending and when issued  may require us to change previously reported plan information

environmental matters we are subject to local  state  federal and foreign laws  regulations and ordinances which govern activities or operations that may have adverse environmental effects and which impose liability for the costs of cleaning up certain damages resulting from past spills  disposal or other releases of hazardous wastes and environmental compliance 
our policy is to comply with all applicable environmental laws and to maintain an environmental management program based on iso to ensure compliance 
however  we currently are  have been and in the future may become the subject of formal or informal enforcement actions or procedures 
we have been named as a potentially responsible party at several third party landfill sites and are engaged in the cleanup of hazardous waste at certain sites owned  leased or operated by us  including several properties acquired in our acquisition of ut automotive 
certain present and former properties of ut automotive are subject to environmental liabilities which may be significant 
we obtained agreements and indemnities with respect to certain environmental liabilities from united technologies corporation utc in connection with our acquisition of ut automotive 
utc manages and directly funds these environmental liabilities pursuant to its agreements and indemnities with us 
while we do not believe that the environmental liabilities associated with our current and former properties will have a material adverse effect on our business  consolidated financial position or results of future operations  no assurances can be given in this regard 
for further information related to environmental matters  see item legal proceedings 
significant accounting policies and critical accounting estimates our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note  summary of significant accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
certain of our accounting policies require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
these estimates and assumptions are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
these estimates and assumptions are based on our historical experience  terms of existing contracts  our evaluation of trends in the industry  information provided by our customers and suppliers and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 
we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if it requires us to make assumptions about matters that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made and changes in the estimate would have had a significant impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
pre production costs related to long term supply arrangements we incur pre production engineering  research and development er d and tooling costs related to the products produced for our customers under long term supply agreements 
we expense all pre production er d costs for which reimbursement is not contractually guaranteed by the customer 
in addition  we expense all pre production tooling costs related to customer owned tools for which reimbursement is not contractually guaranteed by the customer or for which the customer has not provided a non cancelable right to use the tooling 
during and  we capitalized million and million  respectively  of pre production er d costs for which reimbursement is contractually guaranteed by the customer 
in addition  during and  we capitalized million and million  respectively  of pre production tooling costs related to customer owned tools for which reimbursement is contractually guaranteed by the customer or for which the customer has provided a non cancelable right to use the tooling 
during and  we collected million and million  respectively  of cash related to er d and tooling costs 
gains and losses related to er d and tooling projects are reviewed on an aggregate program basis 
net gains on projects are deferred and recognized over the life of the related long term supply agreement 
net losses on projects are recognized as costs are incurred 
a change in the commercial arrangements affecting any of our significant programs that would require us to expense er d or tooling costs that we currently capitalize could have a material adverse impact on our reported results of operations 
goodwill on january   we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
under this statement  goodwill is no longer amortized but is subject to annual impairment analysis

 we recorded impairment charges of million million after tax as of january  these charges are reflected as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle  net of tax  in our consolidated statement of income for the year ended december  our annual sfas no 
impairment analysis was completed as of september   and there was no additional impairment 
as of december   we had billion of goodwill recorded 
an impairment charge related to this amount could materially and negatively affect our operating results 
long lived assets on january   we adopted sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
accordingly  we monitor our long lived assets for impairment indicators 
if impairment indicators exist  we perform the required analysis and record impairment charges in accordance with sfas no 
in  we recorded impairment charges of million related to certain facility consolidations 
in addition  we recorded impairment charges of million related to other facility closures  an early program termination and ongoing losses at certain of our facilities 
the estimated fair values were based upon either discounted cash flow analyses or estimated salvage values 
cash flows are estimated using internal budgets based on recent sales data  independent automotive production volume estimates and customer commitments 
we have certain other facilities that have generated operating losses in recent years 
the results of the related impairment analyses indicated that impairment of the fixed assets was not required 
we will continue to monitor the operating plans of these facilities for potential impairment 
in  an impairment charge of million was recognized in connection with our related restructuring plan 
see note  restructuring plan  to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
legal and other contingencies we are subject to legal proceedings and claims  including product liability claims  commercial or contractual disputes  environmental enforcement actions or procedures and other claims  that arise in the normal course of business 
we routinely assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters  as well as ranges of probable losses  by consulting with internal personnel principally involved with such matters and with our outside legal counsel handling such matters 
we have accrued for estimated losses in accordance with gaap for those matters where we believe that the likelihood that a loss has occurred is probable and the amount of loss is reasonably estimable 
a determination of the amount of such reserves is based on knowledge and experience with regard to past and current matters and consultation with internal personnel principally involved with such matters and with our outside legal counsel handling such matters 
the required reserves may change in the future due to new matters or developments in existing matters 
the inherent uncertainty related to the outcome of these matters can result in amounts materially different from any provisions made with respect to their resolution 
for further information related to legal and other contingencies  see item legal proceedings 
revenue recognition and sales commitments we recognize revenue as our products are shipped to our customers 
we enter into agreements with our customers to produce products at the beginning of a vehicle s life 
although such agreements do not provide for minimum quantities  once we enter into such agreements  fulfillment of our customers purchasing requirements is our obligation for the entire production life of the vehicle  with terms of up to ten years 
these agreements generally may be terminated by our customer but not by us at any time 
historically  terminations of these agreements have been minimal 
in certain limited instances  we may be committed under existing agreements to supply products to our customers at selling prices which are not sufficient to cover the direct cost to produce such products 
in such situations  we recognize losses as they are incurred 
we are required to provide our customers with annual cost reductions as part of certain agreements 
in addition  we have ongoing adjustments to our pricing arrangements with our customers based on the related content and cost of our products 
we accrue for such amounts as our products are shipped to our customers 
such pricing accruals are adjusted as they are settled with our customers 
amounts billed to customers related to shipping and handling are included in net sales in our consolidated statements of income 
shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales in our consolidated statements of income 

table of contents in prior years  we recorded loss contract accruals in purchase accounting in conjunction with the lear donnelly acquisition  the ut automotive acquisition  the peregrine acquisition and the delphi acquisition 
these loss contract accruals were not recorded in the historical operating results of lear donnelly  ut automotive  peregrine or delphi 
the losses included in the accrual have not been  and will not be  included in our operating results since the respective acquisition dates 
further  our future operating results will benefit from accruing these contract losses in the related purchase price allocations 
a summary of the loss contract accrual activity related to these acquisitions is shown below in millions accrual at original dec 
 accrual adjustments utilized lear donnelly ut automotive peregrine delphi we utilized million  million and million of the loss contract accruals to offset losses in  and  respectively 
the estimated utilization of the aggregate loss contract accrual is million in  million in and million in use of estimates the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
during  there were no material changes in the methods or policies used to establish estimates and assumptions 
generally  matters subject to estimation and judgment include amounts related to accounts receivable realization  inventory obsolescence  unsettled pricing discussions with customers and suppliers  warranty  pension and other postretirement benefit plan assumptions  plant consolidation and reorganization reserves  self insurance accruals  asset valuation reserves and accruals related to litigation  environmental remediation costs and income taxes 
actual results may differ from estimates provided 
sales backlog we typically enter into agreements with our customers at the beginning of a vehicle s life for the fulfillment of our customers purchasing requirements for the entire production life of the vehicle 
these agreements generally may be terminated by the customer but not by us at any time 
therefore  our backlog data does not reflect firm orders or firm commitments 
our incremental backlog reflects i formally awarded new programs  ii targeted programs for which we believe there is a substantial likelihood of award  iii phased out and canceled programs  iv estimates regarding customer mandated changes in selling prices and v estimates of expected changes in vehicle content 
changes in any of these components may significantly impact our backlog 
in addition  backlog may be impacted by various assumptions imbedded in the calculation  including vehicle production levels on new  replacement or targeted programs  foreign exchange rates and the timing of major program launches 
for purposes of the backlog data  we have made various assumptions  including the following i north american vehicle production of million units  ii western european vehicle production of million units  iii south american vehicle production of million units and iv a euro exchange rate of euro 
as of december   we had an incremental sales backlog of million for orders to be executed in our current three year sales backlog through exceeds our prior year three year sales backlog through by approximately million

table of contents risk factors a decline in automotive sales could reduce our sales and harm our profitability 
our operations are directly related to automotive vehicle production 
automotive sales and production can be affected by the strength of a country s general economy 
in addition  automotive sales and production can be affected by labor relations issues  regulatory requirements  trade agreements and other factors 
automotive production in north america and western europe  the company s largest markets where most of our operations are located  has declined from million units in to million units in and is expected to remain flat in numerous factors beyond our control could lead to a decline in automotive production from expected levels in these markets 
our restructuring actions were intended to align our capacity with changes in global automotive production volumes 
however  deterioration beyond the expected automotive production levels could reduce our sales and harm our profitability  thereby making it more difficult for us to make payments under our indebtedness or resulting in a decline in the value of our common stock 
the loss of business from a major customer could reduce our sales and harm our profitability 
general motors and ford and their respective affiliates  the two largest automotive manufacturers in the world  together accounted for approximately of our net sales in excluding net sales to opel  saab  volvo  jaguar and land rover  which are affiliates of general motors or ford  general motors and ford accounted for approximately of our net sales in in recent years  general motors and ford have experienced declining market shares in north america 
a loss of significant business from general motors or ford  including a loss of business resulting from a decline in the market share of either of these customers  would be harmful to our business and our profitability  thereby making it more difficult for us to make payments under our indebtedness or resulting in a decline in the value of our common stock 
in addition  no assurances can be given that we will be successful in expanding our business with asian automotive manufacturers 
the discontinuation of  the loss of business with respect to  or a lack of commercial success of a particular vehicle model for which we are a significant supplier could reduce our sales and harm our profitability 
although we have purchase orders from many of our customers  these purchase orders generally provide for the supply of a customer s annual requirements for a particular model and assembly plant  renewable on a year to year basis  rather than for the purchase of a specific quantity of products 
therefore  the discontinuation of  the loss of business with respect to  or a lack of commercial success of a particular vehicle model for which we are a significant supplier could reduce our sales and harm our profitability  thereby making it more difficult for us to make payments under our indebtedness or resulting in a decline in the value of our common stock 
our substantial international operations make us vulnerable to risks associated with doing business in foreign countries 
as a result of our global presence  a significant portion of our revenues and expenses are denominated in currencies other than us dollars 
in addition  we have manufacturing and distribution facilities in many foreign countries  including countries in asia  eastern and western europe and central and south america 
international operations are subject to certain risks inherent in doing business abroad  including exposure to local economic conditions  expropriation and nationalization  foreign exchange rate fluctuations and currency controls  withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by subsidiaries  investment restrictions or requirements  export and import restrictions  and increases in working capital requirements related to long supply chains 
expanding our business in asian markets and our business relationships with asian automotive manufacturers are important elements of our strategy 
in addition  our strategy includes expanding our manufacturing operations in lower cost regions 
as a result  our exposure to the risks described above will be greater 
the likelihood of such occurrences and their potential effect on us vary from country to country and are unpredictable 
however  any such occurrences could be harmful to our business and our profitability  thereby making it more difficult for us to make payments under our indebtedness or resulting in a decline in the value of our common stock 
a significant labor dispute involving us or one or more of our customers or suppliers or that could otherwise affect our operations could reduce our sales and harm our profitability 
most of our employees and a substantial number of the employees of our largest customers and suppliers are members of industrial trade unions and are employed under the terms of collective bargaining agreements 
virtually all of our 
table of contents unionized facilities in the united states and canada have a separate agreement with the union that represents the workers at such facilities  with each such agreement having an expiration date that is independent of other collective bargaining agreements 
collective bargaining agreements covering approximately of our unionized workforce of approximately  employees  including of our unionized workforce in the us and canada  are scheduled to expire during a labor dispute involving us or any of our customers or suppliers or that could otherwise affect our operations or the inability by us or any of our customers or suppliers to negotiate an extension of a collective bargaining agreement covering a large number of employees upon its expiration  could reduce our sales and harm our profitability  thereby making it more difficult for us to make payments under our indebtedness or resulting in a decline in the value of our common stock 
significant increases in labor costs as a result of the renegotiation of collective bargaining agreements could also be harmful to our business and our profitability 
adverse developments affecting one or more of our major suppliers could harm our profitability 
we obtain components and other products and services from numerous tier ii automotive suppliers and other vendors throughout the world 
in certain instances  it would be difficult and expensive for us to change suppliers of products and services that are critical to our business 
certain of our suppliers are financially distressed or may become financially distressed 
any significant disruption in our supplier relationships  including certain relationships with sole source suppliers  could harm our profitability  thereby making it more difficult for us to make payments under our indebtedness or resulting in a decline in the value of our common stock 
a significant product liability lawsuit  warranty claim or product recall involving us or one of our major customers could harm our profitability 
in the event that our products fail to perform as expected and such failure results in  or is alleged to result in  bodily injury and or property damage or other losses  we may be subject to product liability lawsuits  warranty claims and product recalls 
in addition  since we are a party to warranty sharing agreements with certain of our customers  warranty claims involving one of our customers could also harm our profitability  thereby making it more difficult for us to make payments under our indebtedness and leading to a decline in the value of our common stock 
we are involved from time to time in legal proceedings and commercial or contractual disputes  which could have an adverse impact on our profitability and consolidated financial position 
we are involved in legal proceedings and commercial or contractual disputes that  from time to time  are significant 
these are typically claims that arise in the normal course of business including  without limitation  commercial or contractual disputes  including disputes with our suppliers  intellectual property matters  personal injury claims and employment matters 
no assurances can be given that such proceedings and claims will not have a material adverse impact on our profitability and consolidated financial position 
we depend upon cash from our subsidiaries 
therefore  if we do not receive dividends or other distributions from our subsidiaries  it could be more difficult for us to make payments under our indebtedness 
a substantial portion of our revenue and operating income is generated by our wholly owned subsidiaries 
accordingly  we are dependent on the earnings and cash flows of  and dividends and distributions or advances from  our subsidiaries to provide the funds necessary to meet our debt service obligations 
we utilize certain cash flows of our foreign subsidiaries to satisfy obligations locally 
our obligations under our primary credit facilities and senior notes are currently guaranteed by certain of our subsidiaries  but such guarantees may be released under certain circumstances
