critical accounting policies allowance for doubtful accounts we record a provision for doubtful accounts receivable based on specific identification of doubtful accounts 
this involves a degree of judgement based on discussion with our internal sales and marketing groups  our customer base and the examination of the financial stability of our customers 
there can be no assurance that our estimates will match actual amounts ultimately written off 
during periods of downturn in the market for our products or economic recession  a greater degree of risk exists concerning the ultimate collectability of our accounts receivable due to the impact that these conditions might have on our customer base 
sales returns an allowance is established for possible return of products 
the amount of the allowance is an estimate  which is based on historical ratios of returns to sales  the historical average length of time between the sale and the return and other factors 
though management considers these allowances adequate and proper  changes in customers behavior versus historical experience or changes in the company s return policies are among the factors that would result in materially different amounts for this item 
inventory valuation the company s inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
reserves for overstock and obsolescence are estimated 
the amount of the reserve is determined based on projected sales information  plans for discontinued products and other factors 
though management considers these reserves adequate and proper  changes in sales volumes due to unexpected economic or competitive conditions are among the factors that could materially affect the adequacy of this reserve 
in  we recorded a  charge reflecting an adjustment to our inventory to lower of cost or market 
this charge represented excess and obsolete inventory 
income taxes in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements  management calculates income taxes 
this includes estimating the company s current tax liability as well as assessing temporary differences resulting from different treatment of items for tax and book accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are recorded on the balance sheet 
these assets and liabilities are analyzed regularly and management assesses the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be realized from future taxable income 
warranty we provide a standard product warranty program for our product lines and a five year warranty on certain equipment purchased from two vendors and installed at our customer locations 
we provide reserves for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
we estimate the costs of our warranty obligations based on our warranty policy or applicable contractual warranty  our historical experience of known product failure rates  vendors experience and use of materials and service delivery costs incurred in correcting product failures 
management reviews the estimated warranty liability on a quarterly basis to determine its adequacy 
though management considers these balances adequate and proper  changes in the company s warranty policy or a significant change in product defects versus historical experience are among the factors that could result in materially different amounts for this item 
goodwill impairment beginning in  goodwill is required to be evaluated annually for impairment  according to sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the standard requires a two step process be performed to analyze whether or not goodwill has been impaired 
step one is to test for potential impairment  and requires that the fair value of the reporting unit be compared to its book value including goodwill 
if the fair value is higher than the book value  no impairment is recognized 
if the fair value is lower than the book value  a second step must be performed 
the second step is to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any  and requires that a hypothetical purchase price allocation be done to determine the implied fair value of goodwill 
this fair value is then compared to the carrying value of goodwill 
if the implied fair value is lower than the carrying value  an impairment must be recorded 
the company believes that accounting estimates related to goodwill impairment are critical because the underlying assumptions used for the discounted cash flow can change from period to period and could potentially cause a material impact to the income statement 
management s assumptions about inflation rates and other internal and external economic conditions  such as earnings growth rate  require significant judgment based on fluctuating rates and expected revenues 
additionally  sfas no 
requires that the goodwill be analyzed for impairment on an annual basis using the assumptions that apply at the time the analysis is updated 
as of december   an assessment of the carrying values of the company s goodwill indicated no impairment 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue when the earnings process is complete  evidenced by persuasive evidence of an arrangement  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
related to the suttle  austin taylor  and transition networks and milan technology segments  the earning process completion is evidenced through the shipment of goods as the terms these segments are fob shipping point and the risk of loss is transferred upon shipment and they are have no significant obligations subsequent to that point 
other than the sales returns as discussed above  there are not significant estimates related revenue recognition for these segments 
jdl technologies  inc segment jdl records revenue on hardware  software and related equipment sales and installation contracts when the products are installed and accepted by the customer 
jdl records revenue on service contracts on a straight line basis over the contract period  unless evidence suggests that the revenue is earned or obligations are fulfilled in a different pattern 
each contract is individually reviewed to determine when the earnings process is complete 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
deferred income taxes are recorded based on differences in the bases of assets and liabilities between the financial statements and the tax returns as well as from loss carryforwards 
the valuation allowance for deferred income tax benefits is determined based upon the expectation of whether the benefits are more likely than not to be realized 
foreign currency translation assets and liabilities of the foreign subsidiary are translated to us dollars at year end rates  and the statements of operations are translated at average exchange rates during the year

recently issued accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board issued statement on financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
this statement applies to intangibles and goodwill acquired after june   as well as goodwill and intangibles previously acquired 
under this statement  goodwill as well as other intangibles determined to have an infinite life will no longer be amortized  however  these assets will be reviewed for impairment on a periodic basis 
statement no 
also includes provisions for the reclassification of certain existing recognized intangibles as goodwill  reclassification of certain intangibles out of previously reported goodwill and the identification of reporting units for purposes of assessing potential future impairments of goodwill 
we adopted this standard effective january  we assessed the fair value of our business units to determine whether goodwill carried on our financial statements was impaired and the extent of such impairment  if any 
we used the discounted cash flows method using market based rates of return to provide indications of value 
based upon these assessments  we determined that our current goodwill balances were not impaired as of january  and we will continue to reassess the value of our business units and related goodwill balances at the beginning of each year or at other times if events have occurred or circumstances exist that indicate the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable 
as of december  and the company had net goodwill of  in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin 
fin establishes accounting and disclosure requirements for a company s obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued 
a guarantor is required to recognize a liability for the obligation it has undertaken in issuing a guarantee  including the ongoing obligation to stand ready to perform over the term of the guarantee in the event that the specified triggering events or conditions occur 
the objective of the initial measurement of that liability is the fair value of the guarantee at its inception 
the initial recognition and measurement provisions of this interpretation are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  fin also requires expanded disclosure of information related to product warranty amounts recorded in the financial statements 
the disclosure provisions are effective for interim and annual periods ending after december  the adoption of fin is further discussed with appropriate disclosures in note of the consolidated financials statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  an amendment to sfas no 
this standard provides alternative methods of transition for any voluntary changes to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
it also amends the disclosure requirements to require prominent disclosure in both the annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
the new disclosure requirements were effective for interim periods beginning after december  we will continue to apply the principles of apb opinion no 
and related interpretations in accounting for our stock based compensation plans
