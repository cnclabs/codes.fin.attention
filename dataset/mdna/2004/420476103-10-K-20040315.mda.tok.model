we have described under factors that may affect future results of operations  financial condition or business additional factors that could cause actual results to be materially different from those described in the forward looking statements 
other factors that we have not identified in this report could also have this effect 
you are cautioned not to put undue reliance on any forward looking statement  which speak only as of the date they were made 
factors that may affect future results of operations  financial condition or business we are identifying important risks and uncertainties that could affect our company s results of operations  financial condition or business and that could cause them to differ materially from our company s historical results of operations  financial condition or business  or those contemplated by forward looking statements made herein or elsewhere  by  or on behalf of  our company 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those factors described below 
because exchange primarily serves missouri  a decline in the local economic conditions could lower exchange s profitability 
the profitability of exchange is dependant on the profitability of its banking subsidiaries  which operate out of central missouri 
the financial condition of these banks is affected by fluctuations in the economic conditions prevailing in the portion of missouri in which their operations are located 
accordingly  the financial conditions of both exchange and its banking subsidiaries would be adversely affected by deterioration in the general economic and real estate climate in missouri 
an increase in unemployment  a decrease in profitability of regional businesses or real estate values or an increase in interest rates are among the factors that could weaken the local economy 
with a weaker local economy customers may not want or need the products and services of exchange s banking subsidiaries  borrowers may be unable to repay their loans  the value of the collateral security of our banks loans to borrowers may decline  and the overall quality of our banks loan portfolio may decline 
making mortgage loans and consumer loans is a significant source of profits for exchange s banking subsidiaries 
if individual customers in the local area do not want these loans  profits may decrease 
although our banks could make other investments  our banks may earn less revenue on these investments than on loans 
also  our banks losses on loans may increase if borrowers are unable to make payments on their loans 
interest rate changes may reduce the profitability of exchange and its banking subsidiaries 
the primary source of earnings for exchange s banking subsidiaries is net interest income 
to be profitable  our banks have to earn more money in interest and fees on loans and other interest earning assets than they pay as interest on deposits and other interest bearing liabilities and as other expenses 
if prevailing interest rates decrease  as has already happened on several occasions since january  the amount of interest our banks earn on loans and investment securities may decrease more rapidly than the amount of interest our banks have to pay on deposits and other interest bearing liabilities 
this would result in a decrease in the profitability of exchange and its banking subsidiaries  other factors remaining equal 
changes in the level or structure of interest rates also affect our banks ability to originate loans  the value of our banks loan and securities portfolios  our banks ability to realize gains from the sale of loans and securities  the average life of our banks deposits  and our banks ability to obtain deposits 
fluctuations in interest rates will ultimately affect both the level of income and expense recorded on a large portion of our banks assets and liabilities  and the market value of all interest earning assets  other than interest earning assets that mature in the short term 
our banks interest rate management strategy is designed to stabilize net interest income and preserve capital over a broad range of interest rate movements by matching the interest rate sensitivity of assets and liabilities 
although exchange believes that its banks current mix of loans  mortgage backed securities  investment securities and deposits is reasonable  significant fluctuations in interest rates may have a negative effect on the profitability of our banks 
the profitability of exchange s banking subsidiaries depends on their asset quality and lending risks 
success in the banking industry largely depends on the quality of loans and other assets 
the loan officers of exchange s banking subsidiaries are actively encouraged to identify deteriorating loans 
loans are also monitored and categorized through an analysis of their payment status 
our banks failure to timely and accurately monitor the quality of their loans and other assets could have a materially adverse effect on the operations and financial condition of exchange and its banking subsidiaries 
there is a degree of credit risk associated with any lending activity 
our banks attempt to minimize their credit risk through loan diversification 
although our banks loan portfolios are varied  with no undue concentration in any one industry  substantially all of the loans in the portfolios have been made to borrowers in central and west central missouri 
therefore  the loan portfolios are susceptible to factors affecting the central and west central missouri area and the level of non performing assets is heavily dependant upon local conditions 
there can be no assurance that the level of our banks non performing assets will not increase above current levels 
high levels of non performing assets could have a materially adverse effect on the operations and financial condition of exchange and its banking subsidiaries 
the provisions for probable loan losses of exchange s banking subsidiaries may need to be increased 
each of exchange s banking subsidiaries make a provision for loan losses based upon management s analysis of probable losses in the loan portfolio and consideration of prevailing economic conditions 
each of our banks may need to increase the provision for loan losses through additional provisions in the future if the financial condition of any of its borrowers deteriorates or if real estate values decline 
furthermore  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the loan portfolio  provision for loan losses  and real estate acquired by foreclosure of each of our banks 
such agencies may require our banks to recognize additions to the provisions for loan losses based on their judgments of information available to them at the time of the examination 
any additional provisions for probable loan losses  whether required as a result of regulatory review or initiated by exchange itself  may materially alter the financial outlook of exchange and its banking subsidiaries 
if exchange and its banks are unable to successfully compete for customers in exchange s market area  their financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
exchange s banking subsidiaries face substantial competition in making loans  attracting deposits and providing other financial products and services 
our banks have numerous competitors for customers in their market area 
such competition for loans comes principally from other commercial banks mortgage banking companies savings banks finance companies savings and loan associations credit unions competition for deposits comes principally from other commercial banks brokerage firms savings banks insurance companies savings and loan associations money market mutual funds credit unions mutual funds such as corporate and government securities funds many of these competitors have greater financial resources and name recognition  more locations  more advanced technology and more financial products to offer than our banks 
competition from larger institutions may increase due to an acceleration of bank mergers and consolidations in missouri and the rest of the nation 
in addition  the recently enacted gramm leach bliley act removes many of the remaining restrictions in federal banking law against cross ownership between banks and other financial institutions  such as insurance companies and securities firms 
the new law will likely increase the number and financial strength of companies that compete directly with our banks 
the profitability of our banks depends of their continued ability to attract new customers and compete in missouri 
new competitors  as well as the expanding operations of existing competitors  have had  and are expected to continue to have  an adverse impact on our banks market share of deposits and loans in our banks respective service areas 
if our banks are unable to successfully compete  their financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected 
exchange and its banking subsidiaries may be adversely affected by changes in laws and regulations affecting the financial services industry 
banks and bank holding companies such as exchange are subject to regulation by both federal and state bank regulatory agencies 
the regulations  which are designed to protect borrowers and promote certain social policies  include limitations on the operations of banks and bank holding companies  such as minimum capital requirements and restrictions on dividend payments 
the regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in connection with their supervision and enforcement activities and their examination policies  including the imposition of restrictions on the operation of a bank  the classification of assets by an institution and requiring an increase in a bank s allowance for loan losses 
these regulations are not necessarily designed to maximize the profitability of banking institutions 
future changes in the banking laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on the operations and financial condition of exchange and its banking subsidiaries 
the success of exchange and its banks largely depends on the efforts of their executive officers 
the success of exchange and its banking subsidiaries has been largely dependant on the efforts of james smith and david turner and the other executive officers 
these individuals are expected to continue to perform their services 
however  the loss of the services of messrs 
smith or turner  or any of the other key executive officers could have a materially adverse effect on exchange and its banks 
exchange cannot predict how changes in technology will affect its business 
the financial services market  including banking services  is increasingly affected by advances in technology  including developments in telecommunications internet based banking data processing telebanking automation debit cards and so called smart cards the ability of exchange s banking subsidiaries to compete successfully in the future will depend on whether they can anticipate and respond to technological changes 
to develop these and other new technologies our banks will likely have to make additional capital investments 
although our banks continually invest in new technology  there can be no assurance that our banks will have sufficient resources or access to the necessary proprietary technology to remain competitive in the future additional factors 
additional risks and uncertainties that may affect the future results of operations  financial condition or business of our company and its banking subsidiaries include  but are not limited to i adverse publicity  news coverage by the media  or negative reports by brokerage firms  industry and financial analysts regarding our banks or our company  and ii changes in accounting policies and practices 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our company s exposure to market risk is reviewed on a regular basis by our banks asset liability committees and boards of directors 
interest rate risk is the potential of economic losses due to future interest rate changes 
these economic losses can be reflected as a loss of future net interest income and or a loss of current fair market values 
the objective is to measure the effect on net interest income and to adjust the balance sheet to minimize the inherent risk while at the same time maximizing income 
management realizes certain risks are inherent and that the goal is to identify and minimize those risks 
tools used by our bank s management include the standard gap report subject to different rate shock scenarios 
at december   the rate shock scenario models indicated that annual net interest income could change by as much as should interest rates rise or fall within basis points from their current level over a one year period 
however there are no assurances that the change will not be more or less than this estimate
