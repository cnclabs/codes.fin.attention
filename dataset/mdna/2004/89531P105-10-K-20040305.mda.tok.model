all statements regarding our expected financial position and operating results  our business strategy  our financing plans  forecasted demographic and economic trends relating to our industry and similar matters are forward looking statements 
these statements can sometimes be identified by our use of forward looking words such as may  will  anticipate  estimate  expect or intend 
we cannot promise you that our expectations in such forward looking statements will turn out to be correct

overview general 
the company s long term goals are to continue to be the leading producer of a superior non wood decking alternative product  to increase the company s market share of the decking market and to expand into new products and geographic markets 
the company s management considers both financial and non financial indicators and factors in measuring the company s progress in achieving its goals and as general guides for managing the company s operations 
management considers growth in net sales  gross margin  selling  general and administrative expenses  and net income as key indicators of operating performance 
growth in net sales reflects the consumer acceptance of composite decking  the demand for trex over competing products  the success of our branding strategy  the effectiveness of our distribution partners  and the strength of our dealer and contractor network 
management emphasizes gross margin as a key measure of performance because it reflects the company s ability to accurately price its products and to effectively manage its manufacturing unit costs 
managing selling  general and administrative expenses relative to net sales is important to support profitable growth 
management considers net income to be a measure of the company s overall financial performance 
the company manages its liquidity and capital using measures that include total debt  total cash balances  the ratio of debt to total capitalization  the ratio of debt to ebitda  cash flow from operations and free cash flow  which management defines as cash flow from operations  plus net cash used in or provided by investing and financing activities 
management uses these measures to guide it in finding the appropriate balance between sales growth  production  investments in working capital  manufacturing capacity  capital expenditures  and available financial resources to achieve the proper level of liquidity  leverage and capitalization 
management considers manufacturing performance and capacity  market share and distribution as key non financial indicators 
manufacturing performance includes production line efficiency  which can lead to unit cost reductions  and product quality  which is a critical element in ensuring customer satisfaction 
management believes manufacturing capacity is a competitive advantage and supports net sales growth 
market share is a measure of performance relative to the competition and reflects product features  customer satisfaction  brand awareness  and distribution 
the success of our distribution strategy is measured by the effectiveness of our distribution partners and the size of our dealer network and contractor franchise  all of which must continue to expand to support net sales growth and to increase market share 
trex participates in the outdoor home improvement market  which is highly seasonal  and dependent on weather conditions for construction 
management believes that poor weather conditions 
table of contents throughout reduced the activity of contractors and builders  which affected product volume sold through the company s distribution channel and limited the company s net sales growth in managing the cost of pe presented a challenge to the company in the company purchased million of polyethylene in compared to million of polyethylene in higher prices for pe and the start up expenses related to the company s plastic reprocessing plant on its winchester manufacturing site negatively affected manufacturing unit costs 
the company has developed new approaches to rendering contaminated polyethylene film usable for its process and is developing these approaches to broaden its supply of usable pe raw material 
the company expects that its new pe sourcing and purchasing initiatives will be necessary for it to manage effectively its costs for pe raw material in future periods 
to capitalize on growth opportunities and maintain its position as the market leader within the composite decking category  the company must continue to develop innovative new products that meet consumers demands 
in  the company extended its offering of decking products with the addition of the trex accents line 
in addition  the company introduced a new railing system and released fencing prototypes into the market 
as part of its strategy for new product development  the company emphasizes offering consumers a higher level of product aesthetics and superior product performance 
to support further growth  the company must maintain sufficient manufacturing capacity 
although the company s production capacity at the two existing sites will be sufficient to meet anticipated demand for trex through  the company has begun the process of developing a third manufacturing site 
it intends to acquire land  commence construction of a facility and purchase equipment for a third site in completion of a third site will require substantial capital expenditures in and subsequent years 
of all the risks and uncertainties facing the company s business  management views the following as the most significant the company s ability to develop or increase market acceptance of trex  including new products and applications  the company s lack of product diversification and reliance on sales of trex wood polymer lumber  the company s plan to increase production levels  the company s current dependence on its two manufacturing sites  the company s reliance on the supply of low cost raw materials used in its production process  the company s sensitivity to economic conditions  which influence the level of activity in home improvements and new home construction  the company s ability to manage its growth  the company s significant capital investments and ability to access the capital markets  and the company s dependence on its largest distributors to market and sell its products 
a discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties is set forth under the caption business risk factors in this report 
net sales 
net sales consists of sales and freight  net of returns and discounts 
the level of net sales is principally affected by sales volume and the prices paid for trex 
the company s branding and product differentiation strategy enables the company both to command premium prices over wood and to maintain price stability for trex 
the prices for trex over the last three years have increased at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 
gross profit 
gross profit indicates the difference between net sales and cost of sales 
cost of sales consists of raw material costs  direct labor costs  manufacturing costs and freight 
raw material costs generally include the costs to purchase and transport waste wood fiber  pe and pigmentation 
direct labor costs include wages and benefits of personnel engaged in the manufacturing process 
manufacturing costs consists of depreciation  utilities  maintenance supplies and repairs  indirect labor  including wages and benefits  and warehouse and equipment rental costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
the single largest component of selling  general and administrative expenses is branding and other sales and marketing costs  which have increased significantly as the company has sought to build brand awareness of trex in the decking market 
sales and 
table of contents marketing costs consist primarily of salaries  commissions and benefits paid to sales and marketing personnel  advertising expenses and other promotional costs 
general and administrative expenses include salaries and benefits of personnel engaged in research and development  procurement  accounting and other business functions  office occupancy costs attributable to these functions  and professional fees 
as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses have varied from quarter to quarter due  in part  to the seasonality of the company s business 
critical accounting policies  estimates and risks and uncertainties our significant accounting policies are described in note to our audited consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report 
critical accounting policies include the areas where we have made what we consider to be particularly difficult  subjective or complex judgments in making estimates  and where these estimates can significantly affect our financial results under different assumptions and conditions 
we prepare our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
as a result  we are required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon the information available 
these estimates  judgments and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statement and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods presented 
actual results could be different from these estimates 
inventories 
the company s inventories have increased to million as of december  from million as of december  the company believes that its quantity and mix of finished goods inventory will be saleable in the ordinary course of business and  accordingly  has not established significant reserves for slow moving products or obsolescence 
the company accounts for its inventories at the lower of cost last in  first out  or lifo or market value 
the company anticipates a reduction in inventory levels in as shipments are expected to outpace production levels 
at december   the excess of the replacement cost of inventory over the lifo value of inventory was approximately million 
the company cannot estimate at this time the effect of future reductions  if any  in inventory levels on its future operating results 
property  plant and equipment 
as of december   the company s construction in process totaled approximately million 
the construction in process consisted primarily of three production lines in various stages of completion at the company s winchester and fernley manufacturing sites and plastic reprocessing equipment 
the company currently expects that the production lines in process will be put into service by mid pursuant to financial accounting standards board statement no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable  the company compares the carrying values of its long lived assets  including construction in process  against the expected undiscounted cash flows relating to those assets 
the significant assumptions inherent in the company s estimate include increases in sales volumes and maintenance of gross margins that are consistent with historical levels 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
in such event  the carrying value and the estimated useful lives of the company s long lived assets could be reduced in the future 
property  plant and equipment are depreciated on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
the depreciable lives of these assets range from to years 
we make estimates of the useful lives  in part  based upon historical performance of similar assets 
we periodically review the remaining estimated useful lives of our property  plant and equipment to determine if any revisions to our estimates are necessary 
changes to our estimate of the useful lives of our property  plant and equipment could have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
contingencies 
the company is subject  from time to time  to various lawsuits and other claims related to patent infringement  product liability and other matters 
the company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable 
table of contents losses 
the company makes a determination of the amount of reserves required  if any  for these contingencies after an analysis of each lawsuit and claim 
the required reserves may change in the future as a result of new developments in any such matter or changes in approach  such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with a particular matter 
in the opinion of management  adequate provision has been made for any probable losses as of december  revenue recognition 
the company recognizes revenue when title is transferred to customers  which is upon shipment of the product to the customer from the company s manufacturing facilities 
pursuant to emerging issues task force eitf issue  accounting for shipping and handling fees and costs  the company records all shipping and handling fees in net sales and records all of the related costs in cost of sales 
the company offers several programs to dealers and distributors  including cash rebates  sales incentives and cooperative advertising

the senior secured notes  which were privately placed with institutional investors  accrue interest at an annual rate of 
five principal payments of million annually to retire the notes will be payable beginning in june the new revolving credit facility and real estate loans accrue interest at annual rates equal to libor plus specified margins and mature on the third anniversary of the closing date 
the specified margins are determined based on the company s ratio of total consolidated debt to consolidated earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  as computed under the loans 
the specified margins for the credit facility range from to and the specified margins for the real estate loans range from to 

table of contents the company s ability to borrow under the revolving credit facility is tied to a borrowing base that consists of certain receivables and inventories 
as of december   the borrowing base was million and no borrowings were outstanding under the facility

as of december   the company was in compliance with these covenants 
the company s ability to make scheduled principal and interest payments on its real estate loans and senior secured notes  borrow under its revolving credit facility and maintain compliance with the related financial covenants will depend primarily on its ability to generate substantial cash flow from operations 
the generation of operating cash flow is subject to the risks of the company s business  some of which are discussed in this report under business risk factors

the company currently estimates that its capital requirements in will total approximately to million 
of its capital expenditures in  the company expects to use approximately to million to acquire land  commence construction of a facility and purchase equipment for a third manufacturing site  approximately million to acquire additional plastic reprocessing equipment  approximately million to make process and productivity improvements  and approximately million to increase capacity at the company s two existing manufacturing sites 
the company expects that it will continue to make significant capital expenditures in and subsequent years as the company completes its construction in process and its new manufacturing site to meet an anticipated increase in the demand for trex 
as of december   the company had a total of approximately million of cash and cash equivalents 
the company believes that cash on hand  cash flow from operations and borrowings expected to be available under the company s existing revolving credit facility will provide sufficient cash to enable the company to fund its planned capital expenditures  make scheduled principal and interest payments  meet its other cash requirements and maintain compliance with the terms of its financing agreements for at least the next months

the company currently expects that it will fund its future capital expenditures primarily with cash from operations and financing activities 

table of contents the company will have to make additional investments after to complete construction of the new site and to equip the facility for the commencement of production 
the amount and timing of these investments will depend on the anticipated demand for trex  the production obtained from the existing two sites  the availability of funds and other factors 
the company anticipates that it may seek to finance a portion of the additional investments with borrowings under its revolving credit facility and or other financing arrangements 
as of the date of this report  the company had no commitment for any such other financing arrangements 
the actual amount and timing of the company s future capital requirements may differ materially from the company s estimate depending on the demand for trex and new market developments and opportunities 
the company may determine that it is necessary or desirable to obtain financing for such requirements through bank borrowings or the issuance of debt or equity securities 
debt financing would increase the company s level of indebtedness  while equity financing would dilute the ownership of the company s stockholders

changes in interest rates affect the fair value of the company s fixed rate debt 
the fair value of the company s long term fixed rate debt on december  was approximately million 
based on balances outstanding at december   a change in interest rates would change the fair value of the company s long term fixed rate debt by million 
the foregoing sensitivity analysis provides only a limited view as of a specific date regarding the sensitivity of some of our financial instruments to market risk 
the actual impact of changes in market interest rates on the financial instruments may differ significantly from the impact shown in this sensitivity analysis 
the company has a purchase agreement for pe under which it has certain limited market risk related to foreign currency fluctuations on euros 
at current purchase levels  such exposure is not material
