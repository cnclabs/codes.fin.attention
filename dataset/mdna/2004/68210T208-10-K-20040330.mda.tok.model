actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of a number of factors  including but not limited to those discussed under the heading cautionary statements 
forward looking statements provided by us pursuant to the safe harbor established by the federal securities laws should be evaluated in the context of these factors 
this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
recent developments subsequent to december   we issued million of subordinated convertible debentures the debentures maturing in february the proceeds were used to redeem our series a preferred stock and a portion of our series b preferred stock 
under the terms of the agreement  the holders of the debentures will also have the right to require the repayment or conversion of up to million plus accrued and unpaid interest of the debentures earlier than maturity put option 
the put option can be exercised in ten consecutive and equal monthly installments commencing the first full month following the date on which a registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission to register the underlying common shares is declared effective 
upon receipt by omni of the debenture holders intent to exercise the put option  the company will have the irrevocable option to deliver cash or common stock with respect to the put option 
if the company elects to pay the put option with common stock  the underlying shares will be valued at a discount to the average trading price of omni common stock for the applicable pricing period  as defined by the agreement 
the company also issued i series a warrants representing the right to purchase in the aggregate  shares of common stock with an exercise price of per share subject to adjustment as provided therein  and ii series b warrants representing the right to purchase in the aggregate  shares of common stock with an exercise price of per share subject to adjustment as provided therein 
the series a warrants and series b warrants cannot be exercised at any time before the date that is six months and one day after the date the warrants were issued 
the series a warrants are exercisable for one year after they become exercisable 
the series b warrants are exercisable for five years after they become exercisable 
subsequent to december   we entered into a five year contract to provide offshore transportation services to approximately manned and unmanned offshore transportation platforms  primarily in the shallow  offshore waters of the gulf of mexico 
the contract is expected to generate for us  in excess of  million in annual revenue 
in march  we acquired acres of real estate near intracoastal city  louisiana  which will serve as our primary operating aviation base and facilitate the consolidation of our principal aviation maintenance and repair facilities 
we expect to commence operations from this new facility during the third quarter of general demand 
we receive our revenues from customers in the energy industry 
demand for our services is principally impacted by conditions affecting geophysical companies engaged in the acquisition of d seismic data and oil and gas companies operating primarily in the shallow waters of the gulf of mexico 
the level of activity for our services is primarily influenced by the level of capital expenditures by oil and gas companies 
a number of factors affect the decision of oil and gas companies to pursue the acquisition of seismic data  including i prevailing and expected oil and gas demand and prices  ii the cost of exploring for  producing and developing oil and gas reserves  iii the discovery rate of new oil and gas reserves  iv the availability and cost of permits and consents from landowners to conduct seismic activity  v local and international political and economic conditions  vi governmental regulations  and vii the availability and cost of capital 
the ability to finance the acquisition of seismic data in the absence of oil and gas companies interest in obtaining the information is also a factor  as some geophysical companies will acquire seismic data on a speculative basis 
during  with the reduction in the price of oil and gas  we began to experience a decrease in demand for our services 
in  the market experienced a rebound 
for the years ended december   and  our operating revenues were million  million  and million  respectively 
seasonality and weather risks 
our operations are subject to seasonal variations in weather conditions and daylight hours 
since our activities take place outdoors  on average  fewer hours are worked per day and fewer holes are generally drilled or surveyed per day in winter months than in summer months due to an increase in rainy  foggy  and cold conditions and a decrease in daylight hours 
results of operations the following discussion provides information related to the results of our operations 
year ended december  compared to the year ended december  in thousands year ended december  december  operating revenue   operating expense   gross profit   general and administrative expenses   operating income   interest expense  other income expense income before taxes  income tax benefit  net income from continuing operations   loss from discontinued operations net income   accretion of preferred stock and preferred stock dividends net income applicable to common and common equivalent shares  operating revenues increased  or million  from million to million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
this increase was due primarily to improved market conditions in the geophysical industry in as a result  drilling revenues increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  aviation revenues increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december   as we continued to concentrate on the more profitable offshore market and  to a limited extent in the fourth quarter  our acquisition of ahi 
our permitting division reported revenues of million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the same period of survey revenues remained constant at zero for the years ended december  and as we continued to concentrate our personnel  equipment and available working capital on other core segments of our business 
operating revenues are expected to increase in  as the demand for  and range of  our services continue to improve 
operating expenses increased  or million  from million in to million in operating payroll expense increased million from million to million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
also  as a result of the increased activity levels in as compared to  explosives expenses  repairs and maintenance expenses  and fuel and oil expenses increased million  million and million  respectively 
due to the increase in revenue producing assets between the periods ended december  and  depreciation expense and insurance expense increased million and million  respectively 
while operating expenses are expected to continue to increase in as operating revenues increase  we expect these expenses to remain in line with revenues 
gross profit increased  or million  from million to million  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
further  our gross profit margin improved from in to in the increase in gross profit margin is a result of increased business activity in our more profitable business segments  improved utilization of our equipment and personnel for the services provided and more stringent controls over operating expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased million from million for to million for amortization expense increased by million resulting from a one time amortization expense due to the refinancing of a more favorable senior credit facility  revolving line of credit and equipment term loan 
in addition  other general and administrative expense increased by million due to realized savings in from renegotiated lease and vendor agreements and legal expenses offset by the receipt of million in cash received as a result of our agreement to facilitate the private placement of approximately  shares owned by an affiliate and certain investors 
general and administrative expenses are expected to increase slightly in due to our acquisition of ahi  however  we expect to take advantage of synergies relating to this acquisition  as well as  maintain stringent controls of these costs 
interest expense was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease was principally attributable to decreased interest rates between the periods 
we expect to manage our senior debt facility as we explore strategic business opportunities  but are currently positioned to reduce debt with excess cash flow 
other expense increased million  primarily as a result of an increase in sales discounts on customer contracts 
in  the company reversed million of the net operating loss carry forwards previously reserved compared to million in of this related reserve reversed in in  the company incurred million in expenses related to the discontinuation of the south american operations with no corresponding expense recorded in accretion of preferred stock and preferred stock dividends remained constant at million for the years ended december  and year ended december  compared to the year ended december  year ended december  december  operating revenue   operating expense   gross profit   general and administrative expenses   asset impairment and other charges operating income loss  interest expense   other income  income before taxes  income tax benefit net income   accretion of preferred stock net income applicable to common and common equivalent shares  operating revenues increased  or million  from million to million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
this increase was due primarily to the aforementioned acquisition of the assets of airjac drilling and improved market conditions in the geophysical industry in as a result  drilling revenues increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the increase in drilling revenues was partially offset by a decline in revenues in our other divisions 
our newly formed permitting division reported revenues of million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the same period of survey revenues decreased from million for the year ended december  to zero for the year ended december  this decline is attributable to our decision to concentrate our personnel  equipment and available working capital on other core segments of our business 
aviation revenues decreased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  as we continued to reduce our seismic aviation fleet in order to concentrate on the more profitable offshore market 
operating revenues are expected to increase in as demand for our services continues to improve 
operating expenses increased  or million  from million in to million in operating payroll expense increased million from million to million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in seismic activity resulted in a corresponding increase in the amount of personnel employed 
the average number of field employees was in and in also  as a result of the increased activity levels in as compared to  explosives expenses and repairs and maintenance expenses increased million and million  respectively 
these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in rental expense and related insurance expense on leased aviation equipment from to the decrease in rental expense resulted from the refinancing of our aviation fleet in december our aviation fleet was previously operated under an operating lease 
insurance expense declined as we reduced the size of our aviation fleet dedicated solely to support our seismic drilling operations 
while operating expenses are expected to continue to increase in as operating revenues increase  we expect these expenses to remain in line with revenues 
gross profit increased  or million  from million to million  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
further  our gross profit margin improved from in to in the increase in gross profit margin is a result of increased business activity in our more profitable business segments  improved utilization of our equipment and personnel for the services provided and more stringent controls over operating expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased million  or  from million for compared to million for payroll expenses accounted for million of this increase as administrative payroll costs increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this increase is principally attributable to an increase in the average number of administrative employees between the periods 
during we realized savings in certain general and administrative costs by renegotiating lease and vendor agreements with more favorable terms than those in preceding years 
general and administrative expenses are expected to increase slightly in due to increased business activity 
during  we recorded asset impairment charges of million see note compared to million in interest expense was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease was principally attributable to increased debt levels in resulting from our decision to acquire our aviation fleet in december that was previously operated through an operating lease 
other income decreased million between the year ended december  and the year ended december  the decrease was primarily attributable to the receipt of million in proceeds from a key man life insurance policy in procured on the life of our founder and former ceo 
he was killed in a private aircraft accident in february for the year ended december   losses incurred by us generated an additional net operating loss carryforward for which a reserve has been provided see note  resulting in income tax expense of in the company reversed million of this related reserve due to the company s expectation of generating income in fiscal accretion of preferred stock decreased million from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the decrease is due to the accretion of dividends at during the free dividend period from april through june  liquidity and capital resources during  we privately placed a total of million in subordinated debentures with an affiliate  which brought our total placement with them to million 
the debentures accrued interest at per annum or a rate commencing at per annum and escalating over the life of the note to a maximum of per annum 
the debentures matured five years from the date of their issuance with interest payable quarterly 
detachable from these debentures  were warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock 
the warrants vested over four years and with exercise prices from ranging from to 
we recorded each warrant at its relative fair value at date of issuance 
as of december  we have received of million in factored trade receivables of a major customer with an affiliate 
the remaining million is classified as amounts due to affiliate 
in addition  we borrowed million from this affiliate during as of december   million remained outstanding 
the loan is secured by the amounts due from certain customers 
during the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of  we dramatically improved our financial position with the successful raise of million of new equity and the receipt of million in proceeds from a key man life insurance policy 
with the proceeds we repaid approximately million of senior secured indebtedness 
further  we reached an agreement to eliminate all of the remaining subordinated debt to an affiliate by the payment of approximately million to satisfy million of the indebtedness and the issuance of shares of series b preferred stock for the remaining outstanding balance 
we extended the maturity dates for all of our senior secured indebtedness  and negotiated a fixed interest rate reduction on approximately million of our senior secured debt 
on february   our founder and then ceo  was killed in a private aircraft accident 
as a result  we received million in insurance proceeds from the key man insurance policy purchased in connection with a private placement in the private placement stockholders waived their right to put their stock back to us 
in connection with the receipt of these waivers  we also obtained commitments from our senior secured lenders to modify the then existing credit agreements 
under the terms of these revised commitments  the maturity dates were extended and interest rates were reduced from prime plus to prime plus 
with the proceeds we paid million of our senior secured term indebtedness and we reached an agreement with an affiliate  the holder of our outstanding subordinated debt to convert our remaining outstanding subordinated debt into million of series b preferred stock 
under the terms of this agreement  we paid the holder of our outstanding subordinated debt  million in satisfaction of million of indebtedness and issued  shares of series b preferred stock in full satisfaction of the remaining unpaid subordinated debentures 
in september  we refinanced our working capital revolving line of credit and certain equipment term indebtedness with a million senior credit facility including a million revolving line of credit and a million equipment term loan 
in august  we completed a new million real estate loan with a bank 
the proceeds were used to repay the existing real estate loan  the principal balance of which totaled million 
the gain on the early extinguishment of the then existing real estate debt was recognized as income in the second quarter of the new real estate loan is payable in equal monthly installments plus interest accruing at the prime interest rate plus and is secured by our corporate office  real estate and fabrication and maintenance facilities 
further  under the terms of the new real estate credit agreement  a principal payment of million is due in july in december  we entered into a million senior credit facility with a bank including a million working capital revolving line of credit the line and a million term loan 
the proceeds were used to repay term debt  refinance our revolving line of credit and provide working capital 
at december   we had approximately million in cash on hand as compared to approximately million at december  at december   we had working capital of approximately million as compared to approximately million at december  the increase in working capital is due to increased profitability  improved cash flow generated by our operations and the impact of our debt restructuring efforts 
cash provided by operating activities was million and million in the years ended december  and  respectively 
income provided from our operations was the single largest contributing factor in both years 
availability under the line is the lower of i million or ii the sum of of eligible accounts receivable  plus the lessor of million or of the appraised orderly liquidation value of eligible inventory of parts and supplies 
the line accrues interest at the prime interest rate plus at december  and matures on december  the line is collateralized by accounts receivable and inventory and is subject to certain customer concentration limitations 
as of december  we had million outstanding under the line and additional borrowing availability of million 
the weighted average interest rate on borrowings under our revolving lines of credit was and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
at december   we also had outstanding approximately million in other senior secured debt  including approximately million with an equipment finance company 
this loan amortizes over seven years bears interest at libor plus  is secured by seismic drilling equipment and matures in july further  at december  we had approximately million outstanding to an aviation equipment finance company 
this loan is secured by the aviation fleet  amortizes over ten years  accrues interest at per annum and matures january included in the million in senior debt was the assumption of million in equipment debt at an interest rate of  we acquired in our acquisition of ahi  secured by an aircraft 
additionally  we had million in capital leases on four helicopters payable to a finance company 
our real estate is financed with a bank with payments amortized over years  bears interest at prime plus and matures in august with a principal payment of million due in july at december   the balance outstanding under our real estate loan was million 
historically  our capital requirements have primarily related to the purchase or fabrication of new seismic drilling equipment and related support equipment  additions to our aviation fleet and new business acquisitions 
in  we acquired the assets of airjac drilling see notes and and approximately million of new vehicles accounted for as a capital lease 
in  we acquired the assets of american helicopters  inc note for million cash and the assumption of certain long term debt 
in  we plan to continue to explore strategic business opportunities 
contractual commitments we have the following contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period less than after total year years years long term debt     capital lease obligations    total contractual cash     in addition to the obligations described above  we also have a revolving line of credit  which is secured by our accounts receivable and inventory 
the line of credit matures in december the balance outstanding on the line of credit was million at december  we periodically finance insurance policies on a short term basis 
as of december   million was outstanding for various polices financed with maturity dates ranging from august to november we believe that cash flow generated from operations in will be sufficient to fund our working capital needs  satisfy our debt service requirements and contractual commitments  and fulfill our capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months 
cautionary statements certain statements included in this annual report and in the documents that we have incorporated by reference are not historical facts and are intended to be forward looking statements 
forward looking statements in this annual report are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of such forward looking statements may include statements that relate to our business plans or strategies  and projected or anticipated benefits or other consequences of such plans or strategies  our objectives  projected and anticipated benefits from future or past acquisitions  and projections involving anticipated capital expenditures or revenues  earnings or other aspects of capital projects or operating results 
forward looking statements generally can be identified by the use of words such as may  will  expect  intend  estimate  anticipate or believe or similar language 
forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and all phases of our operations are subject to a number of uncertainties  risks and other influences  many of which are beyond our control 
any one of such influences  or a combination  could materially affect the results of our operations and the accuracy of the forward looking statements that we make 
you are cautioned that all forward looking statements involve risks associated with our dependence on activity in the oil and gas industry  labor shortages  international expansion  dependence on significant customers  seasonality and weather risks  competition  technological evolution and other risks detailed in the company s filings with the securities and exchange commission 
additional important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in our forward looking statements are discussed under the caption risk factors below 
you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements  which speak only as of the date that they are made 
we undertake no obligation to publicly update our forward looking statements 
risk factors you should carefully consider the following risk factors  in addition to the other information set forth or incorporated by reference herein 
each of these risk factors could adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition  and also adversely affect the value of an investment in our common stock 
industry volatility may adversely affect our results of operations 
the demand for our services depends on the level of capital expenditures by oil and gas companies for developmental construction and these expenditures are critical to our operations 
the levels of such capital expenditures are influenced by oil and gas prices and industry perceptions of future price levels  the cost of exploring for  producing and delivering oil and gas  the ability of oil and gas companies to generate capital  the sale and expiration dates of leases in the united states  the availability of current geophysical data  the discovery rate of new oil and gas reserves  and local and international political and economic conditions 
the cyclical nature of the oil and gas industry has a significant effect on our revenues and profitability 
historically  prices of oil and gas  as well as the level of exploration and developmental activity  have fluctuated substantially 
this has  in the past  and may  in the future  adversely affect our business 
we are unable to predict future oil and gas prices or the level of oil and gas industry activity 
a prolonged low level of activity in the oil and gas industry will likely depress development activity  adversely affecting the demand for our products and services and our financial condition and results of operations 
our growth and growth strategy involves risks 
we have grown over the last several years through internal growth and acquisitions of other companies 
it will be important for our future success to manage our rapid growth and this will demand increased responsibility for management personnel 
the following factors could present difficulties to us the lack of sufficient executive level personnel  the successful integration of the operations of american helicopters  inc including the integration of a management team with no history of working together  increased administrative burdens  and increased logistical problems of large  expansive operations 
if we do not manage these potential difficulties successfully  they could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we have incurred net losses in previous years 
our past financial history reflects annual net losses 
our more recent history  however  reflects annual net incomes 
while we hope to continue to generate increased revenues and profitability  any such increase may not be sustainable or indicative of future results of operations 
we do intend to continue investing in internal expansion  infrastructure  integration of acquired companies into our operations and our marketing and sales efforts 
the dangers inherent in our operations and the potential limits on insurance coverage for certain risks could expose us to potentially significant liability costs 
our seismic operations are subject to risks or injury to personnel and loss of equipment 
our crews often conduct operations in extreme weather  in difficult terrain that is not easily accessible  and under other hazardous conditions 
in addition  our aviation operations are subject to numerous hazards inherent in the operation of helicopters and airplanes 
these hazards include adverse weather conditions  crashes  explosions  collisions and fires  all of which may result in injury to personnel or loss of equipment 
we maintain what we believe is prudent insurance protection 
however  we cannot assure that our insurance will be sufficient or effective under all circumstances 
a successful claim for which we are not fully insured may have a material adverse effect on our revenues and profitability 
we do not carry business interruption insurance with respect to our operations 
we operate in a highly competitive industry 
we compete with several other providers of seismic drilling  helicopter support  permitting and survey services 
competition among seismic contractors historically has been and will continue to be intense 
competitive factors have in recent years included price  crew experience  equipment availability  technological expertise and reputation for quality and dependability 
our revenues and earnings may be affected by the following factors changes in competitive prices  fluctuations in the level of activity and major markets  general economic conditions  and governmental regulation 
additionally  in certain geographical areas  some of our competitors operate more crews than we do and have substantially greater financial and other resources 
these operators could enjoy an advantage over us if the competitive environment for contract awards shifts to one characterized principally by intense price competition 
seasonality and adverse weather conditions in the regions in which we operate may adversely affect our operations 
our operations are directly affected by the weather conditions in the gulf of mexico 
due to seasonal differences in weather patterns  we may operate more days in the spring  summer and fall periods and less in the winter months 
the seasonality of oil and gas industry activity in the gulf coast region also affects our operations 
due to exposure to weather  we generally experience higher drilling activity in the spring  summer and fall months with the lowest activity in winter months  especially with respect to our operations in the mountainous regions of the western united states 
the rainy weather  hurricanes and other storms prevalent in the gulf of mexico and along the gulf coast throughout the year may also affect our operations 
as a result  full year results are not likely to be a direct multiple of any particular quarter or combination of quarters 
we are dependent on key personnel 
our success depends on  among other things  the continued active participation of our executive officers and certain of our other key operating personnel 
our officers and personnel have extensive experience in the domestic and international oilfield supply industry 
the loss of the services of any one of these persons could impact adversely our ability to implement our expansion strategy 
we may incur additional expenditures to comply with governmental regulations 
our seismic and aviation operations are subject to extensive governmental regulation  violations of which may result in civil and criminal penalties  injunctions and cease and desist orders 
these laws and regulations govern  among other things  operations in wetlands  the handling of explosives and the operation of commercial aircraft 
although our cost of compliance with such laws has to date been immaterial  such laws are changed frequently 
accordingly  it is impossible to predict the cost or impact of such laws on our future operations 
we are also required by various governmental agencies to obtain certain permits  licenses and certificates 
to date  we believe that we possess all permits  licenses and certificates material to the operation of our business 
the loss by us of any of the licenses required for our operation could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
we depend on demand for our services from the oil and gas industry  and this demand may be affected by changing tax laws and oil and gas regulations 
as a result  the adoption of laws that curtail oil and gas production in our areas of operation may adversely affect us 
we cannot determine to what extent our operations may be affected by any new regulations or changes in existing regulations 
future technological advances could impair operating assets or require substantial unbudgeted capital expenditures 
we compete in providing services in a capital intensive business 
the development of seismic data acquisition and processing equipment has been characterized by rapid technological advancements in recent years  and this trend may continue 
manufacturers of seismic equipment may develop new systems that have competitive advantages over systems now in use that could render our current equipment obsolete or require us to make significant unplanned capital expenditures to maintain our competitive position 
under such circumstances  there can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain necessary financing on favorable terms 
we depend on a few significant customers 
we derive a significant amount of our revenue from a small number of geophysical companies 
our inability to continue to perform services for a number of our large existing customers  if not offset by sales to new or other existing customers could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations 
for example  our largest customers those which individually accounted for more than of revenue in a given year  listed alphabetically collectively accounted for grant geophysical  quantum geophysical and western geophysical  veritas dgc and western geophysical and quantum geophysical  seismic exchange  and veritas dgc of revenue for fiscal  and  respectively 
related party transactions during the year ended december   we leased a facility from an affiliate 
lease payments totaled approximately million  which approximated market value 
the lease was terminated in july see notes and for transactions with our affiliates 
as of december   we were liable to an affiliate for approximately million from the factoring of trade receivables of a major customer 
in addition  we borrowed million from this affiliate during as of december   million remained outstanding 
the loan was secured by the amounts due from certain customers 
during the years ended december  and  we privately placed with an affiliate subordinated debentures totaling million and million  respectively 
the debentures matured five years from their date of issue and accrued interest at various rates ranging from a fixed rate of per annum to a variable rate of interest starting at per annum and escalating to per annum 
in october  we agreed to convert million of the subordinated debentures into our series a preferred stock 
in may  we agreed to pay the affiliate million cash plus issue to the affiliate million of the company s series b preferred stock in satisfaction of all of the remaining outstanding subordinated debentures including accrued interest of million 
this transaction resulted in the affiliate agreeing to forgive million of indebtedness  which has been reflected as a capital contribution from the affiliate rather than as income in the accompanying financial statements see note regarding the accounting for preferred stock 
in connection with the original issuance of the subordinated debentures  we issued to the affiliate detachable warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock 
as of december    warrants outstanding are all exercisable with an exercise price of per share 
subsequent to december   the affiliate exercised all of these warrants 
during  we entered into an agreement to facilitate the private placement of approximately  shares of our common stock owned by an affiliate and certain investors 
the sale of the stock covered by this agreement closed in the fourth quarter of  resulting in our receipt of million cash which is reflected as a reduction in our general and administrative expenses in the accompanying financial statements 
in order to facilitate a settlement of ongoing litigation between certain of our affiliates  we agreed to re price and extend the maturity dates of certain warrants owned by the defendant affiliates but transferred in settlement of the litigation to the plaintiff affiliates 
the exercise prices of the transferred warrants ranged from per share 
the maturity dates of the transferred warrants ranged from november  to july  the transferred warrants were re priced at per share and the maturity dates were extended to november  our statement of operations includes a non recurring charge of approximately million representing the differences in the fair market value of the originally issued warrants and the re priced warrants 
subsequent to december   all re priced warrants were exercised 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we evaluate our estimates on an on going basis  based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation on our consolidated financial statements 
we extend credit to customers and other parties in the normal course of business 
we regularly review outstanding receivables  and provide for estimated losses through an allowance for doubtful accounts 
in evaluating the level of established reserves  we make judgments regarding the parties ability to make required payments  economic events and other factors 
as the financial condition of these parties change  circumstances develop or additional information becomes available  adjustments to the allowance for doubtful account may be required 
due to the nature of our industry  we have a concentration of credit risks 
as a result  adjustments to the allowance for doubtful accounts may be significant 
we have made significant investments in inventory to service our equipment 
on a routine basis  we use judgments in determining the level of reserves required to state inventory at the lower of cost or market 
technological innovations  market activity levels and the physical condition of products primarily influence our estimates 
changes in these or other factors may result in adjustments to the carrying value of inventory 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for differences between the book basis and tax basis of our net assets 
in providing for deferred taxes  we consider current tax regulations  estimates of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies 
we have established reserves to reduce our net deferred tax assets to estimated realizable value 
if tax regulations change  operating results or the ability to implement tax planning strategies vary  adjustments to the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets and liabilities may be required 
in making this determination  we have considered future income in assessing the ultimate recoverability of the recognized net deferred tax asset 
we record liabilities for environmental obligations when remedial efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated 
our estimates are based on currently enacted laws and regulations 
as more information becomes available or environmental laws and regulations change  such liabilities may be required to be adjusted 
additionally  in connection with acquisitions  we obtain indemnifications from the seller related to environmental matters 
if the indemnifying parties do not fulfill their obligations  adjustments of recorded amounts may be required 
we maintain insurance coverage for various aspects of our business and operations 
we retain a portion of losses that occur through the use of deductibles and self funded insurance programs 
we regularly review estimates of reported and unreported claims and provide for losses through insurance reserves 
as claims develop and additional information becomes available  adjustments to loss reserves may be required
