we use words such as anticipates  believes  expects  future  intends and similar expressions to identify forward looking statements 
our actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements for any reason  including the factors set forth in risk factors and elsewhere in this report 
executive summary we design  develop  manufacture and market a broad line of high performance digital and mixed signal integrated circuits for a broad range of markets including networking  wireless infrastructure and handsets  computation  consumer  automotive  and industrial 
we have four product divisions and four subsidiaries  organized into two business segments our memory products and non memory products groups 
in addition  in order to enhance our focus on the communications market and our end customers  we report information by the following market segments wide area networks and storage area networks wan san  wireless infrastructure and wireless terminal win wit  computation and consumer  and our cypress subsidiaries 
the semiconductor industry continued its recovery in  which translated into a broad market improvement for us 
we had sequential improvements in revenue  gross margin and operating results during all quarters of fiscal this resulted in a reduction of our net loss to million in fiscal compared to a net loss of million in fiscal we experienced improvements in our operational results in fiscal  a result of both the semiconductor industry recovery as well as us realizing the benefits of our restructuring activities in fiscal and fiscal our revenues for fiscal were million  an increase of million or compared to revenues for fiscal  and an increase of million or compared to revenues for fiscal the revenue increase in is attributable primarily to an increase in unit shipments  offset to a lesser degree by lower average selling price asp degradation 
we have seen a reduction in the rate of decline in pricing during and have been able to raise prices on selected products 
in addition  our revenues have improved across our market segments 
in general  as we look ahead to  we believe the outlook to be a growth year both for the semiconductor industry and ourselves 
our belief is based upon signs we are seeing in the communications recovery and the already strong consumer and wireless markets 
we expect revenue for fiscal to be up approximately over fiscal revenue as a result of increased unit shipments and lower asp degradation 
our gross margins improved to in fiscal compared to in fiscal due to factors discussed above relating to revenue increases 
we expect gross margin to improve approximately  plus or minus a few percentage points  for fiscal research and development and selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal were million and million lower than fiscal primarily as a result of our restructuring activities in fiscal and fiscal from a liquidity and capital resources standpoint  management has emphasized generating positive cash flows for  which was achieved as a result of improved business conditions  the impact of the restructuring of our operations during fiscal and fiscal  and a decline in our spending on capital expenditures 
during fiscal  our total cash  cash equivalents  short term investments  long term investments  and restricted cash increased million  primarily as a result of cash from operations of million with the balance primarily a result of our refinancing of our long term debt during including restricted cash  our total liquid cash position was million at the end of fiscal during fiscal  we issued million in principal amount of convertible subordinated notes due june  and used a portion of the proceeds to redeem in full our convertible subordinated notes due january  and to redeem million in principal amount of our convertible subordinated notes due june  leaving million in principal amount of these notes outstanding at the end of fiscal page results of operations business segment net revenues year ended december  december  december  in thousands memory    non memory    total consolidated revenues    revenues for the sale of memory products for fiscal increased million or versus revenues from the sale of these products for fiscal memory product revenues increased as compared to fiscal due to increased demand for our synchronous sram products and an increase in our asps of 
cypress uses average asp mbit as an indication of the magnitude of price change for memory products 
this metric reflects changes in product mix and density as well as market price 
asp mbit declined by from fiscal to fiscal and from fiscal to fiscal revenues from the sale of memory products for fiscal decreased million or versus revenues from the sale of these products for fiscal a increase in unit demand for semiconductor products  particularly in the wireless markets  was more than offset by a decline in asps although the average density mbits unit of srams products sold continued to increase 
revenues in fiscal from the sale of non memory products increased million or when compared to revenues from the sale of these products for fiscal the increase in non memory product revenues  as compared to fiscal  was driven by revenue growth from our network search engines  programmable logic devices  physical layer devices  multi ports devices and universal serial bus family of products 
our subsidiary companies slm  cypress microsystems and sunpower also contributed to the revenue growth 
in fiscal  asps decreased as compared to fiscal for non memory products 
revenues in fiscal from the sale of non memory products increased million or when compared to revenues from the sale of these products for fiscal the increase in non memory product revenues  as compared to fiscal  resulted primarily from a increase in unit sales 
the increase in unit sales resulted from increases in unit demand primarily from our usb family of products  neuron  and programmable clocks 
market segment revenues years ended december  december  december  in thousands wide area networks storage area networks    wireless terminals wireless infrastructure    computation and consumer    cypress subsidiaries    total consolidated revenues    revenues from the sale of wide area networks storage area networks wan san products for fiscal increased million or compared to fiscal improvement in the overall enterprise networking market has been followed by increases in broader based networking sales 
wan san product revenues increased as compared to fiscal due to increased demand for our network search engines 
this segment also experienced growth due to our acquisition of micron technology  inc s high performance communications orientated synchronous static random access memory sram product portfolio inventory in the second quarter of fiscal revenues from the sale of wan san products for fiscal decreased million or compared to fiscal the revenue declines in were primarily driven by lower sales from the networking markets  although our entire product portfolio experienced declines 
the revenue declines were a result of both the general and industry economic downturn 
revenues from the sale of wireless networks wireless infrastructure wit win products for fiscal increased million or compared to fiscal the revenue increase is attributable in part to strength in the handset business and a continued shift to a higher density sram product mix 
revenue in this segment is dominated by our mobl and micropower srams product families 
revenues from the sale of wit win products for fiscal increased million or compared to fiscal revenue increases were primarily due to the improved sales of our low power memory products 
page revenues from the sale of computation and consumer products for fiscal increased million or compared to fiscal in the computation sector  pc related demand grew due to the increase in the adoption rate of usb technology  a serial plug and play connection standard for pcs and peripherals 
growth in the consumer sector was driven by sales of our programmable clocks 
revenues from the sale of computation and consumer products for fiscal increased million or compared to fiscal growth in this market segment was primarily a result of increases in unit demand from our usb family of products and programmable clocks 
revenues from the cypress subsidiaries for fiscal increased million or compared to fiscal the growth was driven by increased psoc product revenue from cypress microsystems cms  and increased non recurring engineering revenue  product revenue  and license revenue from silicon light machines slm 
in addition  revenue increased as a result of the consolidation of sunpower corporation sunpower  effective at the beginning of fiscal revenues from the cypress subsidiaries for fiscal increased million or compared to fiscal the growth was primarily attributable to the introduction of psoc product revenue from cms 
as is typical in the semiconductor industry  asps of our products generally decline over the lifetime of the products 
to increase revenues  cypress seeks to expand its market share in the markets it currently serves and to introduce and sell new products with higher asps 
cypress will seek to remain competitive with respect to its pricing to prevent a further decline in sales 
cost of revenues gross margin cost of revenues was million  million and million in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
although our overall asps declined during fiscal  we were generally able to offset this effect and increase our gross margin percentage by as compared with fiscal this increase in gross margin is attributable to the continued reduction of manufacturing cycle times  reduced die size  improved labor productivity  more efficient use of capital resources  improved defect densities  improved yields and ultimately lower manufacturing costs 
wafer fabrication utilization increased from as die per wafer increased due to the ramp of our micron cmos and micron cmos manufacturing processes 
in fiscal  our gross margin increased by million or due to the sale of inventory previously reserved during the third quarter of fiscal which is further described below 
our future results could be favorably impacted if we continue to sell fully reserved inventory 
the amount of that reserved inventory on hand at december  was million 
although our overall asps declined significantly during fiscal  we were generally able to offset this effect on our gross margin by implementing cost cutting measures including reducing manufacturing capacity and related headcount 
in addition  we continued to reduce manufacturing cycle times  reduce die size  improve labor productivity  improve efficient use of capital resources  improve defect densities  improve yields and ultimately lower manufacturing costs 
wafer fabrication utilization degraded slightly from as die per wafer increased due to the ramp of our micron cmos and micron cmos manufacturing processes 
in fiscal  our gross margin increased by million or due to the sale of inventory reserved during the third quarter of fiscal the amount of that reserved inventory on hand at december  was million 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we received feedback from our customers that indicated that the downturn in sales would last longer than previously anticipated 
accordingly  we increased inventory reserves during the quarter for inventory that we did not expect to sell 
cost of revenues in the third quarter of fiscal included an unusual charge of million for inventory reserves 
property  plant and equipment with a net book value of million were also written off to cost of revenues as a result of a periodic physical count of property  plant and equipment completed during the third quarter of fiscal given the cyclical and volatile nature of the semiconductor industry in which we operate  significant judgments are made by us in assessing our reserve requirements for inventory  as discussed in this report under critical accounting policies 
as a result  reserve requirements can fluctuate significantly from period to period due to shifts in end customer demand and other factors 
in fiscal and  total inventory reserves declined million and million respectively 
in fiscal  including the million unusual charge  total net charges for inventory reserves were million 
we are continuing our strong emphasis on new product development and improvements in manufacturing technologies and yields  which we expect to reduce manufacturing costs and help offset some of the impact of near term margin declines 
page segment cost of revenues gross margin our gross margin improved to in fiscal compared to in fiscal our gross margin improved to in fiscal compared to in fiscal following is gross margin discussion by our segments business segments our gross margin improvement in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily attributable to the improvement in the non memory segment 
our gross margin improvement in fiscal compared to fiscal was equally attributable to the memory and non memory segments 
market segments our gross margin improvement in fiscal compared to fiscal and in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily attributable to improvements in the computation and consumer segment 
research and development year ended december  december  december  in thousands revenues    research and development    r d as percent of revenues research and development r d expenditures in fiscal decreased from fiscal and fiscal due to closing down of design centers  headcount reductions in existing locations and a reduction in non cash deferred stock compensation 
to keep pace with changing business conditions and with our customers needs  we have scaled back on some of our process and design projects and refocused our attention on fewer projects that are critical to our success 
we believe that our future success will depend on our ability to develop and introduce new products that will compete effectively on the basis of price  performance  and ability to address customer needs 
our process technology research focuses primarily on the continuous migration to smaller geometries 
we are ramping our latest nanometer technology in manufacturing 
we also started initial development activity on the nanometer technology in our eight inch r d facility in san jose  california 
we continued mram magnetic ram process development for memory products and embedded non volatile applications in our fab in mram technology will offer customers an improvement in read write times  endurance and data retention over currently available non volatile memory products flash  eeprom  feram 
initial markets to be served include servers  high end disk drives  and industrial control systems 
we continued our joint development program with honeywell to develop a micron silicon on insulator soi process technology in fab in minnesota 
during fiscal  we recorded million in non cash deferred stock compensation and contingent cash compensation related to prior acquisitions 
these charges were primarily related to the in system design  lara networks  silicon packets and sahasra acquisitions 
during fiscal  we recorded million in non cash deferred stock compensation and contingent cash compensation related to acquisitions 
the decrease in non cash deferred stock compensation and contingent cash compensation in fiscal compared to fiscal was due to employee terminations  non achievement of milestones and accelerated amortization in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
during fiscal  we recorded million in non cash deferred stock compensation and contingent cash compensation related to acquisitions 
the increase in non cash deferred stock compensation and contingent cash compensation in fiscal compared to fiscal is due to the full year effect in of our acquisitions 
we recorded charges of million in the third quarter of fiscal upon reaching an agreement to settle a patent infringement suit for million  of which million pertained to prior periods 
the remainder relates to future product shipments and has been recorded as a prepaid asset that will be expensed over three years 
property  plant and equipment with a net book value of million was written off to r d as a result of a periodic physical count of property  plant and equipment completed during the third quarter of fiscal page selling  general and administrative year ended december  december  december  in thousands revenues    selling  general and administrative    sg a as percent of revenues selling  general and administrative sg a expenses in fiscal decreased from fiscal due to continuing cost cutting measures including the tight control on outside services and discretionary spending 
sg a also benefited compared to the prior year due to the charge incurred as we increased our loss reserve by million for loans outstanding to employees and former employees under the stockholder approved employee stock purchase assistance plan 
see employee stock purchase assistance plan  note in the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
sg a expenses in fiscal decreased from fiscal due primarily to the effects of the reduction in force from the third quarter of fiscal restructuring plan described below and continuing cost cutting measures 
during fiscal  we also realized the cost benefits of transferring certain administrative functions to our shared services center in the philippines 
commission and bonus expenses were lower due to the decline in our sales 
in addition  sg a decreased as a result of significant declines in acquisition related deferred compensation and contingent cash compensation costs 
the decline in such costs was a result of reduced amortization of compensation charges and non achievement of milestones 
these improvements were partially offset as we increased our loss reserve by million in for loans outstanding to employees and former employees under the stockholder approved employee stock purchase assistance plan 
included in sg a are non cash deferred compensation and contingent cash compensation charges related to our acquisitions 
for the fiscal years ended  and  we recorded million  million and million  respectively  for these costs

in process research and development charges and amortization of intangibles in fiscal relate to current and prior acquisitions 
the amortization of intangibles decreased in fiscal versus fiscal due mainly to a million impairment of slm intangibles at the end of the slm impairment charge for fiscal was precipitated by further changes in slm s business plan that was completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal the amortization of intangibles increased in fiscal versus fiscal due to the acquisition of sahasra and the full year effect of the amortization of intangibles from the international microcircuits  lara networks  inc lara  silicon packets  inc 
silicon packets  in system design  inc 
isd and scanlogic corporation scanlogic acquisitions  all companies acquired in the slm impairment charge for fiscal of million was precipitated by a severe economic downturn in the optical market in which slm participates 
as a result  we reviewed slm s long lived assets  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets disposed of sfas no 
 for impairment and recognized in fiscal an impairment loss of million for existing technology impairment  representing the amount by which the carrying value of the acquired existing technology exceeded the estimated future cash flows of slm 
page in fiscal  amortization of goodwill related largely to our acquisitions of lara  isd  scanlogic  hiband  imi  slm and silicon packets 
in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb  statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  we ceased amortizing goodwill at the end of fiscal and have not amortized goodwill for acquisitions subsequent to june  in fiscal  cypress also recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million related to slm in accordance with its annual impairment review under sfas in fiscal  cypress recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million in accordance with sfas no 
as a result of the severe downturn in the optical market discussed above 
the goodwill impairment charge recorded represented the excess of the pro rata share of goodwill over the future estimated cash flows of slm 
the in process research and development charges for fiscal relate to our equity method investment in sunpower 
in process research and development charges during fiscal relate to the acquisitions of imi  hiband  scanlogic  lara  isd and silicon packets  which were completed during fiscal for the fiscal acquisitions  the valuation method used to value in process technology is a form of discounted cash flow method commonly known as the percentage of completion approach 
this approach is a widely recognized appraisal method and is commonly used to value technology assets 
the value of the in process technology is the sum of the discounted expected future cash flows attributable to the in process technology  taking into consideration the percentage of completion of products utilizing this technology  utilization of pre existing technology  the risks related to the characteristics and applications of the technology  existing and future markets and the technological risk associated with completing the development of the technology 
the cash flows derived from the in process technology projects were discounted at rates ranging from to 
cypress believes these rates were appropriate given the risks associated with the technologies for which commercial feasibility had not been established 
the percentage of completion for each in process project was determined by identifying the elapsed time invested in the project as a ratio of the total time required to bring the project to technical and commercial feasibility 
the percentage of completion for in process projects acquired ranged from for sunpower  for sahasra  to for imi  to for hiband  to for scanlogic  to for lara  to for isd and to for silicon packets 
schedules were based on management s estimate of tasks completed and the tasks to be completed to bring the project to technical and commercial feasibility 
in process r d relating to the sunpower  imi  scanlogic  and isd acquisitions resulted in the completed development of products 
in process r d projects relating to the hiband and silicon packets acquisitions were terminated before completion 
other credits recorded during fiscal relates to the reversal of accruals that were originally established in connection with potential penalties we could incur as a result of our decision not to construct a second fabrication facility in our texas location 
during fiscal  we recorded other charges of million for obsolete design software that is no longer being used 
restructuring the semiconductor industry has historically been characterized by wide fluctuations in demand for  and supply of  semiconductors 
in some cases  industry downturns have lasted more than a year 
prior experience has shown that restructuring of operations  resulting in significant restructuring charges  may become necessary if an industry downturn persists 
during the three years ended december   we had two restructuring events that were in various stages of completion 
the first was initiated in the third quarter of fiscal fiscal restructuring plan  and the second was initiated in the fourth quarter of fiscal fiscal restructuring plan 
at the end of december   both restructuring events had been substantially completed with reserves remaining only for leases and employee benefits 
the reserves will decrease over time as we make lease payments and payments for employee benefits  which will be paid through the second quarter of fiscal the cumulative charge to operations for the fiscal restructuring plan and the fiscal restructuring plan was million and million  respectively

the closing price of nve common stock at december  was per share 
other income and expense  net of million for fiscal primarily reflects write downs of million of investments in development stage companies and other investments  and the amortization of deferred financing costs of million 
these were partially offset by gains of million recognized on the repurchase of our notes 
in fiscal  other income and expense  primarily reflects a million write down of long term investments and million related to the amortization of deferred financing costs 
these costs were somewhat offset by gains on the repurchase of convertible notes of million 
the gain on the repurchase of our convertible subordinated notes was previously classified as extraordinary  but has been reclassified to other income and expense  net in accordance with sfas no

page taxes a tax expense of million was recognized in fiscal compared to tax expense of million in fiscal and tax benefit of million in fiscal the expense in fiscal and was largely attributable to foreign income taxes in certain jurisdictions 
no tax benefit was recognized in fiscal and for the future tax benefit of operating losses  as management believes it is more likely than not that the benefit will not be realized 
the fiscal tax benefit was attributable primarily to current year net operating losses  however  the tax benefit of these losses was limited to the amount of prior taxes that could be recovered 
our effective tax rate varies from the us statutory rate primarily due to our assessment of the utilization of loss carryovers and earnings of foreign subsidiaries taxed at different rates 
the net deferred tax assets of million at december  were fully reserved due to uncertainty of realization in accordance with the accounting procedures as established by sfas no

liquidity and capital resources year ended december  december  december  in thousands cash  cash equivalents and short term investments    restricted cash    long term investments    working capital    long term debt excluding current portion    includes a liquid investment in a limited liability partnership see note to the consolidated financial statements for details 
during fiscal  our total cash  cash equivalents and investments including restricted cash  increased by million 
the increase was primarily due to an operating cashflow of million  with the remaining increase mainly provided by our long term debt refinancing 
long term debt increased million in fiscal compared to fiscal as a result of our restructuring of our debt obligations  as described below under key components of cash flow and liquidity 
key components of cash flow year ended december  december  december  net cash flow generated from operating activities    net cash flow used for investing activities    net cash flow generated from used for financing activities    net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents    during fiscal  cash generated from operations was million  which included an increase in working capital of million 
inventory reductions due to increased sales were more than offset by a significant increase in accounts receivable and a significant decrease in accounts payable 
the sale of investments  net of purchases  used cash of million in fiscal  as we made additional investments due to our improved cash position 
the acquisition of property  plant  and equipment used an additional million in cash 
these reductions in cash were partially offset by an increase from sale of investments in other companies of million and the collection of employee stock purchase assistance plan loans from employees of million 
during fiscal  we completed a convertible subordinated debt financing of million in aggregate principal amount 
of the proceeds received  we used million to retire all of our notes and million of our notes  million to repurchase million shares of our common stock  million for debt issuance costs and million to purchase a call spread option on our common stock to mitigate the potential dilution of the convertible debt 
during fiscal  cash generated from operations was million  which included an increase in working capital of million 
with continued weak sales  manufacturing capacity was reduced to avoid additional inventory builds 
accounts payable page declined as we significantly slowed purchases of capital equipment in the latter part of fiscal these changes were partially offset by a decline in net accounts receivable commensurate with the change in revenues 
net of purchases  the sale of investments generated million in cash in fiscal  as we liquidated investments to fund capital expenditures and business acquisitions 
this was offset by the acquisition of million in property  plant and equipment and million in investments in other companies 
in fiscal  the issuance of common shares net of repurchases generated million while the purchase by us of our convertible subordinated notes consumed million 
during fiscal  cash provided by operating activities of million was primarily attributed to changes in operating assets and liabilities of million and net loss adjusted for non cash items 
net cash flows used in investing activities of million for fiscal related primarily to the use of million in cash for acquisitions  net of cash acquired  million for the purchases of property  plant and equipment and million for loans made by cypress to employees under the employee stock purchase assistance plan 
purchases of investments totaled million during fiscal  while investments  which were sold or matured  totaled million 
net cash flows used for financing activities were million during fiscal repurchases of common stock were million  redemption of convertible debt was million and purchases of private placement equity options  net were million 
these cash outflows were offset by cash inflows of million related to the premiums received from the writing of stock put options and million related to the issuance of common shares from the exercise of options or purchases through the espp 
liquidity based on our current plan  we expect to generate positive cash flow from operations in the fiscal year ending january  our expected significant investment and financing cash outlays for the fiscal year ending january  include capital expenditures of approximately million for investment in our product development and infrastructure initiatives 
our board of directors has approved programs authorizing the repurchase of our common stock or convertible subordinated notes the subordinated notes in the open market at anytime 
however  the timing and actual number of shares or principal amount to be repurchased is limited to million  is at the discretion of management and is contingent on numerous factors including cash flows 
we have million of aggregate principal amount in convertible subordinated notes that are due in july and june in the amount of million and million  respectively 
in connection with the million of notes  we may at any time prior to maturity  elect to terminate the holders conversion rights if the closing price of cypress s common stock exceeds subject to certain adjustments for days out of a consecutive trading day period 
if we issue a notice of termination of conversion rights prior to june   we will pay additional interest in an amount equal to three years of interest  less any interest actually paid prior to the conversion date  to holders who convert their notes 
had we been allowed to terminate the conversion rights at december  and all holders converted their notes  we would have been required to pay million in additional interest plus either million of cash or million in value of cypress equivalent shares to satisfy the cash payable upon conversion 
our current intention  should we terminate the conversion rights  would be to satisfy the obligation in cash and not shares of our common stock 
the notes are subject to compliance with certain covenants that do not contain financial ratios 
as of december   cypress was in compliance with these covenants 
if we failed to be in compliance with these covenants beyond any applicable grace period  the trustee of the subordinated notes  or the holders of a specific percentage thereof  would have the ability to demand immediate payment of all amounts outstanding 
as more fully discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this report  we have entered into several synthetic operating lease agreements for manufacturing and office facilities 
each of these leases requires us to purchase the property or to arrange for the property to be acquired by a third party at lease expiration 
if cypress had exercised its right to purchase all the properties subject to these leases at december   it would have been required to make a payment and record assets totaling million 
we are required to maintain restricted cash or investments to serve as collateral for these leases 
as of december   the amount of restricted cash recorded was million  which was classified as a non current asset on the consolidated balance sheet 
in september  we entered into a million  twenty four month revolving line of credit with silicon valley bank 
as of the end of december   there was no amount outstanding under the line of credit 
loans made under the line of credit bear interest based upon the wall street journal prime rate or libor plus basis points at our election 
the line of credit agreement includes a variety of covenants including restrictions on the incurrence of indebtedness  incurrence of loans  the payment of dividends or distributions on our capital stock  and transfers of assets and financial covenants with respect to tangible net worth and a quick page ratio 
our obligations under the line of credit are guaranteed and secured by the stock of certain of its subsidiaries 
we intend to use the line of credit on an as needed basis to fund working capital and capital expenditures including future obligations under the sunpower agreements currently being negotiated 
on may  we entered into a preferred stock purchase agreement with sunpower and certain other investors named therein  pursuant to which the investors and we agreed to acquire sunpower s series one preferred stock 
in connection with the transactions contemplated by the preferred stock purchase agreement  we entered into a note purchase and line of credit agreement with sunpower and as consideration therefore  cypress received a warrant to purchase up to  shares of sunpower s series two preferred stock at an exercise price of per share  for cash 
in accordance with the note purchase and line of credit agreement  as we did not exercise the warrant by april   we became obligated to fund sunpower up to million through may at a rate of up to million per month 
as of december   we had loaned sunpower million bearing interest at the applicable federal rate in accordance with this obligation 
we allowed the warrant to expire unexercised on january  we are currently in negotiations with sunpower for future funding of their operations 
we currently expect the outcome of these negotiations to result in cash outlays of approximately million by us to sunpower in fiscal at december   we and our ceo own approximately and of sunpower respectively 
the remaining of sunpower is owned by minority shareholders 
in june  cypress borrowed million yen at from sumitomo bank japan 
the outstanding principal  including accrued interest  amounting to approximately million was repaid on june  our acquisition agreements obligate us to pay certain contingent cash compensation based on continued employment and meeting certain revenue or project milestones 
as of december   total cash contingent compensation that could be paid under our acquisition agreements assuming all contingencies are met is million 
contractual obligations below is a summary of fixed payments related to certain contractual obligations 
payment timing may be subject to change 
contractual obligations payments due by period total less than year years years more than years long term debt convertible subordinated notes notes principal   notes interest     notes principal   notes interest    other principal     other interest  note to minority shareholder principal   note to minority shareholder interest operating leases synthetic leases     other      purchase obligations     customer advances   total      purchase obligations are principally for manufacturing equipment  facilities and bulk gas and chemicals 
the customer advance is related to a financing and supply agreement into which cypress entered with a specific customer in october off balance sheet arrangements on june   cypress entered into a synthetic operating lease agreement for manufacturing and office facilities located in minnesota and california 
see note of the notes to financial statements for a description of this lease arrangement 
the synthetic lease enables us to lease rather than acquire the facilities 
this results in improved cash flow through lower lease payments compared to expending much more cash in a direct acquisition of the properties 
page as of december   cypress had outstanding a series of equity options on cypress common stock with an initial cost of million  which is classified in stockholders equity in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet 
see note of the notes to financial statements for a description of this equity options arrangement 
we entered into the equity options as part of our stock repurchase program 
depending upon our common stock price at the maturity date of the equity options  we either take delivery of our common stock resulting in a reduction to our outstanding common stock or receive cash resulting in a return on the cash expended 
in conjunction with the convertible subordinated notes offering in june  cypress purchased a call spread option the option on million cypress common shares expiring in july for million 
see note of the notes to financial statements for a description of the option 
the option is designed to mitigate stock dilution from conversion of the notes 
the option has value if the average market price per share of cypress s common stock upon exercise or expiration of the option is greater than per share 
the option may be settled at cypress s election in either net shares or in cash 
settlement of the option in net shares on the expiration date would result in cypress receiving a number of shares  not to exceed million shares  of our common stock with a value equal to the amount otherwise receivable on cash settlement 
the cash receivable on settlement is determined by two factors the average value of cypress s trading price per share over a twenty day trading period beginning july  and ending july  and whether such average value is within  above or below the range of the lower and upper strikes 
if within  then the cash settlement is determined by subtracting the lower strike from the average value determined above multiplied by million 
if above the range  then the cash settlement is limited to the range multiplied by million or million 
if below the lower strike then there would be no cash settlement as the call spread would be worthless 
should there be an early unwind of the option the amount of cash or net shares potentially received by cypress will be dependent upon then existing overall market conditions  on cypress stock price  the volatility of cypress stock and the amount of time remaining on the option 
as at december   the amount of cash cypress would receive should it have chosen to unwind the option was million 
capital resources and financial condition our long term strategy is to maintain a minimum amount of cash and cash equivalents for operational purposes and to invest the remaining amount of our cash in interest bearing and highly liquid cash equivalents and marketable debt securities 
accordingly  in addition to the million in cash and cash equivalents that we had at the end of fiscal for short term requirements  we had at fiscal year end approximately million in marketable debt and equity securities that are available for future operating  financing and investing activities  for a total liquid cash and investment position of million 
cypress has an additional million of restricted cash as more fully discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this report for a total cash  investment and restricted cash position of million 
as of december   cypress had outstanding million in principal amount of its notes and million in notes 
we also maintain the ability to issue an aggregate of approximately million in debt  equity and other securities under a us securities and exchange commision shelf registration statement we filed in fiscal we believe that liquidity provided by existing cash  cash equivalents  investments  and our borrowing arrangements described above and cash generated from operations  will provide sufficient capital to meet our requirements for at least the next twelve months 
however  should prevailing economic conditions and or financial  business and other factors beyond our control adversely affect our estimates of our future cash requirements including our debt obligations  we would be required to fund our cash requirements by alternative financing 
there can be no assurance that additional financing  if needed  would be available on terms acceptable to us or at all 
we may choose at any time to raise additional capital to strengthen our financial position  facilitate growth  and provide us with additional flexibility to take advantage of business opportunities that arise 
subsequent events on january   cypress acquired all of the outstanding common and preferred stock of cascade semiconductor corporation cascade  a company specializing in one transistor t pseudo sram products for wireless applications  including cell phones 
cypress acquired cascade for total consideration of million in cash and stock to be paid over three years  of which approximately half is expected to be future compensation charges as some of the amounts are tied to future employment page critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and the results of our operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements included in this report and the data used to prepare them 
our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and we are required to make estimates  judgments and assumptions in the course of such preparation 
note to the consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
on an ongoing basis  we re evaluate our judgments and estimates including those related to revenue recognition  product returns  allowances for doubtful accounts receivable and employee loans  inventories  valuation of long lived assets including intangibles  investment impairments  restructuring charges  goodwill impairments  income taxes  litigation and contingencies 
we base our estimates and judgments on our historical experience  knowledge of current conditions and our beliefs of what could occur in the future considering available information 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following are our critical accounting policies that are affected by significant estimates  assumptions and judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we generate revenue by selling our products to original equipment manufacturers and distributors 
our policy is to recognize revenue from sales to customers when title and the rights and risks of ownership have passed to the customer  when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been delivered  the price is fixed and determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
we allow certain global distributors  primarily based in the united states  rights of return and other credits for price protection 
given the uncertainties associated with the levels of returns and other credits issuable to these distributors  we defer recognition of revenue from sales to these distributors until they have resold our products 
our method of deferral is based on certain assumptions  including average gross margins 
reserves are provided for estimated returns relating to rights of return and other credits for price protection 
if actual results differ from our estimates  future operating results could be adversely affected 
sales to certain other primarily non us based distributors carry either no or very limited rights of return 
we have historically been able to estimate returns and other credits from these distributors and accordingly have historically recognized revenue from sales to these distributors on shipment  with a related allowance for potential returns established at the time of our sale 
we must make estimates of potential future product returns and revenue adjustments related to current period product revenue 
management analyzes historical returns  current economic trends in the semiconductor industry  changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products when evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for sales returns 
if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates  material differences in the amount of our reported revenue may result 
we provide for these situations based on our experience with specific customers and our expectations for revenue adjustments based on economic conditions within the semiconductor industry 
at december   december  and december  our reserves for sales returns were million  million and million  respectively 
allowance for doubtful accounts and employee loans we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for losses that we estimate will arise from our customers inability to make required payments 
we make our estimates of the collectibility of our accounts receivable by analyzing historical bad debts  specific customer creditworthiness and current economic trends 
at december   the allowance for doubtful accounts was million  at december   the allowance for doubtful accounts was million and at december  it was million 
as of december   cypress has outstanding loans  consisting of principal and cumulative accrued interest  of million to employees and former employees under the shareholder approved employee stock purchase assistance plan 
each loan is evidenced by a full recourse promissory note executed by the employee in favor of cypress and is secured by a pledge of the shares of cypress s common stock purchased with the proceeds of the loan 
as of december   cypress has a loss reserve against these accounts of million 
in determining the reserve  management considered various factors  including an independent fair value analysis of these employee and former employee loans and the underlying collateral 
at december   the carrying value of the loan exceeded the underlying common stock collateral by million 
if the underlying assumptions supporting our reserve requirements change  including the value of our stock price  future operating results could be adversely affected 
page accounting for income taxes our global operations involve manufacturing  r d and selling activities 
profit from non us activities are subject to local country taxes but are not subject to us tax until repatriated back to the us it is our intention to permanently reinvest these earnings outside the us we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we consider historical levels of income  expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
in the future  should we determine that we would be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  we would record an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
this adjustment would increase income in the period such determination was made 
the calculation of tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex global tax regulations 
we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes will be due 
if payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary  the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary 
if the estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment  a further charge to expense would result 
valuation of inventory we write down our inventory for lower of cost or market reserves  aged inventory reserves and obsolescence reserves 
inventory reserves are generally recorded when the inventory for a device exceeds nine months of demand for that device and or when individual parts have been in inventory for greater than six months 
our inventories represent high technology parts that may be subject to rapid technological obsolescence and which are sold in a highly competitive industry 
if actual product demand or selling prices are less favorable than we estimate  we may be required to take additional inventory write downs 
conversely  if demand comes back for devices that have been fully reserved  our future margins may be higher 
valuation of long lived assets our business requires heavy investment in manufacturing facilities that are technologically advanced but can quickly become significantly under utilized or rendered obsolete by rapid changes in demand for semiconductors produced in those facilities 
in addition  we have recorded intangible assets related to our acquisitions 
we evaluate our long lived assets and intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 
we review our other long lived assets  including property and equipment and other identifiable finite intangible assets  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable 
factors considered important that could result in an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of acquired assets or the strategy for its business  significant negative industry or economic trends  and a significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period of time 
impairments are recognized based on the difference between the fair value of the asset and its carrying value  and fair value is generally measured based on discounted cash flow analyses 
we recorded no impairment charges on indefinite useful lived intangibles in the fourth quarter of fiscal but did record an impairment charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal of million related to slm 
if there is a significant decrease in our business in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges in the future 
goodwill impairments we perform goodwill impairment tests on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain circumstances for each reporting unit 
see note in the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is highly subjective and requires significant judgment at many points during the analysis 
in estimating the fair value of the businesses with recognized goodwill for the purposes of our fiscal consolidated financial statements  we made estimates and judgments about the future cash flows of these businesses 
our cash flow forecasts were based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses 
in addition  we made certain judgments about allocating shared assets such as accounts receivable and inventory to the page estimated balance sheet for those businesses 
we also considered our market capitalization on the dates of our impairment tests under sfas  in determining the fair value of the respective businesses 
in connection with the adoption of sfas  effective the beginning of fiscal  we completed the required transitional analysis in the first quarter of fiscal with no impairment charge required 
in addition  as required by sfas  we performed our annual goodwill impairment test 
we performed this test in the fourth quarter of fiscal and determined that no goodwill impairment was required 
however  changes in these estimates  including projected cash flows of our market capitalization  could cause one or more of the businesses to be valued differently  which could result in a future impairment of our remaining goodwill 
investments in privately held companies at december   the carrying value of our portfolio of strategic investments in non marketable equity securities privately held companies totaled million 
our ability to recover our investments in private  non marketable equity securities and to earn a return on these investments is primarily dependent on how successfully these companies are able to execute to their business plans and how well their products are accepted  as well as their ability to obtain venture capital funding to continue operations and to grow 
in the current equity market environment  their ability to obtain additional funding as well as to take advantage of liquidity events  such as initial public offerings  mergers and private sales  is significantly constrained 
under our accounting policy  the carrying value of a non marketable investment is the amount paid for the investment unless it has been determined to be other than temporarily impaired  in which case we write the investment down to its impaired value 
we review all of our investments periodically for impairment  however  for non marketable equity securities  the impairment analysis requires significant judgment 
this analysis includes assessment of each investee s financial condition  the business outlook for its products and technology  its projected results and cash flows  the likelihood of obtaining subsequent rounds of financing and the impact of any relevant contractual equity preferences held by us or others 
if an investee obtains additional funding at a valuation lower than our carrying amount  we presume that the investment is other than temporarily impaired  unless specific facts and circumstances indicate otherwise  for example  when we hold contractual rights that give us a preference over the rights of other investors 
as the equity markets have declined significantly over the past few years  we have experienced substantial impairments in our portfolio of non marketable equity securities 
if equity market conditions do not improve  as companies within our portfolio attempt to raise additional funds  the funds may not be available to them  or they may receive lower valuations  with more onerous investment terms than in previous financings  and the investments will likely become impaired 
however  we are not able to determine at the present time which specific investments are likely to be impaired in the future  or the extent or timing of individual impairments 
we recorded impairments of non marketable equity investments of million in fiscal and million in fiscal restructuring costs we currently have two active restructuring plans one initiated in the third quarter of fiscal and the other initiated in the fourth quarter of fiscal after it became clear that actions taken in the previous year would not be sufficient to return the company to profitability 
both plans were designed to reduce costs and expenses in order to return the company to profitability 
the current accounting for restructuring costs requires us to record provisions and charges when we have a formal and committed plan 
in connection with these plans  we have recorded estimated expenses for severance and outplacement costs  lease cancellations  asset write offs and other restructuring costs 
given the significance of  and the timing of the execution of such activities  this process is complex and involves periodic reassessments of estimates made at the time the original decisions were made 
we continually evaluate the adequacy of the remaining liabilities under our restructuring initiatives 
although we believe that these estimates accurately reflect the costs of our restructuring plans  actual results may differ  thereby requiring us to record additional provisions or reverse a portion of such provisions 
recent accounting pronouncements financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin  was issued in january fin requires that if an entity is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity  the assets  liabilities and results of operations of the variable interest entity should be included in the consolidated financial statements of the entity 
the provisions of fin are effective immediately for all arrangements entered into after january  cypress has not invested in any variable interest entities after january  for those arrangements entered into prior to january   the fasb recently delayed the required implementation date such that the provisions of fin are required to be adopted no later than the end of the first reporting period that ends after march  on june   cypress entered into a new operating lease to refinance its then existing operating leases with respect to certain manufacturing and office facilities located in minnesota and california see note 
cypress refinanced these leases in a manner that best met its financing strategy 
the new operating lease is page not subject to the consolidation provisions of fin cypress does not expect the finalization of fin by the fasb relating to variable interest entities created prior to january  to impact the consolidated financial statements as the issues currently under discussion do not impact cypress 
on december   the staff of the securities and exchange commission sec or the staff issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition  which supercedes sab  revenue recognition in financial statements 
sab s primary purpose is to rescind accounting guidance contained in sab related to multiple element revenue arrangements  superceded as a result of the issuance of eitf  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf 
additionally  sab rescinds the sec s revenue recognition in financial statements frequently asked questions and answers the faq issued with sab that had been codified in sec topic  revenue recognition 
selected portions of the faq have been incorporated into sab while the wording of sab has changed to reflect the issuance of eitf  the revenue recognition principles of sab remain largely unchanged by the issuance of sab eitf was effective for revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june  there was no impact to the consolidated financial statements related to sab for fiscal item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest and foreign currency exchange rates cypress is exposed to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
to mitigate these risks  cypress utilizes derivative financial instruments 
cypress does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
the fair value of cypress s investment portfolio would not be significantly impacted by either a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates due mainly to the short term nature of the major portion of cypress s investment portfolio 
an increase in interest rates would not significantly increase interest expense due to the fixed nature of cypress s debt obligations 
a majority of cypress s revenue and capital spending is transacted in us dollars 
however  cypress does enter into these transactions in other currencies  primarily japanese yen and euro 
to protect against reductions in value and the volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in foreign exchange rates  cypress has established revenue and balance sheet hedging programs 
cypress s hedging programs reduce  but do not always eliminate  the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements 
cypress had no euro exposure as of december  all of the potential changes noted above are based on sensitivity analyses performed on cypress s balances as of december  equity options at december   cypress had outstanding a series of equity options on cypress common stock with an initial cost of million  which is classified in stockholders equity 
the contracts require physical settlement and were extended in january to february upon expiration of the options  if cypress s stock price is above the threshold price of per share  cypress will receive a settlement value totaling million 
if cypress s stock price is below the threshold price of per share  cypress will receive million shares of its common stock 
alternatively  the contract may be renewed and extended 
during fiscal  the contracts resulted in net cash inflows of million 
in conjunction with the notes offering in june  cypress purchased a call spread option on cypress s common stock the option maturing on july  for million 
the option  including fees and costs  has been accounted for as an equity transaction in accordance with emerging issues task force no 
 accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to  and potentially settled in  a company s own stock 
the option covers million shares of cypress common stock 
the option is designed to mitigate dilution from conversion of the notes in the event that the market price per share of cypress s common stock upon exercise of the option is greater than per share and is less than or equal to per share 
the option may be settled at cypress s election in either net shares or in cash 
settlement of the option in net shares on the expiration date would result in cypress receiving a number of shares  not to exceed million shares  of its common stock with a value equal to the amount otherwise receivable on cash settlement 
the amount receivable on cash settlement will be determined based upon a twenty day averaging period beginning on july  should there be an early unwind of the option  the amount of cash or net shares potentially received by cypress will be dependent upon then existing overall market conditions  on the cypress s stock price  the volatility of cypress s stock and the amount of time remaining on the option 
page investments in privately held companies cypress has also invested in several privately held companies  all of which can be considered in the startup or development stages 
these investments are inherently risky as the market for the technologies or products they have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize 
as of december   cypress had invested million in development stage companies 
the carrying value of these investments at december   was million 
as our equity investments generally do not permit us to exert significant influence or control over the entity in which we are investing  these amounts generally represent our cost of the investment  less any adjustments we make when we determine that an investment s net realizable value is less than its carrying cost 
the process of assessing whether a particular equity investment s net realizable value is less than its carrying cost requires a significant amount of judgment 
in making this judgment  we carefully consider the investee s cash position  projected cash flows both short and long term  financing needs  most recent valuation data  the current investing environment  management ownership changes  and competition 
this evaluation process is based on information that we request from these privately held companies 
this information is not subject to the same disclosure and audit requirements as the reports required of us public companies  and as such  the reliability and accuracy of the data may vary 
based on our evaluation  we recorded impairment charges related to our investments in privately held companies of million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal estimating the net realizable value of investments in privately held early stage technology companies is inherently subjective and may contribute to volatility in our reported results of operations and we may in the future incur additional impairments to our equity investments in privately held companies 
stock purchase assistance plan included in other current assets at the end of fiscal  is million of principal and cumulative accrued interest  relating to employees and former employees under the shareholder approved employee stock purchase assistance plan 
as of december   the outstanding principal and cumulative accrued interest totaled million 
cypress made the loans to employees for the purpose of purchasing cypress common stock 
each loan is evidenced by a full recourse promissory note executed by the employee in favor of cypress and is secured by a pledge of the shares of cypress s common stock purchased with the proceeds of the loan 
the primary benefit to cypress from this program is increased employee retention 
in accordance with the plan  the ceo and the board of directors do not participate in this program 
to date  there have been immaterial write offs 
as of december   cypress has a loss reserve against these loans of million 
in determining the reserve  management considered various factors  including an independent fair value analysis of these employee and former employee loans and the underlying collateral 
at december   the carrying value of the loan exceeded the underlying common stock collateral by million 
in october  we announced a program aimed at minimizing any losses to employees as a result of our common stock price fluctuations 
under this program  either a limit sale order or a stop loss order is placed on the common stock purchased by each employee with the loan proceeds once the common stock price exceeds that employee s break even point 
if the common stock price reaches the sale limit order or declines to the stop loss price  the common stock purchased by the employee under the plan will be automatically sold and the proceeds utilized to repay the employee s outstanding loan to us
