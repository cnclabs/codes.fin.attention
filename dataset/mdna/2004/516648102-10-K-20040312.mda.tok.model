as a result  a charge of  for the impairment of the asset was recorded and is reflected on the consolidated statement of operations 
we also had a loss on the disposal of obsolete machinery and equipment in the amount of  in and  in in addition  the net book value of certain fixed assets was reduced by  discontinued operations during  the company evaluated all circumstances and that a period of five years had passed since any material communication relating to commitments and contingencies of our discontinued operations

we currently do not have the liquidity or capital resources to fund our operations without raising capital either from borrowing or from the sale of additional shares of stock 
further financing through short term loans and or the private sale of our common and preferred stock to accredited sophisticated investors is anticipated 
if adequate funds are not available when needed  our business  operations  financial condition and future prospects will be materially adversely affected 
we estimate that approximately million will be required for us to continue our operations in although no formal commitment has been received from the chairman of the board to fund the company s operating requirements for the year  we have received for the period beginning as of january  through march   loans amounting to  from the chairman of the board  which are bearing interest at per annum 
in addition  the company is seeking to raise cash proceeds of at least  privately  on a best efforts basis  pursuant to a private placement offering  however  there can be no assurance as to the availability or terms upon which such financing and capital might be available 
the company s ability to continue as a going concern will be dependent on management s ability to successfully execute its business plan including an increase in revenue  decrease in operating costs and expenses  and seeking additional forms of debt and or equi ty financing
