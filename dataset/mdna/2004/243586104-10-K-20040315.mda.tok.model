item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations as of december  and for the three years then ended should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto set forth elsewhere in this report 
this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements  including our expectations of future industry conditions  strategic plans and forecasts of operational results 
various risks may cause our actual results to differ materially 
a list and description of some of the risks and uncertainties is contained below and in the summary of risk factors included in item overview we are a population genetics company developing drugs and dna based diagnostics based upon our discoveries in the inherited causes of common diseases 
our population approach and resources have enabled us to identify genes and targets directly involved in the development of many of the most common diseases 
we are focused on turning these findings into a growing pipeline of products and services which we believe will be able to combat the causes of disease  not just the signs and symptoms 
our approach to research and development brings together three key types of non personally identifiable data derived from our population research in iceland genotypic and disease data from more than  volunteer participants in some disease gene research programs and information that can be analyzed in tandem with genealogical data linking together the entire present day population of iceland and going back to the settlement of the country in the ninth century 
our primary focus is on the discovery and commercialization of novel therapeutics based on genetic information identified in our population based gene discovery work 
through the acquisition in march of medichem life sciences and its subsidiary  emerald biostructures  now our pharmaceuticals and biostructures groups  we have integrated capabilities for applying genetic findings to the development of drugs  both through our own programs and in alliance with corporate partners 
we are also applying the links we have identified between genetic factors and disease to create dna based tests which can also be used to identify patients with increased risk of developing a disease or to predict which patients will respond well to a given drug therapy 
we believe that such tests will become a standard part of healthcare within the coming decade  making it possible to gauge individual predisposition to a particular illness and to design effective preventive strategies  to complement traditional clinical diagnoses  and to identify patients who are likely to respond or not respond to particular drugs 
we are also marketing software systems we have developed  making correlations between genetic variation and disease and drug response 
we currently derive revenues primarily from research funding and other service fees from our collaborative partners  milestone payments  and upfront  exclusivity  technology access and technology development fees under our collaboration agreements comprise most of the rest of our revenues 
our expenses consist primarily of research and development expenses 
while we are entitled to royalties or profit sharing under the terms of our agreements  due to the extended time period for the development and commercialization of a saleable product or therapy  we have not yet received royalties or profit sharing under any of our contracts and expect that we will not do so for several years  if at all 
in addition to conducting work on our targets in our collaborative and internal programs  our pharmaceuticals group provides drug discovery work for our fee for service customers 
our other service offerings include protein crystallization products and protein structure analysis contract services through our seattle based biostructures group  pharmacogenomics and clinical trials services through our wholly owned subsidiary encode  and dna analysis services through our genotyping laboratory in reykjavik 
as we continue our discovery in common diseases  we aim to conserve ample resources to bring our products forward to the market  and we are constantly evaluating the optimal balance between several factors crucial to our strategy 
these include the level of our investment in research and development  the preservation of cash resources and their deployment for product development  and the financing environment 
our goal is to bring products to the market and  in that  make the company profitable 
we believe the best means in achieving that objective is to operate the company on a sustainable basis such that it will have the staying power to turn our discoveries into products in the marketplace 
as a means to this end  in late and in the face of an uncertain environment in the capital markets  we undertook measures aimed at improving our operational efficiency and at lowering our operating costs 
as a benchmark  we set ourselves the goal of running our base research and development activities on a cash neutral basis 
however  this objective was not an end unto itself but rather a means to ensure that we continued to have on hand the resources to advance our key drug and diagnostic programs 
we have incurred losses since our inception  principally as a result of research and development and general and administrative expenses in support of our operations 
as of december  we had an accumulated deficit of million 
while we achieved positive cash flow from operations for the third quarter of  we believe that the initiation of substantial new activities such as the conduct of clinical trials on decode owned compounds will require significant additional expenditures 
for example  in our target discovery work on our findings in myocardial infarction  we have in licensed a compound which acts upon our principal target and for which we are preparing to enter directly into a phase ii clinical trial 
we expect to seek similar in licensing opportunities for other compounds in other diseases and any success may increase our cash requirements 
we anticipate incurring additional net losses at least through the next several years  due to  among the above mentioned factors  depreciation and amortization  as well as stock based compensation and other non cash charges 
we expect that our revenues and losses will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and that such fluctuations may be substantial  especially because progress in our scientific work and milestone payments that are related to progress can fluctuate between quarters 
we do not believe that comparisons of our quarter to quarter performance are a good indication of future performance 
we are highly susceptible to conditions in the global financial markets and in the pharmaceutical industry 
positive and negative movement in those markets will continue to pose challenges and opportunities to us 
previous downturns in the market valuations of biotechnology companies and of the equity markets more generally have restricted our ability to raise additional capital on favorable terms 
to the extent that equity markets are risk averse  our ability to raise capital will be adversely affected 
however  we believe that we have sufficient cash resources to continue to fund our current research and operations for several years  and we are also investigating the possibility of alternative avenues of financing for our product development programs 
the pharmaceutical industry  which is the principal customer base for our gene discovery and contract chemistry businesses  is experiencing difficulties in maintaining historical rates of growth 
this presents near term challenges and significant longer term opportunities 
one of the main challenges facing the pharmaceutical industry is developing pipelines of effective new drugs to treat major indications 
as many leading brand name drugs come off patent and face generic competition  developing successful new medicines will become critical for filling the gap 
in the short term  the financial pressures on pharmaceutical companies may be reflected in their research and development spending  making it more difficult for us to sign corporate alliances with significant upfront funding  or lengthening the time required to negotiate such deals 
we believe that in the medium to longer term  however  companies such as ours may be well positioned to play an important role in filling the gap in the pipeline of new drugs  either on their own or as partners of pharmaceutical companies 
our gene discovery programs are aimed at identifying novel drug targets that are involved in the basic biology of common diseases and we are focused on discovering new drugs against these targets  both on our own and with major pharmaceutical partners 
our partnerships with roche and merck demonstrate that the industry is already investing in the development of new therapeutics based on our approach 
our recent in licensing of a developmental compound from bayer demonstrates that the industry may be prepared to provide companies such as ours with rights to shelved compounds that may be brought forward in clinical development in indications other than those for which the compounds were originally designed 
collaborations and alliances collaborations and further growth in our medicinal chemistry  pharmacogenomics and informatics services will remain an important element of our business strategy and future revenues 
our ability to generate revenue growth and become profitable is dependent  in part  on our ability to enter into additional collaborative arrangements  and on our ability and our collaborative partners ability to successfully commercialize products incorporating  or based on  our work 
it is also dependent on our ability to maintain and grow our service lines of business 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain or expand our existing collaborations  enter into future collaborations to develop applications based on existing or future research agreements  sign additional subscribers to our database services  or successfully expand our medicinal chemistry or pharamacogenomics businesses 
our failure to successfully develop and market products over the next several years  or to realize product revenues  would have a material  or materially adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we do not expect to receive royalties or other revenues from commercial sales of products developed using our technologies in the near term 
it may be several years before product revenues materialize  if they do at all 
acquisitions as part of our business strategy  we continue to consider joint development programs and merger and acquisition opportunities that may provide us with products in late stage development  intellectual property or financial resources  or with capabilities that will help accelerate our downstream drug discovery efforts 
on march   we acquired medichem life sciences  inc in a stock for stock exchange accounted for as a purchase transaction 
the acquisition of medichem is a central element in our strategy to transform decode from a company focused on gene discovery into a biopharmaceutical company capable of creating and capturing the greatest possible value from its discovery capabilities 
the acquisition has benefited us in three ways enabling us to advance our in house programs in drug discovery  enabling us to negotiate much more favorable terms in our alliances with pharmaceutical companies  in which we take our discoveries much further down the drug development process and receive a more significant share of revenues from sales of products that are developed  and providing us with a service business generating revenue in the short term and maintaining the infrastructure for conducting drug discovery work on several programs at once 
the total consideration for the acquisition was approximately million  which consists of decode common stock issued in exchange for outstanding medichem common stock million  medichem employee stock options assumed million and decode transaction costs million 
we have recorded the transaction as a purchase for accounting purposes and have allocated the purchase price  based upon independent valuations  to the assets purchased and liabilities assumed based upon their respective estimated fair values 
identifiable intangible assets include developed technology  patents  customer and other contracts and agreements that have estimated useful lives ranging from three to ten years 
in the first quarter we recorded a charge to earnings for acquired in process research and development amounting million 
in addition  amortization charges for other identifiable intangibles recorded in the medichem acquisition will amount to approximately million annually 
under statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
 resulting goodwill million will not be amortized but is subject to annual impairment testing refer below 
our statements of operations include the results of medichem from march   the date of acquisition 
the following unaudited pro forma financial information presents our consolidated results as if the acquisition of medichem occurred at the beginning of nonrecurring charges  such as the acquired in process research and development charge of million is not reflected in the following pro forma financial information 
this pro forma information is not intended to be indicative of future operating results 
for the year ended december  in thousands  except per share amount total revenues  net loss  basic and diluted net loss per share critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates  which include  among others  those related to revenue recognition  property and equipment  intangible assets  materials and supplies  derivative financial instruments  income taxes  litigation and other contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form our basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
the impact and any associated risks related to these and our other accounting policies on our business or operations is discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  please refer to our notes to the consolidated financial statements 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from the estimates referred to above 
we believe the following policies to be the most critical to an understanding of our financial condition and results of operations because they require us to make estimates  assumptions and judgements about matters that are inherently uncertain 
collaborations and revenue 
our collaborative arrangements and the recognition of revenue in such arrangements is the accounting policy most critical to us 
a substantial portion of our revenues relate to funded research collaborations 
under these arrangements  we perform research in a specific disease area or disease areas aimed at discoveries leading to novel pharmaceutical and diagnostic products 
these arrangements generally have fixed terms and renewal periods specific to each agreement 
under these agreements we are entitled to receive committed payments for which we recognize revenue over the term of the associated contract  inclusive of renewal periods to which we are contractually bound 
in addition  we generally receive contractually agreed milestone payments upon the achievement of specific research and product development milestones 
we recognize milestones when acknowledgement of having achieved applicable performance requirements is received 
our revenues from research and development collaboration agreements are recorded and recognized in accordance with the applicable performance requirements and terms of the respective contracts  generally either i as contract research costs are incurred  usually ratably over the period of effort  ii according to the level of efforts expended based on the ratio of contract research costs incurred to expected total costs  or iii upon the achievement of substantive milestones 
funding payments are not refundable in the event that the related efforts are not successful 
non refundable  up front payments we receive are deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the contract term 
our contracted chemistry services revenue from negotiated rate contracts are recognized on a per diem basis as services are rendered or on the percentage of completion method based on the ratio of costs incurred to expected total costs for fixed fee contracts based upon the terms of the underlying contract 
any losses on contracts are provided for when they are determinable 
included in revenue are billings to customers for the cost of materials purchased by us under the contract 
given the nature of some of our contractual obligations  we may invoice in advance of the work being completed or we may be required to recognize revenue under gaap in advance of being contractually permitted to invoice for our services 
revenue invoiced in advance of satisfying the applicable criteria for revenue recognition remains as deferred revenue in our balance sheet at any reporting date and then is recognized as revenue as we provide the related services 
revenue recognized prior to the time we are contractually entitled to invoice is reported as unbilled costs and fees 
in considering whether to recognize unbilled revenues we assess the likelihood of successfully fulfilling our obligations under the arrangement as well as the risk of collection 
revenue estimates are reviewed and revised throughout the lives of our contracts and are made based upon current facts and circumstances 
if changes in these estimates or other material adjustments to revenue are identified  the adjustments to profits resulting from such revisions will be recorded on a cumulative basis in the period in which the revisions are made 
in november  the emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on issue no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf no 

eitf no 
provides guidance on how to account for arrangements that involve the delivery or performance of multiple products  services and or rights to use assets 
the provisions of eitf no 
were applicable to revenue arrangements entered into fiscal periods beginning after june  our adoption of eitf no 
did not impact revenue for  however  this pronouncement may have a significant impact on timing of revenue recorded under future agreements  including the possible deferral of milestone payments received during the research period and recognition over the remaining period of performance 
other 
we consider certain other accounting matters related to property and equipment  materials and supplies  foreign exchange transactions  income taxes and litigation and other contingencies to also be important policies for us 
long lived assets 
we periodically review property and equipment for potential impairments and to assess whether their service lives have been affected by continued technological change and development 
in september of  we implemented a cost reduction program and reduced total worldwide headcount by approximately employees  focusing in particular on utilizing ongoing process automation and increased productivity in the core genetics operations in reykjavik 
stemming from this initiative and together with our consideration of significant and pervasive declines in the market environment for pharmaceutical and biotech industries  we determined that impairment tests of the carrying value of our goodwill and other long lived assets  including the long lived assets acquired through the medichem acquisition  should be performed 
we completed these tests and recorded impairments and write downs of long term assets amounting to million for the year ended december  there were no events in that triggered an impairment review nor did our annual review indicate any recoverability issues 
should we determine that there has been further impairment of our fixed assets  goodwill or other intangible assets in the future we would suffer an increase to our net loss or a reduction of our net income in the period such a determination is made 
in  we reduced the service lives of our gene sequencing machines from five years to four years to better reflect our estimate of the service lives of these machines resulting in an increase to depreciation expense of million in that year 
should we determine that the pace of technological change or other matters dictate that we change the estimated service lives of other of our assets  there will be an impact on depreciation expense from the date of the change 
materials and supplies 
we value our materials and supplies at the lower of cost or market  cost being determined on the first in  first out method 
we apply judgment in determining necessary provisions for slow moving  excess and obsolete materials and supplies based on historical experience and anticipated usage  giving effect to general market conditions 
any rapid technological changes or future business developments could result in an increase in the amount of obsolete materials and supplies on hand 
furthermore  if our estimates of our needs for materials and supplies prove to be inaccurate  additional provision may be required for incremental excess and obsolete items 
we recorded charges for write down of obsolete and excess materials and supplies of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
in  we used materials and supplies for which we had made provisions for in prior years as slow moving  excess and obsolete  benefiting otherwise reported research and development expenses by million 
foreign exchange transactions 
our functional currency is the us dollar 
however  in light of the significance of our operations outside the united states  an important element of our cost base is or will be denominated in icelandic krona  including much of our payroll and other operating expenses and some of our long term borrowings 
to manage our exposure to fluctuations in exchange rates  we have entered into and will likely continue to enter into derivative instruments to hedge our exposure to such fluctuations 
we have entered into interest rate and foreign currency risk arising from long term debt obligations denominated in icelandic krona 
to this end  we have entered into two interest rate and cross currency swaps to manage interest rate and foreign currency risk 
these interest rate and cross currency swaps are designated as economic hedges of fixed rate foreign currency debt  but do not qualify for hedge accounting under sfas no 
at each reporting date  the estimated fair value of these instruments is recorded on our balance sheet and the resulting unrealized gain or loss is included as an other non operating income or expense in our statements of operations 
we estimate the fair value of these instruments using information that is available at the time of such determination  however  the financial markets for these instruments are immature and  as a result  there is significant judgment inherent in the estimating process 
consequently  subsequent changes in the market for such instruments and or our views with respect to such and the estimate of the fair value of these instruments could materially affect our results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period 
income taxes 
significant estimates are required in determining our provision for income taxes  including interpretations of existing tax laws and regulations 
various internal and external factors may have favorable or unfavorable effects on our future effective tax rate 
these factors include  but are not limited to  changes in tax laws  regulations and or rates  changing interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations  future research and development spending and future levels of capital expenditures 
the preparation of financial statements requires us to evaluate the positive and negative evidence bearing upon the realizability of our deferred tax assets resulting from deductible operating losses and other items 
due primarily to our history of operating losses and the expectation that such losses will continue into the foreseeable future  we have concluded that currently insufficient positive evidence exists to justify the recognition of our net deferred tax assets in our balance sheet 
although there can be no assurance that losses generated to date will be used to offset future taxable income  an adjustment to the valuation of our current net deferred tax assets in the future would increase income in the period that we made a determination that such an adjustment was appropriate 
income tax in iceland is payable in icelandic krona 
consequently  the us dollar value of our net operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets and liabilities is subject to fluctuations in exchange rates 
such fluctuations over time may increase or reduce the reported us dollar balance of our deferred tax assets and liabilities  and there would be a corresponding gain or loss reported in our income statement 
litigation and other contingencies 
we consider litigation and other claims and potential claims or contingencies in preparing our financial statements under generally accepted accounting principles 
we maintain accruals for litigation and other contingencies when we believe a loss to be probable and reasonably estimated 
in doing so  we assess the likelihood of any adverse judgements or outcomes with respect to legal and other matters as well as potential of probable losses 
we base our accruals on information available at the time of such determination 
changes or developments in the relevant action or our strategy in such proceedings could materially affect our results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period 
since the recognition of a loss is dependent upon factors not completely in the control of management  timing of a charge  if any  is difficult to predict with certainty 
results of operations from the years ended december   and our results of operations have fluctuated from period to period and may continue to fluctuate in the future based upon  among other things  the timing and composition of funding under our various collaborative agreements  as well as the progress of our own research and development efforts 
results of operations for any period may be unrelated to results of operations for any other period 
in addition  historical results should not be viewed as indicative of future operating results 
we are subject to risks common to companies in our industry and at our stage of development  including risks inherent in our research and development efforts  reliance upon collaborative partners  development by us or our competitors of new technological innovations  ability to market products or services  dependence on key personnel  dependence on key suppliers  protection of proprietary technology  ability to obtain additional financing  ability to negotiate collaborative arrangements  and compliance with governmental and other regulations 
in order for a product to be commercialized based on our research  we and our collaborators must conduct preclinical tests and clinical trials  demonstrate the efficacy and safety of our product candidates  obtain regulatory approvals or clearances and enter into manufacturing  distribution and marketing arrangements  as well as obtain market acceptance 
we do not expect to receive revenues or royalties based on therapeutic or diagnostic products for a period of years  if at all 
financial highlights for the year ended december  include our revenue increased to million for the year ended december  as compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
this growth reflects continued expansion across our product development and other service businesses  including milestone revenue from our existing product development alliances and the formation of new corporate partnerships 
importantly  from our revenues we were able to derive the funds necessary to sustain our investment in research and development including investment in clinical development  as we have done for dg in heart attack 
we decreased our research and development expenses to million for the year ended december  as compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in as compared to is principally attributable to the cost reduction measures we implemented late in  taking advantage of investments in automation in our disease gene research programs 
the principal result of this effort has been a marked increase in productivity enabling us to continue to accelerate both our discovery and downstream work with substantially lower costs 
at december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents  including million in restricted cash 
our cash resources are down million from our year end balance on million of cash used in operating activities together with million of debt service and million of new financing proceeds 
revenue 
our business strategy is focused on turning our discoveries and assets into a broad range of products for the market  at the same time as we leverage our capabilities to generate near term service revenue 
in some instances  we are pursuing product development on our own 
in others  we have formed alliances with pharmaceutical and biotechnology firms through which we can cover some of the cost of conducting basic research and spread the risk and investment involved in product development 
we have entered into research  development and commercialization alliances and collaborations with major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies across our business 
depending on the nature of each prospective business opportunity  the key components of the commercial terms of such alliance arrangements typically include one or more of the following research funding  up front  exclusivity  technology access  and technology development fees  milestone payments  license or commercialization fees  and royalties or profit sharing from the commercialization of products 
significant elements of our revenue is summarized as follows for the year ended december  in thousands research funding and service fees    milestone payments    up front  exclusivity  technology access  and technology development fees other  collaborations with our most significant partners include f 
hoffmann la roche roche 
therapeutics 
in we entered into a research collaboration and cross license agreement with roche  which terminated in  under which we identified key genetic factors involved in ten common diseases osteoarthritis  alzheimer s disease  schizophrenia  paod  stroke  osteoporosis  obesity  anxiety  non insulin dependent diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis 
in january  we entered into a new three year agreement with roche focused on turning the achievements of our gene discovery collaboration into novel therapeutics 
the agreement provided that we would collaborate with respect to four diseases that had been the subject of the agreement 
we are currently collaborating on two of those diseases 
under the agreement we have received  in research funding and may receive an additional  in research funding during the remainder of the term of the agreement 
the agreement provides that upon the development of specified compounds during the term of the agreement and for a specified period thereafter we may receive milestone payments  the amount of which will depend on the type of compound developed 
in addition  we will be entitled to receive royalties on the sales of drugs that are developed 
we expect that we will not receive research funding under the agreement after february   when the research term ends  unless we and roche decide to extend the collaboration beyond that time 
diagnostics 
in june  we signed a five year alliance with roche s diagnostics division to develop and market dna based diagnostics for major diseases 
more recently we have added research programs aimed at developing diagnostics to predict drug response for major therapeutics used to treat those diseases  in order to help select the most effective treatment of those available 
under the agreement we have received  in research funding  up front fees and milestone payments 
we may receive  in additional research funding over the remainder of the term of the agreement as well as milestone payments upon the achievement of research and development milestones and royalties on the sales of diagnostic products developed 
revenues from these alliances with roche amounted to million  million  and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
merck co  inc merck 
obesity 
in september  we entered into an alliance with merck aimed at developing new treatments for obesity 
under the alliance  we are combining our research efforts in the genetics of obesity to identify  validate and prioritize a series of drug targets to take into development 
under the terms of the three year agreement  which can be extended on a year to year basis upon the consent of the parties  we have received research funding  technology access fees and milestone payments in the aggregate amount of  and may receive research funding and technology access in the future of  in addition  we may receive further research milestone payments and we may receive milestone payments as compounds developed under the alliance advance in the development process and royalties on successfully marketed drugs 
merck may terminate the agreement at any time upon days notice or after september  upon days notice in the event that the research program fails to achieve certain specified goals 
information rich clinical trials 
in february  we entered into an agreement with merck under which we will conduct information rich clinical trials on a range of merck s developmental compounds 
the term of the alliance is seven years  subject to termination by merck after five years 
we will  at any given point over the course of the alliance  be conducting concurrent trials on as many as five merck compounds 
under the terms of the agreement  we will receive royalties on sales of drugs and diagnostics developed as part of the alliance 
we will receive a one time technology access fee  will share research funding for the clinical development of compounds and pharmacogenomic analysis  and will receive milestone payments as compounds or pharmacogenomic tests reach the market 
in addition  merck has purchased  shares of our common stock at a price of per share  and has received a warrant to purchase up to  of additional shares of our common stock at per share over the next five years 
revenues from the therapeutics and other alliances with merck during the periods presented amounted to million  and million and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
applied biosystems group abg 
in the fourth quarter of  we terminated and entered into a related settlement agreement regarding two agreements with abg that had been in place since july our accounting policy for the joint development and commercialization agreement with abg to develop genotypic analysis products provided for revenue related to abg s payment obligation and our development costs associated with the agreement to be deferred until the development efforts were completed or the agreement is terminated  if earlier  as was the case 
as a result  deferred revenue of million was recognized in the fourth quarter of when the parties reached agreement as to termination 
revenue for the years ended december   and are as follows as compared to as compared to change change change change in thousands  except revenue      the increase in revenue in from is largely accountable to there being a full year of research funding payments and amortization of technology access and exclusivity fees in our collaboration with merck and from milestone payments received in our collaborations with roche and with merck  partially offset by the termination of the abg collaboration in the fourth quarter of the increase in revenue in from is attributable to the addition of decode s pharmaceuticals and biostructures groups and the totality of revenue recognized under decode s contract with abg  offset by the recognition of revenue from milestone achievements under the research collaboration with roche during that did not recur in we expect that our revenues will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and that such fluctuations may be substantial especially because progress in our scientific work  including milestone payments that are related to progress  can fluctuate between quarters 
research and development  including cost of revenue 
research and development expenses for the years ended december   and are as follows as compared to as compared to change change change change in thousands  except research and development  including cost of revenue   our research and development costs reflects spending related to the range of our disease gene research programs  including product development and downstream work on targets already identified as well as our pharmaceutical and biostructures groups  which are now an integral part of our operations 
the decrease in as compared to is principally attributable to the cost reduction measures we implemented late in  taking advantage of investments in automation in our disease gene research programs and with notable reductions in our usage of chemicals and consumables million  salary and related expenses million  costs related to our clinical collaborations million and our research and development property related and other overheads million 
further  productivity gains have enabled acceleration in our basic gene and target discovery work while also making available the resources to undertake preparations for clinical work on our lead drug development programs 
our research and development expenses for as compared to also reflect a relative net benefit of million resulting from i a reversal of accrued database license fees discussed further below  ii materials and supplies we used for which there was relatively little or no attendant cost as a result of the settlement agreement we entered into with abg in or for which we had made provisions for in prior years as slow moving  excess or obsolete according to our accounting policy  and iii development funding received from ibm  partially offset by iv license fees to bayer ag with respect to the small molecule compound  dg the increase in as compared to reflects spending related to the range of our disease gene research programs and the initiation of downstream work on targets already identified as well as  from march  the addition of our pharmaceutical and biostructures groups 
on january   the icelandic ministry of health and social security the ministry  granted decode an operating license the license to create  operate and commercialize the icelandic health sector database the ihd  or the license 
as required by the license  and concurrently with its issuance  decode entered into an agreement the agreement with the ministry whereby decode would be obligated to pay the icelandic government a fixed annual fee of million icelandic kronas per year approximately million per year as of december and an additional annual fee of of its net profit  up to a maximum of million icelandic krona per year as a consideration for the rights granted to decode under the license 
through june and december   million and million  respectively  of these annual fees had been provided for and included in other accrued expenses 
under the terms of the agreement  certain events needed to take place in order for the fixed annual fee to become due  including the consummation of certain data transfer agreements with the two largest icelandic hospitals  which have subsequently merged to form the national university hospital nuh 
no such agreement with the nuh has been consummated  and the ihd has not been commercialized primarily because the icelandic data protection authority has not issued the required security certification 
in light of the development of our business since the agreement was entered into  the lack of the required agreement with the nuh and the fact that the icelandic data protection authority has not issued the required security certification  we do not expect to operate the ihd under the terms of the agreement 
as such  management s estimation after consultation with legal counsel is that it is no longer probable that the accrued fixed annual fee will become due  and accordingly  a reversal of million of the accrued fees in the third quarter of  has reduced recorded research and development expenses for the year ended december  selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the years ended december   and are as follows as compared to as compared to change change change change in thousands  except selling  general and administrative    the decrease in as compared to reflects the impact of the cost reduction programs implemented in late  with notable reductions in our legal and other third party service costs million and in our travel and other overhead expenses million  more than making up for approximate increases in our outside auditing expenses million and in our director s and officer s insurance premiums million 
the increase in as compared to results from expanded sales efforts across our businesses and from the addition of selling  general and administrative costs of our pharmaceutical and biostructures groups from march  offset somewhat by a one time  non cash litigation settlement in stock based compensation and remuneration expense 
stock based compensation and remuneration expense for the years ended december   and are as follows as compared to as compared to change change change change in thousands  except stock based compensation and remuneration expense   with little compensation expense being attributed to our more recent stock option grants  stock based compensation and remuneration expense has been decreasing as grants made to employees in earlier years become fully vested 
historical stock based compensation and remuneration is not necessarily representative of the effects on reported income or loss for future years due to  among other things  the vesting period of the stock options  the value of stock options that have been granted in recent times and the value of additional options that may be granted in future years 
impairment  employee termination benefits and other costs 
impairment  employee termination benefits and other costs for the years ended december   and are as follows as compared to as compared to change change change change in thousands  except impairment  employee termination benefits and other costs  in september  we implemented a cost reduction program aimed at achieving positive operating cashflow from existing operations by the end of in this regard  we reduced total worldwide headcount  focusing in particular on utilizing ongoing process automation and increased productivity in the core genetics operations in reykjavik 
stemming from this initiative and together with our consideration of significant and pervasive declines in the market environment for pharmaceutical and biotech industries  we determined that impairment tests of the carrying value of our goodwill and other long lived assets  including the long lived assets acquired through the medichem acquisition  should be performed 
we have recorded the following impairment  employee termination benefits and other charges in the year ended december  in thousands employee termination benefits  impairment of goodwill  impairment of property and intangible asset  write down of assets held for sale  write down of equipment  obsolete and excess materials and supplies  during the year ended december   decode recorded  of additional employee terminations benefits 
the following summarizes the charges  payments and unpaid termination benefits for the years ended december  and for the year ended december  in thousands balance at beginning of period additions to accrual  payments of benefits   the charges related to termination benefits are for and employees during and  respectively 
benefits remaining as of december  are expected to be settled in cash over the first half of for purposes of the goodwill impairment tests  we identified our reporting units  identified the assets and liabilities of the reporting units and performed impairment tests on the net goodwill associated with them 
goodwill that resulted from the acquisition of medichem was assigned to the reporting units based upon expectations of synergies to be gained from the integration of the pharmaceutical and biostructures groups with the overall group 
goodwill impairment is deemed to exist if the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value 
to identify potential impairment  we compare fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
for this purpose  we estimate fair value of a reporting unit using analyses of comparable companies and recent comparable transactions 
in measuring the amount of impairment loss  we compare the implied fair value of a reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill  estimating the fair value of an impaired reporting unit using discounted cash flow methodologies 
the goodwill impairment charge is associated solely with goodwill resulting from the acquisition of medichem and results largely from significant and pervasive declines in the market environment for the pharmaceutical and biotech industries impacting  among other things  market valuations of companies operating in those industries 
in september  we committed to a plan to sell our woodridge discovery center and an agent was engaged and has initiated an active marketing program to locate a buyer investor in a sale and leaseback transaction 
efforts to enter into a sale and leaseback transaction or other form of re financing continue but have yet to be consummated 
taking into account the then estimated selling price of the building  we recorded an impairment charge in the year ended december  amounting to million 
in addition  certain intangible assets amounting to million were determined to be impaired utilizing a discounted cashflow methodology to estimate fair value 
in september  we committed to a plan to sell our former headquarters facility that had been vacated in connection with the move to our new headquarters facility in reykjavik s university district earlier in the year 
in october  an agent for the sale was engaged and an active marketing program to locate a buyer was initiated 
in november  terms of sale were agreed and executed with a buyer in the amount of million 
taking into account the selling price of the building less costs to sell  we wrote down the property in september amounting to million 
in september  we wrote down the value of certain laboratory equipment no longer in use to fair value  amounting to an impairment of million 
ongoing process automation and increased productivity in the core genetics operations in reykjavik and changes in some of our target research programs have affected planned volume and timing of usage of materials and supplies 
in this connection  we recorded a write down for excess and obsolete materials and supplies during september of million  which was recorded in impairment  employee termination benefits and other charges in the statement of operations 
interest income 
interest income for the years ended december   and are as follows as compared to as compared to change change change change in thousands  except interest income      in general  the decreased returns are attributable to the continued decline of prevailing interest rates but also from an overall decrease in our cash balance as we utilize the proceeds of  among other of our financing activities  our initial public offering 
interest expense 
interest expense for the years ended december   and are as follows as compared to as compared to change change change change in thousands  except interest expense    the increase in interest expense from reflects the cost of financings put into place during the late part of and early part of and  from  reflects an equipment sale leaseback financing in june as well as short term borrowings made in the latter half of the year 
other non operating income and expense  net 
other non operating income and expense for the years ended december   and are as follows as compared to as compared to change change change change in thousands  except other non operating income and expense  net   our other non operating income and expense  net for the year ended december  comprises unrealized swap gains million  the net impact of foreign exchange million loss and the gain on the sale of decode s investment in the common stock of emr million 
our unrealized swap gains stem from the two cross currency swaps we entered into as economic hedges against foreign exchange rate fluctuations that may occur on our tier a and tier c bonds but that do not qualify for hedge accounting under sfas no 
such unrealized amounts may or may not equate to the realized gains or losses that may result in the final settlement of these swaps 
the continued weakening of the us dollar compared to the icelandic krona during has been significant and these currency fluctuations may continue to adversely affect our financial results 
income taxes 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million and did not owe any icelandic or us federal income taxes nor did we pay any in the years ended december   or realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on future earnings  if any 
as of december   we had net operating losses able to be carried forward for us federal income tax purposes of approximately million to offset future taxable income in the united states that expire at various dates through also  as of december  our foreign subsidiaries had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million that expire in varying amounts beginning in net loss and basic and diluted net loss per share 
net loss and basic and diluted net loss per share for the years ended december   and are as follows as compared to as compared to change change change change in thousands  except and per share amounts net loss      basic and diluted net loss per share this is a decrease of in net loss and a decrease of in basic and diluted net loss per share from to increased revenue and the introduction of significant operational efficiencies account for these decreases in the periods as compared to the periods together with the impact of significant impairment  employee termination costs and other gains and charges in all periods presented 
this is an increase of in net loss and an increase of in basic and diluted net loss per share from to the increases in net loss and basic and diluted net loss per share in are primarily attributable to the impairment  employee termination benefits and other charges recorded offset in part by the higher average number of shares outstanding for the periods 
the difference in the average number of shares outstanding is the result of our acquisition of medichem in march pro forma net loss and basic and diluted net loss per share 
pro forma net loss and basic and diluted net loss per share for the years ended december   and are as follows as compared to as compared to change change change change in thousands  except and per share amounts pro forma net loss     pro forma basic and diluted net loss per share net loss and basic and diluted net loss per share were million and  respectively  for the year ended december  as compared to pro forma net loss and basic and diluted net loss per share calculated assuming our new milestone revenue recognition method is applied retroactively of million and  respectively  for the year ended december  and of million and  respectively  for the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations primarily through funding from research and development collaborative agreements  and the issuance of equity securities and long term financing instruments million from the beginning of to date 
future funding under terms of our existing agreements is approximately million excluding milestone payments and royalties that we may earn under such collaborations 
although we currently depend upon funded research arrangements for a significant portion of our revenue  we continue to invest in proprietary research and we will incur the costs of such research 
in the near term  this will require us to continue to make investments in our in house capabilities for downstream development which we believe will better position us to capture the most value to us in our discoveries 
as we identify promising discoveries for further development  we may choose to continue the development ourselves into and through clinical trials  regulatory clearances and manufacture  distribution and marketing 
in other cases we are or will be working to varying degrees with partners 
the decisions we make as to these matters will affect our cash requirements 
based upon the range of our current activities  including the clinical trial alliance we formed with merck in february  we expect to have an overall net use of cash in in our operating  investing and financing activities very similar to that used in million 
debt service in together with net payments on short term borrowings and other working capital needs are expected to amount to million 
in february  we received proceeds of million from merck in their purchase of decode common stock 
although our capital expenditure needs and other investing activities may in the future fluctuate significantly from period to period  we currently anticipate that we will only have to make replacement capital expenditures in  likely amounting to under million 
however  while we will continue to carefully manage our basic operating costs we are also beginning to deploy the necessary resources to bring our proprietary programs into the clinic 
our most advanced proprietary drug discovery programs are in myocardial infarction and paod 
in our myocardial infarction program we in licensed dg in the fourth quarter of  a compound that we will be testing in the clinic as a treatment for vascular inflammation and the prevention of heart attack 
we are preparing to begin a phase ii information rich clinical trial in in our paod program during we advanced into screening of lead compounds and we anticipate filing an ind in paod by the end of or early  and entering into the clinic shortly thereafter 
our cash requirements depend on numerous factors  including our ability to obtain new research and development collaboration agreements  to obtain and maintain contract service agreements in our pharmaceuticals  biostructures  clinical research trials and genotyping service groups  expenditures in connection with alliances  license agreements and acquisitions of and investments in complementary technologies and businesses  competing technological and market developments  the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  the purchase of additional capital equipment  including capital equipment necessary to ensure that our sequencing and genotyping operations remain competitive  and capital expenditures required to expand our facilities 
changes in our research and development plans  the entry into clinical trials of a drug based on our discoveries  or other changes affecting our operating expenses may result in changes in the timing and amount of expenditures of our capital resources 
under all circumstances  we will require significant additional capital in the future  which we may seek to raise through further public or private equity offerings  additional debt financing or added collaborations and licensing arrangements 
however  no assurance can be given that additional financing or collaborations and licensing arrangements will be available when needed  or that if available  will be obtained on favorable terms 
if adequate funds are not available when needed  we may have to curtail operations or attempt to raise funds on unattractive terms 
for the year ended december  in thousands cash provided by used in operating activities    investing activities   financing activities   cash and cash equivalents  at end of period   cash and cash equivalents 
at december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents  including million in connection with a financing that is restricted as to its use 
our cash resources are down million from our year end balance on million of cash used in operating activities together with million of debt service and million of new financing proceeds 
available cash is invested in accordance with our investment policy s primary objectives of liquidity  safety of principal and diversity of investments 
our cash is deposited only with financial institutions in iceland  the united kingdom and the united states having a high credit standing 
this cash is largely invested in us dollar denominated money market and checking accounts and also in icelandic krona denominated accounts 
operating activities 
working capital needs resulted in the net use of million of funds in the year ended december  as compared to million in the year ended december  on account of this and significant non cash impairment and other charges in  although net loss decreased million in as compared to  net cash used in operating activities decreased million 
as more fully described above  this is as a result of our increased revenue base and the impacts of the cost reduction measures we implemented late in working capital needs resulted in the net use of million of funds in the year ended december  as compared to that was provided by working capital sources in the year ended december  on account of this and significant non cash impairment and other charges in  although net loss increased by million in as compared to  net cash used in operating activities increased million in as compared to notably  in we made significant payments to our vendors and particularly to abg for reagents  other supplies and dna analyzers 
in addition  into we were continuing to make significant investments in our disease gene research programs and had taken on the costs of downstream work on targets already identified as well as were expanding our sales efforts across our businesses 
investing activities 
our investing activities have consisted of capital expenditures and long term strategic equity investments in  and acquisitions of  technologies and businesses that are complementary to our business 
purchases of property and equipment during the year ended december  were million as compared to and million in the years ended december  and  respectively  the latter being primarily due to the expansion of our facilities and operations 
we principally made replacement capital expenditures during in  we expended million in respect of the new building to house our operations in the university district of reykjavik  million for the purchase of dna analyzers under our supply agreement with abg  and acquired million of cash in the purchase of medichem 
there were also million of medichem transaction costs  resulting in a net outlay of cash for the year ended december  in connection with the acquisition of million 
during  we expended million in respect of our new headquarters building and we paid million for dna analyzers acquired late in although we expect to continue to make simply replacement capital expenditures  net cash used in investing activities may in the future fluctuate significantly from period to period due to the timing of our capital expenditures and other investments 
financing activities 
net cash of million was provided in financing activities in the year ended december  as compared to million and million provided in financing activities in the years ended december  and  respectively 
financing activities for the year ended december  largely consisted of the sale and month leaseback of certain laboratory equipment million  short term borrowings million and installment payments on our existing debt and capital lease obligations million 
in  we financed certain equipment purchases million in a sale and leaseback transaction and  importantly  in december we established a million bridge loan with an icelandic financial institution to finance the construction of our new headquarters facility 
we repaid the borrowings under the bridge loan in january and march with the proceeds from our tier a million bond offering  tier c million offering of privately placed bonds and tier d million bank loan 
million of cash that was restricted as of december  was provided in in the final financing tiers c and d of our new headquarters facility 
in addition  we repaid the existing mortgage on our woodridge  il discovery center million and re financed the property in june  resulting in proceeds of million 
we seek to maintain a desired level of floating rate debt with respect to our overall debt portfolio denominated in us dollars 
to this end  we have entered into two interest rate and cross currency swaps to manage interest rate and foreign currency risk arising from long term debt obligations denominated in icelandic krona 
these interest rate and cross currency swaps with a remaining combined notional amount of  million icelandic krona are designated as economic hedges of fixed rate foreign currency debt tier a and tier c bonds  but do not qualify for hedge accounting under sfas the estimated fair value of these instruments is included in other long term assets is million and million as of december  and december   respectively 
the unrealized gain for the year ended december  and resulting from the recording of these instruments together with the translation of the tier a and tier c bonds is million and million  respectively  and is included in other non operating income and expense  net in the consolidated statements of operations 
on march   we prepaid the tier c bonds  as a first step in an integrated refinancing of the tier c bonds and the tier d bank loan with an icelandic financial institution the lender 
on march   we entered a  term loan with the lender to refinance the tier c bonds and the tier d bank loan 
the term loan bears interest at the three month libor plus as of march  until march   at which point  the lender may adjust the interest margin unilaterally on the interest date march  the term loan is payable in twenty quarterly payments starting on march  and the final payment is due on december  the term loan can be repaid on every anniversary of the loan starting on march   but for which we will pay a prepayment fee of for every year that remains on the term loan facility with a maximum fee of 
final execution of the term loan and our receipt of the related proceeds is expected to occur by march  contractual commitments 
our major outstanding contractual commitments relate to the privately placed bonds and bank loans and equipment lease financings 
our contractual commitments as of december  were as follows payments due by period total less than year years years more than years in thousands long term debt     capital lease obligations  including interest    operating leases    under the terms of certain technology licensing agreements  we are obligated to make payments upon the achievement of established milestones leading to the discovery of defined products 
these payments could total million and the year incurred cannot be determined at the current time

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities in our investment portfolio may be subject to market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the market value of the investment to fluctuate 
for example  if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the then prevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises  the market value of our investment will probably decline 
to minimize this risk in the future  we intend to maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  including commercial paper  money market funds and government and non government debt securities 
in general  money market funds and bank deposits are not subject to market risk because the interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate 
as of december   all of our cash and cash equivalents were in money market  bank deposit and checking accounts 
we are exposed to market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and investment prices 
these changes may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
we seek to manage these risks through regular operating and financing activities and  when deemed appropriate  through the use of derivative financial instruments 
we control and manage foreign exchange risk  interest rate risk  and investment price risk by continually monitoring changes in key economic indicators and market information 
as a consequence of the nature our business and operations our reported financial results and cash flows are exposed to the risks associated with fluctuations in the exchange rates of the us dollar  the icelandic krona and other world currencies 
we continue to monitor our exposure to currency risk but have not yet purchased instruments to hedge these general risks through the use of derivative financial instruments 
we hold various interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities to manage the liquidity and cash needs of our day to day operations 
as a result  we are exposed to risks due to changes in interest rates 
in order to mitigate risks associated with interest rate sensitive liabilities we use interest rate derivative instruments  such as cross currency interest rate swaps  and may in future use other instruments to achieve the desired interest rate maturities and asset liability structures 
we are exposed to credit or repayment risk  as well as market risk from the use of derivative instruments 
if the counterparty fails to fulfill its performance obligations under a derivative contract  our credit risk will equal the positive market value in a derivative 
consequently  when the fair market value of a derivative contract is positive  this indicates that the counterparty owes us  thus creating a repayment risk for us 
when the fair market value of a derivative contract is negative  we owe the counterparty and therefore  assume no repayment risk 
in order to minimize the credit risk in derivative instruments  we enter into transactions with high quality counterparties such as financial institutions that satisfy our established credit approval criteria 
we review the credit ratings of such counterparties on a regular basis
