item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in item of this annual report 
the following information contains forward looking statements 
please read forward looking statements below for a discussion of certain limitations inherent in such statements 
overview we provide contract drilling and related services to oil and gas companies worldwide  operating both offshore and on land 
as of march   we operated a global fleet of rigs  including two ultra deepwater drillships  semisubmersible rigs  jackup rigs  tender assisted  barge and platform rigs and land based drilling and workover rigs 
we operate in more than countries and marine provinces 
we have five principal operating segments gulf of mexico  international offshore  international land  e p services and technical services 
the markets for our drilling  workover and related e p services are highly cyclical 
variations in market conditions during the cycle impact us in different ways depending primarily on the length of drilling contracts in different regions 
contracts in the us gulf of mexico  for example  tend to be short term  so a deterioration or improvement in market conditions tends to impact our operations quickly 
contracts in our international offshore segment  as well as in mexico  tend to be longer term 
accordingly  short term changes in market conditions may have little or no impact on our revenues and cash flows from those operations unless the market changes occur during a period when we are attempting to renew a number of those contracts 
in late  we commenced the first of four major deepwater platform rig construction projects 
the rigs are being constructed on behalf of two major oil company customers under lump sum contracts 
we have experienced significant cost overruns on these projects  and we estimate that total costs on all four projects will substantially exceed contract revenues 
accordingly  in  we recorded provisions for losses on these projects totaling million  or million net of taxes at the us statutory rate 
the provisions reflect our current estimates of the costs to complete the projects and of additional contract revenues from the projects  following a review by our operating and senior management 
there are  however  uncertainties regarding many of the estimates and  particularly  the range of possible outcomes of certain commercial disputes related to the projects  which could result in settlements significantly above or below our current estimates 
our current estimates may be revised in future periods  and those revisions may be material 
weakness in the deepwater semisubmersible and drillship markets offshore west africa and brazil did not have a significant impact on our results for  as our deepwater rigs in those markets were operating under long term contracts entered into when market conditions were more favorable 
the impact of the continued weakness in these markets on our results for is likely to be more significant  however  as the contracts for two of our deepwater assets in the west african market are due to be renewed during the year 
we believe  however  that conditions in those markets will improve later in as development drilling commences on a number of major oil discoveries 
we experienced improved utilization of our jackup rig fleet in  principally due to our success in marketing rigs into mexico and other international markets from the us gulf of mexico  which has experienced weak market conditions since late the contracts in mexico have an average remaining term of approximately two years and  together with recently obtained extensions to the contracts for our two drillships working offshore angola for an aggregate of ten years  resulted in an increase in the contract backlog for our offshore rig fleet to approximately years and billion as of march   from years and billion as of march  in calculating our contract backlog  we include the remaining firm period of outstanding contracts  excluding any option periods  and the contract operating day rate less a allowance for any downtime or reduced rate billing  excluding any mobilization fees  performance bonuses and anticipated charges for ancillary services 
the above figures are the aggregate for all offshore rigs operated by us  including rigs owned by others that we manage  and excluding the deepwater platform rigs under construction 
conditions in our south american land and related e p services markets improved during  and our activity in these markets has recovered from the political and economic crises in argentina and venezuela in to levels exceeding those before the crises 
assuming there are no new major disruptions in these markets in  we expect our results from operations in these markets to be comparable to results 
we ended with approximately million more debt and million less total cash cash and cash equivalents plus restricted cash than at the end of total debt and liquidity in were negatively impacted by the high level of capital expenditures required to prepare rigs in our us fleet for work in mexico  higher than normal operating costs during the start up of operations for those rigs  net cash outflows on the rig construction projects discussed above and an increase in trade receivables 
we expect that debt levels and liquidity in will continue to be negatively impacted by increased net cash outflows relating to the construction projects 
debt levels and liquidity in will also be negatively impacted by our share of stacking and debt service costs if we are unable to secure work during for the pride portland and pride rio de janeiro  two amethyst class semisubmersible rigs that are concluding construction and are expected to be available for work in the second quarter and third quarter of  respectively 
in addition  the day rate under which either or both of our two west african deepwater semisubmersible rigs  whose existing contracts expire in  are recontracted could have a significant impact on our future debt and liquidity 
however  we expect debt and liquidity in to benefit from a full year of operations for our rigs in mexico and from a reduced level of capital expenditures  as our program to upgrade rigs from our us gulf of mexico fleet for international markets winds down 
debt reduction and liquidity in also will be positively impacted if we succeed in our announced focused efforts to reduce operating  general and administrative costs  improve our working capital management and sell certain assets 
although we intend to aggressively pursue these strategies to reduce our debt and improve our liquidity  it is not practicable at the present time to quantify the possible impact  if any  of any of these measures 
as of march   our liquidity position totaled approximately million  consisting of approximately million of unrestricted cash  million of available undrawn capacity under our senior secured revolving credit facilities and million of available undrawn unsecured credit facilities 
the total undrawn portion of our senior secured revolving credit facilities at that date was approximately million 
indentures governing our outstanding senior notes due and our senior notes due limit our ability to draw under these facilities to a percentage of consolidated net tangible assets  which effectively restricts our ability at present to borrow additional amounts under these facilities 
accordingly  approximately million of the million of undrawn capacity under these facilities was not available as of march  to meet our short term liquidity needs  leaving only million available 
furthermore  in connection with the announced extension of the drilling contracts for our two drillships  we are in the process of finalizing an approximate million expansion of the drillship loans 
we currently expect that approximately million of the proceeds and approximately million of currently restricted cash will be used by the joint venture to repay indebtedness due from the joint venture company to pride early in the second quarter of if the transaction is completed  the funds paid to us will be available to reduce our other outstanding debt and improve liquidity 
in addition  as of december   million of our cash balances  which amount is included in restricted cash  consisted of funds held in trust in connection with our drillship and semisubmersible loans and our limited recourse collateralized term loans and is therefore not available for our use 
the amount as of march  was approximately million 
in september  we acquired marine drilling companies  inc in a stock for stock transaction 
we issued million shares of our common stock to the former shareholders of marine  which equaled approximately of the outstanding shares of our common stock immediately following completion of the acquisition 
the acquisition was accounted for as a pooling of interests for accounting and financial reporting purposes and  accordingly  our consolidated financial statements for each period prior to the merger reflect the combined operations of pride and marine 
since november  we have reorganized our senior management team 
john o leary has been appointed to the position of president  louis raspino joined pride as executive vice president and chief financial officer  john blocker has been appointed senior vice president operations and gregory looser has been appointed vice president  general counsel and secretary 
business environment and outlook general revenues 
our revenues depend principally upon the number of our available rigs  the number of days these rigs are utilized and the contract day rates received 
the number of days our rigs are utilized and the contract day rates received are largely dependent upon the balance of supply and demand for drilling and related services in the different geographic regions in which we operate 
the number of available rigs may increase or decrease as a result of the acquisition  relocation or disposal of rigs  the construction of new rigs and the number of rigs being upgraded or repaired or the subject of periodic surveys or routine maintenance at any time 
in order to improve utilization or realize higher contract day rates  we may mobilize our rigs from one market to another 
our revenues also depend on the number and scope of construction or engineering projects being undertaken by our technical services group 
revenues for these projects are recognized on a percentage of completion basis 
oil and gas companies exploration and development drilling programs drive the demand for drilling and related services 
these drilling programs are affected by their expectations about oil and natural gas prices  anticipated production levels  demand for crude oil and natural gas products  government regulations and many other factors 
oil and gas prices are volatile  which has historically led to significant fluctuations in expenditures by our customers for oil and gas drilling and related services 
operating expenses 
earnings from operations are primarily affected by changes in revenue  but are also a function of changes in operating expenses 
operating expenses are generally influenced by changes in utilization 
for instance  if a rig is expected to be idle for an extended period of time  we may reduce the size of the rig s crew and take steps to cold stack the rig  which reduces expenses and partially offsets the impact on operating income associated with loss of revenues 
we recognize as an operating expense routine overhauls that maintain rather than upgrade the rigs or e p services equipment 
these expenses vary from period to period 
costs of rig enhancements are capitalized and depreciated over the expected useful lives of the enhancements 
depreciation expense decreases earnings from operations in periods subsequent to capital upgrades 
operating expenses in relation to our engineering and construction projects are recognized in proportion to revenues using the percentage of completion method 
additionally  operating expenses may include a provision for expected losses if we estimate that a project will be unprofitable in total 
our general and administrative expenses are principally related to our corporate headquarters and our regional offices 
environmental regulation 
we are subject to the us oil pollution act of  the us outer continental shelf lands act  and the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act  or cercla 
additionally  other countries where we operate have similar regulations covering the discharge of oil and other contaminants in connection with drilling operations 
segment review the following table summarizes average daily revenue and percentage utilization by type of rig for the last three years 
average daily revenue information is based on total revenues for each rig type divided by actual days worked by all rigs of that type 
average daily revenue will differ from average contract day rate for a rig due to billing adjustments for any non productive time  mobilization fees  performance bonuses and charges to the customer for ancillary services 
percentage utilization is calculated as the total days worked divided by the total days available for work by all rigs of that type 
daily daily daily revenue utilization revenue utilization revenue utilization gulf of mexico jackup rigs    platform rigs    international offshore drillships semisubmersibles    jackup rigs    tenders and barges    international land land drilling    land workover    gulf of mexico demand for drilling services in the us gulf of mexico showed only a marginal improvement in demand has continued to lag the recovery in natural gas prices that commenced in mid when natural gas inventory storage levels started to decline 
market conditions have  however  somewhat improved due to the reduction in the supply of rigs resulting from a number of rigs leaving the us sector of the gulf of mexico for other markets 
as a result  jackups in the us gulf of mexico are currently being contracted at rates of approximately  per day higher than at the start of in response to the weak market conditions that have existed in the us gulf of mexico since the fourth quarter of  we have actively marketed a number of rigs in our us gulf of mexico fleet to international markets 
since early  we have obtained long term contracts for jackup rigs and two platform rigs with a unit of petroleos mexicanos sa in the mexican sector of the gulf of mexico and for two jackup rigs in other international markets  one in nigeria and one in india 
additionally  we obtained long term contracts with pemex in mexico for the pride south seas  a semisubmersible rig that we mobilized from south africa  and for the pride mexico  a newly acquired semisubmersible rig 
the first nine jackup rigs  one of the platform rigs and the pride south seas were contracted and completed redeployment in and worked throughout three of the jackups and the second platform rig commenced operations in july  and the pride mexico and the remaining two jackup rigs commenced operations in the fourth quarter of as of march   our jackups working for pemex had contracts with an average remaining term of years and an average contract day rate of  six of our jackups were working in the us gulf of mexico with an average contract day rate of  of which four were on short term contracts 
there were five rigs available 
additionally  three of our platform rigs were working offshore mexico on contracts with an average contract day rate of  and five were working in the us gulf of mexico at an average contract day rate of two of our available jackup rigs could be put back into service in the us gulf of mexico at a relatively low cost 
the remaining three rigs have not worked since late  and we would require longer term contracts to justify the cost of reactivating these rigs 
all of our available rigs would require additional expenditures to work in mexico or other international markets 
we expect that revenues and gross margins derived from our gulf of mexico operations in will exceed those for due to higher revenues from a full year of operations  and the absence of start up costs  for those rigs working in mexico 
results for are also expected to benefit from improved day rates and a modest increase in activity in the us sector of the gulf 
international offshore our international offshore segment has continued to experience high levels of activity  and we have maintained essentially full utilization of six of our seven high specification deepwater rigs in the seventh rig  the pride south america semisubmersible rig  received its five year periodic survey and related maintenance in the first quarter of and was out of service for approximately days 
in addition  the rig had approximately days of downtime in the third and fourth quarters of due to repairs to its thruster systems 
the pride carlos walter and pride brazil semisubmersible rigs working offshore brazil both experienced unscheduled downtime in the fourth quarter of relating to the replacement of certain bearings on their riser tensioner systems 
the downtime resulted in approximately million of lost revenues and approximately million of increased operating costs 
each rig has eight sets of riser tensioners  and we plan to replace the bearings on the remaining unchanged sets during  which is expected to result in an aggregate of approximately days of downtime for the two rigs in two of our deepwater semisubmersible rigs working in west africa are expected to complete their current contracts in april and august  respectively 
demand and day rates for deepwater rigs in the west african market are lower than when the rigs were last contracted 
we currently expect that the rigs will be recontracted at rates significantly less than their current rates and that one or both could have some period without contract revenues 
our remaining three deepwater semisubmersibles are on long term contracts  and our two deepwater drillships  the pride africa and pride angola  are working under contracts that were extended in december by an aggregate of ten years  commencing at the end of the contracts current terms in june and may  respectively 
the pride africa is scheduled to undergo its five year special periodic survey in the fourth quarter of and is expected to be out of service for approximately days 
the market for intermediate water depth semisubmersible rigs remained weak during idle time for our three rigs working in the international offshore segment was due primarily to one of the rigs undergoing its five year periodic survey during the period and to the pride venezuela being stacked for the last five months of after it completed its contract with pdvsa in july 
the pride venezuela has been demobilized to trinidad and is being marketed internationally 
additionally  the contract for the pride south atlantic  offshore brazil  expired in october  and the rig commenced a new contract to drill three wells  with possibly additional optional wells  offshore brazil  in january both the pride venezuela and the pride south atlantic were warm stacked after their respective contracts expired 
therefore  operating costs while they were stacked were similar to when they had been working 
since the transfer of two independent leg jackup rigs to nigeria and india under two year contracts in  we have had eight jackup rigs working in international waters outside of the gulf of mexico 
all of these rigs are currently working under long term contracts  of which four are due to expire in these jackup rigs experienced utilization in the idle time was primarily due to two of these rigs undergoing shipyard repairs in additionally  we manage two jackup rigs on behalf of pdvsa in venezuela under contracts that expire in the second quarter of four of our jackup rigs are expected to undergo their planned special periodic surveys during and will be out of service for a combined total of approximately eight months 
we currently expect that the four rigs whose contracts are due to expire in will be recontracted at modestly lower day rates 
we expect revenues and gross margin for our international offshore segment to be lower in than in primarily due to the weaker market conditions in the west african deepwater semisubmersible market and to the pride africa undergoing its special periodic survey 
international land during  our international land segment benefited from improved economic and political stability in argentina  where approximately out of of our worldwide land drilling and workover rigs are located 
operations in had been adversely affected by the economic and political instability in that country 
the argentine peso declined in value against the us dollar following the argentine government s decision to abandon the country s fixed one to one dollar to peso exchange rate at the end of prior to that decision  commercial transactions were freely entered into in either pesos or dollars because the two currencies operated in parity and both could move out of the country freely 
in december  the argentine government imposed restrictions that severely limited dollar withdrawals and exchanges  with the result that as of december   no argentine commercial transactions could be conducted in dollars and there was no exchangeability between the peso and the dollar 
in january  the argentine government announced the creation of a dual exchange rate system in which limited transactions would be settled at an official preferential rate 
when this system proved to be non operational in practice  the government abandoned it in early february and adopted a free market rate system for all new transactions 
the government also mandated that all existing us dollar commercial transactions be redenominated into pesos at the rate of one peso to one dollar 
as a result of this conversion  which followed the earlier devaluation of the peso  we recorded a charge in the fourth quarter of of million before estimated income taxes  and million net of estimated income taxes  to reduce the carrying values of our net monetary assets in argentina  which included our bank accounts  receivables  prepaid expenses  deposits  payables and accrued liabilities 
this amount is reflected as other income expense 
during the first quarter of  we engaged in discussions with all of our argentine customers regarding recovery of losses sustained from the devaluation of accounts receivable and the basis on which new business would be contracted 
we restructured most of our contracts on a basis that we believe limits our exposure to further devaluations 
activity levels have recovered steadily from mid as high oil prices positively impacted our customers cash flows 
the average rate of utilization of our available rig fleet in argentina was in as compared with in as of march   rigs  or of our total fleet of rigs  in argentina were under contract 
venezuela also has been experiencing political  economic and social instability 
a prolonged strike by pdvsa employees that ended in february led to the dismissal of more than  employees by the government 
the recent turmoil in venezuela led to a reduction in our level of operations in that country during the first quarter of since the conclusion of the strike  our rig activity has recovered and currently exceeds the level that existed before the strike 
as of march   we had rigs  or  of our total land based rigs and all four of our offshore rigs in venezuela under contract as compared with only seven rigs at the end of the strike 
exchange controls  together with employee dismissals and reorganization within pdvsa  initially led to a slower rate of collection of our trade receivables  but the rate of collection has improved since early in kazakhstan  the first of two of our large land rigs  which had been earning a standby rate since being accepted by the customer in november  commenced operations on an artificial island in the caspian sea in april  and the second rig commenced operations in july the related contracts required substantial engineering  logistics and construction work to modify  enhance and deploy our rigs in accordance with the customer s specifications 
we received up front fees that we recognized over the rigs respective contract periods  of which million was recognized in and million in both of the rigs were stacked at the onset of the winter period in november and are currently being reactivated 
one of the rigs is expected to work throughout the drilling season 
activity for the second rig depends upon the results of testing of the well it drilled in in africa  activity increased due to a full year of operation for five newly constructed mobile land rigs that started work in chad between december and april under contracts with a unit of exxonmobil with initial terms ranging from five to seven years 
e p services our e p services activity is generated predominately in south america and has benefited from the improved political and economic environment in revenues and gross margins have improved during in argentina due to the commencement of additional integrated services contracts 
activity in this sector has also improved due to the commencement of directional  measurement while drilling and other services onshore brazil and the provision of cementing services offshore mexico  where the services are complementary to our existing drilling operations 
technical services our technical services group has major projects ongoing to design  engineer  manage construction of and commission four deepwater platform drilling rigs  which are being constructed on behalf of two major oil company customers for installation on spars and tension leg platforms 
we also are to provide drilling operations management of the rigs once they have been installed on the platforms 
the first platform drilling rig has been mated with the customer s platform and towed to angola  where it commenced drilling operations in november two of the other deepwater platform rigs are expected to enter into service in the second half of and the remaining rig is expected to enter into service in early during  we recorded loss provisions  included in operating costs  totaling million  or million net of taxes at the us statutory rate  relating to the construction of these deepwater platform rigs 
on all four of these projects  costs are now expected to substantially exceed revenues 
we do not currently intend to enter into any additional lump sum construction contracts for rigs to be owned by others 
much of the increased costs are related to difficulties experienced with two different shipyards 
we terminated our contract with the initial shipyard prior to the completion of the first two rigs 
as a result  we have incurred substantial unplanned costs in completing the construction of the first unit 
we have engaged another shipyard to complete construction of the second rig  and the aggregate costs paid to the initial shipyard and committed and paid to the second shipyard have greatly exceeded budgeted expenditures for the rigs 
in addition  because of the difficulties with the initial shipyard  we are now utilizing shipyards in the asia pacific region for the third and fourth deepwater rig projects 
as a result  the lump sum contracts and anticipated freight costs for these two projects are higher than originally budgeted 
a us shipyard building one of the primary components for the third rig encountered significant financial difficulties  and we have paid costs in excess of amounts initially agreed to provide financial capacity for it to complete a reduced scope of work 
the aggregate costs paid to that shipyard  in addition to the costs associated with the completion of the remaining tasks by newly contracted third parties  as well as transportation and other costs necessitated by the revisions to the project completion plan  have significantly exceeded the budgeted expenditures for the third deepwater rig 
furthermore  based on our experience from the start up of the first rig and on revisions of estimates  we have included increased costs for construction  transportation  commissioning  training and warranties in our estimates of costs to complete the three remaining rigs 
we have commenced arbitration proceedings against the initial shipyard claiming damages of approximately million  and the shipyard has asserted counterclaims against us for damages of approximately million 
we also are in commercial disputes and negotiations with certain equipment vendors and major sub contractors 
we intend to vigorously pursue equitable resolutions with these other parties 
our technical services segment is performing these deepwater platform rig construction projects under lump sum contracts with our customers 
in pricing these contracts  we attempted to accurately estimate our cost to perform the work  including the cost of labor  material and services 
despite these efforts  however  the revenue  cost and gross profit or loss we now expect to realize on these lump sum contracts vary from the originally estimated amounts 
we have experienced cost overruns on these contracts that have adversely impacted our financial results 
currently unforeseen events may result in further cost overruns to complete these projects  which could be material and which would require us to record additional loss provisions in future periods 
such events could include variations in labor and equipment productivity over the remaining term of the contract  unanticipated cost increases  engineering changes  shipyard or systems problems  project management issues  shortages of equipment  materials or skilled labor  unscheduled delays in the delivery of ordered materials and equipment  work stoppages  shipyard unavailability or delays 
we recognize revenues and related costs from our rig construction contracts under the percentage of completion method of accounting using measurements of progress toward completion appropriate for the work performed  such as man hours  costs incurred or physical progress 
accordingly  we review contract price and cost estimates periodically as the work progresses and reflect adjustments in income to recognize income proportionate to the percentage of completion in the case of projects showing an estimated profit at completion and to recognize the entire amount of the loss in the case of projects showing an estimated loss at completion 
to the extent these adjustments result in an increase in previously reported losses or a reduction in or an elimination of previously reported profits with respect to a project  we would recognize a charge against current earnings  which could be material 
although we continually strive to improve our ability to estimate our contract costs and profitability associated with our construction projects  our current estimates may be revised in future periods  and those revisions may be material 
currently  all four of our lump sum construction projects are in a loss position

r  consolidation of variable interest entities 
compared with revenues 
revenues for were million  or  higher than in  due primarily to increased activity for our offshore rigs in mexico  an increase in land drilling and e p services activity due to the recovery in argentina and venezuela  increased activity in kazakhstan  and an increase in revenues recognized related to the design  engineering and construction of deepwater platform rigs by our technical services group 
additionally  one of our international deepwater rigs  the pride south pacific  worked throughout  but was idle from april to november these increases in revenues were partially offset by a decrease in activity in the us sector of the gulf of mexico 
operating costs 
operating costs for were million  or  higher than in due to increased costs  including loss provisions of million  incurred on contracts related to the construction of deepwater platform rigs and costs associated with rigs that operated during that were stacked or being upgraded during additionally  certain operating costs denominated in euros increased due to the strengthening of that currency relative to the dollar 
these increases in costs were partially offset by the favorable impact of the devaluation in venezuela on expenses denominated in its local currency 
operating costs for were reduced by million as a result of changes in estimates of costs accrued in prior periods primarily for contractually required maintenance costs that were not expected to be incurred on two rigs managed by us 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation expense increased by million  or  to million in  from million in  due to incremental depreciation on newly acquired and constructed rigs and other rig refurbishments and upgrades 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  to million for  from million for  due primarily to executive retirement costs of million  increased overhead related to higher activity in argentina  mexico and venezuela  the impact of the decline in the value of the dollar relative to the euro on certain expenses denominated in euros and higher professional fees  insurance and staffing costs 
other income expense 
other expense for decreased by million  or  as compared to interest expense decreased by million due principally to a reduction in the weighted average interest rate of our debt as a result of recent debt refinancings  partly offset by an increase in the average amount of outstanding debt 
additionally  the effective interest rate applicable to our pride angola drillship loan declined after january from the swapped rate of to a rate based on libor plus a margin of 
other income in was comprised of mostly net foreign exchange gains  primarily in venezuela  partly offset by expenses related to the redemption of million principal amount of our senior notes due  including a redemption premium of million and the recognition of million of unamortized deferred financing costs 
other expense in principally comprised a loss of million related to the early extinguishment of approximately million accreted value  net of offering costs  of our zero coupon convertible senior and subordinated debentures 
income tax provision 
our consolidated effective income tax rate for was as compared to for the lower rate for the current period was principally a result of increased income in foreign jurisdictions with low or zero effective tax rates  partly offset by a true up of the provision relating to tax returns for prior periods 
minority interest 
minority interest in increased million  or  as compared to  primarily due to an increase in income from a reduction in interest expense on the pride angola drillship loan 
compared with revenues 
revenues in decreased million  or  as compared to  primarily due to reduced activity and day rates for our jackup and platform rigs in the us gulf of mexico and a reduction in revenues in argentina and venezuela due to reduced activity levels for our land drilling and e p services operations and the devaluation of their currencies 
additionally  one of our seven high specification deepwater rigs  the pride south pacific  which worked throughout  was idle from april to november these decreases were partially offset by a full year of operations for two of our semisubmersible rigs  the pride carlos walter and pride brazil  which commenced working for petrobras under five year contracts in june and july  increased jackup activity in mexico  the commencement of land drilling operations in chad and in kazakhstan and the start up of operations for our technical services division 
operating costs 
operating costs in decreased million  or  as compared to due to decreased costs associated with rigs that were stacked or being upgraded during that operated during and a reduction in operating costs in argentina and venezuela due to reduced activity levels in those countries and the devaluation of their local currencies 
these reductions in costs were partially offset by a full year of operating costs for the pride carlos walter and pride brazil placed into service in june and july  costs related to the commencement of operations in chad and kazakhstan and to the start up of operations of our technical services division 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense increased million  or  in as compared with  due to incremental depreciation on newly acquired and constructed rigs and other rig refurbishments and upgrades 
this increase was partially offset by the impact of a reassessment of residual values and estimated remaining useful lives of certain rigs during the third quarter of and the elimination of amortization of goodwill beginning in january general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses for decreased million  or  as compared with  primarily due to cost savings associated with the closure of duplicate facilities and staffing reductions following our september acquisition of marine 
additionally  the devaluation of the currencies in argentina and venezuela favorably impacted expenses denominated in their local currencies 
pooling and merger costs 
costs totaling million were incurred in connection with the acquisition of marine in september the costs consisted of investment advisory  legal and other professional fees totaling million and costs associated with the closure of duplicate office facilities and employee terminations of million 
other income expense 
other expense in increased million  or  as compared to interest expense increased by million  principally due to interest on indebtedness added in the march acquisition of the remaining ownership of the pride carlos walter and pride brazil and interest on construction financing for the rigs that had been capitalized during their construction 
during  we capitalized million of interest expense in connection with construction projects  as compared to million of interest capitalized in interest income declined million due to lower cash balances available for investment and to a reduction in interest rates 
other expense in principally comprised a loss of million related to the early extinguishment of approximately million accreted value  net of offering costs  of our zero coupon convertible senior and subordinated debentures 
other expense in included foreign exchange losses of million and a million charge in connection with the settlement of a wage related antitrust lawsuit  partially offset by a gain from the sale of surplus assets and a gain of million related to the early extinguishment of approximately million accreted value  net of offering costs  of our zero coupon convertible subordinated debentures due the foreign exchange losses included a pre tax charge of million or million net of estimated income taxes to reduce the carrying value of our net monetary assets in argentina following devaluation of the argentine currency 
income tax provision 
our consolidated effective income tax rate for decreased to from in the higher rate in was principally a result of approximately million of the pooling and merger costs being estimated to be non deductible for us federal income tax purposes 
minority interest 
minority interest in increased million  or  as compared to  primarily due to an increase in net income generated by our owned drillships  the pride africa and pride angola  as a result of decreased downtime and increased performance bonuses received from our customer 
liquidity and capital resources we had net working capital of million and million as of december  and december   respectively 
the decrease in net working capital was attributable primarily to the use of cash to upgrade rigs being contracted to mexico and other international markets from our us gulf of mexico fleet and other capital expenditures in excess of cash generated from operating activities  an increase in the current portion of long term debt as a result of the reclassification of approximately million of senior convertible notes that mature in december from long term to current liabilities and net cash outlays on deepwater platform rig construction projects 
rig construction projects in  we recorded a provision for expected losses on deepwater platform rig construction projects of million 
of this amount  approximately million corresponds to the excess of expected cash outlays after december  to complete the projects over estimated future cash receipts from the projects  which will negatively impact liquidity in and the first six months of capital expenditures additions to property and equipment during totaled million  including million for the upgrade of one large land rig to work in kazakhstan  million for the acquisition of a conventionally moored semisubmersible rig  now the pride mexico  million for the upgrading of five jackup rigs  one platform rig and the pride mexico for contracts in mexico  million for other rig upgrades  refurbishments and reactivations  and approximately million for sustaining capital projects 
since early  we have obtained long term contracts in mexico for jackup rigs  two platform rigs and two semisubmersible rigs 
most of these rigs came from our us gulf of mexico rig fleet and required substantial upgrades to meet international standards and pemex s specific requirements 
the upgrades included expanding the living quarters and adding additional equipment such as extra mud pumps  top drives and higher load capacity cranes 
although we currently expect our capital expenditures in to decrease as our program to upgrade rigs in our us gulf of mexico fleet for international markets winds down  we may be required to upgrade a number of rigs whose contracts expire in in connection with their working under new contracts 
these upgrades could require significant investments of our working capital 
rig mobilization fees mobilization fees received from customers and the costs incurred to mobilize a rig from one geographic area to another  as well as up front fees to modify a rig to meet a customer s specifications  are deferred and amortized over the term of the related drilling contracts 
additionally  we defer costs associated with obtaining special periodic survey certificates from various regulatory bodies in order to operate our offshore rigs 
we amortize these costs over the period of validity of the related certificate 
these up front fees and costs impact liquidity in the period in which the fees are received or the costs incurred  whereas they will impact our statement of operations in the periods during which the deferred revenues and costs are amortized 
deferred revenues and costs that are expected to be amortized in the twelve month period following each balance sheet date are included in other accrued liabilities and current assets  respectively  and deferred revenues and costs that are expected to be amortized after more than twelve months from each balance sheet date are included in other long term liabilities and other assets  respectively 
the amount of up front fees received and the related costs vary from period to period depending upon the nature of new contracts entered into and market conditions then prevailing 
generally  contracts for drilling services in remote locations or contracts that require specialized equipment will provide for higher up front fees than contracts for readily available equipment in major markets 
in  up front fees received included million related to the mobilization of rigs to mexico 
in  up front fees received included million in respect of engineering  logistics and construction work to modify  enhance and deploy two large land rigs for kazakhstan  in accordance with the customer s specifications  and million related to the mobilization of rigs to mexico 
credit facilities in june  we entered into senior secured credit facilities with a group of banks providing for aggregate availability of up to million  consisting of a five year million term loan and a three year million revolving credit facility 
in december  we replaced the term loan with a new million term loan expiring in january and extended the period of the revolving credit agreement until january borrowings under the revolving credit facility are available for general corporate purposes 
we may issue up to million of letters of credit under the facility 
as of december   million of borrowings and an additional million of letters of credit were outstanding under the revolving credit facility 
the facilities are collateralized by two deepwater semisubmersible rigs  the pride north america and the pride south pacific  and jackup rigs 
borrowings under the facilities currently bear interest at variable rates based on libor plus a spread based on the credit rating of the facility or  if unrated  index debt 
as of december   the interest rates on the term loan and revolving credit facility were and  respectively 
the credit facilities contain provisions that limit our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries  with certain exceptions  to pay dividends or make other restricted payments and investments  incur additional debt  create liens  incur dividend or other payment restrictions affecting subsidiaries  consolidate  merge or transfer all or substantially all of our assets  sell assets or subsidiaries  enter into speculative hedging arrangements outside the ordinary course of business  enter into transactions with affiliates  make maintenance capital expenditures and incur long term operating leases 
the credit facilities also require us to comply with specified financial tests  including a ratio of net debt to ebitda  an interest coverage ratio  a ratio of net debt to total capitalization and a minimum net worth 
in  in order to reduce the potential impact of fluctuations in libor  we entered into interest rate agreements that effectively cap the interest rate on million of borrowings under our senior secured term loan at rates from to  plus the applicable spread  and provide a lower limit on rates from to  plus the applicable spread  to march if interest rates fall below the lower limits  interest rates payable increase to rates from to  plus the applicable spread 
the interest rate agreements are marked to market quarterly with the change in fair value recorded as a component of interest expense 
at december   the net value of the instruments was a liability of million 
marking these instruments to market each quarter may increase short term earnings volatility as market perceptions of future interest rate movements change

as of march   the undrawn portion of our senior secured revolving credit facilities was approximately million 
indentures governing our outstanding senior notes due and our senior notes due limit our ability to draw under these facilities to a percentage of consolidated net tangible assets  which  as of march   effectively restricted our ability to borrow approximately million of undrawn capacity under these facilities 
accordingly  only million of these facilities were available to meet our short term liquidity needs

drillship loans we have a ownership interest in and operate the ultra deepwater drillships pride africa and pride angola  which are contracted to work for total exploration production angola sa under contracts which were extended  in december  by an aggregate of ten years  commencing at the end of the contracts current terms in june and may  respectively  each with two one year extension options 
financing for approximately million of the drillships total construction cost of million was provided by a group of banks 
the loans are collateralized by the two drillships and the proceeds from the related drilling contracts and are non recourse to us and the joint owner 
as of december   a total of million was outstanding under these loans 
as a condition of the drillship loans  we entered into interest rate swap and cap agreements 
the agreements effectively fixed the interest rate on the pride africa loan at through december  effectively fixed the interest rate on the pride angola loan at through january and effectively capped the interest rate on the pride angola loan at from february to january after january  the effective interest rate applicable to our pride angola drillship loan declined from the swapped rate of to a rate based on six month libor plus a margin of 
interest expense was approximately million lower  and minority interest was approximately million higher  in than it would have been if we had continued to pay interest on this debt at the swapped rate 
following the extension of the contracts for our two drillships  we are in the process of finalizing an approximate million expansion of the drillship loans 
we expect to complete the increase of the facility early in the second quarter of we expect that approximately million of the proceeds and approximately million of currently restricted cash will be used by the joint venture to repay indebtedness due from the joint venture company to pride and that the balance of the proceeds will be used by the joint venture to repay indebtedness to our joint venture partner and to increase future working capital in the joint venture 
if the transaction is completed  the funds paid to us will be available to reduce our other outstanding debt  including the million of senior convertible notes described below  and for other working capital purposes 
semisubmersible rig financings in march  we increased from to our ownership in a joint venture that constructed two dynamically positioned  deepwater semisubmersible drilling rigs 
the pride carlos walter commenced operations in june  and the pride brazil commenced operations in july these rigs are operating for petrobras under charter and service rendering contracts expiring in june and july  respectively  each with two one year extension options 
the purchase consideration for the interests we did not previously own consisted of approximately million aggregate principal amount of senior convertible notes  which were issued to the brazilian participant in the joint venture  and  shares of our common stock valued at approximately million  which were issued to two investment funds managed by first reserve corporation pursuant to the funds original investment in the joint venture 
the acquisition added to our consolidated balance sheet approximately million of assets represented by the two rigs  approximately million of indebtedness incurred to finance the construction of the rigs and approximately million of senior convertible notes issued to the brazilian participant 
the notes mature in december  bear interest at per annum and are convertible into approximately million shares of our common stock 
the holder of the notes has the right to require us to prepay the notes at any time after july  or before july  to the extent of the amount of any required capital contributions by such holder with respect to the joint venture for the pride portland and the pride rio de janeiro described below under investments 
we have the option to prepay the notes any time after june  in july  we entered into a credit agreement with a group of foreign banks to provide loans totaling up to million to refinance the construction loans for the pride carlos walter and pride brazil 
borrowings under the facility bear interest at rates based on libor plus an applicable margin of to 
principal and interest on the loans are payable semi annually from march through funding under the facility and repayment of the construction loans which had interest rates of per annum was completed in november the loans are collateralized by  among other things  a first priority mortgage on the drilling rigs and assignment of the charters for the rigs 
as required by the lenders under the facility  we entered into interest rate swap and cap agreements with the lenders that capped the interest rate on million of the debt at and which fixed the interest rate on the remainder of the debt at from march through september as of december   there were borrowings of million outstanding under this facility 
in february  we completed the sale and leaseback of the pride south america semisubmersible drilling rig with an unaffiliated leasing trust pursuant to which we received million 
since that time we have been recording activity associated with this transaction as an operating lease in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for leases 
upon evaluation of the provisions of the recently issued financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
r consolidation of variable interest entities fin no 
r  issued in december  it was determined that the leasing trust would qualify for consolidation as a variable interest entity and that we were the primary beneficiary  as defined 
pursuant to the recommendation of the fasb  in the fourth quarter of we adopted the consolidation provisions of fin no 
r retroactively by restating previously issued financial statements for comparability purposes to consolidate the leasing trust s assets and liabilities  which comprise the pride south america rig and the associated note payable  from inception of the lease 
as of december   the carrying amount of the note payable was approximately million 
contractual obligations as of december   we had approximately billion in total assets and billion of long term debt and capital lease obligations 
although we do not expect that our level of total indebtedness will have a material adverse impact on our financial position  results of operations or liquidity in future periods  it may limit our flexibility in certain areas 
please read risk factors we may be considered highly leveraged 
our significant debt levels and debt agreement restrictions may limit our flexibility in obtaining additional financing and in pursuing other business opportunities in item of this annual report 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december  payments due by period less than after contractual obligations total year years years years in millions principal payments on long term debt  interest payments on long term debt capital lease obligations operating lease obligations deepwater platform rig construction obligations retirement obligations total   does not include unconditional purchase commitments to third parties for materials  goods and services incurred in the normal course of business 
investments in joint ventures we own a equity interest in a joint venture company that is currently completing construction of two dynamically positioned  deepwater semisubmersible drilling rigs  the pride portland and the pride rio de janeiro formerly referred to as amethyst and amethyst 
the pride rio de janeiro is undergoing sea trials in the caribbean sea and the pride portland is expected to exit the shipyard in maine in may the joint venture company has financed of the cost of construction of these rigs through credit facilities  with repayment of the borrowings under those facilities guaranteed by the united states maritime administration marad 
advances under the credit facilities  which totaled approximately million as of march   are being provided without recourse to any of the joint venture owners at a weighted average fixed interest rate of 
the remaining of the cost of construction is being provided by the joint venture company from equity contributions that have been made by the joint venture partners 
in addition  the joint venture partners have agreed to provide equity contributions to finance all of the estimated million of incremental costs associated with upgrading both rigs to a water depth capability of  meters from the original design of approximately  meters  of which our share would be approximately million 
we expect that the joint venture partners will have to make additional capital contributions to fund the project through the sea trial stage for each rig or  alternatively  will have to provide acceptable guarantees to marad to permit the required further draws to become available under the marad guaranteed credit facilities 
if the funding is made by additional capital contributions  we expect that our proportionate share would be approximately million 
the capital contributions are likely to be required during the second quarter of through december   our equity contributions to the joint venture totaled million  including capitalized interest of million and contributions of million in connection with the water depth upgrades 
if either joint venture partner failed to make its capital contribution and the other joint venture partner failed to cover the obligations  a default would occur under the fixed rate obligations guaranteed by marad 
marad would be entitled to foreclose on the mortgages related to the pride portland and the pride rio de janeiro and take possession of the two rigs 
the pride portland and pride rio de janeiro are being built to operate under long term contracts with petrobras  however  petrobras has given notice of cancellation of those contracts for late delivery 
based on current demand for deepwater drilling rigs  we believe that petrobras or another customer will employ the pride portland and pride rio de janeiro under new or amended contracts 
there can be no assurance  however  that either the pride portland or the pride rio de janeiro will be contracted to petrobras or to any other customer 
if no contract is obtained before the rigs complete their sea trials  the rigs will be stacked 
in this case  the joint venture partners would need to advance further funds to the joint venture company to allow it to pay stacking costs as well as principal and interest payments on the debt as they become due since the joint venture company would have no alternative source of funds to allow it to make such payments 
initial interest and debt service payments in respect of construction debt for the two rigs are expected to total approximately million during  of which our share would be million 
we have a interest in basafojagu hs inc  a company incorporated in liberia that has capital lease obligations in respect of the al baraka tender assisted drilling rig 
the majority shareholder is a subsidiary of a major saudi arabian banking and industrial group  and the two lessor banks are members of that same group 
we entered into a long term management agreement with basafojagu to manage and operate the rig 
we also provided guarantees for our share  or approximately million at december   of basafojagu s lease obligations 
basafojagu is in arrears in payment of its lease obligations 
in january  we entered into a purchase option that expires on may  to acquire the tender barge and associated derrick set for aggregate consideration of million 
if we exercise our option  we will be released of all obligations under the guarantees and under the lease and management agreements 
we currently expect that we will exercise our purchase option 
other sources and uses of cash we have a direct stock purchase plan  which provides a means for investors to purchase shares of our common stock without paying brokerage commissions or service charges 
during and  we sold approximately million and  shares  respectively  of common stock under this plan for net proceeds of million and million  respectively 
no shares were sold under the plan in as of december   million of our cash balances  which amount is included in restricted cash  consisted of funds held in trust in connection with our drillship and semisubmersible loans and our limited recourse collateralized term loans and  accordingly  was not available for our use 
the amount as of march  was approximately million 
management believes that the cash and cash equivalents on hand  together with the cash generated from our operations and borrowings under our credit facilities  will be adequate to fund normal ongoing capital expenditures  working capital and debt service requirements for the foreseeable future 
we may redeploy additional assets to more active regions in if we have the opportunity to do so on attractive terms  however  we expect fewer opportunities for redeployments than in and from time to time  we have one or more bids outstanding for contracts that could require significant capital expenditures and mobilization costs 
we expect to fund project opportunities primarily through a combination of working capital  cash flow from operations and full or limited recourse debt or equity financing 
in addition  we may consider from time to time opportunities to dispose of certain assets when we believe the capital could be more effectively deployed to reduce debt or for other purposes  and we continue to discuss with potential buyers the possible sale of certain assets 
in addition to the matters described in this liquidity and capital resources section  please read business environment and outlook for additional matters that may have a material impact on our liquidity 
tax matters we have a us deferred tax asset of million relating to us net operating loss nol carryforwards 
due to the acquisition of marine in september  certain nol carryforwards are subject to limitation under sections and of the us internal revenue code 
we have determined that such limitations should not affect our ability to realize the benefits associated with such nol carryforwards 
the us nol carryforwards total million and expire in through we estimate that we will generate sufficient us taxable income of approximately million prior to the expiration dates of these nol carryforwards to fully utilize them 
historically  the difference between financial income loss and taxable income loss is primarily due to accelerated tax depreciation 
tax depreciation in excess of book depreciation for the years ended december    and was million  million  and million  respectively 
the argentine nol carryforwards were utilized in the current year due to a merger between the entity with the losses and our profitable argentine entity 
the profitable entity had sufficient income to utilize the entire amount of the deferred tax asset 
we provide an allowance for the deferred tax assets in certain taxing jurisdictions because the benefits of the net operating losses will be realized only if we enter into additional profitable contracts in those jurisdictions 
in we had an increase of in the us statutory rate for foreign taxes due to the following for an adjustment to prior year deferred tax assets for foreign losses  and for current year foreign taxes in excess of us statutory rate 
in we had an increase of in the us statutory rate for the change in valuation allowance due to an adjustment to prior year allowances on the deferred tax asset for foreign losses as explained above that will not be utilized in future years 
we also had a decrease in the us statutory rate for the following tax increase due to estimated us tax at december  below the actual tax expense on the us tax return as filed and a increase to us tax for other permanent items 
in we had a decrease of in the us statutory rate for foreign taxes due to the following for previously omitted deferred tax assets for foreign losses  for current year deferred tax assets created by mexico losses  and for current year foreign taxes in excess of us statutory rate 
in we had an increase of in the us statutory rate for the change in valuation allowance due to the following for previously omitted allowances on the deferred tax asset for foreign losses as explained above that will not be utilized in future years  for the current year allowance on mexico tax losses described above that will not be utilized in future years  and decrease for the partial reversal of the allowance on french tax losses from rig rental income in france from russia and kazakhstan contracts that extend into management s assumptions regarding these tax provisions  as described herein  were consistent with those of prior periods 
critical accounting policies we consider policies concerning property and equipment and rig construction contracts to have the most significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
property and equipment are carried at original cost or adjusted net realizable value  as applicable 
property and equipment held and used by us are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
indicators of possible impairment include extended periods of idle time and or an inability to contract specific assets or groups of assets  such as a specific type of drilling rig  or assets in a specific geographical region 
however  the drilling  workover and related service industries in which we operate are highly cyclical and it is not unusual to find that assets that were idle  underutilized or contracted at sub economic rates for significant periods of time resume activity at economic rates when market conditions improve 
additionally  most of our assets are mobile  and we may mobilize rigs from one market to another to improve utilization or realize higher day rates 
we estimate the future undiscounted cash flows of the affected assets to determine the recoverability of carrying amounts 
in general  analyses are based on expected costs  utilization and day rates for the estimated remaining useful lives of the asset or group of assets being assessed 
asset impairment evaluations are by  nature  highly subjective 
they involve expectations about future cash flows generated by our assets  and reflect management s assumptions and judgments regarding future industry conditions and their effect on future utilization levels  day rates and costs 
the use of different estimates and assumptions could result in materially different carrying values of our assets and could materially affect our results of operations 
we account for rig construction contracts using the percentage of completion method 
in applying this method we estimate periodically for each project the profit or loss at completion 
this involves estimating future costs and revenues as well as determining the amount of costs incurred and revenues earned to date 
although estimating future revenues may require the exercise of a high degree of judgment  for example where there have been changes to the scope of work that have not been approved by the customer  the most judgmental areas often involve estimates of future costs 
this judgment is most critical in construction projects that are expected to show a loss at completion since any change in estimate will immediately effect the amount of the recorded loss provision 
in projects that are expected to show a profit  the judgment would only impact the results in proportion to the estimate of percentage complete 
with our current construction projects  we have had to make particularly difficult judgments and estimates concerning the likely outcome  or range of outcomes  of a number of commercial disputes with shipyards  equipment vendors  major sub contractors and others 
certain of these disputes involve claims and counterclaims and may involve either binding arbitration or legal proceedings 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to certain market risks arising from the use of financial instruments in the ordinary course of business 
these risks arise primarily as a result of potential changes in the fair market value of financial instruments that would result from adverse fluctuation in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates as discussed below 
we entered into these instruments other than for trading purposes 
we incorporate by reference in response to this item the information set forth in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report 
interest rate risk 
we are exposed to interest rate risk through our convertible and fixed rate long term debt 
we have entered into agreements as required by the lenders under our drillship and semisubmersible loan agreements that effectively fixed or capped the interest rate on such debt 
additionally  during  we entered into interest rate agreements that effectively capped the interest rate on million of borrowings under our senior secured term loan 
these latter interest rate agreements are marked to market quarterly with the change in fair value recorded as a component of interest expense 
as of december   the net value of these instruments was a liability of million 
as of december   we held interest rate swap and cap agreements covering million of our long term debt 
the fair market value of fixed rate debt will increase as prevailing interest rates decrease 
the fair value of our long term debt is estimated based on quoted market prices where applicable  or based on the present value of expected cash flows relating to the debt discounted at rates currently available to us for long term borrowings with similar terms and maturities 
the estimated fair value of our long term debt as of december  and was approximately  million and  million  respectively  which is more than its carrying value as of december  and of  million and  million  respectively 
a hypothetical decrease in interest rates relative to market interest rates at december  would increase the fair market value of our long term debt at december  by approximately million 
foreign currency exchange rate risk 
we operate in a number of international areas and are involved in transactions denominated in currencies other than us dollars  which expose us to foreign exchange rate risk 
we utilize forward exchange and option contracts  local currency borrowings and the payment structure of customer contracts to selectively reduce our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations in connection with monetary assets  liabilities and cash flows denominated in certain foreign currencies 
we had no unrealized losses as of december  on forward exchange contracts and option contracts based on quoted market prices of comparable instruments 
the estimated unrealized loss on our forward exchange and option contracts as of december  was approximately million 
we do not hold or issue forward exchange contracts  option contracts or other derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes
