item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition general executive summary the company s oilfield service businesses generally performed well in  but the strength of these businesses was overshadowed by weak results in the company s capital equipment businesses 
in particular  results of the drilling equipment group suffered from softening demand and cost overruns on a large rig fabrication project 
during  the company s service oriented businesses benefited from rising levels of oilfield activity in several important markets  including north american land drilling  mexico  the middle east and the far east 
these benefits were somewhat offset by slightly declining oilfield activity in other key markets  including the us gulf of mexico  the north sea and venezuela 
demand for the company s coiled tubing and fiberglass tubing for oilfield applications strengthened in the company generally experienced declining market conditions during in its businesses that sell capital equipment to other oilfield service companies  including drilling equipment  solids control equipment  and rig instrumentation equipment 
sales of coiled tubing and wireline equipment were modestly improved  but backlog for the coiled tubing and wireline products group turned down at year end 
backlog and revenue for drilling equipment generally trended down throughout looking forward  the company believes worldwide drilling activity should remain strong in  led by north america  latin america and the middle east  and that its oilfield service businesses should generally continue to perform well 
however  offshore drilling activity  particularly in the gulf of mexico and the north sea  continues to be very slow and has not yet shown signs of improvement 
additionally  the company expects that the market for premium tubulars  which is dependent in part on the level of drilling critical wells ie  high pressure  high temperature  deep and or offshore wells  will remain slow in premium tubulars for critical wells are more likely to be coated or inspected by the company than conventional tubulars for shallower  onshore drilling because the cost of tubular failures is much higher for critical wells 
also  the company expects that the market for new drillpipe will remain slow in  due primarily to an overhang of drillpipe in the market currently 
this affects the company s tubular coating business because most new drillpipe is coated before it is placed into service 
the company does not expect the market for capital equipment to strengthen significantly in  and foresees few new drilling rigs being fabricated in in view of the declining revenue and backlog for the drilling equipment group  the company has begun a significant restructuring of the group  as detailed below  to lower its overhead 
additionally  the company has decided to exit the rig fabrication business  which it entered by acquiring morinoak international ltd 
mil in september the company expects that the focus of the drilling equipment group in will be on downsizing operations  moving manufacturing to more cost efficient locations  launching new products targeting the land drilling contractor market  providing units to upgrade existing drilling rigs  and continuing the group s emphasis on aftermarket spares and services business 
operating environment overview the company s results are dependent on among other things  the level of worldwide oil and gas drilling  well remediation activity  the prices of oil and gas  capital spending by other oilfield service companies and drilling contractors  pipeline maintenance activity  and worldwide oil and gas inventory levels 
key industry indicators for the past three years include the following v v active drilling rigs us canada international worldwide active workover rigs us canada north america west texas intermediate crude prices per barrel natural gas prices mbtu averages for the years indicated 
the following table details the us  canadian  and international rig activity and west texas intermediate oil prices for the three years ended december  on a quarterly basis logo source rig count baker hughes  inc www

oil and natural gas prices rose sharply in compared to the average price per barrel of west texas intermediate crude was  an increase of over the average for natural gas prices were per mbtu  an increase of compared to the average 
high commodity prices led to the recent improvement in us  canadian  and international rig activity  which began in the second half of  and continued throughout us  canadian  and international rig activity increased   and  respectively  for the full year in compared to on a combined basis  worldwide rig activity increased in compared to the prior year average 
however  rig activity in several key operating locations including the gulf of mexico and north sea have remained sluggish 
the gulf of mexico rig activity declined from an average of rigs in to rigs in  while the north sea average rig count dropped from a average of rigs to an average of rigs in us rig activity at february  was at  rigs  compared to  rigs at december  the company believes that current industry projections are forecasting commodity prices to remain strong as compared to recent years  and  as a result  us and international drilling rig activity is expected to continue to be strong 
however  numerous events could significantly alter these projections including political tensions in the middle east  the acceleration or deceleration of the recovery of the us and world economies  a build up in world oil inventory levels  or numerous other events or circumstances 
drilling equipment group restructuring and mil impairment charge drilling equipment group revenue declined million in revenue was million in compared to million in the group s operating profit was down million  from million in to million in operating profit as a percent of revenue declined from in to in the decline in the drilling equipment group operating profit reflects in part the softening market for capital drilling equipment in and into  as well as adverse movements in the company s mix of drilling equipment unit sales rig floor equipment and handling tools declined  while pressure control equipment sales increased 
as a result of its lowered outlook for rig equipment sales  particularly in the offshore rig construction market  the company has undertaken a significant restructuring of its drilling equipment group 
plans to reduce its technical and administrative workforce by approximately employees are underway  and should be completed by the end of the second quarter the company is consolidating certain sales  engineering and administrative functions of the drilling equipment group from california into houston  and is moving certain manufacturing operations between its plants to improve efficiency 
the company expects to save approximately million annually in drilling equipment group overhead expenses  and expects to recognize severance  relocation  and facility consolidation charges in the range of million to million related to these measures during the first half of the significant decline in drilling equipment group operating profit was also caused by charges taken by its rig fabrication division  mil 
in  mil recognized million in anticipated losses on a turnkey contract to construct a million land drilling rig for the middle east  and other operating losses of million 
the million loss on the contract was due to the structural complexity of the rig  which required substantially more material  fabrication  engineering and design work than originally planned  underestimation of rig up and commissioning costs  delays in the project which resulted in late delivery penalties  and adverse foreign currency exchange movements with the weakening of the us dollar 
due to this poor financial performance  the company has decided to exit the rig fabrication business 
acquired in september of for million  mil designs  fabricates and assembles structural drilling rig components such as masts  derricks and substructures 
the acquisition of mil was intended to expand the company s sales of drilling equipment by packaging the equipment with rigs fabricated by mil 
however  the company determined that its integrated packages of drilling equipment and structural rig components bore too much risk  and failed to produce a sufficient economic return  and therefore  the company decided to exit the rig fabrication business and close the mil facility in great yarmouth  england 
as a consequence of this decision  the company recognized a charge of million related to goodwill and fixed asset impairments in the fourth quarter of the combined effect of the impairment charge and losses from operations on earnings per share was a loss of per share 
the company expects to incur additional exit costs and operating losses in related to the winding up of the mil business 
the mil operation is expected to be accounted for as a discontinued operation upon its shut down in the following summarizes the operations of mil for the years ending december    and in thousands 
revenue operating income loss net income loss from mil operations results of operations year ended december  vs year ended december  revenue 
the company s total revenue was  million in  an increase of million over revenue of  million 
the increase was due mainly to the acquisition of ico s oilfield services business in september and increases in the company s services business due to the increase in rig activity discussed above 
the company s tubular services business increased million and drilling services business increased million in compared to in addition  the company s coiled tubing and wireline business was also positively impacted by the increase in activity as revenue increased million in compared to these results were offset to some extent by a decrease in drilling equipment group revenue of million in compared to  which was primarily related to a decline in the sale of drilling units 
the following table summarizes the company s revenue by operating segment in and in thousands variance drilling equipment group tubular services drilling services coiled tubing wireline products total revenue revenue from the company s drilling equipment group in was million  a decrease of million compared to the decrease was due to declines in shipments of capital equipment  including rig floor equipment  and handling tools of million 
the company shipped top drives in compared to top drives shipped in these declines were offset by increases in capital equipment sales of pressure control equipment of million and increases in aftermarket revenue including spares  service  repair and rental of million 
new orders for were million compared to million for the same period of  while backlog at december  was million compared to million at december  the decline in orders and backlog was reflective of fewer new rig construction projects and reduced capital investment in rig upgrades and refurbishments by drilling contractors in compared to in accordance with industry practice  orders and commitments generally are cancelable by customers at any time 
revenue from the company s tubular services was million in  an increase of million over results 
acquisitions for and resulted in an estimated incremental increase in revenue of approximately million in compared to the largest acquisition was ico s oilfield services business on september  excluding the impact from these acquisitions  tubular services revenue would have increased million in compared to the prior year 
the increase in us  canada  and worldwide oilfield activity resulted in greater non acquisition revenue from the company s inspection  coating  and fiberglass operations in these increases were slightly offset by lower capital sales from the company s mill equipment sales operations and lower revenue from pipeline services 
revenue from the company s drilling services was million in  an increase of million compared to results 
the increase was primarily driven by greater revenue from the company s us and canadian instrumentation and solid control businesses  which increased a combined million in compared to the us and canadian rig activity was up and  respectively  in compared to these increases were partially offset by lower revenue from the company s solids control and instrumentation capital equipment sales divisions  and lower revenue from venezuela operations which was a result of economic and political troubles in that country 
coiled tubing and wireline products revenue was million in  an increase of million in compared to the increase was primarily due to greater revenue from company s quality tubing operations  which were up million in as a result of the increased oilfield activity discussed above 
in addition  the company s coiled tubing and wireline business was up million in revenue also benefiting from increased activity 
coiled tubing and wireline products backlog at december  was million  a decline of million compared to december  gross profit 
gross profit was million of revenue in compared to million of revenue in the increase in gross profit dollars was due to the million increase in revenue 
the decrease in gross profit percent was due to lower margins in the drilling equipment group discussed above and operating losses related to the mil operations 
selling  general  and administrative costs

the increase was due primarily to the acquisitions in and in addition  the company s insurance costs  legal expenses  and fringe benefit costs were also greater in than as a percent of revenue  selling  general  and administrative costs were of revenue in compared to of revenue in research and engineering costs 
research and engineering costs were million in  an increase of million compared to results 
the increase was spread out between all four major operating segments and was primarily related to new product development and integration  and acquisitions completed in and merger  transaction  impairment and litigation costs 
merger  transaction  impairment  and litigation costs were million and million for december  and  respectively 
the impairment charge of million was related to goodwill and fixed asset impairments associated with the mil operations in the fourth quarter the costs consisted of two components  million of transaction costs associated with the acquisition of substantially all of the oilfield services business of ico see note of notes to consolidated financial statements and million of severance costs 
operating profit 
operating profit was million for compared to million for excluding merger  transaction  impairment and litigation costs  operating profit was million of revenue for compared to million of revenue for the operating profit included losses from the mil operations excluding impairment charges of million 
excluding mil operations  operating profit was million  or of revenue in the decline in operating profit percent in compared to was due to weak margins in the drilling equipment group discussed above 
operating profit percents in drilling services and coiled tubing and wireline both improved in  while tubular services was approximately flat as compared to interest expense 
interest expense was million in compared to million in the increase in interest expense was due to greater average outstanding debt balances as a result of the million senior notes issued in november other expense income 
other expense includes interest income  foreign exchange losses and gains  and other expense income 
net other expense was million in compared to million in the improvement in other expense in was primarily due to million in foreign exchange losses in compared to a million gain in the losses occurred in the third quarter of due mostly to foreign exchange losses in venezuela  the second quarter of due mostly to the weakening of the us dollar against the euro dollar and uk pound sterling  and the first quarter due mostly to foreign exchange losses in argentina as a result of the devaluation of the argentine peso in the first quarter of provision for income taxes 
the company recorded a tax provision of million of pre tax income and million of pre tax income for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the tax provision was higher than the domestic tax rate of due to deductions not allowed under domestic and foreign jurisdictions related to the asset impairment charge on its investment in its drilling rig fabrication business  and to foreign earnings subject to tax rates differing from domestic rates 
the company partially offset these increases by the benefit from its utilization of the extraterritorial income provisions  increased research and development credits and the resolution of a prior year tax audit 
the european union has put into place a process to begin imposing sanctions on us exports effective march   if congress does not repeal the extraterritorial tax regime eti 
there are proposals before the us senate and us house of representatives  but no resolution has been determined as of february the company has utilized the eti regime in prior years in reducing its us tax attributable to its export sales 
the repeal of the eti regime would have an adverse impact on the net income in the range of million to million on the projected export sales by the company 
it is not determinable the impact of the export sanctions would have on the company s operating profit 
net income 
net income was million and million for and  respectively 
the decrease in net income was due to the factors discussed above 
year ended december  vs year ended december  revenue

acquisitions for and resulted in an estimated incremental increase in revenue of approximately million in compared to the largest acquisition was ico s oilfield services business on september  excluding the impact from these acquisitions  tubular services revenue would have declined million in compared to the major reason for the non acquisition decline was lower rig activity in the us  which was down in compared to this resulted in a decrease of million in us inspection and coating revenue excluding the impact from acquisitions 
in addition  lower rig activity resulted in a million decline in revenue from the company s fiberglass operations in compared to excluding the estimated impact of million in revenue from acquisitions 
revenue from the company s drilling services was million in  a decrease of million compared to results 
excluding the estimated impact from acquisitions  revenue would have been down million in the decline was mainly due to a million decline in north america solids control revenue and a million decline in latin america revenue 
the decline in north america solids control revenue was due to a drop in north america rig activity 
lower latin america revenue was concentrated primarily in venezuela and argentina as a result of economic and political troubles in those countries 
in addition  the company s instrumentation revenue decreased million in due to the decrease in worldwide drilling activity  primarily in north america 
coiled tubing and wireline products revenue was million in  an increase of million in compared to the increase was due to the acquisition of three companies in  which contributed estimated incremental revenue of approximately million in compared to excluding the estimated impact of these acquisitions  coiled tubing and wireline products revenue would have decreased million in compared to the lower market activity resulted in lower revenue in the company s coiled tubing related products 
coiled tubing and wireline products backlog at december  was million  a decline of million compared to december  further reflecting the declining market activity in however  sequentially from the third quarter of  backlog increased million due to the recent increase in market activity discussed above

in addition  cash was provided by an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of million 
the increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities was due to an increase in insurance accruals  employee benefit accruals  and acquisition related accruals 
these items were offset by an increase in inventory of million  and an increase in accounts receivable of million 
the increase in inventory was related primarily to the construction of a land drilling rig for a customer  as well as an increase in drilling equipment and coiled tubing wireline inventory 
the increase in accounts receivable was due to an increase in days sales outstanding  which was up from days outstanding at december  to days outstanding at december for the fiscal year ended december   cash used for investing activities was million compared to for the same period of the company used approximately million of cash for acquisitions during and cash paid in for acquisitions

critical accounting policies and estimates in preparing the financial statements  we make assumptions  estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported 
we periodically evaluate our estimates and judgments related to bad debts and inventory obsolescence  impairments of long lived assets  including goodwill and our reserves for product warranty claims 
note to the consolidated financial statements contains the accounting policies governing each of these matters 
our estimates are based on historical experience and on our future expectations that we believe are reasonable  the combination of these factors forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results are likely to differ from our current estimates and those differences may be material 
reserves for bad debts are determined on a specific identification basis when we believe that the required payment of specific amounts owed to us is not probable 
a substantial portion of the company s revenues come from international oil companies  international oilfield service companies  and government owned or government controlled oil companies 
therefore  the company has significant receivables in many foreign jurisdictions 
if worldwide oil and gas drilling activity or changes in economic conditions in foreign jurisdictions deteriorate  our customers may be unable to repay these receivables  and additional allowances could be required 
reserves for inventory obsolescence are determined based on our historical usage of inventory on hand as well as our future expectations related to requirements to provide spare parts for our substantial installed base and new products 
changes in worldwide oil and gas drilling activity and the development of new technologies associated with the drilling industry could require the company to record additional allowances to reduce the value of inventory to the lower of its cost or net realizable value 
accruals for warranty claims are provided based on historical experience at the time of sale 
most product warranties cover periods from one to three years 
our accruals for warranty claims are affected by the size of our installed base of products currently under warranty  as well as new products delivered to the market 
if actual experience proves different from historical estimates  changes to the company s provision rates may be required 
long lived assets  which include property and equipment  goodwill  and identified intangible assets comprise a significant amount of the company s total assets 
the company makes judgments and estimates in conjunction with the carrying value of these assets  including amounts to be capitalized  depreciation and amortization methods and useful lives 
additionally  the carrying values of these assets are reviewed for impairment periodically or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss is recorded in the period in which it is determined that the carrying amount is not recoverable 
this requires the company to make long term forecasts of its future revenues and costs related to the assets subject to review 
these forecasts require assumptions about demand for the company s products and services  future market conditions and technological developments 
significant and unanticipated changes to these assumptions or the intended use of these assets could require a provision for impairment in a future period 
pensions and other postretirement benefits the company sponsors several pension and postretirement plans 
the company has two defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all of its employees in germany german plans  a plan providing healthcare and life insurance benefits to certain executives and former retired employees retiree medical plan and a supplemental executive retirement plan serp 
these plans are unfunded 
see additional disclosure in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company accounts for its defined benefit pension plans and its nonpension postretirement benefit plans using actuarial models required by statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions and sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions  respectively 
a significant element in determining the company s expense in accordance with sfas no 
and sfas no 
is the discount rate 
the discount rate is an estimate of the current interest rate at which the pension and postretirement liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year 
in estimating this rate  the company looks to rates of return on high quality  fixed income investments currently available and expected to be available during the period to maturity of the pension and postretirement benefit obligation 
changes in the discount rates over the past three years have not materially affected pension expense and the net effect of changes in the discount rate  as well as the net effect of other changes in actuarial assumptions and experience  have been deferred in accordance with sfas no 
and sfas no 
the company s discount rates ranged from to at december  and for  the company does not expect any changes in its discount rates 
additionally  the health care cost trend rate can have a significant effect on the company s expense for the retiree medical plan as reported in accordance with sfas no 
the company  in conjunction with its actuary reviews external data and its own historical trends for health care costs to determine the health care cost trend rates 
the assumed health care cost trend rate for is and is assumed to decrease gradually to for and remain at that level thereafter 
an increase of the health care cost trend rates by one percentage point each year would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of december  by  and the aggregate of the service and interest cost components of net periodic postretirement benefit cost for by  pension and postretirement benefit expense for these plans was million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
cash payments for these plans were million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas which addresses financial accounting and reporting costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
previously  a liability for an exit cost was recognized at the date of an entity s commitment to an exit plan 
the provisions of this statement were effective for exit or disposal activities that were initiated after december  in january  fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin was issued 
fin requires the consolidation of each variable interest entity vie in which an enterprise absorbs a majority of the entity s expected losses or receives a majority of the entity s expected residual returns  or both  as a result of ownership  contractual or other financial interests in the entity 
the fasb has delayed the implementation date of fin to the first interim period ending after march  the company does not believe the adoption of fin will have a material effect on the company s financial statements 
in december  president bush signed into law the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of the act 
the act expanded medicare to include  for the first time  coverage for prescription drugs 
the company expects that this legislation will eventually reduce some of the costs for the company s retiree medical plan 
the company is awaiting guidance from various governmental and regulatory agencies concerning the requirements that must be met to obtain these cost reductions  as well as the manner in which such savings should be measured 
because of the various uncertainties related to the company s response to this legislation and the appropriate accounting methodology for this event  the company elected to defer financial recognition of this legislation until the fasb issues final accounting guidance 
when issued  that final guidance could require the company to change previously reported information 
this deferral is permitted under fasb staff position no 
fas  accounting and disclosure requirements related to the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of other the company has executed acquisitions over the past few years as part of its growth strategy 
the company seeks  where possible  to effect consolidation cost savings by integrating acquired businesses with its own 
as a consequence  the financial results of acquired businesses may not be separable from the company s existing businesses  and therefore may not be readily measurable 
accordingly  the impact of acquisitions on the company s overall financial results are difficult to measure 
where the company provides estimates of incremental revenue and operating profit from acquired businesses  these estimates are based upon management s judgment 
factors affecting future operating results this annual report contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of the forward looking statements are those that do not state historical facts and are inherently subject to risk and uncertainties 
the forward looking statements contained herein are based on current expectations and entail various risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
such risks and uncertainties are set forth below 
the oil and gas industry in which the company participates historically has experienced significant volatility 
demand for the company s services and products depends primarily upon the number of oil and gas wells being drilled  the depth and drilling conditions of such wells  the volume of production  the number of well completions  the capital expenditures of other oilfield service companies and drilling contractors  the level of pipeline construction and maintenance expenditures  and the level of workover activity 
drilling and workover activity can fluctuate significantly in a short period of time  particularly in the united states and canada 
the willingness of oil and gas operators to make capital expenditures for the exploration and production of oil and natural gas will continue to be influenced by numerous factors over which the company has no control  including the prevailing and expected market prices for oil and natural gas 
such prices are impacted by  among other factors  the ability of the members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec to maintain price stability through voluntary production limits  the level of production of non opec countries  worldwide demand for oil and gas  general economic and political conditions  costs of exploration and production  availability of new leases and concessions  and governmental regulations regarding  among other things  environmental protection  taxation  price controls and product allocations 
in addition  political tensions in the middle east may have an impact on market prices for oil and natural gas 
no assurance can be given as to the level of future oil and gas industry activity or demand for the company s services and products 
the company s foreign operations  which include significant operations in canada  europe  africa  the far east  the middle east and latin america  are subject to the risks normally associated with conducting business in foreign countries  including foreign exchange fluctuations  and uncertain political and economic environments  which may limit or disrupt markets  restrict the movement of funds or result in the deprivation of contract rights or the taking of property without fair compensation 
government owned petroleum companies located in some of the countries in which the company operates have adopted policies or are subject to governmental policies giving preference to the purchase of goods and services from companies that are majority owned by local nationals 
as a result of such policies  the company relies on joint ventures  license arrangements and other business combinations with local nationals in these countries 
in addition  political considerations may disrupt the commercial relationship between the company and such government owned petroleum companies 
there can be no assurances that such problems will not be material in the future 
the company s solids control  inspection and coating services routinely involve the handling of waste materials  some of which may be considered to be hazardous wastes 
the company is subject to numerous local  state and federal laws and regulations concerning the containment and disposal of materials  pursuant to which the company has been required to incur compliance and clean up costs  which were not substantial in   and compliance with environmental laws and regulations due to currently unknown circumstances or developments  however  could result in substantial costs and have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
a significant portion of the company s recent growth in revenues and profitability has been the result of its acquisition program 
the company s future operating results will be impacted by the company s ability to identify additional attractive acquisition opportunities  consummate such acquisitions on favorable terms and successfully integrate the operations of the acquired businesses with those of the company 
many of the company s oilfield markets for equipment  products and services are predominately priced in us dollars  although some portion may be in local currencies 
the company conducts manufacturing and service operations through foreign locations  and  as a result  has significant costs denominated in local currencies that often exceed the mix of local currency revenue 
consequently  the recent weakening of the us dollar against the euro  the british pound and other currencies has resulted in higher costs of sales and services for some of the company s business in england  the eec and other areas  when these costs are converted to us dollars 
this is partially but not completely offset by higher foreign currency revenue  when converted to us dollars 
overall  the weakening of the us dollar reduced the company s operating profits and margins 
this effect on consolidated operating income is offset somewhat by the company s position in canada  where a portion of its costs are in us dollars  but nearly all of its revenues are in canadian dollars 
as a result  the company s canadian operations have benefited from the weakening us dollar 
the net impact of the weaker us dollar compared to foreign currencies where the company operates including the euro  british pound  norwegian kroner  canadian dollar and singapore dollar is expected to adversely impact operating profit in the range of million to million in compared to based on current exchange rates 
further adverse foreign currency exchange rate movements could result in additional operating profit declines 
item a 
quantitative qualitative disclosure about market risk the company conducts operations in various countries around the world and is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and changes in foreign currency rates 
the company does not believe that it has a material exposure to market risk 
the company does not enter into interest rate or foreign currency transactions for speculative purposes 
interest rates the company has historically managed its exposure to interest rate changes by using a combination of fixed rate debt  variable rate debt  and interest swap and collar agreements in its total debt portfolio 
at december   the company had million of outstanding debt 
fixed rate debt included million of the notes at a fixed interest rate of  million of the notes at a fixed interest rate of and million of the notes at a fixed interest rate of 
as of december   the company had three interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of million associated with the company s notes 
under this agreement  the company receives interest at a fixed rate of and pays interest at a floating rate of six month libor plus a weighted average spread of approximately 
the swap agreements will settle semi annually and will terminate in february an increase in outside market interest rates of would result in a million increase to the company s annual interest expense 
foreign currency exchange rates with respect to foreign currency fluctuations  the company uses natural hedges to minimize the effect of rate fluctuations 
when natural hedges are not sufficient  the company may enter into forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge significant transactions for periods consistent with the underlying risk 
the company had no forward foreign exchange contracts outstanding at december  the company has market risk sensitive instruments denominated in foreign currencies totaling million as of december   excluding trade receivables and payables  which approximate fair value 
these market risk sensitive instruments consisted of cash balances and overdraft facilities 
the company estimates that a hypothetical movement of foreign currency exchange rates would affect net income by approximately million 
because the company operates in virtually every oil and gas exploration and production region in the world  it conducts a portion of its business in currencies other than the us dollar 
the functional currency for some of the company s international operations is the applicable local currency 
although some of the company s international revenues are denominated in the local currency  the effects of foreign currency fluctuations are partly mitigated because local expenses of such foreign operations are also generally denominated in the same currency 
during the years ended december   and  the company reported foreign currency gains losses of million  million and  respectively 
the gains and losses were primarily due to exchange rate fluctuations related to monetary asset balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency 
assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries are translated using the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date  resulting in translation adjustments that are reflected in accumulated other comprehensive loss in the common stockholders equity section of the company s balance sheet
