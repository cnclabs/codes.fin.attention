item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the purpose of this discussion and analysis is to focus on significant changes in the financial condition of whitney holding corporation and its subsidiaries the company or whitney and on their results of operations during  and virtually all of the company s operations are contained in its banking subsidiary  whitney national bank the bank 
this discussion and analysis is intended to highlight and supplement information presented elsewhere in this annual report on form k  particularly the consolidated financial statements and related notes in item certain financial information in prior years has been reclassified to conform to the current year s presentation 
overview the company earned per basic share  or million  for this was a increase over earnings in on both a per share and dollar basis 
the key components of s earnings performance follow o net interest income  on a taxable equivalent te basis  was little changed between and the favorable impact of growth in earning assets in was offset by moderate compression during the year in the net interest margin te  to a still healthy 
whitney was and continues to be moderately asset sensitive  which implies that its margin would tend to compress in a declining rate environment  but also tend to widen in a rising rate environment  holding other factors constant 
whitney was able to limit the margin compression in to basis points with the help of loan pricing discipline and successful deposit pricing strategies 
o the direction of overall credit quality was favorable during and whitney was able to reduce its allowance for loan losses by million from the end of net charge offs totaled million in  down from million in the prior year 
for  the company recognized a negative provision for loan losses of million compared to a provision of million in o noninterest income grew  or million  in income from secondary mortgage market operations was again bolstered by a strong refinancing market during most of and ended the year up  or million  over  although the pace of activity slowed toward year end 
fees from bank cards were up  or million  in  despite some rate reductions following the settlement of a dispute between merchants and the card association 
o noninterest expense was  or million  higher in the main driver was the  or million  increase in personnel expense 
employee compensation was up close to  as base pay increased a moderate  but payments under targeted employee incentive programs rose more sharply  largely due to mortgage origination incentives 
the jump in employee benefits was driven by a combined million increase in the actuarially determined expense of providing pension and postretirement health benefits 
most other major expense categories were lower in  as management continued its emphasis on cost control 
forward looking statements this discussion contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
such statements include  but may not be limited to a discussion of potential earnings volatility from changes in the estimated allowance for loan losses over time  b comments on the expected growth rate of the loan portfolio and on future changes in the mix of deposits  c statements of the results of net interest income simulations run by the company to measure interest rate sensitivity  d comments about the performance of whitney s net interest income and net interest margin assuming certain future conditions  e comments about possible future levels of income from secondary mortgage market operations  f discussion of the settlement of a dispute between visa usa and merchants and its expected impact on whitney  and g comments on changes or trends in expense levels for retirement benefits  occupancy  equipment and data processing  legal services and deposit insurance 
forward looking statements  which whitney makes in good faith  are based on numerous assumptions  certain of which may be referred to specifically in connection with a particular statement 
some of the more important assumptions include o expectations about overall economic strength and the performance of the economies in whitney s market area  o expectations about the movement of interest rates  including actions that may be taken by the federal reserve board in response to changing economic conditions  o reliance on existing or anticipated changes in laws or regulations affecting the activities of the banking industry and other financial service providers  and o expectations regarding the nature and level of competition  changes in customer behavior and preferences  and whitney s ability to execute its plans to respond effectively 
because it is uncertain whether future conditions and events will confirm these assumptions  there is a risk that whitney s future results will differ materially from what is stated in or implied by such forward looking statements 
whitney cautions the reader to consider this risk 
whitney undertakes no obligation to update any forward looking statement included in this discussion  whether as a result of new information  future events or developments  or for any other reason 
critical accounting policies whitney prepares its financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
note to the consolidated financial statements discusses certain accounting principles and methods of applying those principles that are particularly important to this process 
in applying these principles to determine the amounts and other disclosures that are presented in the financial statements and discussed in this section  the company is required to make estimates and assumptions 
whitney believes that the determination of its estimate of the allowance for loan losses involves a higher degree of judgment and complexity than its application of other significant accounting policies 
factors considered in this determination and the process used by management are discussed in note and in the following section on loans  credit risk management and allowance for loan losses 
although management believes it has identified appropriate factors for review and designed and implemented adequate procedures to support the estimation process that are consistently followed  the allowance remains an estimate about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
over time  changes in economic conditions or the actual or perceived financial condition of whitney s credit customers or other factors can materially impact the allowance estimate  potentially subjecting the company to significant earnings volatility 
management makes a variety of assumptions in applying principles that govern the accounting for retirement benefits under the company s defined benefit pension plan 
these assumptions are essential to the actuarial valuation that determines the amounts the company recognizes and certain disclosures it makes in the consolidated financial statements related to the operation of this plan see note in item 
two of the more significant assumptions concern the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and the rate needed to discount projected benefits to their present value 
changes in these assumptions impact the cost of pension benefits recognized in earnings 
certain assumptions are closely tied to current conditions and are generally revised at each measurement date 
for example  the discount rate is set with reference to market yields on high quality fixed income investments 
other assumptions  such as the rate of return on assets  are determined  in part  with reference to historical and expected conditions over time and are not as susceptible to frequent revision 
holding other factors constant  pension cost will move opposite to changes in either the discount rate or the rate of return on assets 
a basis point decrease in the expected return on assets or the discount rate would have increased the actuarially determined expense for by 
million or 
million  respectively 
recent trends in pension costs are discussed in the section on noninterest expense 
financial condition loans  credit risk management and allowance for loan losses loan portfolio developments total loans increased close to  or million  from year end  after registering declines of to in each of the previous two years 
beginning in the latter half of  the commercial loan portfolio has shown some steady growth  with strong support from new customer development 
the residential mortgage loan portfolio has decreased steadily over the last three years  reflecting the effects of refinancing activity and management s continuing decision to sell most current production in the secondary market 
table  which is based on regulatory reporting codes  shows loan balances at december  and at the end of the previous four years 
table loans outstanding by type december dollars in thousands commercial  financial and agricultural loans      real estate loans commercial and other      real estate loans residential mortgage      loans to individuals      total loans      the portfolio of commercial loans  other than those secured by real property  was up million  or  compared to year end this followed a million  or  increase in from the end of overall the portfolio remained well diversified  with customers in a wide range of industries  including oil and gas exploration and production  marine transportation  wholesale and retail trade in and manufacture of various durable and nondurable products  financial services  and professional services 
there have been no major trends or changes in the concentration mix of this portfolio category from year end  although there has been some noticeable growth in loans to customers in the oil and gas industry as discussed below 
also included in the commercial loan category are loans to individuals  generally secured by collateral other than real estate  that are used to fund investments in new or expanded business opportunities 
outstanding balances under participations in larger shared credit loan commitments totaled approximately million at december   including million related to the oil and gas industry 
substantially all such shared credits are with customers operating in whitney s market area 
the rate of commercial loan growth at the bank in will depend mainly on the economic fundamentals affecting its customers as well as on its ability to continue to develop customers in the newer parts of its market and take advantage of competitive circumstances to attract new business in its established market 
at december   outstanding loans to oil and gas industry customers totaled million  or approximately of total loans  an increase of approximately million from the end of the previous year after a million increase in the growth in was concentrated in the exploration and production sector of this industry 
with expectations of sustained higher commodity prices  whitney increased its attention to lending opportunities in this sector  and outstanding loans to exploration and production companies grew to approximately of the industry portfolio in  from at the end of the bank has a petroleum engineer on staff who participates in the underwriting of loans to exploration and production customers 
the major portion of the company s customer base provides transportation and other services and products to support exploration and production activities 
whitney seeks service and supply customers who are quality operators that can manage through volatile commodity price cycles 
management  through the bank s credit policy committee  monitors both industry fundamentals and portfolio performance and credit quality on a formal ongoing basis and establishes and adjusts internal exposure guidelines as a percent of capital both for the industry as a whole and for individual sectors within the industry 
the level of activity in this industry continues to have an important impact on the economies of certain portions of whitney s market area  particularly southern louisiana and houston 
the commercial real estate portfolio  which includes loans secured by properties used in commercial or industrial operations  grew  or million  after a period of relative stability dating back to the end of whitney has been able to develop new business in this highly competitive market  including significantly increased activity at its houston operations  and the company continues to finance new projects for its well established customer base 
the pace of new real estate project development has picked up some with improving economic conditions and higher confidence that these conditions can be sustained 
the growth achieved through new business development has  in part  been offset by expected paydowns on and permanent takeouts of seasoned projects as developers take advantage of favorable long term financing rates 
the bank s credit policy committee has also set exposure guidelines for the overall portfolio of commercial real estate loans as well as for loans to developers or owner users that are secured by various subcategories of property 
as with the lending to the oil and gas industry  management regularly monitors real estate industry fundamentals and portfolio credit quality 
in recent years  activity in this portfolio sector has been driven by the development of retail  small office and commercial facilities by customers throughout whitney s market area and by apartment and condominium projects  particularly in the eastern gulf coast region 
financing activity for hotel and other hospitality industry projects  which have largely been concentrated in the new orleans metropolitan area  has slowed over this period 
hotel loans were of total loans  or million  at the end of increased promotion of tailored home mortgage products that are held in the portfolio helped limit the decrease in residential mortgage loans to million from the end of to year end the million decrease in from the prior year end more clearly showed the impact of refinancing activity on this segment of the portfolio 
fixed term home equity loans outstanding grew moderately in both and this loan product offers customers the opportunity to leverage increased home values and equity to obtain tax advantaged consumer financing 
the rate of growth in this product slowed as borrowers increasingly tapped home equity when refinancing their primary home mortgages 
loans to individuals include various consumer installment and credit line loan products other than fixed term retail mortgage loan products 
this portfolio sector grew a moderate in both and  mainly from the promotion of secured personal credit lines 
the  or million  decrease in from the prior year reflected  in part  the decision by management to shorten the period it holds student loans before being taken out by the permanent financing source

written credit policies define underwriting criteria  concentration guidelines  and lending approval processes that cover individual authority and the appropriate involvement of regional loan committees and a senior loan committee 
the senior loan committee is composed of the bank s senior lenders  the president and the chairman and chief executive officer 
the credit administration function ensures consistent credit underwriting  policy administration and monitoring throughout the company 
strong monitoring processes are key to early identification of problem credits 
lending officers are responsible for ongoing monitoring and the assignment of risk ratings based on established guidelines 
an independent credit review function overseen by the audit committee of the board of directors assesses the accuracy of officer ratings and the timeliness of rating changes and performs concurrent reviews of the underwriting processes 
the credit review function also provides the audit committee with its assessment of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses on a quarterly basis 
once a problem relationship over a certain size threshold is identified  a quarterly watch committee process is initiated 
the watch committee  composed of senior lending and credit administration management  must approve any substantive changes to identified problem credits and assigns relationships to the special credits department when appropriate 
commercial credits  including commercial real estate loans  are underwritten principally based upon cash flow coverage  as well as on collateral value and guarantor strength 
commercial loans are typically relationship based rather than transaction driven 
loan concentrations are monitored monthly by management and the board of directors 
consumer loans are centrally underwritten using automated credit scoring tools  with appropriate secondary review procedures 
management s evaluation of credit risk in the portfolio is ultimately reflected in the estimate of probable loan losses that is reported in the company s financial statements as the allowance for loan losses 
changes in this ongoing evaluation over time are reflected in the provision for loan losses charged to expense 
the allowance is established at a level management believes is adequate to absorb probable losses inherent in the portfolio 
the methodology for determining the allowance involves significant judgment and is re evaluated quarterly to respond to changing conditions 
the recorded allowance encompasses three elements allowances established for losses on criticized loans  allowances based on historical loss experience for loans with acceptable credit quality  and allowances based on general economic conditions and other qualitative risk factors internal and external to the company 
criticized loans are credits with above average weaknesses as identified through the internal risk rating process 
criticized loans include those that are deemed to be impaired as defined by statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
specific allowances are determined for impaired loans based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s contractual interest rate  the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent  or  when available  the loan s observable market price 
the allowance for the remainder of criticized loans is calculated by applying loss factors to loan balances aggregated by the severity of the internal risk rating 
the loss factors applied to criticized loans are determined with reference to the results of migration analysis  which analyzes the charge off experience over time for loans with different ratings 
for the second element  loans assessed as having average or better credit quality with similar risk ratings and homogeneous loans not subject to individual rating  such as residential mortgage loans and consumer installment loans and draws under consumer credit lines  are grouped together and individual loss factors are applied to each group 
the loss factors for homogeneous loan groups are based on average historical charge off information 
industry based factors are applied to other portfolio segments for which migration analysis has not been performed 
determining the final element of the allowance involves assessing how other current factors  both internal and external  impact the accuracy of results obtained for the other two elements 
internally  management must consider whether trends have been identified in the quality of underwriting and loan administration as well as in the timely identification of credit quality issues 
management also monitors shifts in portfolio concentrations and other changes in portfolio characteristics that indicate levels of risk not fully captured in the loss factors 
external factors include local and national economic trends  as well as changes in the economic fundamentals of specific industries that are well represented in whitney s customer base 
management has established procedures to help ensure a consistent approach to this inherently judgmental process over time 
the direction of overall credit quality was favorable during table provides information on nonperforming loans and other nonperforming assets for each of the five years in the period ended december  nonperforming loans are included in the criticized loan total discussed below and encompass substantially all loans separately evaluated for impairment 
the company reduced nonperforming loans by million in  partly as a result of the successful efforts to fully collect on several larger credits that were categorized as impaired at year end there have been no significant trends related to industries or markets underlying the changes in nonperforming assets

during  there was a million reduction in the total of loans classified through the internal risk rating process as having well defined weaknesses or doubtful prospects for full repayment 
criticized loans at december  included million of loans whose full repayment is in doubt  down million from year end loans identified as having well defined weaknesses that would likely result in some loss if not corrected decreased million during the year  to a total of million 
loans warranting special attention totaled million at year end  up million from the prior year end 
the total of all criticized loans at the end of was down million from the level at year end beginning in  management s evaluation of credit risk included an assessment of what impact the economic repercussions of that year s terrorist attacks on the united states could have on the company s customers 
in whitney s market area  the impact has been felt mainly by businesses related to the convention and tourism industry  including  among others  hotels and restaurants  and by the employees of these businesses 
loan officers continue to monitor the operations of affected customers and their responses to a reduced level of travel and tourism 
management has applied tests to identify credits that would have the most difficulty with debt service under stressed conditions different than would normally have been considered in the underwriting process 
the results continue to indicate acceptable levels of risk

total investment in securities in  the liquidity of the company s earning assets surged in response to heightened demand for deposit products during a period of restrained loan demand 
beginning in  management redirected this liquidity to the investment portfolio  particularly to mortgage backed securities with relatively short duration  based on its expectations regarding the stability of the funding sources and the near term prospects for loan demand 
continued strong demand in the deposit base helped fund further growth in the investment portfolio in in addition to supporting increased loan production during this period 
at december   total securities were billion  an increase of  or million  compared to year end the majority of this increase came toward the end of when management  in response to market conditions  executed a strategy to temporarily leverage portfolio growth in anticipation of expected portfolio paydowns during the early part of the average investment in securities in was up  or million  from mortgage backed securities grew to of the total portfolio at the end of from in and in short term liquidity investments  including federal funds sold  totaled million at the end of  compared to million at year end on average  short term liquidity investments were million in  compared to million in  a decrease of million that reflected the gradual reallocation of excess liquidity to the investment portfolio during the earlier year

substantially all of the securities in the investment portfolio bear fixed interest rates 
the investment in mortgage backed securities with final contractual maturities beyond ten years shown in table included approximately million of adjustable rate issues with a weighted average yield of 
the initial reset dates on these securities are mainly within five to seven years 
whitney has steadily built its investment in securities classified as available for sale in recent years  primarily as a means to increase liquidity management flexibility 
effective january   the company reclassified securities with a carrying value of million  and an unrealized net loss of million  as available for sale in connection with the adoption of sfas no 
the unrealized loss at the effective date of the reclassification was reported net of tax in other comprehensive income in securities available for sale constituted of the total investment portfolio at december  there was a net unrealized gain on this portfolio segment of million at year end that was concentrated in mortgage backed securities 
the overall unrealized gain represented less than of amortized cost 
at year end  there was a net unrealized gain of million  or of amortized cost  including million related to mortgage backed securities 
the net unrealized gain or loss will vary based on overall changes in market rates  shifts in the slope of the yield curve  movement in spreads to the yield curve for different types of securities  and changing expectations about the timing of cash flows on securities that can be prepaid 
securities in the company s portfolio that are subject to possible credit quality deterioration  such as obligations of states and political subdivisions  are monitored for signs that contractual obligations may not be met and that there may be value impairment that is other than temporary 
if such impairment is identified  the carrying amount of the security is reduced with a charge to operations 
no impairment losses were recognized in the three years ended december  the company s investment policy requires special approval for the purchase of other than investment grade securities 
the company does not normally maintain a trading portfolio  other than holding trading account securities for short periods while buying and selling securities for customers 
such securities  if any  are included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets

deposits and short term and other borrowings deposits at december  were up  or million  from the level at year end many of the factors that prompted the increased availability of deposit funds in and continued to influence customer behavior during average deposits in were up  or million  compared to short term and other borrowings  the major part of which represents liabilities under repurchase agreements with customers  increased  or million  from year end  but were little changed on average for compared to the prior year 
table average deposits dollars in thousands noninterest bearing demand deposits    now account deposits    money market deposits    savings deposits    other time deposits    time deposits  and over    total    deposit pricing strategies implemented during and sustained demand for deposit products helped improve the mix of deposits throughout that year  and these improvements have been preserved in noninterest bearing demand deposits at year end were up  or million  from the end of for the year  average demand deposits increased  or million 
over the last three years  noninterest bearing demand deposits have steadily increased as a percentage of total deposits  as can be seen in table above 
interest bearing deposits  were up  or million  between year end and the most recent year end 
on average  interest bearing deposits were little changed in compared to the slower growth in interest bearing deposits during was largely a reaction to steadily declining renewal rates for time deposits 
the shift in the mix of interest bearing deposits over these years was partly a function of funds flows between deposit products  and to deposits from short term borrowings  in response to the reduced yields 
money market deposits were up moderately from the end of  but increased  or million  on average in regular savings deposits grew  or million  during  and were up on average from the prior year  at least temporarily continuing the reversal of a trend away from this more traditional deposit product 
now account deposits were up  or million  at year end  reflecting in part an increased share of public funds during the active tax collection period at year end 
the average balance of now deposits grew only between and total time deposits  however  decreased  or million  from the end of  and were down  or million  on average in compared to the prior year 
table shows the maturity structure of time deposits over and under  at december  the maturity of million of time deposits in the first quarter of is not expected to have a significant impact on the mix of deposits

other than in connection with the temporary leveraging of growth in the investment portfolio toward the end of discussed earlier  whitney made little use of available wholesale short term funding sources in either or these sources include overnight and term federal funds purchased and brokered repurchase agreements 
average short term borrowings from customers under repurchase agreements declined a little over in each of the past two years  partly representing the flow of funds back to deposits as the comparative yield advantage was largely eliminated 
because of the underlying customer relationship  these borrowings serve as a relatively stable source of funds 
shareholders equity and capital adequacy shareholders equity totaled million at december   which represented an increase of million from the end of during  whitney retained million of earnings  net of dividends declared  and recognized million in additional equity from activity in stock based compensation plans for employees and directors  including option exercises 
these factors were partly offset by a million decrease in other comprehensive income representing an unrealized net holding loss on securities available for sale during the period 
total shareholders equity grew million in  to million at december  driving this growth were net retained earnings of million  million in stock based compensation plan activity  and a million increase in comprehensive income 
the company paid a relatively stable percentage of its earnings in dividends over the last three years 
the dividend payout ratio was in  in and in the ratios in table indicate that the company remained strongly capitalized at december  the increase in risk weighted assets at december  from the end of resulted mainly from an increase in loans and other on balance sheet assets and  to a lesser degree  from growth in off balance sheet obligations  such as loan facilities and letters of credit  which are converted to assets for the risk based capital calculations

liquidity management and contractual obligations liquidity management the objective of liquidity management is to ensure that funds are available to meet cash flow requirements of depositors and borrowers  while at the same time meeting the operating  capital and strategic cash flow needs of the company and the bank  all in the most cost effective manner 
whitney develops its liquidity management strategies and measures and monitors liquidity risk as part of its overall asset liability management process  making full use of the quantitative modeling tools available to project cash flows under a variety of possible scenarios 
projections are also made assuming credit stressed conditions  although such conditions are not likely to arise 
on the liability side  liquidity management focuses on growing the base of more stable core deposits at competitive rates  including the use of treasury management products for commercial customers  while at the same time ensuring access to economical wholesale funding sources 
the section above on deposits and short term borrowings discusses changes in these liability funding sources in whitney national bank is a member of the federal home loan bank system 
this membership provides access to a variety of federal home loan bank advance products as an alternative source of funds  although the bank had made only very limited use of this funding source through the end of in addition  both the company and the bank have access to external funding sources in the financial markets  and the bank has developed the ability to gather deposits at a nationwide level 
liquidity management on the asset side primarily addresses the composition and maturity structure of the loan and investment securities portfolios and their capacity to generate cash flows from scheduled payments  contractual maturities  prepayments  use as collateral for borrowings under repurchase agreements and possible outright sales or securitizations 
table above presents the contractual maturity structure of the loan portfolio and table presents contractual investment maturities 
whitney has built its investment in securities classified as available for sale in recent years to further increase liquidity management flexibility 
cash generated from operations is another important source of funds to meet liquidity needs 
the consolidated statements of cash flows present operating cash flows and summarize all significant sources and uses of funds for each year in the three year period ended december  the bank s liquidity position had grown significantly in reflecting strong deposit inflows  moderate loan demand  and an attractive refinancing environment 
conditions supported ample liquidity again in  and whitney made investment allocation decisions and developed deposit pricing strategies consistent with management s assessment of the underlying conditions 
continued high levels of liquidity in the deposit base helped support increased loan production and overall earning asset growth in management anticipates that some of the demand for deposit products will moderate with increased economic activity  a return to confidence in the capital markets and rising market interest rates and has factored this possibility into its liquidity projections and planning processes 
whitney holding corporation had approximately million in cash and demand notes from the bank available to provide liquidity for acquisitions  dividend payments to shareholders  or other corporate uses at the end of  before consideration of any future dividends that may be received from the bank 
during  the bank will have available an amount equal to approximately million plus its current net income to declare as dividends to the company without prior regulatory approval 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes payments due from the company under specified long term and certain other contractual obligations as of december  obligations under deposit contracts are not included 
the maturities of time deposits are scheduled in table above in the section on deposits and short term and other borrowings 
purchase obligations represent legal and binding contracts to purchase services or goods that cannot be settled or terminated without paying substantially all of the contractual amounts 
the balance includes approximately million under contracts to construct or improve bank facilities 
not included are a number of contracts entered into to support ongoing operations that either do not specify fixed or minimum amounts of goods or services or are cancelable on short notice without cause and without significant penalty

a million nonqualified plan obligation was recorded at year end c the recorded obligation for postretirement benefits other than pensions was million at december  the funding to purchase benefits for current retirees  net of retiree contributions  has not been significant 
off balance sheet arrangements as a normal part of its business  the company enters into arrangements that create financial obligations that are not recognized  wholly or in part  in the consolidated financial statements 
certain of these arrangements  such as noncancelable operating leases  are reflected in table above 
the most significant off balance sheet obligations are the bank s commitments under traditional credit related financial instruments 
table schedules these commitments as of december  by the periods in which they expire 
commitments under credit card and personal credit lines generally have no stated maturity 
table credit related commitments dollars in thousands commitments expiring by period from december  less than more than total year years years years loan commitments revolving     loan commitments nonrevolving    credit card and personal credit lines   standby and other letters of credit    total     revolving loan commitments are issued to support commercial activities 
the availability of funds under revolving loan commitments generally depends on whether the borrower continues to meet credit standards established in the underlying contract 
many such commitments are used only partially or not at all before they expire 
credit card and personal credit lines are generally subject to cancellation if the borrower s credit quality deteriorates  and many lines remain partly or wholly unused 
unfunded balances on revolving loan commitments and credit lines should not be used to project actual future liquidity requirements 
nonrevolving loan commitments are issued mainly to provide financing for the acquisition and construction of real property  both commercial and residential  although many are not expected to lead to permanent financing by the bank 
expectations about the level of draws under all credit related commitments are incorporated into the company s liquidity and asset liability management models 
substantially all of the letters of credit are standby agreements that obligate the bank to fulfill a customer s financial commitments to a third party if the customer is unable to perform 
the bank issues standby letters of credit primarily to provide credit enhancement to its customers other commercial or public financing arrangements and to help them demonstrate financial capacity to vendors 
the company has historically had minimal calls to perform under standby agreements 
asset liability management the objective of the company s asset liability management is to implement strategies for the funding and deployment of its financial resources that are expected to maximize soundness and profitability over time at acceptable levels of risk 
interest rate sensitivity is the potential impact of changing rate environments on both net interest income and cash flows 
the simplest method of measuring interest rate sensitivity is gap analysis  which identifies the difference between the dollar volume of assets and liabilities that reprice within specified time periods 
table shows the company s static gap position as of december  this table indicates that whitney is somewhat liability sensitive in the very near term and somewhat asset sensitive over a one year time horizon 
gap analysis has several limitations  including the fact that it is a point in time measurement that ignores the dynamic nature of the company s assets and liabilities  and it does not take into consideration actions that management can and will take to maximize net interest income over time 
the company has developed a model that allows it to obtain more accurate and meaningful measures of its interest rate sensitivity by running net interest income simulations and monitoring the economic value of equity 
the model can be used to test the company s sensitivity in various economic environments 
the model is able to incorporate management s assumptions and expectations regarding such factors as loan and deposit growth  pricing  prepayment speeds and spreads between interest rates 
assumptions can also be entered into the model to evaluate the impact of possible strategic responses to changes in the competitive environment 
management  through the company s asset liability committee  monitors simulation results against rate sensitivity guidelines specified in whitney s asset liability management policy 
table interest rate sensitivity by maturity or repricing date at december  non after interest dollars in millions days days days days year bearing total assets loans   securities available for sale   securities held to maturity loans held for sale and other short term investments other assets total assets    sources of funds now account deposits money market deposits   savings deposits other time deposits time deposits  and over short term borrowings noninterest bearing demand deposits   other liabilities shareholders equity total sources of funds    interest rate sensitivity gap   cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap  cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap as a percentage of total earning assets 
the net interest income simulations run at the end of also indicated that whitney was moderately asset sensitive over the near term  similar to its position at year end based on these simulations  annual net interest income te would be expected to increase million  or  and decrease million  or  if interest rates instantaneously increased or decreased  respectively  from current rates by basis points 
these changes are measured against the results of a base simulation run that uses current growth forecasts and assumes a stable rate environment and structure 
the comparable simulation run at year end produced results that ranged from a positive impact on net interest income te of million  or  to a negative impact of million  or 
at the end of each year  additional simulations were run applying instantaneous parallel rate shocks up to basis points as well as gradual rate changes of up to basis points 
in the recent rate environment  certain downward rate shocks caused unrealistic model assumptions  and the results from these simulation runs were disregarded 
the actual impact that changes in interest rates have on net interest income will depend on many factors 
these include whitney s ability to achieve expected growth in earning assets and maintain a desired mix of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  the actual timing when assets and liabilities reprice  the magnitude of interest rate changes  interest rate spreads and the level of success of asset liability management strategies implemented 
the method used for measuring longer term interest rate risk is the economic value of equity analysis 
at year end  the simulated measure of the company s sensitivity was acceptable under internal guidelines at all levels of rate shock that produced realistic model assumptions 
changes in interest rates affect the fair values of financial instruments 
the earlier section on investment in securities and notes and to the consolidated financial statements contain information regarding fair values 
to be able to accommodate the maturity rate preferences of certain potential borrowers  during the bank began to employ interest rate swaps to bring the market risk associated with these longer duration fixed rate loans in line with whitney s asset liability management objectives 
at december   only one swap with a notional amount of million had been executed  essentially converting the related fixed rate commercial loan into a floating rate loan 
the swap has been structured to be a highly effective hedge against changes in the loan s fair value  and there was no ineffectiveness to be recognized in earnings during other than this swap activity  the company has made no investments in financial instruments or participated in agreements with values that are linked to or derived from changes in the value of some underlying asset or index 
these are commonly referred to as derivatives and include such instruments as futures  forward contracts  option contracts  and other financial arrangements with similar characteristics 
management continues to evaluate whether to make additional use of derivatives as part of its asset liability and liquidity management processes 
impact of inflation and changing prices the great majority of assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
management believes the most significant potential impact of inflationary or deflationary economic cycles on whitney s financial results is its ability to react to changes in interest rates 
interest rates do not  however  necessarily move in the same direction  or at the same magnitude  as the prices of goods and services 
as discussed above  the company employs asset liability management strategies in its attempt to minimize the effects of economic cycles on its net interest income 
inflation and changing prices also have an impact on the growth of total assets in the banking industry and the resulting need to increase capital at higher than normal rates in order to maintain an appropriate equity to assets ratio 
changing prices will also affect the trend in noninterest operating expenses and noninterest income 
results of operations net interest income te whitney s net interest income te was little changed between and  following an increase of  or million  from to earning assets grew on average in both and the favorable impact of earning asset growth in was offset by moderate compression during the year in the net interest margin te to a still healthy 
in  the net interest margin te  which is net interest income te as a percent of average earning assets  widened slightly to  from in tables and show the components of changes in the company s net interest income te and net interest margin te 
as mentioned earlier  whitney is moderately asset sensitive  which implies that its net interest margin would tend to compress in a declining rate environment  holding other factors constant  but also tend to widen in a rising rate environment 
the operating environment over the last three years has proved a difficult one for improving the margin and generating significant growth in net interest income 
the most important characteristics of this environment for whitney have been sustained low market interest rates  high levels of liquidity in the deposit base  and restrained commercial loan demand 
the relative stability of the net interest margin te over this period was the result of numerous factors  including the implementation of successful pricing strategies on deposits  careful deployment of excess liquidity in the deposit base  and pricing discipline on loans in a highly competitive market 
although the latter half of has seen some upward movement in yields at longer maturities  an overall environment of low  though relatively stable  market interest rates prevailed during and after a steep decline during as expected  whitney s funding costs trended down  but at a declining rate  including the impact of the gradual repricing of fixed rate time deposits 
sustained low rates coupled with increased demand for deposit products also allowed whitney to implement deposit pricing strategies to help shift the mix of funds in favor of noninterest bearing and lower cost interest bearing sources 
average noninterest bearing deposits funded of average earning assets in  up from a healthy in and in  and the percentage of funding from all noninterest bearing sources rose steadily to from over this three year period 
lower cost interest bearing deposits supported close to of earning assets in  up from in and in higher cost sources of funds  which include time deposits and short term and other borrowings  fell to of average earning assets in  from in and in the overall cost of funds decreased basis points between and  and was down basis points in from the average rate on lower cost interest bearing deposits also declined basis points in after a fall of basis points in because of their maturity structure  the average rate on time deposits fell further  decreasing basis points in after the steep basis points decline in the overall yield te on average earning assets decreased basis points in  or basis points beyond the reduction in the cost of funds from in  the overall asset yield te declined basis points  or basis points better than the decrease in the cost of funds from both loan and investment yields trended lower as higher yielding fixed rate instruments gradually repriced and new funds were invested at current low rates 
loan yields te were down basis points in  following a decrease of basis points in the average yield te earned on the investment portfolio decreased basis points in and was down basis points in compared to the prior year 
a substantial number of loans  approximately of the portfolio by dollar value  have an adjustable rate tied to market indices or prime  while the company s investment securities are predominantly fixed rate instruments 
as such  the overall loan yield tends to be more responsive to changes in market rates than the overall yield on the investment portfolio 
with low market rates stimulating home mortgage refinancing activity  mortgage backed securities prepayments accelerated in and and the yield on this portfolio segment suffered 
this was particularly evident in when the yield on mortgage backed securities fell basis points  compared to the basis point decline in loan yields te for this period 
as noted earlier  whitney sold certain mortgage backed securities in the third quarter of and reinvested in other issues with a higher and more stable yield and duration more consistent with overall investment and asset liability management strategies

the pace of refinancings recently moderated  and this has slowed prepayments and helped stabilize the overall yield te on investment securities toward the end of there was some favorable shift in the mix of average earning assets in  with average loans growing to of the total from in loans had declined as a percentage of average earning assets in  from in  reflecting the more restrained loan demand over much of this period 
restrained loan demand and higher demand for deposit products  among other factors  had caused a surge in the liquidity of the asset mix in that carried over into short term investments grew to of average earning assets in and remained on average at the higher level in beginning in  management gradually redirected this liquidity to securities portfolio investments and  eventually  to fund renewed loan growth 
for  the average investment in securities increased to of average earning assets  from in provision for loan losses the overall credit risk profile of whitney s customers improved in both and with these improvements  whitney was able to reduce its allowance for loan losses by million in  following a reduction of million in from year end net charge offs were million in  compared to million in and million in in  whitney recognized a million negative provision for loan losses  compared to provisions of million in and million in for a more detailed discussion of changes in the allowance for loan losses  nonperforming assets and general credit quality  see the earlier section on loans  credit risk management and allowance for loan losses 
the future level of the allowance and provisions for loan losses will reflect management s ongoing evaluation of credit risk  based on established internal policies and practices 
noninterest income table shows the components of noninterest income for each year in the three year period ended december   along with the percent changes between years for each component 
noninterest income increased  or million  in after decreasing  or million  in excluding revenue and gains associated with merchant processing agreements that were sold in  as discussed below  noninterest income grew  or million  in table noninterest income dollars in thousands change change service charges on deposit accounts    secondary mortgage market operations    bank card fees    trust service fees    atm fees    investment services income    other fees and charges    other operating income    net gain on sales and other revenue from foreclosed assets    net gains on disposals of surplus property  gain on sale of merchant processing agreements a  securities transactions total noninterest income    a not meaningful 
income from service charges on deposit accounts was stable in after an increase of  or million  in account maintenance charges on business customers were up in  but grew  or million  in refinements to pricing policies for certain business accounts implemented mid and a relatively steep reduction in the earnings credit available to offset charges on these accounts both benefited the results in whitney appropriately lowered the earnings credit rate as short term market interest rates declined sharply in the earnings credit rate moved moderately lower into  but the potential favorable impact on business charges was partly offset by the impact of increased liquidity and balances in the deposit base and some reduction in the volume of chargeable transactions 
overall service charge income in also benefited from the introduction  beginning in s second quarter  of automated tools to help banking officers with certain service fee decisions and to measure their performance against corporate standards 
the integration of customers acquired in mergers also generated additional fee income in secondary mortgage market operations posted a  or million  increase in fee income in this followed an increase of  or million  in low rates have benefited loan production volumes for several years by stimulating homeowners to refinance and by helping sustain demand for new home purchases 
total home loan production  including loans originated for the portfolio  was million in  million in and million in whitney sold approximately of this production in  compared to in and in refinancing activity accounted for approximately of the total dollar volume of loans originated in  compared to in both and there was a marked reduction in home loan production toward the end of the third quarter of as mortgage rates trended higher and refinancing activity abated 
a return to a more favorable rate environment in the near term is not currently anticipated  and both overall production levels and secondary mortgage market fee income in are expected to be well below results 
at the end of s third quarter  whitney entered into an alliance with a firm that specializes in processing credit card sale transactions for merchants 
in forming this alliance  whitney sold its existing merchant processing agreements to the firm and recognized a gain of million  while maintaining an interest in the ongoing net revenues generated through the alliance 
with this move  bank card fees decreased a net  or million  in the corresponding reduction in bank card processing expense is discussed in the following section 
excluding revenues associated with merchant processing in all periods  bank card income rose  or 
million  in  and was up  or million in in addition to income from merchant processing services  this category includes fees from activity on bank issued credit and debit cards 
fee income from credit card activity grew in  consistent with the growth in transaction volume  and was up in fee income from debit card activity has made an increasingly important contribution in recent years as the company expanded the distribution of this product and saw increasing acceptance and use of these cards for retail transactions 
debit card fee income was up  or 
million in  on a increase in transaction volume 
this followed income growth of  or million  in when transaction volume rose 
the income growth in did not fully reflect the underlying growth in transaction volume because rates were reduced beginning in august under the terms of a settlement between visa usa and merchants 
as part of this settlement  visa usa also agreed to modify its policy requiring merchants who honor its credit cards to also accept its check or debit card product 
although the implementation of this policy in january is not expected to significantly impact transaction volume  it is expected to lead to lower interchange fees per transaction relative to pre settlement levels 
trust service fees were lower in both and  although the most recent quarterly results have shown some improvement with the recovery of capital market valuations after an extended period of market weakness 
investment service income decreased in  following growth in market conditions in limited the volume of fixed income transactions in which the company has traditionally been most active and reduced the demand for and the profitability of annuity products 
at the same time  there was some improvement in retail brokerage activity with improving equity markets and investor confidence 
income growth in had been driven mainly by customers reinvestment of called bond proceeds and sales of annuity products when returns were relatively more attractive 
fees on letters of credit and unused loan commitments were the main contributors to the growth in other fees and charges in both and  mainly reflecting successful lending efforts 
other operating income in includes a gain of million recognized on the sale of a portfolio of seasoned loans originated under affordable housing programs 
the net gain on sales and other revenue from foreclosed assets includes income from grandfathered assets that vary from year to year as opportunities for sales arise 
management evaluates its banking facilities on an ongoing basis to identify possible under utilization and to determine the need for functional improvements  relocations or possible sales 
the net gains recognized in each period from these and other dispositions of surplus banking property are shown in table the total for includes a gain of approximately million related to a property acquired through merger 
noninterest expense table shows the components of noninterest expense for each year in the three year period ended december   along with the percent changes between years for each component 
noninterest expense increased  or million  in  driven mainly by a  or million  increase in personnel expense 
noninterest expense declined between and adjusting for the impact of the merchant business sale in each period and excluding merger related expenses of million in  noninterest expense in was up from personnel costs were again the most significant factor 
table noninterest expense dollars in thousands change change employee compensation    employee benefits    total personnel expense    net occupancy expense    equipment and data processing expense    telecommunication and postage    corporate value and franchise taxes    legal and professional services  
  amortization of intangibles    security and other outsourced services    advertising    operating supplies    bank card processing services    deposit insurance and regulatory fees    miscellaneous operating losses    other operating expense    total noninterest expense    underlying the rise in personnel expense in were a  or million  increase in employee compensation and a  or million  increase in employee benefits 
base pay increased a moderate  or close to million 
continued attention to efficient management of human resources helped the company maintain its full time equivalent staff during at a level that was on average below the level in payments in under targeted employee incentive programs rose more sharply than base pay  with the million increase driven mainly by the impact of higher loan production volumes on retail mortgage origination incentives 
an increase in stock based compensation  which fluctuates with changes in whitney s stock price and employee participation levels  was the main factor in the overall million increase in management incentive plan expense 
defined benefit pension plan expense and the cost of providing health benefits to retirees increased a combined million in  with pension expense alone up million 
this was the main factor behind the overall rise in employee benefits for the year 
a weak investment performance by the pension trust fund or a decline in market yields on fixed income securities will cause the actuarially determined periodic pension expense to increase in future periods  holding other variables constant 
declines in market yields and negative trends in actual benefit outlays will also have an unfavorable impact on actuarial valuation results for postretirement health benefits 
all of these conditions were present in  leading to the higher expense levels in the company also experienced an expected increase in the cost of providing current health benefits in a much more moderate increase in pension expense is anticipated for  reflecting the beneficial impact of better than assumed investment performance in and the million employer contribution to the pension trust during that year 
although the cost of postretirement health benefits is also expected to continue to rise in  the size of the increase could be favorably impacted by recently enacted legislation on prescription drug benefits under medicare 
whitney has deferred recognizing the impact of this legislation in its accounting for postretirement health benefits  pending issuance of authoritative guidance on certain accounting issues raised by the act 
the basis for this deferral is discussed more fully in note to the consolidated financial statements 
total personnel costs increased  or million  in  with employee compensation up  or million  and employee benefits up  or million 
excluding million of merger related expense incurred in  related mainly to severance or retention bonuses and change in control payments  employee compensation increased  or million  in over the previous year 
base salaries and the cost of various targeted employee incentive pay plans  such as for mortgage originators  increased a combined  or million  including the impact of recurring costs of bank operations purchased in late the staff level during was essentially unchanged from  partly reflecting the successful integration of operations and employees from the acquisitions 
management incentive expense was up million in  similar to the increase in stock based compensation was again the main factor 
the same conditions that led to higher pension costs in also impacted the defined benefit plan expense was up million from  accounting for approximately three quarters of the overall increase in employee benefits expense in higher costs of providing both current and retirement health benefits also contributed to the overall increase in net occupancy expense was moderately lower in both and management has emphasized expense control through aggressive contract management  careful analysis of proposed capital expenditures  and ongoing identification of under utilized facilities 
several branch facilities were eliminated during after their operations were consolidated with nearby locations 
six new or replacement branches are scheduled to open through the third quarter of  including three additional locations to serve the houston market 
with the impact of these openings and other factors  a moderate increase in net occupancy expense is expected in to reduce costs over the long term and enhance productivity  certain operations in houston will be moved to one of the new locations and out of office space that is subject to a noncancelable lease 
whitney expects to recognize a loss of up to million related to its remaining obligation under the lease when the move is completed  which is currently planned for the third quarter of equipment and data processing expense also trended lower in recent years  with a decrease of  or million  in  following a decrease of  or million  in excluding million in system integration expenses in related to mergers  the improvement in was  or million 
as with occupancy expense  the company s equipment and data processing process in recent years has shown the benefit of contract management and close control over capital expenditures for both new projects and the replacement of fully depreciated assets 
systems integration activities completed in also produced ongoing savings 
although cost control efforts will continue  recent upgrades to the data processing system and new applications and capabilities that have been or will be added to support expanded customer service are expected to lead to a year over year increase in this expense category in a project to upgrade the capacity and functionality of branch communication lines was the main factor behind the increase in telecommunication and postage expense in this expense category was slightly lower in despite postal rate increases in that year and in during and  whitney renegotiated its contract for mail services  improved internal mail operations  and restructured its data and voice communication contracts 
the company has also noted some trends in customer transaction preferences that have reduced the cost of periodic mailings 
the expense for legal and professional services was little changed in compared to the prior year 
this followed a decrease of  or million  from to the results in included million of merger related expense primarily for system conversion consulting services 
excluding merger related costs  whitney s expenditures for consulting and other nonlegal professional services have been relatively stable over the last three years 
during this period  the company pursued various initiatives that included implementing new systems to support trust operations and funds transfer services  introducing new on line banking services  developing products and service protocols that better target different customer groups  and evaluating overall organizational efficiency and effectiveness 
legal expense  which covers services for both loan collection efforts and general corporate matters  was relatively stable over this three year period 
the improvements in loan credit quality during that were discussed earlier should translate into lower demand for collection services over the near term 
amortization of purchased intangibles decreased million in compared to the million benefit from the elimination of goodwill amortization in was partly offset by amortization of the deposit relationship intangible purchased in the northwest bank acquisition in s fourth quarter and adjustments to the amortization schedule for certain other purchased intangibles 
note to the consolidated financial statements presents pro forma information to show the impact elimination of goodwill amortization has on net income and earnings per share 
scheduled amortization of intangible assets other than goodwill in is million 
the expense for security and other outsourced services increased in after rising in the outsourcing of trust related processing services was the main contributor to the larger increase in toward the end of  whitney launched a multi faceted advertising campaign featuring a louisiana based celebrity spokesperson 
costs associated with this campaign continued throughout during  no new major campaigns were introduced  leading to a decrease in expense of  or million 
the significant reduction in bank card processing services expense in was directly related to the merchant business sale discussed earlier 
excluding merchant processing costs  this expense category will vary mainly with changes in transaction volume on bank issued credit cards 
the bank has been assessed at relatively low rates for deposit insurance premiums in recent years  reflecting both the level of the deposit insurance funds in relation to required levels and the favorable overall risk rating assigned to the bank by its primary regulator 
the company does not expect the bank s deposit insurance premiums to rise significantly in the near term 
the expense categories included in other operating expense were up  or million  on a combined basis in the company experienced a sharp jump in its insurance premiums when certain coverages were renewed in an insurance market much harder than at the beginning of the prior multi year contract 
the required amortization of new affordable housing project investments was also a factor behind the increases in and  but the related tax credits reduced income tax expense and the effective tax rates as noted in the following section and note to the consolidated financial statements 
income taxes income tax expense was million in  million in and million in the company s effective tax rate was in  in and in the effective rates in each of these years was lower than the federal statutory tax rate primarily because of tax exempt interest income from the financing of state and local governments 
additional investments in projects that generate affordable housing credits helped lower the effective tax rate in as compared to as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  whitney recorded a deferred tax benefit of approximately million in when an acquired bank s subchapter s election was terminated 
the effective rate in was also impacted by nondeductible goodwill amortization 
this was not a factor in and  because the amortization of goodwill was discontinued after as was discussed earlier 
louisiana sourced income of commercial banks is not subject to state income taxes 
rather  banks in louisiana pay a tax based on the value of their capital stock in lieu of income and franchise taxes  and these corporate value taxes are included in noninterest expense 
this expense will fluctuate based in part on the growth in the bank s equity and earnings and in part based on market valuation trends for the banking industry 
see note for additional information on the company s effective tax rates and the composition of changes in income tax expense for all periods 
fourth quarter results whitney earned million  or 
per basic share  in the fourth quarter of  compared to million  or 
per basic share  in the fourth quarter of selected highlights from the fourth quarter s results follow o whitney s net interest income te increased  or million  from the fourth quarter of the favorable impact of growth in earning assets was partly offset by an basis point compression of the net interest margin te between these periods 
the margin for the most recent quarter was  down only slightly from in the third quarter of although the latter part of has seen some upward movement in rates for longer maturities  an overall environment of low market rates has been prevalent for some time now 
both funding costs and asset yields have trended down  but at a declining rate  as higher yielding fixed rate instruments gradually repriced and new instruments were added at current low rates 
funding costs decreased basis points between the fourth quarters of and  but were only basis points lower than in s third quarter 
deposit pricing strategies implemented in response to market conditions have helped shift the mix of funds in favor of noninterest bearing and lower cost interest bearing sources 
the overall yield on earning assets was basis points lower than in s fourth quarter  but was down only basis points in comparison to the third quarter of a recent nationwide slowdown in home mortgage refinancing activities led to lower prepayments on mortgage backed securities and helped stabilize the overall yield on investment securities 
loans increased slightly as a percentage of earning assets between the fourth quarters of and  reflecting continued steady growth 
o the direction of overall credit quality was again favorable during the fourth quarter of this development and a favorable change in certain loss experience factors helped reduce the allowance for loan losses needed at december  to a level million below that at september  with net charge offs of a comparable million for the period  whitney recorded no provision for loan losses in the final quarter of  compared to a million negative provision in s third quarter and a provision of 
million in the fourth quarter of net charge offs were 
million in the third quarter of and million in s final quarter 
the successful resolution of a larger problem credit was the major factor in a million reduction in total nonperforming loans from the end of s third quarter 
the allowance required for impaired loans at the end of was million below the level at september  the total of loans criticized through the internal credit risk classification process was down million from the end of the third quarter of with continued loan growth  the allowance declined as a percentage of total loans to at december   from at september  the allowance represented of nonperforming loans at year end and at the end of s third quarter 
o noninterest income decreased  or 
million  from the fourth quarter of fee income from whitney s secondary mortgage market operations in s fourth quarter was down  or 
million  compared to the fourth quarter of there was a marked reduction in home loan production toward the end of the third quarter of as mortgage rates trended higher and refinancing activity abated 
service charges from deposit accounts were  or 
million  higher in the fourth quarter of and income from bank issued credit and debit cards was up  or 
million  compared to s fourth quarter 
the results for bank card income do not fully reflect the underlying growth in transaction volumes because of a reduction in debit transaction rates beginning in august under the terms of a settlement between visa usa and merchants 
trust service fees declined  or 
million  compared to the fourth quarter of  but were up slightly from s third quarter with rising capital market valuations 
o noninterest expense increased  or million  from s fourth quarter 
total personnel expense was up  or million  as employee compensation increased and employee benefits rose  or each approximately million 
base pay increased  or close to 
million  but payments under targeted employee incentive programs declined  reflecting the impact of reduced loan production volumes on retail mortgage origination incentives 
management incentive plan expense  which includes certain stock based compensation  increased 
million 
a combined increase of 
million in defined benefit pension plan expense and the cost of providing postretirement health benefits was the main factor behind the overall rise in employee benefits expense for the fourth quarter of a project to upgrade the capacity and functionality of communication lines was the main factor behind the increase in the telecommunication and postage expense category 
the categories making up other noninterest expense increased a net  or million 
the most significant factor of a recurring nature was the sharp jump in insurance premiums for the current coverage period  reflecting an insurance market much harder than at the beginning of the prior multi year contract 
the required amortization of new affordable housing project investments during was also a factor  but the related tax credits reduced income tax expense and helped lower the effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of the summary of quarterly financial information appearing in item of this form k provides selected comparative financial information for each of the four quarters in and item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the information required for this item is included in the section entitled asset liability management in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations that appears in item of this form k and is incorporated here by reference
