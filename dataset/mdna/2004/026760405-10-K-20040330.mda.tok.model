ihc will also have at least two representatives on the company s board of directors who will have similar conflicts of interest 
in addition  the company is relying upon the management and expertise of officers of ihc who also serve as officers of the company 
the occurrence of various events may adversely affect the company s ability to utilize fully its tax net operating loss carryforwards 
the company has us federal tax net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million  which may be used against any profits from the company s business 
however  events outside of the control of the company or ihc  such as certain acquisitions and dispositions of the company s common stock  may limit the use of all or a portion of the company s tax net operating loss carryforwards 
if such events were to occur  the company s expectation of using its tax net operating loss carryforwards against potential profits would not be realized and the company could potentially have a higher tax liability in the future than it would otherwise have had 
results may fluctuate as a result of factors generally affecting the insurance and reinsurance industry the results of companies in the insurance and reinsurance industry historically have been subject to significant fluctuations and uncertainties 
factors that affect the industry in general could also cause results to fluctuate 
the industry s and the company s financial condition and results of operations may be affected significantly by fluctuations in interest rates  inflationary pressures and other changes in the investment environment  which affect returns on invested capital and may impact the ultimate payout of loss amounts  rising levels of actual costs that are not known by companies at the time they price their products  events like the september  attacks  which affected the insurance and reinsurance markets generally  changes in reserves resulting from different types of claims that may arise an the development of judicial interpretations relating to the scope of insurers liability  and the overall level of economic activity and the competitive environment in the industry 
decrease in rates for accident and health reinsurance and insurance could reduce net income independence american  the company s insurance subsidiary  primarily reinsures accident and health insurance 
rates for accident and health insurance and reinsurance are influenced primarily by factors that are outside of independence american s control and historically have been highly cyclical 
any significant decrease in the rates for accident and health insurance or reinsurance could reduce the company s net income 
if the rating agencies downgrade independence american  the company s results of operations and competitive position in the industry may suffer ratings are an important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies 
independence american is rated b very good by am best company  inc  whose ratings reflect its opinions of an insurance company s financial strength  operating performance  strategic position  and ability to meet its obligations to policyholders  and are not evaluations directed to investors 
the rating of independence american is subject to periodic review by am best company  inc  and the company is not assured of the continued retention of this rating 
if am best company  inc reduces independence american s ratings from its current levels  the company s business would be adversely affected 
the company s loss reserves are based on an estimate of its future liability  and if actual claims prove to be greater than reserves  the company s results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 
the company maintains loss reserves to cover its estimated liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses  including legal and other fees as well as a portion of its general expenses  for reported and unreported claims incurred as of the end of each accounting period 
because setting reserves is inherently uncertain  the company cannot assure that current reserves will prove adequate in light of subsequent events 
if the company reserves are insufficient to cover its actual losses and loss adjustment expenses  it would have to augment its reserves and incur a charge to its earnings  and these charges could be material 
reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability 
rather  reserves represent an estimate of what the company expects the ultimate settlement and administration of claims will cost 
these estimates  which generally involve actuarial projections  are based on the company s assessment of facts and circumstances then known  as well as estimates o f future trends in claims severity  frequency  judicial theories of liability and other factors 
these variables are affected by both internal and external events  such as changes in claims handling procedures  inflation  judicial trends and legislative changes 
many of these items are not directly quantifiable in advance 
additionally  there may be a significant reporting lag between the occurrence of the insured event and the time it is reported 
the inherent uncertainties of estimating reserves are greater for certain types of liabilities  particularly those in which the various considerations affecting the type of claim are subject to change and in which long periods of time may elapse before a definitive determination of liability is made 
reserve estimates are continually refined in a regular and ongoing process as experience develops and further claims are reported and settled 
adjustments to reserves are reflected in the results of the periods in which such estimates are changed 
inability to assess underwriting risk accurately could reduce its net income the company s success is dependent on its ability to assess accurately the risks associated with the businesses on which the risk is retained 
if the company fails to assess accurately the risks it retains  it may fail to establish the appropriate premium rates and its reserves may be inadequate to cover its losses  requiring augmentation of the company reserves  and a reduction in future profit commissions which in turn could reduce net income 
if the company is unsuccessful in competing against larger or more well established competitors  its results of operations and financial condition will be adversely affected the company s industry is highly competitive and has experienced severe price competition from time to time over the last several years 
the company faces competition from domestic and international insurance and reinsurance companies  underwriting agencies  and from diversified financial services companies that are significantly larger than the company 
some of these competitors have greater financial  marketing and other resources  have been operating longer than the company and have established long term and continuing business relationships through the industry  which can be a significant competitive advantage 
in addition to competition in the operation of its business  the company faces competition from a variety of sources in attracting and retaining qualified employees 
the company cannot assure that it will maintain its current competitive position in the markets in which it operates  or that it will be able to expand its operations into new markets and compete effectively in the future 
if the company fails to do so  its business could be materially adversely affected 
if the company fails to comply with extensive state and federal regulations  it will be subject to penalties  which may include fines and suspension and which may adversely affect its results of operations and financial condition 
the company is subject to extensive governmental regulation and supervision 
most insurance regulations are designed to protect the interests of policyholders rather than stockholders and other investors 
this regulation  generally administered by a department of insurance in each state in which it does business  relates to  among other things approval of policy forms and premium rates  standards of solvency  including risk based capital measurements  which are a measure developed by the national association of insurance commissioners and used by state insurance regulators to identify insurance companies that potentially are inadequately capitalized  licensing of insurers and their agents  restrictions on the nature  quality and concentration of investments  restrictions on the ability of independence american s to pay dividends to the company  restrictions on transactions between insurance companies and their affiliates  restrictions on the size of risks insurable under a single policy  requiring deposits for the benefit of policyholders  requiring certain methods of accounting  periodic examinations of the company s operations and finances  prescribing the form and content of records of financial condition required to be filed  and requiring reserves for unearned premium  losses and other purposes 
state insurance departments also conduct periodic examinations of the affairs of insurance companies and require the filing of annual and other reports relating to the financial condition of insurance companies  holding company issues and other matters 
recently adopted federal financial services modernization legislation is expected to lead to additional federal regulation of the insurance industry in the coming years 
the company s business depends on compliance with applicable laws and regulations and its ability to maintain valid licenses and approvals for its operations 
regulatory authorities have broad discretion to grant  renew  or revoke licenses and approvals 
regulatory authorities may deny or revoke licenses for various reasons  including the violation or regulations 
in some instances  the company follows practices based on its interpretations of regulations  or those that it believes to be generally followed by the industry  which may be different from the requirements or interpretations of regulatory authorities 
if the company does not have the requisite licenses and approvals and does not comply with applicable regulatory requirements  the insurance regulatory authorities could preclude or temporarily suspend it from carrying on some or all of its activities or otherwise penalize it 
that type of action could have a material adverse effect on its business 
also  changes in the level of regulation of the in surance industry whether federal  state or foreign  or changes in laws or regulations themselves or interpretations by regulatory authorities  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
certain proposed federal and state legislation may  if adopted  adversely affect the company s reinsurance of medical stop loss 
individuals who obtain health coverage through self insured plans cannot currently sue their employer in state court for punitive or compensatory damages  but can seek legal recourse in federal court where an employer can be ordered to cover a wrongfully denied benefit 
in the continuing debate over health care reform  certain federal and state legislation has been proposed which could have the effect of making plan sponsors  administrators  or certain other parties liable for punitive damages in state court 
while the company cannot predict whether any of these proposals will be adopted or what  if any  impact enactment of any of these would have on its reinsurance of medical stop loss  the number of employers offering health benefits or choosing self insured plans could be reduced  plans could increase the portion paid by employees thereby reducing participation  pricing and coverage options could be affected  and the company could be faced with greater liability exposure 
decreases in the fair market value of fixed income securities may greatly reduce the value of the company s investment portfolio  and as a result  the company s financial condition may suffer at december   million of the company s million investment portfolio was invested in fixed income securities 
the fair market value of these fixed income securities and the investment income from these fixed income securities fluctuate depending on general economic and market conditions 
with respect to the company s investments in fixed income securities  the fair market value of these investments generally increases or decreases in an inverse relationship with fluctuations in interest rates  while net investment income realized by the company from future investments in fixed income securities will generally increase or decrease with interest rates 
in addition  actual net investment income and or cash flows from investments that carry prepayment risk  such as mortgage backed and other asset backed securities  may differ from those anticipated at the time of investment as a result of interest rate fluctuations 
an investment has prepayment risk when there is a risk that the timing of cash flows that result from the repayment of principal might occur earlier than anticipated because of declining interest rates or later than anticipated because of rising interest rates 
historically  the impact of market fluctuations has affected the company s financial statements 
because all of the company s fixed income securities are classified as available for sale  changes in the fair market value of the company s securities are reflected in the company s other comprehensive income 
similar treatment is not available for liabilities 
therefore  interest rate fluctuations and economic conditions could aversely affect the company s stockholders equity  total comprehensive income loss and or cash flows 
regulatory restrictions limit the company s ability to obtain dividends from independence american one of the company s principal assets through its ownership of iahc  is the shares of capital stock of independence american 
the company may rely on dividends from independence american to meet its obligations for paying principal and interest on outstanding debt obligations  dividends to stockholders and corporate expenses 
the payment of dividends by independence american is subject to regulatory restrictions and will depend on the surplus and future earnings of independence american  as well as the regulatory restrictions 
as a result  should the company s other sources of funds prove to be inadequate 
the company may not be able to receive dividends from independence american at times and in amounts necessary to meet its obligations
