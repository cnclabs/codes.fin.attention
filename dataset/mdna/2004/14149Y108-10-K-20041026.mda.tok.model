in connection with certain conclusions made by the audit committee during september and october as part of its internal review to date  the company made certain reclassification and restatement adjustments to its fiscal and prior historical financial statements  as more fully described in notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements 
revenue previously disclosed separately as bulk deliveries to customer warehouses and others has been aggregated with operating revenue resulting in combined revenue being reported in the financial statements 
in addition  the company changed its accounting method for recognizing income from cash discounts 
the company also reduced its fourth quarter fiscal results of operations for premature revenue recognition within its automation and information services segment after assessing the impact this segment s sales practice had on the company s results of operations for the three year period ended june  lastly  the company restated its financial statements for fiscal   and and the first three quarters of fiscal as a result of various misapplications of gaap and errors relating primarily to balance sheet reserve and accrual adjustments recorded in prior periods 
as a result  the company supplemented its historical disclosures within management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations to reflect these reclassification and restatement adjustments on previously reported company and business segment operating earnings performance 
all prior period disclosures presented in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations have been adjusted to reflect these changes

results of operations the following summarizes the company s results of operations for the fiscal years ended june   and in millions  except per common share amounts growth results of operations years ended june  adjusted restated restated revenue    operating earnings    earnings from continuing operations before cumulative effect of change in accounting    net earnings    net diluted earnings per common share growth is calculated as change increase or decrease for a given year as compared to immediately preceding year 
during the fiscal years noted in the table above  the results of operations reflect the breadth of products and services the company offers 
the increasing demand for the company s diverse portfolio of products and services led to revenue growth in every segment of the company 
the company continues to experience strong demand for integrated solutions from health care providers 
these integrated solutions include products and services from multiple lines of businesses within the company 
these arrangements currently represent nearly billion of annual sales 
as of june   the company s operations were organized into four operating business segments pharmaceutical distribution and provider services  medical products and services  pharmaceutical technologies and services and automation and information services see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for discussion of changes to business segments resulting from the alaris acquisition which will impact fiscal 
the results of operations also reflect the increasing operating earnings contribution each segment outside of pharmaceutical distribution and provider services is making 
the three segments outside of pharmaceutical distribution and provider services have gradually increased the amount of operating earnings contributed to the company and currently represent more than one half of the company s operating earnings 
the company expects this trend to continue 
as previously reported  the company s pharmaceutical distribution business is in the midst of a business model transition with respect to how it is compensated for the logistical  capital and administrative services that it provides to pharmaceutical manufacturers 
historically  the compensation received by the pharmaceutical distribution business from pharmaceutical manufacturers was based on each manufacturer s unique sales practices eg  volume of product available for sale  eligibility to purchase product  cash discounts for prompt payment  rebates  etc 
and pharmaceutical pricing practices eg  the timing  frequency and magnitude of product price increases 
specifically  a significant portion of the compensation the pharmaceutical distribution business received from manufacturers was derived through the company s ability to purchase pharmaceutical inventory in advance of pharmaceutical price increases  hold that inventory as manufacturers increased pharmaceutical prices  and generate a higher operating margin on the subsequent sale of that inventory 
this compensation system was dependent to a large degree upon the sales practices of each pharmaceutical manufacturer  including established policies concerning the volume of product available for purchase in advance of a price increase  and on stable and predictable pharmaceutical pricing practices 
beginning in fiscal  pharmaceutical manufacturers began to seek greater control over the amount of pharmaceutical product available in the supply chain  and  as a result  began to change their sales practices by restricting the volume of product available for purchase by pharmaceutical wholesalers 
in addition  manufacturers have increasingly sought more services from the company  including the provision of data concerning product sales and distribution patterns 
the company believes these changes have been made to provide greater visibility to pharmaceutical manufacturers over product demand and movement in the market and to increase product safety and integrity by reducing the risks associated with product being available to  and distributed in  the secondary market 
nevertheless  the impact of these changes has significantly reduced the compensation received by the company from pharmaceutical manufacturers 
in addition  since the fourth quarter of fiscal  pharmaceutical manufacturers product pricing practices have become less predictable  as the frequency of product price increases generally has slowed versus historical levels 
as a result of these actions by pharmaceutical manufacturers  the company is no longer being adequately and consistently compensated for the reliable and consistent logistical  capital and administrative services being provided by the company to these manufacturers 
in response to the developments discussed above  the company is working to establish a compensation system that is no longer dependent on manufacturers sales or pricing practices  but rather is based on the services provided by the company to meet the unique distribution requirements of each manufacturer s products 
to that end  the company is working with individual pharmaceutical manufacturers to define fee for service terms that will adequately compensate the company  in light of each product s unique distribution requirements  for the logistical  capital and administrative services being provided by the company 
to accelerate this process  in august  the company communicated to its pharmaceutical manufacturing vendors a new policy which sets april  or  for manufacturers with an existing agreement with the company  the next anniversary date of such agreement  as the deadline by which manufacturers must have entered into a mutually satisfactory distribution services agreement with the company providing for reliable  predictable and adequate compensation for the company s services 
for any manufacturer with which the company is unable to enter into such a mutually satisfactory agreement  the company plans to assist such manufacturer in transitioning to another method of distribution 
there can be no assurance that this business model transition will be successful  or of the timing of such a successful transition 
revenue and operating earnings growth within the company s automation and information services segment during fiscal were lower than historical growth rates 
these growth rates were adversely affected by softening demand  attributable to capital spending pressures experienced by hospitals and increased competition within the industry 
the company believes this trend may continue in the short term  however  the company remains confident in the long term prospects for this segment as patient safety concerns combined with innovative new products continue to lead to future demand 
government investigations and audit committee internal review the company is currently the subject of a formal investigation by the sec relating to certain accounting matters 
the company also learned that the us attorney for the southern district of new york has commenced an inquiry with respect to the company 
also  the company s audit committee commenced its own internal review  assisted by independent counsel

product safety as a leading provider of products and services supporting the health care industry  including the distribution of pharmaceuticals and other health care products  the company is monitoring issues regarding importation of pharmaceuticals and other health care products 
the company is sensitive to the issue of pharmaceutical prices and the pricing disparity between domestic and international markets 
however  the company believes that for importation into the united states to be successful additional controls and protections would need to be implemented to ensure patients and consumers receive safe and effective pharmaceutical products 
the company will continue to work proactively with all participants and regulators in the pharmaceutical supply chain to help ensure any solution is safe and efficient 
the company continues to work with its suppliers to help minimize the risks associated with counterfeit products in the supply chain 
acquisitions on june   the company acquired approximately of the outstanding common stock of alaris  a leading provider of intravenous medication safety products and services 
on july   alaris merged with a subsidiary of the company to complete the transaction 
the value of the transaction  including the assumption of alaris debt  totaled nearly billion 
for further information regarding the alaris acquisition  the valuation of the acquisition s intangibles  and the impact on segment reporting  see notes  and of notes to consolidated financial statements 
prior to the completion of the alaris acquisition  on june   icu medical  inc filed a patent infringement lawsuit against alaris in the united states district court for the southern district of california 
in the lawsuit  icu claims that the alaris smartsite r family of needle free valves and systems infringes upon icu patents 
icu seeks monetary damages plus permanent injunctive relief preventing alaris from selling smartsite r products 
on july   the court denied icu s application for a preliminary injunction finding  among other things  that icu had failed to show a substantial likelihood of success on the merits 
the company intends to vigorously defend this action 
during december  the company completed its acquisition of intercare  a leading european pharmaceutical products and services company 
this acquisition increased the company s scale of proprietary sterile manufacturing and broadened its participation in the fast growing european generic including manufacturing capabilities and injectible product market 
the cash transaction was valued at approximately million  including the assumption of approximately million in intercare debt 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the impact this acquisition had on the company s segment reporting 
during fiscal  and  the company completed numerous acquisitions  including  but not limited to  alaris  intercare and syncor 
the company s trend with regard to acquisitions has been to expand its role as a provider of services to the health care industry 
this trend has resulted in expansion into areas which a complement the company s existing operations  and b provide opportunities for the company to develop synergies with  and thus strengthen  the acquired business 
as the health care industry continues to change  the company evaluates possible candidates for merger or acquisition and intends to continue to seek opportunities to expand its role as a provider of services to the health care industry through all its reporting segments 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to successfully pursue any such opportunity or consummate any such transaction  if pursued 
to the extent the company continues to pursue acquisitions  its ability to complete such transactions may be adversely affected by the government investigations described under part i  item legal proceedings and note of notes to consolidated financial statements in this form k 
if additional transactions are pursued or consummated  the company would incur additional merger and acquisition related costs  and may need to enter into funding arrangements for such mergers or acquisitions 
there can be no assurance that the integration efforts associated with any such transaction would be successful

total company 
revenue increased and during fiscal and  respectively 
the revenue growth in these fiscal years resulted from a higher sales volume across each of the company s segments  revenue growth from existing customers  addition of new customers  some of which resulted from new corporate arrangements with health care providers that integrate the company s diverse offerings  addition of new products  and pharmaceutical price increases averaging approximately and  respectively  during fiscal and in addition  acquisitions completed by the company during fiscal and accounted for approximately of the overall growth for fiscal and these increases during fiscal were partially offset by slower sales growth within the pharmaceutical technologies and services and automation and information services segments 
pharmaceutical distribution and provider services 
this segment s revenue growth of in fiscal resulted primarily from strong sales to existing customers  sales to new customers and pharmaceutical price increases 
sales growth to existing customers within the retail chain and alternate site categories in this segment s pharmaceutical distribution business showed particular strength 
this segment also benefited from contract wins during fiscal  pharmaceutical price increases averaging approximately during fiscal  and an extra business day 
these revenue gains were partially dampened by continued reduction in business with kmart holding corp 
kmart due to kmart s closure of various stores and certain contract losses during fiscal in this segment s pharmaceutical distribution business 
this segment s revenue growth of in fiscal resulted from strong sales to customers within the segment s core pharmaceutical distribution business  some of which were generated from the addition of new contracts  and pharmaceutical price increases averaging approximately 
the most significant growth was in the alternate site and chain pharmacy businesses 
the chain pharmacy growth rate would have been stronger had it not experienced a reduction in business with kmart due to kmart s closure of various stores in connection with its reorganization 
this segment s overall revenue growth was partially dampened by the loss of certain customers 
medical products and services 
this segment s revenue growth of in fiscal resulted from increased sales momentum from new and existing contracts within the distribution business as well as increased sales volume from the segment s international businesses 
new contracts drove increased sales of both distributed and self manufactured products  with sales from the distribution business particularly strong during fiscal the international businesses also generated strong revenue growth  increasing nearly from the prior fiscal year 
approximately of the international business revenue growth  however  related to changes in foreign currency rates 
sales of new self manufactured products  particularly enhancements within surgeon glove products  also contributed to the overall revenue growth 
this segment s revenue growth was above industry averages during fiscal this segment s revenue growth of in fiscal resulted from increased sales of both distributed and self manufactured products 
the addition of several new contracts with hospitals and health care networks  as well as increased market share in the growing surgery center market contributed to increased sales of distributed and self manufactured products 
increased demand for certain existing self manufactured products  including medical gloves  medi vac r suction canisters  procedure based delivery system r kits and other minor procedure trays  accounted for a portion of this segment s revenue growth 
the addition of new  self manufactured products also contributed to the overall revenue growth in this segment 
some examples of these new  self manufactured products include the esteem r surgeon gloves and the tiburon tm and astound tm fabrics within the convertors r business 
pharmaceutical technologies and services 
this segment s revenue growth of in fiscal resulted from acquisitions and sales momentum within the pharmaceutical development  nuclear pharmacy services and packaging services businesses 
approximately of this segment s revenue growth was due to the inclusion of intercare  an acquisition completed during december intercare s results of operations are not included in the prior period amounts 
intercare s operations have shown considerable sales momentum since the acquisition was completed  particularly the fourth quarter fiscal also  this segment s revenue growth benefited from the inclusion of syncor  an acquisition that was completed on january  syncor s results of operations are not included in the amounts for the first half fiscal excluding the impact of acquisitions within this segment  revenue growth would have been approximately during fiscal this segment s revenue growth was partially dampened by a delay in startup of commercial manufacturing of key sterile products from signed contracts as certain regulatory inspections and product approvals were delayed in the biotechnology and sterile life sciences business 
this segment s revenue growth is not impacted by foreign exchange fluctuations as the company applies constant exchange rates to translate its foreign operations revenue into us dollars 
the impact of actual foreign exchange rate changes for translation purposes is retained within the corporate segment see footnote of the table in note in notes to consolidated financial statements 
this segment s revenue growth of in fiscal resulted from acquisitions and increased demand within the oral technologies  biotechnology and sterile life sciences  and packaging services businesses 
the acquisitions of syncor  effective january   and boron  lepore associates  inc which has been given the legal designation of cardinal health  inc  and is referred to in this form k as blp  effective june  resulted in significant revenue growth in fiscal blp s revenue includes customer reimbursements of out of pocket expenses  which generally comprise travel expenses and other incidental costs incurred to fulfill the services required by various contracts and are recorded as gross revenue 
excluding the impact of acquisitions within this segment  revenue growth would have been approximately during fiscal product sales from this segment s businesses that showed particular strength included lilly s zyprexa r zydis r  an anti psychotic  mylan s amnesteem tm  a generic drug for the treatment of acne  and sepracor s xoponex r  a respiratory drug 
the growth within the biotechnology and sterile life sciences business was negatively impacted by the planned shutdown for twelve weeks of a domestic sterile manufacturing facility to expand capacity 
automation and information services 
this segment s revenue growth of in fiscal is reflective of the premature revenue recognition adjustment resulting from the audit committee s internal review as more fully described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
operationally  this segment s revenue growth in fiscal included sales growth within the medication product lines such as the pyxis medstation r system and addition of new products 
this segment was adversely affected by a softening of demand at the hospital level 
the company believes this softening is primarily attributable to capital spending pressures experienced by hospitals and an increasingly competitive market 
these factors were also seen in the weakening of this segment s committed contract backlog 
the company believes this trend may continue in the short term  however  the company remains confident in the long term prospects for this segment as patient safety concerns combine with innovative new products to drive future demand 
in order to aid in the comparability of this segment s operating results  during fiscal  the company recorded a corporate allocation adjustment to this segment s revenue of million representing an estimate of interest income this segment would have earned had the company not completed sales of its lease receivables 
this allocation was recorded within revenue  consistent with the recording of interest income received from sales type leases 
the allocation was recorded for comparative purposes to reflect the segment s growth rate excluding the impact of the corporate initiated lease sales 
excluding the impact of this allocation entry  this segment s revenue growth would have been negative for fiscal for more information  see footnote to the table in note in notes to consolidated financial statements 
this segment s revenue growth of in fiscal resulted from strong sales of new and existing patient safety and supply management product lines  including pyxis medstation r  pyxis anesthesia system tm  pyxis connect tm and pyxis supplystation r systems 
in addition  the segment s revenue benefited in fiscal from gains of approximately million  realized upon sales of its sales type lease receivables 
bulk deliveries to customer warehouses and other as presented historically  the pharmaceutical distribution and provider services segment s revenue was classified into two categories operating revenue and bulk deliveries to customer warehouses and other 
bulk deliveries to customer warehouses and other has historically included revenue arising from sales where the company ordered pharmaceutical product in bulk on behalf of a specific warehousing customer and either the manufacturer ships the product directly to the customer s warehouse or the product is shipped to the customer s warehouse shortly after it is received by the company and is not put into the company s inventory in either case  bulk revenue 
for all bulk revenue  the product was shipped to the customer in the same bulk form in which it was received by the company from the manufacturers 
the company previously since fiscal followed an internal policy for distinguishing between operating revenue and bulk revenue based on how long the product was in the company s possession prior to being shipped to customers 
if the product was in the possession of the company for more than hours prior to being shipped to customers  then  regardless of other characteristics of the transaction or the reason for the product being held for more than hours  the sale of that product was deemed to be operating revenue 
the company s internal policy also provided that customer orders for bulk shipments filled from inventory within the company s warehouse were deemed to be operating revenue if the order for the product had been placed with the manufacturer prior to the company receiving the bulk order from one of its customers just in time 
operating revenue for bulk shipments for product that was in the possession of the company for more than hours prior to being shipped to customers other than with respect to certain bulk shipments intentionally held for more than hours as described in the text following the table and just in time bulk shipments by quarter for the three year period ended june  was approximately as follows hour rule just in time in millions fiscal year ended june  fiscal year ended june  first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter total year   based on results of the internal review conducted by the audit committee  the company has concluded that certain bulk shipments ordered by customers were intentionally held for more than hours so that  pursuant to the internal policy  such shipments were classified as operating revenue in four quarters within fiscal and the company estimates that approximately million and million being improperly classified as operating revenue in fiscal and  respectively 
the impact of this practice was not previously quantified and disclosed as part of the company s reported operating revenue 
the improper classification between bulk revenue and operating revenue had no impact on the company s previously reported total revenue or operating or net earnings for these periods 
the following table shows the estimated amount of bulk revenue that was improperly classified as operating revenue in the manner described above  and shows the estimated impact from adjusting each of bulk revenue and operating revenue for the periods in which these improper classifications occurred bulk revenue operating revenue fiscal year ended june  fiscal year ended june  in millions first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter total year in response to the internal review conducted by the company s audit committee see part i  item legal proceedings and note of notes to consolidated financial statements and a review of company policies  the company has changed its definition of bulk revenue 
transactions with the following characteristics will now be defined as bulk revenue a deliveries to customer warehouses whereby the company acts as an intermediary in the ordering and delivery of pharmaceutical products  b delivery of products to the customer in the same bulk form as the products are received from the manufacturer  c warehouse to customer warehouse or process center deliveries  or d deliveries to customers in large or high volume full case quantities 
bulk revenue under this new definition was billion in fiscal  billion in fiscal and billion in fiscal the increase in bulk revenue during fiscal primarily relates to additional volume from existing customers 
the increase in bulk revenue during fiscal primarily relates to new customers and additional volume from existing customers 
for fiscal  the company decided to aggregate revenue classes within this form k 
operating revenue and bulk deliveries to customer warehouses and other have been combined for all periods presented so that revenue and cost of products sold are presented as single amounts in the consolidated statements of earnings 
these reclassifications have no effect on previously reported total revenue  related cost of products sold  net earnings or earnings per share 
however  these reclassifications do impact previously reported growth rates which focused solely on operating revenue 
beginning with this form k  information concerning the portion of the company s revenue that arises from bulk revenue will be discussed in the company s management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
in the past  bulk deliveries to customer warehouses and other also included certain revenue relating to the pharmaceutical technologies and services segment 
the pharmaceutical technologies and services segment s revenue classified as bulk deliveries to customer warehouses and other represented reimbursement from customers of certain out of pocket expenses incurred by the company on behalf of customers and totaled million in fiscal these customer reimbursements will not be included within the company s definition of bulk revenue going forward 
operating earnings operating earnings for the company and its reportable segments are as follows in millions restated restated pharmaceutical distribution and provider services    medical products and services pharmaceutical technologies and services automation and information services corporate total company operating earnings    see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a description of corporate operating earnings 
the following table summarizes the operating earnings growth rates for the company and its reportable segments  as well as the percent of company operating earnings  excluding corporate  each segment represents percent of company growth operating earnings years ended june  adjusted adjusted adjusted pharmaceutical distribution and provider services medical products and services pharmaceutical technologies and services automation and information services total company growth is calculated as change increase or decrease for a given year as compared to immediately preceding year 
the company s overall operating earnings growth of and  respectively  in fiscal and includes the effect of special items 
special items are not allocated to the segments 
see note in notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the company s special items 
total company 
total operating earnings increased and during fiscal and  respectively 
the following paragraphs provide a description of the varying dynamics affecting the total company s operating earnings for fiscal and fiscal operating earnings increased during fiscal primarily as a result of the company s revenue growth of during the same time period  which yielded a gross margin increase of 
gross margins grew at a slower rate than revenue primarily as a result of continued dampening effect of reduced vendor margins and competitive pricing within the pharmaceutical distribution business driven by changes to its business model see the overview section for further discussion  increased mix of lower margin distribution business within the medical products and services segment  increased mix of lower margin business  primarily nuclear pharmacy services  within the pharmaceutical technologies and services segment  and competitive product and pricing actions within the automation and information services segment 
the overall increase in gross margin reflects the increased contributions from the company s operating segments outside of the pharmaceutical distribution and provider services segment  which generate higher gross margins and operating earnings as a percentage of revenue 
these segments currently account for more than one half of the company s operating earnings 
the company expects this trend to continue 
acquisitions completed by the company accounted for approximately of the operating earnings growth 
the increases in revenue and gross margin were partially offset by a increase in selling  general and administrative expenses during fiscal  as well as an increase of million in the company s special items 
the overall increase in operating expenses was primarily a result of the additional expenses resulting from acquisitions  higher personnel costs associated with overall business growth and an increase in depreciation and amortization costs 
additionally  the company continues to invest in research and development and strategic initiatives that will benefit future periods 
investments of approximately million in fiscal were charged against current operating earnings as incurred 
these increases in selling  general and administrative expenses were offset partially by reduction versus the prior fiscal year in incentive compensation expenses of approximately million due to the performance of the company s consolidated operations relative to management s expectations and established financial performance metrics  such reductions affecting all of the company s business segments  and adjustments of certain trade receivable reserves and lower bad debt expenses  combined impact approximately million  due to changes in customer specific credit exposures  as well as improvements in customer credit  billing and collection processes yielding significant reductions in past due and uncollectible accounts 
fiscal the company attributes the operating earnings increase of during fiscal to its revenue growth of during the same time period  which yielded a gross margin increase of 
selling  general and administrative expenses grew during this period primarily due to additional expenses resulting from acquisitions  higher personnel costs associated with the overall business growth and an increase in depreciation and amortization costs 
however  selling  general and administrative expenses grew at a slower rate than gross margin which contributed to the overall percentage increase in operating earnings 
in addition  a significant contributor of the overall operating earnings increase was a decrease of million in the company s special items due to the recognition of special item income of million related to net litigation settlements received by the company in fiscal as compared to million received in fiscal pharmaceutical distribution and provider services 
this segment s operating earnings declined during fiscal primarily due to reduced vendor margins caused by the changing business model within the pharmaceutical distribution business as further described in the overview section and the impact of competitive pricing 
other adjustments which negatively impacted this segment in fiscal included the following items within the pharmaceutical distribution business a an increase in inventory valuation and vendor dispute reserves in the fourth quarter  million  and b an adverse adjustment in the third quarter  million  for vendor margins 
in addition  one of several aspects of the business model transition adversely impacting pharmaceutical distribution s year over year operating earnings is the change in estimation of vendor margin with generic  health and beauty products and pharmaceutical manufacturers  approximately million 
these declines were partially offset by the following segment revenue growth of coupled with expense control  change in accounting for cash discounts resulting in additional gross margin of million in fiscal see additional discussion of the accounting change in notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements  favorable year over year impact  million  from changes in last in  first out lifo reserve  favorable year over year impact of lower incentive compensation expense  favorable year over year impact of certain non recurring expenses recorded in fiscal relating to operations from the bindley acquisition  and favorable year over year impact of million charge recorded in fiscal relating to the segment s vendor margins with its generic suppliers 
this segment s operating earnings increase of during fiscal resulted primarily from the following segment revenue growth of  change in timing of income recognition for pharmaceutical manufacturers payments under existing inventory management agreements from a modified cash basis to an accrual basis resulting in a favorable gross margin impact of approximately million recorded in the third quarter  expense controls  which resulted in a decrease of in selling  general and administrative expenses  and favorable year over year impact  million  relating to changes in corporate expenses allocated to this segment 
also contributing to the improvement in fiscal year over year performance were certain non recurring expenses of approximately million recorded in fiscal associated with operations acquired as part of the bindley acquisition 
these non recurring expenses in fiscal were partially offset by a million benefit recognized in the same period as a result of changes in the company s lifo calculation with respect to generic products in order to more accurately reflect inflationary indices 
the segment s operating earnings in fiscal were negatively impacted by the million year over year impact within the pharmaceutical distribution business of the business model transition impacting its vendor margins with generic  health and beauty products and pharmaceutical vendors 
medical products and services 
this segment s operating earnings growth of during fiscal resulted primarily from this segment s revenue growth of during the same time period  led by sales momentum from distribution contracts and gains within international markets 
this segment also realized manufacturing productivity improvements resulting in gross margin gains 
in addition  operating earnings benefited from lower incentive compensation expense versus prior year 
this segment s operating earnings growth was partially dampened by the increased mix of lower margin distributed products  competitive pricing within the industry and an increase of approximately million in raw material prices 
this segment s operating earnings growth of during fiscal resulted from this segment s revenue growth of during the same time period and the ability to leverage this revenue growth into additional gross margin gains 
this segment s gross margin was positively impacted by increased sales of existing and new higher margin  self manufactured products  manufacturing efficiencies achieved during the fiscal year and outsourcing of some product manufacturing to more cost efficient areas 
in addition  operating earnings benefited from various required balance sheet reserve adjustments  approximately million  recorded during the year relating to historical customer and vendor disputes 
the operating earnings growth rate was negatively affected by impact of new distribution agreements which increased sales of lower margin distributed products in fiscal  increased corporate expenses  million  allocated to this segment  and a one time adjustment recorded in fiscal to transfer the segment s incentive compensation expenses  approximately million  to the corporate segment 
this adjustment was recorded in the corporate segment as the business segment s stand alone incentive compensation program in effect at the time would have resulted in no incentive compensation expense for the year  however  a corporate management decision was made to include the segment s employees in the company s overall incentive compensation program in advance of integrating various employee benefit programs 
pharmaceutical technologies and services 
this segment s operating earnings growth of during fiscal resulted primarily from this segment s revenue growth of during the same time period  with sales momentum in the pharmaceutical development  nuclear pharmacy services and packaging services businesses showing particular strength 
this segment also benefited from acquisitions completed by the company  specifically intercare and syncor 
the acquisition of intercare was completed during the second quarter fiscal and  therefore  its results of operations are not included in the prior period 
also  syncor s results of operations are not included in the first half of fiscal since the acquisition was completed on january  excluding the impact of acquisitions within this segment  operating earnings growth would have been approximately during fiscal this segment s gross margin as a percentage of revenue was negatively impacted by the increase in services provided by the nuclear pharmacy services business  which has a lower gross margin ratio as compared to the other businesses within this segment 
the segment s operating earnings also benefited year over year by reduced incentive compensation expenses 
operating earnings growth was dampened by the delay in startup of commercial manufacturing of certain sterile products as discussed in this segment s revenue discussion 
in addition  this segment s operating earnings growth is not impacted by foreign exchange fluctuations as the company applies constant exchange rates to translate its foreign operations operating earnings into us dollars 
the impact of actual foreign exchange rate changes for translation purposes is retained within the corporate segment see footnote to the table in note in notes to consolidated financial statements 
this segment s operating earnings growth of during fiscal resulted primarily from this segment s revenue growth of during the same time period  as discussed above in the revenue section 
excluding the impact of acquisitions within this segment  operating earnings growth would have been approximately during fiscal the deleveraging effect between gross margin and revenue within this segment was primarily driven by the addition of syncor s nuclear pharmacy services business and the addition of blp s customer reimbursements of out of pocket expenses incurred to fulfill services required by various contracts 
syncor has a lower gross margin ratio than the other businesses within this segment  and blp records these customer reimbursements gross within revenue and cost of products sold  but generates no margin from them 
automation and information services 
this segment s operating earnings growth of during fiscal was impacted by the premature revenue recognition adjustment resulting from the audit committee s internal review as more fully described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
this segment s operating earnings growth during fiscal resulted  in part  from this segment s revenue growth of during the same time period in conjunction with operational improvements and favorable product mix 
in addition  this segment benefited from a reduction in receivable reserves and lower bad debt expenses  combined impact approximately million  due to improvements in customer specific credit matters  as well as general improvements in customer credit  billing and collection procedures  resulting in significant reductions in past due and uncollectible accounts 
the segment s operating earnings also benefited year over year from reduced a incentive compensation expenses  and b corporate expense allocation of million 
as mentioned in this segment s revenue discussion  the company recorded  for comparative purposes  a corporate allocation of million to this segment representing estimated interest income this segment would have earned had the company not initiated the sale of its lease receivables 
excluding the impact of this allocation  this segment s operating earnings growth would have been negative during fiscal see this segment s discussion under revenue for additional information regarding this allocation entry 
this segment s operating earnings growth of during fiscal resulted primarily from this segment s revenue growth of during the same time period in conjunction with an improved mix of higher margin products sold and productivity gains realized from operational improvements 
in addition  operating earnings during fiscal included gains of approximately million from sales of sales type leases

provision for income taxes the provisions for income taxes relative to earnings before income taxes  discontinued operations and cumulative effect of changes in accounting were of pretax earnings in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal fluctuations in the effective tax rate are primarily due to changes within state and foreign effective tax rates resulting from the company s business mix and changes in the tax impact of special items  which may have unique tax implications depending on the nature of the item and the taxing jurisdiction 
the company s effective tax rate reflects tax benefits derived from increasing operations outside the united states  which are generally taxed at rates lower than the us statutory rate of percent 
during fiscal  the company s provision for income taxes benefited from increased profits from production in lower tax international countries eg  thailand and the dominican republic 
the company has subsidiaries operating in puerto rico under a tax incentive agreement expiring in  as well as a tax agreement in place with thailand that expires in loss from discontinued operations see note in notes to consolidated financial statements for information on the company s discontinued operations 
critical accounting policies and sensitive accounting estimates critical accounting policies are those accounting policies that can have a significant impact on the presentation of the company s financial condition and results of operations  and require use of complex and subjective estimates based upon past experience and management s judgment 
because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates  actual results may differ from these estimates 
below are those policies applied in preparing the company s financial statements that management believes are the most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions 
for additional accounting policies  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
trade receivables comprise amounts owed to the company through its operating activities and are presented net of an allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company also provides financing to various customers 
such financing arrangements range from one year to ten years at interest rates that generally fluctuate with the prime rate 
these financings may be collateralized  guaranteed by third parties or unsecured 
finance notes and accrued interest receivables are recorded net of an allowance for doubtful accounts and are included in other assets 
extending credit terms and calculating the required allowance for doubtful accounts involve the use of judgment by the company s management 
in determining the appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts  which includes general and specific reserves  the company reviews accounts receivable agings  industry trends  customer financial strength  credit standing and payment history to assess the probability of collection 
the company continuously monitors the collectibility of its receivable portfolio by analyzing the aging of its accounts receivable  assessing credit worthiness of its customers and evaluating the impact of changes in economic conditions that may impact credit risks 
if the frequency or severity of customer defaults increases due to changes in customers financial condition or general economic conditions  the company s allowance for uncollectible accounts may require adjustment 
the allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of customer receivables was and at june  and  respectively 
the decrease was a result of adjustments to certain trade receivable reserves due to changes in customer specific credit exposures  as well as improvements in customer credit  billing and collections processes 
a hypothetical increase or decrease in the reserve as a percentage of trade receivables to the fiscal reserve would result in an increase or decrease in bad debt expense of approximately million 
the company believes the reserve maintained and expenses recorded in fiscal year are appropriate and consistent with historical methodologies employed 
the favorable net effect results from improvements in the company s credit and collection practices and actual experiences 
the total reserve at june  and exceeds the total company receivable balance greater than days past due at those same dates 
see schedule ii included in this form k which includes a rollforward of activity for these allowance reserves 
inventories 
a majority of inventories approximately in and in are stated at the lower of cost  using the lifo method  or market  and are primarily merchandise inventories 
the remaining inventory is primarily stated at the lower of cost  using the first in  first out fifo method  or market 
if the company had used the fifo method of inventory valuation  which approximates current replacement cost  inventories would have increased million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
below is a reconciliation of fifo inventory to lifo inventory june  in millions restated fifo inventory   lifo reserve valuation total inventory   inventories recorded on the company s consolidated balance sheets are net of reserves for excess and obsolete inventory 
the company reserves for inventory obsolescence using estimates based on historical experiences  sales trends  specific categories of inventory and age of on hand inventory 
if actual conditions are less favorable than the company s assumptions  additional inventory reserves may be required  however these would not be expected to have a material adverse impact on the company s financial statements 
goodwill 
the company accounts for goodwill in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
under sfas no 
 purchased goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized  but instead tested for impairment annually or when indicators of impairment exist 
accordingly  the company does not amortize goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives 
intangible assets with finite lives  primarily customer relationships and patents and trademarks  continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
in conducting the impairment test  the fair value of the company s reporting units is compared to its carrying amount including goodwill 
if the fair value exceeds the carrying amount  then no impairment exists 
if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value  further analysis is performed to assess impairment 
the company s impairment analysis is based on a review of the price earnings ratio for companies similar in nature  scope and size 
the use of alternative estimates  peer groups or changes in the industry could affect the estimated fair value of the assets and potentially result in impairment 
any identified impairment would result in adjustment to the company s results of operations 
the company completed the required impairment testing in fiscal and and did not incur any impairment charges 
business combinations 
assumptions and estimates are used in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination 
a significant portion of the purchase price in many of the company s acquisitions is assigned to intangible assets which require management to use significant judgment in determining fair value 
the company typically utilizes third party valuation experts valuation experts for this process 
in addition  current and future amortization expense for such intangibles is impacted by purchase price allocations as well as the assessment of estimated useful lives of such intangibles  excluding goodwill 
the company believes the assets recorded and the useful lives established are appropriate based upon current facts and circumstances 
in conjunction with the review of a transaction  the valuation experts assess the status of the acquired company s research and development projects to determine the existence of in process research and development ipr d 
the company has not historically recorded significant costs related to ipr d 
however  in conjunction with the recent acquisition of alaris  the company was required to estimate the fair value of acquired ipr d which required selecting an appropriate discount rate and estimating future cash flows for each project 
management also assessed the current status of development  nature and timing of efforts to complete such development  uncertainties and other factors when estimating the fair value 
costs were not assigned to ipr d unless future development was probable 
once the fair value was determined  an asset was established and immediately written off as a special item in the company s consolidated statement of earnings 
the company recorded million as a special item in fiscal representing an estimate of alaris ipr d see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
special items 
the company s special items consist primarily of costs that relate to the integration of previously acquired companies or costs of restructuring operations to improve productivity 
integration costs from acquisitions accounted for under the pooling of interests method have been recorded in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring  and sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 restructuring and impairment charges 
certain costs related to these acquisitions  such as employee and lease terminations and other facility exit costs  were recognized at the date the integration plan was adopted by management 
certain other integration costs that did not meet the criteria for accrual at the commitment date have been expensed as the integration plan has been implemented 
the costs associated with integrating acquired companies under the purchase method are recorded in accordance with eitf issue no 
 recognition of liabilities in connection with a purchase business combination 
certain costs to be incurred by the company  as the acquirer  such as employee and lease terminations and other facility exit costs  are recognized at the date the integration plan is formalized and adopted by management 
certain other integration costs that do not meet the criteria for accrual at the commitment date are expensed as the integration plan is implemented 
at the beginning of the third quarter fiscal  the company implemented sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  to account for costs incurred in restructuring activities 
under this standard  a liability for an exit cost is recognized as incurred 
as discussed above  the company previously accounted for costs associated with restructuring activities under eitf issue no 
 which required the company to recognize a liability for restructuring costs on the date of the commitment to an exit plan 
the majority of the special items related to acquisitions and restructurings can be classified in one of the following categories employee related costs  exit costs including lease termination costs  asset impairments and other integration costs 
employee costs include severance and termination benefits 
lease termination costs include lease cancellation fees  forfeited deposits and remaining payments due under existing lease agreements less estimated sublease income 
other facility exit costs include costs to move equipment or inventory out of a facility as well as other costs incurred to shut down a facility 
asset impairment costs include the remaining net book value of assets no longer used as a result of the integration or restructuring activities 
other integration costs primarily include charges directly related to the integration plan such as consulting costs related to information systems and employee benefit plans as well as relocation and travel costs directly associated with the integration plan 
actual costs could differ from management s estimates 
if actual results are different from original estimates  the company will record additional expense or reverse previously recorded expenses 
these adjustments will be recorded as special items 
the company also records settlements of significant lawsuits that are infrequent  non recurring or unusual in nature as special items 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statement for additional information 
vendor reserves 
in determining an appropriate vendor reserve  the company assesses historical experience and current outstanding claims 
the company researches and resolves contested transactions based on discussions with vendors  company policy and findings of research performed 
at any given time  there are outstanding items in various stages of research and resolution 
the ultimate outcome of certain claims may be different than the company s original estimate and may require adjustment 
however  the company believes reserves recorded for such disputes are adequate based upon current facts and circumstances 
income tax reserves 
the company has established an estimated liability for federal  state and foreign income tax exposures that arise and meet the criteria for accrual under sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
this liability addresses a number of issues for which the company may have to pay additional taxes and interest when all examinations by taxing authorities are concluded 
the company has developed a methodology for estimating its tax liability related to such matters and has consistently followed such methodology from period to period 
the liability amounts for such matters are based on an evaluation of the underlying facts and circumstances  a thorough research of the technical merits of the company s arguments  and an assessment of the chances of the company prevailing in its arguments 
in all cases  the company considers previous irs findings 
the company generally consults with external tax advisers in researching its conclusions 
amounts accrued for a particular period are not adjusted upward or downward unless a significant change in facts or circumstances has occurred and been formally documented 
loss contingencies 
the company accrues for contingencies related to litigation in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  which requires the company to assess contingencies to determine degree of probability and range of possible settlement 
an estimated loss contingency is accrued in the company s consolidated financial statements if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the settlement can be reasonably estimated 
assessing contingencies is highly subjective and requires judgments about future events 
the company regularly reviews contingencies to determine the adequacy of the accruals and related disclosures 
the amount of ultimate settlement may differ from these estimates 
self insurance accruals 
the company is self insured for employee medical and dental insurance programs 
the company had recorded liabilities totaling million and million for estimated costs related to outstanding claims at june  and  respectively 
these costs include an estimate for expected settlements on pending claims  administrative fees and an estimate for claims incurred but not reported 
these estimates are based on the company s assessment of outstanding claims  historical analysis and current payment trends 
the company records an estimate for the claims incurred but not reported using an estimated lag period 
this lag period assumption has been consistently applied for the periods presented 
if the lag period was adjusted by a period equal to a half month  the impact on earnings would be million 
however  the company believes the liabilities recorded are adequate based upon current facts and circumstances 
the company is also self insured for various general liability and workers compensation claims 
the company had recorded liabilities totaling million and million for anticipated costs related to general liability and workers compensation at june  and  respectively 
these costs include an estimate for expected settlements on pending claims  defense costs and an estimate for claims incurred but not reported 
these estimates are based on the company s assessment of outstanding claims  historical analysis  actuarial information and current payment trends 
the amount of ultimate liability in respect to these matters may differ from these estimates 
liquidity and capital resources sources and uses of cash the following table summarizes the company s consolidated statements of cash flows for fiscal  and fiscal years ended june  in millions restated restated cash provided by used in operating activities   investing activities  financing activities operating activities 
cash provided by operating activities nearly doubled during fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily due to an increase in accounts payable and increased earnings from continuing operations 
the primary driver of the increase in accounts payable was due to the timing of payments at fiscal year end  as well as inventory buys executed shortly before fiscal year end within the company s pharmaceutical distribution business 
in addition  as a result of certain non recurring end of year arrangements  payments to vendors in fiscal were reduced by million due to the acceleration of payments at june  to selected pharmaceutical vendors 
such arrangements resulted in changes to the original payment terms with the vendors for which an economic consideration was exchanged between both parties 
the company s overall investment in inventories declined during fiscal as compared to fiscal due primarily to the changing business model of the pharmaceutical distribution business see the overview section earlier within management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
this business model change should continue to have a positive impact on the company s operating cash flows in the near term  reducing the company s inventory on hand and moderating historical seasonal fluctuations in working capital 
for further discussion of changes within the company s earnings from continuing operations  see the results of operations section 
additionally  the company s operating cash flow benefited by approximately million during fiscal due to sales of lease receivables from the company s automation and information services segment 
see note in notes to consolidated financial statements for information regarding sales of lease receivables 
cash provided by operating activities during fiscal increased million as compared to fiscal primarily due to a increased earnings from continuing operations  and b sales of lease receivables  which benefited the company s operating cash flow by million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal these positive factors were partially offset by year over year impact of i end of year payments to selected pharmaceutical vendors  approximately million  for which economic consideration was exchanged between both parties  and ii accelerated end of year customer receipts  approximately million  for which economic consideration was exchanged between both parties 
the positive factors were also partially offset by increases in trade receivables and inventories 
the increase in trade receivables was driven by the company s revenue growth 
the increase in inventories resulted primarily from increased sales across each of the company s segments 
the rate of increase in inventories was less than in prior years due to the impact of branded to generic product conversions  vendor inventory policies and inventory management agreements 
synergies realized from the bindley integration also lowered the company s investment in inventory 
investing activities 
cash used in investing activities during fiscal  and primarily represents the company s use of cash to complete acquisitions which expand its role as a provider of services to the health care industry see acquisitions and divestitures within part i  item business for further information regarding the company s acquisitions  and develop and enhance the company s infrastructure  including facilities  information systems and other machinery and equipment 
during these fiscal years  the company has focused on developing the infrastructure within its pharmaceutical technologies and services segment 
the uses of cash noted above were partially offset by proceeds received from the sale of property  equipment and other assets  as well as proceeds from the sale of discontinued operations during fiscal and financing activities 
the company s financing activities utilized cash of million and million during fiscal and  respectively  and provided cash of million during fiscal cash used in financing activities during fiscal and primarily reflects the company s decision to repurchase its shares as authorized by its board of directors see share repurchases below for additional information 
these cash outflows for fiscal and were partially offset by net proceeds received from the company s debt facilities see capital resources below for additional information and proceeds received from shares issued under various employee stock plans 
cash provided by financing activities during fiscal primarily reflects the issuance of million of notes  partially offset by repurchase of the company s shares 
international cash the company s cash balance of approximately billion as of june   includes million of cash held by its subsidiaries outside of the united states 
although the vast majority of cash held outside the united states is available for repatriation  doing so could subject it to united states federal income tax 
share repurchases during fiscal  and  the company s board of directors approved  and management completed  several share repurchase programs 
these share repurchase programs  in the aggregate  allowed the company to repurchase billion of the company s shares 
during fiscal  the company repurchased approximately million shares having an average price paid per share of 
during fiscal  the company repurchased approximately million shares having an average price paid per share of 
during fiscal  the company repurchased approximately million shares having an average price paid per share of 
the repurchased shares were placed into treasury to be used for general corporate purposes 
see issuer purchases of equity securities within part i  item market for the registrant s common shares  related shareholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities for further information regarding the company s most recent share repurchase program 
capital resources in addition to cash  the company s sources of liquidity include a billion commercial paper program backed by billion of bank revolving credit facilities  a million extendible commercial note program and a committed receivables sales facility program with capacity to sell million in receivables 
subsequent to june   the capacity under the committed receivables sales facility program was increased to million and the company sold in the aggregate million in receivables under the program for more information regarding this committed receivables sales facility program  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
also subsequent to june   the company received a commitment letter for a million committed borrowing facility to be used for general corporate purposes 
this facility is in the process of being negotiated 
as of june   million of commercial paper was backed by the billion of bank revolving credit facilities  with the remaining facilities unused 
the company also has lines of credit of approximately million  of which million was outstanding as of june  the company maintains two million bank revolving credit facilities 
these facilities are available for general corporate purposes  however  they are primarily used as backstop liquidity for the company s commercial paper program 
during the third quarter of fiscal  the company refinanced its maturing day  million revolving credit facility with a new five year  million revolving credit facility 
management believes that the extension to a five year facility enhanced the company s liquidity profile by reducing refinancing risk at nominal marginal cost 
in connection with adding the new five year revolving credit facility  the company also amended its existing five year million revolving credit facility during the third quarter of fiscal to administratively conform it to the new five year revolving credit facility 
subsequent to june   the company borrowed billion in the aggregate on its revolving credit facilities 
the proceeds from the company s revolving credit facilities were utilized to repay a significant portion of the company s commercial paper program  none of which remained outstanding as of the filing date of this form k  and for general corporate purposes  including the establishment of pharmaceutical inventory at the pharmaceutical distribution business national logistics center in groveport  ohio 
the company had an asset securitization facility which allowed the company to sell receivables generated from its radiopharmaceutical operations to a wholly owned subsidiary  which in turn sold the receivables to a multi seller conduit administered by a third party bank 
this facility allowed for borrowings up to million 
this securitization facility was terminated in fiscal during fiscal  the company retired two series of million notes which matured in during fiscal and  the company issued million of notes due and million of notes due  respectively 
the proceeds of the debt issuances were used for repayment of a portion of the company s indebtedness and general corporate purposes  including working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and investments 
as of june   the company  pursuant to a shelf registration statement filed with the sec  has the capacity available for issuance of up to million of equity and debt securities 
during fiscal  the company entered into an agreement to periodically sell trade receivables to a special purpose accounts receivable and financing entity the accounts receivable and financing entity  which is exclusively engaged in purchasing trade receivables from  and making loans to  the company 
the accounts receivable and financing entity  which is consolidated by the company  issued million and million in preferred variable debt securities to parties not affiliated with the company during fiscal and  respectively 
these preferred debt securities are classified as long term debt in the company s consolidated balance sheet 
these preferred debt securities must be retired or redeemed by the accounts receivable and financing entity before the company  or its creditors  can have access to the accounts receivable and financing entity s receivables 
from time to time  the company considers and engages in acquisition transactions in order to expand its role as a leading provider of services to the health care industry 
the company evaluates possible candidates for merger or acquisition and intends to continue to seek opportunities to expand its role as a provider of services to the health care industry through all its reporting segments 
if additional transactions are entered into or consummated  the company may need to enter into funding arrangements for such mergers or acquisitions 
the company currently believes that  based upon existing cash  operating cash flows  available capital resources as discussed above and other available market transactions  it has adequate capital resources at its disposal to fund currently anticipated capital expenditures  business growth and expansion  contractual obligations and current and projected debt service requirements  including those related to business combinations 
debt ratings covenants the company s senior debt credit ratings from s p  moody s and fitch are bbb  baa and bbb  respectively  the commercial paper ratings are a  p and f  respectively  and the ratings outlooks are negative  on review for possible further downgrade and negative  respectively 
further reductions in the company s credit ratings could negatively impact its ability to access capital as well as its ability to issue additional debt securities at currently available interest rates 
the company s various borrowing facilities and long term debt  except for the preferred debt securities as discussed below  are free of any financial covenants other than minimum net worth which cannot fall below billion at any time 
as of june   the company was in compliance with this covenant 
the company s preferred debt securities contain a minimum adjusted tangible net worth covenant adjusted tangible net worth cannot fall below billion and certain financial ratio covenants 
as of june   the company was in compliance with these covenants 
a breach of any of these covenants would be followed by a grace period during which the company may discuss remedies with the security holders  or extinguish the securities  without causing an event of default 
interest rate and currency risk management the company uses forward currency exchange contracts  currency options and interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to cash flow variability 
the company also uses foreign currency forward contracts and interest rate swaps to protect the value of its existing foreign currency assets and liabilities and the value of its debt 
see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements for information regarding the use of financial instruments and derivatives  including foreign currency hedging instruments 
as a matter of policy  the company rarely engages in speculative transactions involving derivative financial instruments 
during fiscal  the company entered into one speculative interest rate swap transaction resulting in a gain of approximately million 
this gain was recorded in interest expense and other per the consolidated statement of earnings 
contractual obligations as of june   the company s contractual obligations  including estimated payments due by period  are as follows payments due by period in millions thereafter total on balance sheet long term debt   capital lease obligations other long term liabilities off balance sheet operating leases purchase obligations   total financial obligations     represents maturities of the company s long term debt obligations  as shown on the balance sheet

represents maturities of the company s capital lease obligations  included within long term debt on the company s balance sheet 
represents cash outflows by period for certain of the company s long term liabilities in which cash outflows could be reasonably estimated 
the primary items included are estimates of the company s pension and other post retirement benefit obligations as well as accrued marketing fees and other long term liabilities 
certain long term liabilities  such as deferred taxes  have been excluded from the table above as there are no cash outflows associated with the liabilities or the timing of the cash outflows cannot reasonably be estimated 
represents minimum rental payments for operating leases having initial or remaining non cancelable lease terms as described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company also has required lease payments based upon libor which are not included in the above amounts due to variability related to such payments 
see description of these leases in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
purchase obligations are defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding and specifying all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and approximate timing of the transaction 
the purchase obligation amounts disclosed above represent estimates of the minimum for which the company is obligated and the time period in which cash outflows will occur 
purchase orders and authorizations to purchase that involve no firm commitment from either party are excluded from the above table 
in addition  contracts that can be unilaterally cancelled with no termination fee or with proper notice are excluded from the company s total purchase obligations except for the amount of the termination fee or the minimum amount of goods that must be purchased during the requisite notice period 
the significant amount disclosed within fiscal  as compared to other periods  primarily represents obligations to purchase inventories within the pharmaceutical distribution and provider services segment 
the company has certain obligations to repurchase franchisee pharmacies from its medicine shoppe and medicap businesses at the end of the term of the franchise renewal agreement 
these obligations are determined through third party appraisals and are for periods beyond fiscal at this time  the company cannot estimate the amount of these obligations and therefore has not included them in this presentation

foreign exchange rate sensitivity 
by nature of the company s global operations  it is exposed to cash flow and earnings fluctuations resulting from foreign exchange rate variation 
these exposures are transactional and translational in nature 
since the company manufactures and sells its products throughout the world  its foreign currency risk is diversified 
principal drivers of this diversified foreign exchange exposure include the european euro  mexican peso  british pound and the thai bhat 
transactional exposure the company s transactional exposure arises from the purchase and sale of goods and services in currencies other than the functional currency of the parent or its subsidiaries 
as part of its risk management program  at the end of each fiscal year the company performs a sensitivity analysis on its forecasted transactional exposure for the upcoming fiscal year 
this analysis assumes a hypothetical strengthening or weakening of the us dollar 
included in the analysis is the estimated impact of its hedging program  which mitigates the company s transactional exposure 
at june  and  the company had hedged approximately and of its transactional exposures  respectively 
the following table summarizes the analysis as it relates to the company s transactional exposure in millions net estimated transactional exposure sensitivity gain loss estimated offsetting impact of hedges estimated net gain loss impact of a hypothetical strengthening or weakening of the u 
s dollar 
translational exposure the company also has exposure related to the translation of financial statements of its foreign divisions into u 
s dollars  functional currency of the parent 
it performs a similar analysis as described above related to this translational exposure 
the company does not typically hedge any of its translational exposure and no hedging impact was included in the company s analysis at june  and the following table summarizes the company s translational exposure and the impact of a hypothetical strengthening or weakening in the u 
s dollar in millions net estimated translational exposure sensitivity gain loss impact of a hypothetical strengthening or weakening of the u 
s dollar 
the increase in net estimated translational exposure between fiscal and resulted primarily from international acquisitions completed during fiscal interest rate sensitivity 
the company is exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of its borrowing and investing activities to maintain liquidity and fund business operations 
the nature and amount of the company s long term and short term debt can be expected to fluctuate as a result of business requirements  market conditions  and other factors 
the company s policy is to manage exposures to interest rates using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt as deemed appropriate by management 
the company utilizes interest rate swap instruments to mitigate its exposure to interest rate movements 
as part of its risk management program  the company annually performs a sensitivity analysis on its forecasted exposure to interest rates for the following fiscal year 
this analysis assumes a hypothetical change in interest rates 
at june  and  the potential increase or decrease in interest expense under this analysis as a result of this hypothetical change was million and million  respectively 
commodity price sensitivity 
the company purchases certain commodities for use in its manufacturing processes  which include rubber  heating oil  diesel fuel  and polystyrene 
the company typically purchases these commodities at market prices  and as a result  is affected by price fluctuations 
as part of its risk management program  the company performs sensitivity analysis on its forecasted commodity exposure for the following fiscal year 
at june  and  the company had not hedged any of these exposures 
the table below summarizes the company s analysis of these forecasted commodity exposures and a hypothetical fluctuation in commodity prices as of june  and in millions estimated commodity exposure sensitivity gain loss impact of a hypothetical change in commodity market prices 
the company also has exposure to certain energy related commodities  including natural gas and electricity through its normal course of business 
these exposures result primarily from operating the company s distribution  manufacturing  and corporate facilities 
in certain deregulated markets  the company from time to time enters into long term purchase contracts to supply these items at a specific price
