item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this form k 
except for the historical financial information  many of the matters discussed in this item may be considered forward looking statements 
such forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve a number of risks and uncertainties 
many of the risks and uncertainties are described below under the caption risk factors 
overview we are focused on protecting gateways  networks  servers and desktops against an ever changing spectrum of threats  with a comprehensive line of products and services designed specifically for the enterprise  service provider  risk management  small business and consumer markets 
these threat protection solutions go beyond basic access control to deliver multiple layers of defense that detect  prevent and respond to threats prior to those threats causing damage to our customers business operations 
our family of products is a critical element of an active internet and networking security program within today s world of global connectivity  enabling organizations to proactively monitor  detect and respond to risks to enterprise information 
prior to  our products were exclusively software  providing intrusion detection and vulnerability assessment solutions 
in  we began to sell a new line of products called proventia  which includes an appliance pre loaded and configured with our network based software solutions for intrusion detection and in line intrusion prevention 
initial customer response has been positive  with this line representing of product and license sale revenues for the fourth quarter of we believe this new product line is critical to growing our product sales and the ongoing subscription revenues associated with such sales 
in the fourth quarter of  our product offering expanded to further include a multi function proventia appliance that includes  in addition to intrusion protection  firewall  virtual private network  and anti virus protection 
we expect the addition of content filtering and anti spam to this product line in the first half of we believe this expanded product offering significantly increases our market opportunity as well as our risk from broader competition 
while there were some sales of this product in  our expectations for future revenue growth are dependent on successfully penetrating both our existing intrusion protection market and new network security markets with this multi function appliance 
our managed services offerings currently provide remote management of our best of breed security technology  focusing on security assessment and intrusion detection systems  and include firewalls  vpns  anti virus and url filtering software 
we focus on serving as the trusted security provider to our customers by maintaining within our existing products the latest counter measures to security risks  creating new innovative products based on our customers needs and providing professional and managed services 
in an effort to create differentiation  we emphasize the management of our own products  which has allowed us to announce a new offering in early called managed protection services 
we expect this new service to provide guaranteed protection to customers who meet the requirements of the program 
the program provides for a fixed cash payment if the protection system is compromised by an exploit for which protection is guaranteed 
many factors will affect our future financial performance  especially our ability to differentiate our offerings from competitors that include much larger companies with greater marketing capabilities  financial resources and brand recognition 
in order to continue to create such differentiation  we expect to continue to expand our domestic and international sales and marketing operations  seek acquisition candidates and alliances with partners whose products  technologies or services capabilities are complementary to our solutions  and improve our internal operating and financial infrastructure in support of our strategic goals and objectives 
at the same time  we expect to adjust our organization size in light of changing economic conditions and maintain emphasis on controlling discretionary spending and capital expenditures 
while we believe in the long term success of our business solutions  our prospects must be considered in light of the recent experience  risks and difficulties that are frequently encountered by companies serving rapidly evolving markets 
see risk factors 
critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
as such  management is required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions it believes are reasonable based upon the information available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
the significant accounting policies which management believes are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following revenue recognition we recognize software license revenue under statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as modified by sop  software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions  when the following criteria have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  price is fixed or determinable  and collection is probable 
product licenses and sales include revenue from sales of perpetual software licenses and products 
we recognize perpetual software license revenues upon delivery of software or  if the customer has evaluation software  delivery of the software key and issuance of the related license  assuming that no significant vendor obligations or customer acceptance rights exist 
where payment terms are extended over periods greater than months  revenue is recognized as such amounts become due and payable 
product sales consist primarily of appliances sold in conjunction with iss licensed software 
these sales are recognized upon shipment to the customer provided all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
sales of enterprise products are generated both through direct sales to end users as well as through various partners  including system integrators  value added resellers and distributors 
license revenue is recognized when the sale has occurred for an identified end user through electronic delivery of a software key that is necessary to operate the product  provided all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
at the point of delivery  the end user has no right of return 
subscription revenues include product support and content updates  term licenses  and managed service arrangements 
renewable product support and content updates are separate components of software licenses and appliances sold 
term licenses allow customers to use our products and receive product support coverage and content updates for a specified period  generally months 
we generally invoice for product support  content updates and term licenses at the beginning of the term and recognize revenue ratably over the subscription term 
security monitoring and management services for information assets and systems are part of managed services and associated revenues are recognized and billed as such services are provided 
historically  our appliance and software sales have been accounted for primarily as revenue at the time of sale  with product support and content updates generally representing between and of the license or product amount 
with the introduction of the multi function appliance  we expect to significantly alter this ratio  as the majority of the initial price paid by the customer will be for content provided for a specified term 
this will result in the subscription component being recorded initially in deferred revenues and recognized over the term as subscription revenue 
professional services revenues include fee based service engagements and training 
service engagements are typically billed on either a fixed fee or time and materials basis and focus primarily on security assessments of customer networks and the development of customers security policies 
these offerings are intended to support our goal of providing products and managed services 
we prefer to have our partners provide these services where practical 
we recognize such professional services revenues as the related services are rendered 
multiple element arrangements can include any combination of our products or services listed above 
when some elements are delivered prior to others in an arrangement  all revenue is deferred until the delivery of the last element unless all of the following exist vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value of the undelivered elements  the functionality of the delivered elements is not dependent on the undelivered elements  and delivery of the delivered elements represents the culmination of the earnings process 
when these criteria have been met  we allocate revenue to the delivered software product using the residual method 
under the residual method  we allocate discounts inherent in the arrangement entirely to the product that is initially delivered and recognize the other elements as they are delivered based on the vendor specific objective evidence  which is typically determined by the company selling those elements separately 
our historical rate of product returns by customers of our software products is negligible 
we do not have sufficient experience with our newly introduced proventia appliance products to make a meaningful estimate of product return rates for these products 
we offer evaluation software available via download from our website and evaluation units for appliance based products that allow potential customers to see the functionality of the products on their own networks 
we did not have any transactions in  or involving reciprocal arrangements where goods or services were purchased from an organization at the same time that we licensed software or provided services to that organization 
allowance for doubtful accounts our sales are global  with customers located in the united states  europe  latin america and asia pacific regions 
we perform periodic credit evaluations of our customer s financial condition and do not require collateral 
we provide for estimated credit losses as such losses become probable 
we evaluate specific accounts when we become aware of a situation where a customer may not be able to meet its financial obligations due to deterioration of its liquidity or financial viability  credit ratings or bankruptcy 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is established based on the best facts available to us and is reevaluated and adjusted as additional information is received 
at december   the allowance for doubtful accounts totaled million  or of the million of total trade receivables 
this allowance percentage of receivables reflects our practice to leave accounts on our general ledger and provide reserves pending final resolution of collectibility rather than write off such accounts 
our bad debt expense for the year ended december  amounted to million 
this was a decrease from million in and million in the economic conditions in the asia pacific region  especially in korea and china  increased our bad debt expense in by million based on an internal evaluation of the outstanding receivables in this region 
during  we also decreased the provision by  for allowances specifically established in prior years for two customers that were successfully collected in the lower provision for is directly attributable to the absence of any significant new identified exposures 
we continued to monitor the asia situation identified in in january  a new distributor for china assumed the rights and the obligations of the distribution agreement for iss products from the old distributor 
in connection with this agreement  we modified the new distributor s obligations  which resulted in an additional  of bad debt expense recorded in the fourth quarter of and the write off of million against the allowance account 
we have a firm repayment schedule with the new distributor  a public company with a liquid balance sheet  and expect that the outstanding balance of million at january  is collectible 
while actual credit losses have historically been within management s expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates we have in the past 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
impairment of goodwill and other acquisition related intangibles we review goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or on an interim basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
all other long lived and intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
such impairment loss would be measured as the difference between the carrying amount of the asset and its fair value based on the present value of estimated future cash flows 
significant judgment is required in the forecasting of future operating results  which are used in the preparation of projected cash flows 
due to uncertain market conditions and potential changes in our strategy and products  it is possible that forecasts used to support our intangible assets may change in the future which could result in significant non cash charges that would adversely affect our results of operations 
we currently have goodwill and other acquisition related intangibles of approximately million  with million of goodwill related to our june acquisition of network ice 
the determination of whether or not goodwill is impaired involves significant judgments based upon short and long term projections of future performance 
we have concluded that this amount is realizable based on forecasted discounted cash flows through and on our stock market valuation 
neither method indicated that our goodwill had been impaired and  as a result  we did not record any impairment losses related to goodwill during the year ended december  other intangibles of approximately million are principally software form the network ice acquisition that is a primary component in most of our current product offerings 
acquisitions we believe that our total solutions approach will positively impact all of our revenue categories 
this includes our products and managed services offerings  as well as product support  professional services and training 
while we expect the expansion of these product and service offerings to originate primarily from internal development  our strategy includes acquiring products  technologies and service capabilities that fit within our strategy and could potentially accelerate the timing of the commercial introduction of such products and technologies 
in january  we acquired cobion  ag cobion  a privately held company based in kassel  germany 
cobion provides content filtering and anti spam technology that protects individuals and enterprises against unwanted web content  spam  misuse of information and lost productivity 
the purchase price was approximately million in cash plus the direct costs of acquisition 
we intend to continue to sell the cobion product on a stand alone basis as well as include the technology in our multi function proventia appliance in in october  we completed the acquisition of privately held vcis  inc vcis of santa clara  california  a developer of patent pending  next generation  pre emptive behavioral inspection technology 
the technology prevents malicious code from executing and causing damage before it has an opportunity to interact with the enterprise network 
the aggregate purchase price was million and was primarily allocated to in process research and development 
in process research and development had not yet reached technological feasibility and was required to be expensed at the time of acquisition under generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
as a result  we incurred an expense of million in the fourth quarter of of the remaining purchase price  million was allocated to the assembled workforce  which is being amortized over three years   was allocated to net tangible assets  principally fixed assets  and  of liabilities were assumed 
in the fourth quarter of we committed to a plan to close the research and development facility in sydney  australia  transferred knowledge of the product to our atlanta based personnel  and wrote off the remaining approximately  of the intangible asset related to the vcis workforce 
in august  internet security systems kk iss kk  our asia pacific subsidiary  acquired a distributor in singapore  trisecurity holdings pte ltd 
trisecurity 
trisecurity was the sole distributor for iss kk in southeast asia  including india  and its business was almost exclusively focused on iss solutions 
this acquisition provides our asia pacific subsidiary direct support capabilities for their customers in southeast asia and allows iss kk to expand its capabilities in this growing market 
the consideration consisted of  shares of iss kk stock and approximately million of cash 
goodwill of approximately million related to the purchase was recorded 
during the first quarter of  iss kk amended the agreement and agreed to make payment of shares of iss kk in each of the first quarters of and  relating to annual contingent consideration payments defined in the purchase agreement 
the additional consideration of  based on current fair market value of the shares  was recorded as additional goodwill and additional paid in capital at such time 
when such shares are actually issued  a gain or loss will be recognized to the extent of any difference between the  fair value of the shares to be issued and the book value of those shares 
in june  we acquired network ice corporation network ice  a privately held corporation based in san mateo  california 
network ice was a leading developer of desktop intrusion protection technology and highly scalable security management systems 
the merger was accounted for as a purchase and  accordingly  the operating results of network ice are included in the consolidated financial statements of iss from the date of acquisition 
substantially all of the aggregate purchase price of million was allocated to goodwill  with the remainder allocated to identified intangibles  including in process research and development  developed technology  customer relationships  and to deferred compensation related to stock options assumed 
results of operations the following table sets forth our consolidated historical operating information  as a percentage of total revenues  for the periods indicated year ended december  consolidated statements of operations data product licenses and sales subscriptions professional services total revenues cost of revenues product licenses and sales subscriptions and professional services total cost of revenues research and development sales and marketing general and administrative write off of lease obligation charge for in process research and development amortization and write off of intangibles stock based compensation amortization of goodwill total costs and expenses operating income loss revenues product licenses and sales product licenses and sales  including perpetual licenses and sales of partner software and hardware appliances  reflect a decreasing trend for the last three years 
they also continue to be a decreasing source of revenue generation at of total revenues in  in and in as subscription revenues grew significantly 
we believe that the general economic slowdown in information technology spending contributed to the decrease in product licenses and sales as well as the cost and complexity of deploying and managing software based solutions for networks 
in the second quarter of  we began to ship our first proventia network protection appliance the proventia a series appliance which provides intrusion detection capabilities to customers 
the proventia family of appliances collectively provides unified  multi function protection capabilities designed to identify and prevent many forms of attack with minimal user intervention 
they are designed to operate in demanding network environments while being easy to deploy  easy to use and centrally managed  all in an effort to make our solution more cost effective 
revenues from our proventia appliance line represented of total revenues for the year ended december  in the fourth quarter of  we introduced and shipped our in line intrusion protection proventia appliance the proventia g series appliance and the multi function appliance the proventia m series appliance that initially includes firewall  virtual private network anti virus and intrusion protection capabilities 
in the fourth quarter  proventia represented of our product and license revenues  which produced a reversal in the quarterly trend of reduced product and license revenues 
our future growth is dependent on a continuation of the positive market response to our proventia family of products 
in  we expect to extend proventia to our server and desktop solutions that will continue to be delivered as software offerings 
this expected growth is critical as it represents not only product and license revenues  but also subscription revenues from product support and content 
our present product roadmap focuses our development on product offerings and enhancements that will continue to improve central control and manageability  easier deployment and more refined information and broader proventia appliance offerings 
we expect that this focus will make our products more cost effective to implement and maintain and will increase the future level of product licenses and sales 
subscriptions subscriptions revenue represented of total revenues in  of total revenues in and in subscription revenues consist of product support and content updates  term licenses of products and security monitoring fees for managed services offerings 
the increase in subscriptions revenue as a percentage of total revenues was primarily due to an increase in product content and support revenues  the largest component  which grew from of total revenues in to in and to in product content and support includes hardware support of our proventia appliances  software updates  technical support and security content that includes advisory updates from x force  our internal team of security experts 
we continue to increase our software client base that generates product content and support revenues  through a combination of contracts associated with new product licenses and renewal of existing contracts 
managed services revenues accounted for of total revenues in the year  as compared with in the year and in the year we believe these increases were due to a strong demand in the market for proven  financially sound  managed security service providers 
we are marketing managed services both directly to end users and through partners  including a number of new arrangements with integrators and service providers that include managed services as a part of their service offerings to their customers 
we also expect sales of managed services to continue to increase as a percentage of total revenues over time as we focus our efforts on marketing new  innovative offerings  such as our managed protection services  to new and existing customers 
managed protection services is a premium service combining vulnerability assessment  managed protection and other professional services 
professional services professional services revenue decreased both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total revenue from in to in and to in during we began narrowing our consulting offerings to focus on services that directly contribute to our protection platform strategy 
this strategy continued in as we focused on high value offerings that utilize our x force expertise  and chose to use partners to provide deployment and other offerings where appropriate 
in  we believe that entities continued to curtail costs and limit spending of discretionary dollars on professional services in current economic times  which resulted in flat to lower levels of demand for these services 
in addition  we continued the strategy that promotes professional services through our systems integrator and channel partner relationships 
although we continue to offer training classes at our atlanta headquarters and customers premises  our primary focus is to deliver course materials to our customers through authorized training centers 
geographic regions geographically  we derived the majority of our revenues from sales to customers within the americas region 
revenues by region represented the following percentages of total revenues americas emea asia pacific revenues in emea benefited from volume growth combined with a strengthening currency throughout  since products are primarily sold in the euro currency 
asia pacific remained consistent with  decreasing minimally  we believe  because of difficult economic conditions in portions of the region in the financial data for each segment can be found in note to the consolidated financial statements 
costs and expenses personnel personnel and related costs represent our largest expense category 
our headcount has fluctuated between approximately  and  over the last years as we acquired and integrated acquisitions and continually refined our business targets in light of difficult economic conditions during these years 
cost of product licenses and sales cost of product licenses and sales consists of several components 
costs associated with licensing our software products are minor 
the substantial portion of our cost of product licenses and sales represents the hardware cost of our proventia appliances and payments to partners for their products that we sell or integrate with our managed service offerings 
this cost  as a percentage of product licenses and sales  decreased from in to in and increased to in the decrease from to was a result of a movement away from the direct sales of third party products that had been a more significant part of our revenues as a result of a acquisition 
the increase from to was connected with the introduction of the proventia appliance line in the second quarter of and we expect the increase in cost of product licenses and sales to continue to increase in future periods as sales of the proventia appliances increase and become a larger component of our product licenses and sales 
cost of subscriptions and professional services cost of subscriptions and professional services includes the cost of our technical support personnel who provide assistance to customers under product support agreements  the security operations center soc costs of providing managed security monitoring services and the costs related to our professional services and training 
these costs increased modestly from million in to million in followed by a decrease to million in as a percentage of subscription and professional services revenues  the costs decreased from in to in and in costs associated with our technical support personnel and our security operations centers increased in and as we added personnel to handle additional customers 
we gained efficiencies in our security operations centers and restructured our support groups to be more productive so personnel increased at a much lower rate than revenue growth  contributing to the decrease in those costs as a percentage of total revenues 
while we continue to seek increased productivity  we do expect to increase costs with a continued increase in revenues in the future 
offsetting this increase of costs associated with our technical support personnel and our security operations centers was a decrease in costs associated with our professional services and education services 
cost decreases accompanied the decrease in revenues that occurred through a continued narrowing of our consulting offerings to focus on services that directly contribute to our protection platform strategy  the outsourcing of educational training outside of atlanta to authorized partners  and a decrease in the number of training classes related to third party products 
research and development research and development expenses consist of salary and related costs of research and development personnel  including costs for employee benefits  and depreciation on computer equipment 
these costs include those associated with maintaining and expanding the x force  our internal team of security experts 
we believe our primary research and product development and managed service offerings are important to retaining our leadership position in the market 
we continue to add functionality to our product family  providing gateway  network  server and desktop based solutions  as well as to our security management applications 
these improvements as well as new offerings are intended to provide our customers with more powerful and easier to use solutions for security management across the enterprise 
included among new releases and major enhancements in were proventia a series models a  a and a network threat detection appliance for aggregate network bandwidth from mbps to mbps on to network segments 
proventia g series models g and g network threat protection appliance for aggregate network bandwidth from mbps to mbps on a particular network segment 
proventia m series model m unified firewall  vpn  anti virus  and intrusion detection and prevention in one appliance  under one management system  to protect at the network and the gateway 
realsecure server sensor assesses host security to detect and report system security weaknesses  and provides intrusion prevention and response 
realsecure r desktop provides protection against malicious activity by analyzing application and network including vpn behavior on desktops 
realsecure internet scanner added improved accuracy and new ease of use features to our network assessment solution 
realsecure siteprotector unifies the management of protection across networks  servers and desktops to increase customers ability to effectively detect  prevent and respond to today s ever changing spectrum of threats 
research and development expenses were million in  million in and million in these costs fluctuated as a percentage of total revenues from in to in and in in we continued to provide new product offerings and enhancements without an increase in research and development expenses 
our development group headcount increased in the fourth quarter of due to the addition of engineers from the vcis acquisition 
the increase in in both absolute dollars and percentage of revenues is due to the increase in the number of our development personnel focused on our proventia offerings 
throughout  we also reorganized and consolidated our efforts for security content  protection agent frameworks  management infrastructure and multifunction appliance delivery to enhance operational and development efficiency 
this resulted in closing our engineering operations in reading  uk and sydney  australia in the fourth quarter of the reading office was closed november  and all costs associated with the closing of this facility were charged to expense in the sydney office will remain open through the first half of  with a small number of key employees 
the costs of severance associated with all terminated employees from the sydney office were expensed in the normal operating costs of keeping the office open into will be expensed as incurred 
these exit costs  which totaled million  increased research and development expenses by of total revenues in to 
while we are committed to continue our investment in x force research and development capabilities  which we believe distinguishes iss from its competitors  we intend to seek leverage in future periods in the research and development area while enhancing current technologies and developing new technologies 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses consist of salaries  travel expenses  commissions  advertising  maintenance of our website  trade show expenses  costs of recruiting sales and marketing personnel and costs of marketing materials 
sales and marketing expenses were million in  million in and million in gaining leverage in sales and marketing was a key objective for us in  and we were able to decrease these expenses as a percentage of total revenues from in to in this occurred largely because we resized our operations globally in the third quarter of  resulting in personnel reductions and decreases in various operating expenses  followed by further reduction in the third quarter of in areas such as latin america and europe where revenue demand did not support our cost base 
marketing costs increased in as we launched our first television and print advertising campaign designed to demonstrate the multitude of threats that can compromise the security of a company s networks  servers or desktops 
this campaign was aimed at increasing awareness of the iss brand  especially at the mainstream business market 
in  sales and marketing expenses decreased in both absolute dollars to million and as a percentage of total revenue to 
these decreases occurred as a result of a full year impact of sales headcount reductions as well as selective decreases during additionally  we incurred lower commissions due to the decrease in total product license and sales revenues 
finally  marketing costs were at a lower level  as we did not continue our television and print advertising campaign in we expect to continue to achieve leverage in our sales efforts by focusing our direct touch sales force on large customers that are served either directly by us or through large systems integrators 
this channel  which includes systems integrators  value added resellers and distributors  will continue to be of increasing importance to us 
we intend to use its capabilities to reach larger customers through joint selling efforts and to reach departmental and small companies  especially for our proventia multi function appliance  which we believe has much more appeal to these companies 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses of million in  million in and million in  represented approximately of our total revenues in  in and in general and administrative expenses consist of personnel related costs for executive  administrative  finance and human resources  internal information systems and other support services costs  and legal  accounting and other professional service fees 
the increase in general and administrative expenses from to includes non recurring expenses associated with a relocation of our asia pacific headquarters in tokyo during the second quarter of costs included lease termination costs  including remaining rent payments  write off of leasehold improvements and moving costs 
these costs increased general and administrative expenses by of total revenues in charge for in process research and development we have reflected charges of million in and million in for the write offs of in process research and development costs associated with the network ice acquisition in june and the vcis acquisition in october in process research and development had not reached technological feasibility based on identifiable technological risk factors which indicated that even though successful completion was expected  it was not assured at the acquisition date and was immediately charged to operations 
vcis was developing a protection kernel that uses behavior analysis technology to identify viruses  trojans  worms  and other forms of malicious code 
the technology operates on behavior of malicious code rather than on individual signatures of malicious code 
it conducts real time assessments of all executable program files  in a safe environment  and cleans the files before they are allowed to execute within an actual system 
at the time the merger transaction was concluded  the vcis technology had not reached technological feasibility  vcis had no marketable product and vcis had not identified any alternative uses for the technology at its current stage of development 
we continue to work on the development of the product and had not used this technology in our product line as of the end of amortization we incurred amortization expense related to intangible assets and stock based compensation of million in  million in and million in these intangible assets and stock based compensation resulted from acquisitions accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and are amortized over their useful lives 
due to the closing of our reading  uk and sydney  australia research and development facilities in late  the expense in includes a  charge related to our workforce reductions at these facilities 
interest income net interest income decreased from million in to million in and to million in the decrease in interest income year over year resulted from lower market rates of interest on debt securities 
the market rate of interest paid on investment grade commercial paper and similar investments dropped from approximately during to approximately during and dropped to approximately for as a result  interest income decreased despite an increase in cash and cash equivalents and interest bearing marketable securities 
other income expense  net other income and expense is primarily the result of issuance of stock in subsidiary companies and the results of investment in and the acquisition of distributors 
in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  we have recorded gains when shares in our japanese subsidiary have been issued in connection with its initial public offering  a acquisition of a singapore based distributor and option exercises in and additionally  our japan subsidiary took a minority position in a number of private companies  which ultimately produced a million realized gain in  and a million impairment loss in at december   our japan subsidiary has only one remaining investment for  which is carried at cost and has been deemed to not be impaired 
provision for income taxes we recorded a provision for income taxes of million in  million in  and million in while income tax expense was recorded on domestic income for each year  taxes payable were reduced by deductions related to the value of employee exercise of stock options 
the tax benefit for the use of these stock option deductions was recorded as additional paid in capital 
taxes paid generally relate to foreign operations 
as of december   we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million related to stock option deductions that expire in varying amounts between and the tax benefit for this carryforward will be recorded as additional paid in capital when it is realized 
we also have approximately million of research and development tax credit carryforwards  which expire between and and foreign tax credit carryforwards of million that expire between and liquidity and capital resources our financial position remained strong throughout our cash and cash equivalents and marketable security investments increased from million at december  to million at december  our investments in marketable securities consist solely of high rated debt obligations with maturities of months or less 
during  we met our working capital needs and capital equipment needs with cash provided by operations 
cash provided by operations in totaled million compared to million in and million in accounts receivable  net of acquisitions  increased million in compared to an increase of million in and a decrease of million in these changes were primarily the result of changes in sales levels in the fourth quarter of the respective periods  increasing from to and from to we measure our accounts receivable management by our daily sales outstanding 
this is a measurement of accounts receivable divided by billings in the quarter  represented by the sum of revenues plus the change in the deferred revenues liability account balance 
this measurement was  and days at december   and  respectively  each within our publicly stated target range of to days 
our investing activities of million in resulted from our capital purchases  which decreased to million compared to million in our spending is primarily for improved computer hardware for new and existing employees and investment in infrastructure hardware and software applications 
investing activities also included changes in our marketable securities that have quality characteristics similar to cash equivalents  except their maturities when we acquire them are longer than three months 
the cash flow statement included the purchase of million of intermediate term marketable securities  primarily interest bearing government obligations and commercial paper  offset by net proceeds from the maturity of marketable securities of million 
our financing activities used million of cash in  principally due to the repurchase of our common stock under an authorized plan to repurchase up to million 
through december   we had repurchased a total of million  including the purchase of  shares of our common stock on the open market during at an aggregate cost of million 
at december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities  primarily money market accounts and investment grade commercial paper 
an additional million of commercial paper investments are pledged as collateral for stand by letters of credit related to the operating leases of our facilities and are shown on the balance sheet as restricted marketable securities 
we believe that such cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to meet our working capital needs and capital expenditures for the foreseeable future 
furthermore  we are not aware of any trends  events  or uncertainties that are reasonably likely to result in any significant change to our liquidity 
from time to time  we evaluate possible acquisition and investment opportunities in businesses  products or technologies that are complementary to ours 
in the event we determine to pursue such opportunities  we may use our available cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities for this purpose 
in january  we used approximately million of cash in acquiring cobion and the license of development source code from another party 
off balance sheet arrangements payments for certain of our operating leases are secured by two collateralized stand by letters of credit totaling approximately million at december  the stand by letters of credit are annually renewable over the duration of the applicable leases 
these stand by letters of credit guarantee our payment obligations on the leases 
if we default on the lease payments  the landlords can claim against the letters of credit 
we  in turn  would be liable to the letter of credit issuers 
our stand by letters of credit are collateralized by securities worth million at december  other than these non cancelable operating leases  we have no off balance sheet financing arrangements  any relationships with structured finance or special purpose entities  or any contractual obligations with unconsolidated entities that are reasonably likely to impact our liquidity 
contractual commitments the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods 
this table excludes amounts already recorded on our balance sheet as current liabilities at december  amounts in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years after years operating lease obligations      other total contractual cash obligations      other obligations consist of payments due under an existing software licensing agreement 
the expected timing and payment of the obligations above is estimated based on current information 
timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the timing of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed upon amounts for some obligations 
risk factors there are many factors that affect iss business and the results of its operations  some of which are beyond iss control 
the following is a description of some of the important factors that may cause the actual results of iss operations in future periods to differ materially from those currently expected or desired 
we encourage you to read this section carefully 
we operate in a rapidly evolving market we operate in a rapidly evolving market and must  among other things respond to competitive developments  continue to upgrade and expand our product and services offerings  and continue to attract  retain and motivate our employees 
we cannot be certain that we will successfully address these issues 
as a result  we cannot assure our investors that we will be able to continue to operate profitably in the future 
we introduced our new proventia appliance line  beginning with the a series in april the g series and m series were introduced in the fourth quarter of as a result of our limited history with these products  it may be difficult to plan or project our revenues accurately 
the revenue and income potential of these products is unproven and the markets addressed by these products are volatile 
if these products fail to gain market acceptance  our revenue could be below our expectations and our operating results could be adversely affected 
our future operating results will likely fluctuate significantly we cannot predict our future revenues and operating results with certainty 
however  we do expect our future revenues and operating results to fluctuate due to a combination of factors  including the growth in the acceptance of  and activity on  the internet and the world wide web  particularly by corporate  institutional and government users  the extent to which the public perceives that unauthorized access to and use of online information are threats to network security  customer budgets  the volume and timing of orders  including seasonal trends in customer purchasing  our ability to develop new and enhanced product  managed service and professional service offerings  the introduction and acceptance rate of iss branded appliances  including increased cost of goods sold and inventory costs  our ability to accurately forecast and produce demanded quantities of our appliance products and models  availability of component parts of appliance products and reliance on contract manufacturers to produce such products  our ability to provide scalable managed services offerings through our partners in a cost effective manner  foreign currency exchange rates that affect our international operations  product and price competition in our markets  and general economic conditions  both domestically and in our foreign markets 
we increasingly focus our efforts on sales of enterprise wide security solutions  which consist of our entire product suite and related professional services  and managed security services  rather than on the sale of component products 
as a result  each sale requires substantial time and effort from our sales and support staff 
in addition  the revenues associated with particular sales vary significantly depending on the number of products licensed by a customer  the number of devices used by the customer and the customer s relative need for our professional services 
large individual sales  or even small delays in customer orders  can cause significant variation in our license revenues and results of operations for a particular period 
the timing of large orders is usually difficult to predict and  like many software and services companies  many of our customers typically complete transactions in the last month of a quarter 
we cannot predict our operating expenses based on our past results 
instead  we establish our spending levels based in large part on our expected future revenues 
as a result  if our actual revenues in any future period fall below our expectations  our operating results likely will be adversely affected because very few of our expenses vary with our revenues 
because of the factors listed above  we believe that our quarterly and annual revenues  expenses and operating results likely will vary significantly in the future 
our ability to provide timely guidance and meet the expectations of investors with respect to our operating and financial results is impacted by the tendency of a majority of our sales to be completed in the last month of a quarter 
we may not be able to determine whether we will experience material deviations from guidance or expectations until the end of a quarter 
dependence on third party suppliers and manufacturers we carry little inventory of our appliance products and we rely on suppliers to deliver necessary components to our contract manufacturers in a timely manner based on the forecasts we provide 
we currently purchase some proventia appliance components and contract manufacturing services from single or limited sources 
if shortages occur  supplies are interrupted  or we under forecast sales of demanded models  we may not be able to deliver products to our customers and our revenue and operating results would be adversely affected 
because our supply of hardware is based on short term forecasts and purchase orders  our contract manufacturers are not obligated to purchase components for greater quantities over longer periods 
we provide six month forecasts of our demand to our contract manufacturer 
if we overestimate our requirements  we or our contract manufacturers may have excess inventory  which could increase our costs 
if we underestimate our requirements  our contract manufacturers may have an inadequate component inventory and  based on lead times  this could interrupt manufacturing and result in delays in shipments and revenues 
we face intense competition in our market the market for network security monitoring  detection  prevention and response solutions is intensely competitive  and we expect competition to increase in the future 
we cannot guarantee that we will compete successfully against our current or potential competitors  especially those with significantly greater financial resources or brand name recognition 
our chief competitors generally fall within the following categories large companies  including symantec corp  cisco systems  inc  netscreen technologies  inc which is being acquired by juniper networks  inc  and network associates  inc  that sell competitive products and offerings  as well as other large software companies that have the technical capability and resources to develop competitive products  software or hardware network infrastructure companies like cisco systems  inc and juniper networks  inc 
that could integrate features that are similar to our products into their own products  relatively smaller software companies offering relatively limited applications for network and internet security  and small and large companies with competitive offerings to components of our managed services offerings 
mergers or consolidations among these competitors  or acquisitions of small competitors by larger companies  represent risks 
for example  symantec corp  cisco systems  inc  and network associates  inc 
have acquired smaller companies that have intrusion prevention technologies during the past several years  and juniper networks  inc announced that it is acquiring netscreen technologies  inc these acquisitions will make these entities potentially more formidable competitors to us if such products and offerings are effectively integrated 
large companies may have advantages over us because of their longer operating histories  greater name recognition  larger customer bases or greater financial  technical and marketing resources 
as a result  they may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements 
they can also devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products than we can 
in addition  these companies have reduced and could continue to reduce  the price of their security monitoring  detection and response products and managed security services  which increases pricing pressures within our market 
several companies currently sell software and hardware products such as encryption  firewall  operating system security and virus detection software that our customers and potential customers have broadly adopted 
some of these companies sell products that perform the same functions as some of our products 
in addition  the vendors of operating system software or networking hardware may enhance their products to include the same kinds of functions that our products currently provide 
the widespread inclusion of comparable features to our software in operating system software or networking hardware could render our products less competitive or obsolete  particularly if such features are of a high quality 
even if security functions integrated into operating system software or networking hardware are more limited than those of our products  a significant number of customers may accept more limited functionality to avoid purchasing additional products 
in addition  with the introduction of our multi function m series proventia appliance  we have offerings that compete with vendors of firewalls  vpn s  anti virus systems  and content and spam filtering 
this offering is competitive with a broader spectrum of network security companies  as well as those that also offer multi function appliances or broad product suites  like symantec corp 
for the above reasons  we may not be able to compete successfully against our current and future competitors 
increased competition may result in price reductions  reduced gross margins and loss of market share 
we face rapid technological change in our industry and frequent introductions of new products rapid changes in technology pose significant risks to us 
we do not control nor can we influence the forces behind these changes  which include the extent to which businesses and others seek to establish more secure networks  the extent to which hackers and others seek to compromise secure systems  evolving computer hardware and software standards  changing customer requirements  and frequent introductions of new products and product enhancements 
to remain successful  we must continue to change  adapt and improve our products in response to these and other changes in technology 
our future success hinges on our ability to both continue to enhance our current line of products and professional services and to introduce new products and services that address and respond to innovations in computer hacking  computer technology and customer requirements 
we cannot be sure that we will successfully develop and market new products that do this 
any failure by us to timely develop and introduce new products  to enhance our current products or to expand our professional services capabilities in response to these changes could adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
our products involve very complex technology  and as a consequence  major new products and product enhancements require a long time to develop and test before going to market 
because this amount of time is difficult to estimate  we have had to delay the scheduled introduction of new and enhanced products in the past and may have to delay the introduction of new and enhanced products in the future 
the techniques computer hackers use to gain unauthorized access to  or to sabotage  networks and intranets are constantly evolving and increasingly sophisticated 
furthermore  because new hacking techniques are usually not recognized until used against one or more targets  we are unable to anticipate most new hacking techniques 
to the extent that new hacking techniques harm our customers computer systems or businesses  affected or prospective customers may believe that our products are ineffective  which may cause them or prospective customers to reduce or avoid purchases of our products 
risks associated with our global operations the expansion of our international operations includes our presence in dispersed locations throughout the world  including throughout europe and the asia pacific and latin america regions 
our international presence and expansion exposes us to risks not present in our us operations  such as the difficulty in managing an organization spread over various countries located across the world  compliance with  and unexpected changes in  a wide range of complex regulatory requirements in countries where we do business  duties and tariffs imposed on importation of our products in other jurisdictions where other manufacturers may not bear those same costs  increased financial accounting and reporting burdens  potentially adverse tax consequences  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates resulting in losses or gains from transactions and expenses denominated in foreign currencies  reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries  reduced protection for enforcement of creditor and contractual rights in some countries  and import and export license requirements and restrictions on the import and export of certain technology  especially encryption technology and trade restrictions 
despite these risks  we believe that we must continue to expand our operations in international markets to support our growth 
to this end  we intend to establish additional foreign sales operations  expand our existing offices  hire additional personnel  expand our international sales channels and customize our products for local markets 
if we fail to execute this strategy  our international sales growth will be limited 
our networks  products and services may be targeted by hackers like other companies  our websites  networks  information systems  products and services may be targets for sabotage  disruption or misappropriation by hackers 
as a leading network security solutions company  we are a high profile target 
although we believe we have sufficient controls in place to prevent disruption and misappropriation  and to respond to such situations  we expect these efforts by hackers to continue 
if these efforts are successful  our operations  reputation and sales could be adversely affected 
we must successfully integrate acquisitions as part of our growth strategy  we have and may continue to acquire or make investments in companies with products  technologies or professional services capabilities complementary to our solutions 
when engaging in acquisitions  we could encounter difficulties in assimilating or completing the development of the technologies  new personnel and operations into our company 
these difficulties may disrupt our ongoing business  distract our management and employees  increase our expenses and adversely affect our results of operations 
these difficulties could also include accounting requirements  such as impairment charges related to goodwill or expensing in process research and development costs 
we cannot be certain that we will successfully overcome these risks with respect to any future acquisitions or that we will not encounter other problems in connection with our recent or any future acquisitions 
in addition  any future acquisitions may require us to incur debt or issue equity securities 
the issuance of equity securities could dilute the investment of our existing stockholders 
our proprietary rights may be difficult to enforce we rely primarily on copyright  trademark  patent and trade secrets laws  confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights 
we have obtained one united states patent and have a number of patent applications pending  as well as numerous trademarks and trademark applications pending 
there can be no assurance that patents will be issued from pending applications  or that claims allowed on any patents will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology 
there can be no assurance that any issued patents will not be challenged  invalidated or circumvented  or that any rights granted under these patents will actually provide competitive advantages to us 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
policing unauthorized use of our products is difficult 
while we cannot determine the extent to which piracy of our software products occurs  we expect software piracy to be a persistent problem 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the united states  and many foreign countries do not enforce these laws as diligently as us government agencies and private parties 
if we are unable to protect our proprietary rights to the totality of the features in our software and products including aspects of our software and products protected other than by patent rights  we may find ourselves at a competitive disadvantage to others who need not incur the additional expense  time and effort required to create the innovative products that have enabled us to be successful 
we may be found to infringe the proprietary rights of others third parties may assert claims or initiate litigation related to exclusive patent  copyright  trademark and other intellectual property rights to technologies that are relevant to our business 
because of the large number of patents in the internet  networking  security and software fields  the secrecy of some pending patents and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents  it is not economically practical or even possible to determine in advance whether a product or any of its components infringe or will infringe the patent rights of others 
third party asserted claims and or initiated litigation can include claims against us or our manufacturers  suppliers  or customers  alleging infringement of their proprietary rights with respect to our existing or future products or components of those products 
regardless of the merit of these claims  they can be time consuming  result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel  or require us to develop a non infringing technology or enter into license agreements 
there can be no assurance that licenses will be available on acceptable terms and conditions  if at all  in these circumstances  or that any indemnification that might be available to us would be adequate to cover our costs of defense 
furthermore  because of the potential for large judgments  which are not necessarily predictable  it is not unusual to find even arguably unmeritorious claims settled for significant funds 
if any infringement or other intellectual property claim made against us by a third party is successful  or if we fail to develop non infringing technology or license the proprietary rights on commercially reasonable terms and conditions  our business  operating results  financial condition and liquidity could be materially and adversely affected 
some provisions in the iss certificate of incorporation and bylaws make a takeover of iss difficult our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire  or of discouraging a third party from attempting to acquire  control of iss 
these provisions establish a classified board of directors  create preferred stock purchase rights that grant to holders of common stock the right to purchase shares of series a junior preferred stock in the event that a third party acquires or more of the voting power of our outstanding common stock  prohibit the right of our stockholders to act by written consent  limit calling special meetings of stockholders  and impose a requirement that holders of of the outstanding shares of common stock are required to amend the provisions relating to the classification of our board of directors and action by written consent of stockholders 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities in which we invest may be subject to market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
for example  if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the then prevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises  the market value of our investment will probably decline 
to minimize this risk  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and marketable securities in a variety of high quality relatively short term investments  including commercial paper and overnight repurchase agreements 
as of december   million of our securities mature in more than three months and million of our securities mature in more than six months  but in all cases less than one year 
risk associated with foreign exchange rates iss is subject to foreign exchange risk as a result of exposures to changes in currency exchange rates 
our foreign operations are  for the most part  naturally hedged against exchange rate fluctuations since both revenues and expenses of each foreign affiliate are denominated in the same currency 
therefore  we do not engage in formal hedging activities  but we do periodically review the potential impact of this risk to ensure that the risk of significant potential losses remains minimal 
as a result  an unfavorable change in the exchange rate for any particular foreign subsidiary would result in lower revenues and expenses with regards to operating results  and lower assets and liabilities with regards to the balance sheet 
the company s operating results are affected by changes in exchange rates between the us dollar and the euro and the japanese yen 
when the us dollar strengthens against these foreign currencies  the value of our non functional currency revenues decreases 
when the us dollar weakens  the value of our functional currency revenues increases 
since much of our international operating expenses are also incurred in local currencies  which is the foreign subsidiaries functional currency  the impact of exchange rates on net income or loss is relatively less than the impact on revenue 
although our operating and pricing strategies take into account changes in exchange rates over time  our results of operations may be affected significantly in the short term by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
during  the company recorded a net foreign exchange gain of  the nature and extent of the foreign currency risk faced by the company depends on many factors that cannot be accurately predicted 
these factors include significant changes in foreign currency market conditions  the company s inability to match foreign currency denominated revenues with costs denominated in the same currency  and changes in the amount or mix of revenues denominated in various foreign currencies 
as a result of material unforeseen changes in these factors  the company s foreign currency risk could have a greater impact on the company s results of operations in the future
