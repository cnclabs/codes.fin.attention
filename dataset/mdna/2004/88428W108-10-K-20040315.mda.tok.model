item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with selected financial data and our financial statements  including the notes thereto  included elsewhere in this form k 
overview third wave technologies  inc is a leading molecular diagnostics company 
we believe our proprietary invader r technology  a novel  chemistry based platform  is easier to use  more accurate and cost effective  and enables higher testing throughput 
these and other advantages conferred by our technology platform are enabling us to provide physicians and researchers with superior tools to diagnose and treat disease 
more than clinical laboratory customers are using third wave s products 
our customer base also includes the japanese government s share of the international haplotype map project 
other customers include pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  academic research centers and major health care providers 
third wave markets a growing number of products including analyte specific reagents asrs 
these asrs allow certified clinical reference laboratories to create assays to screen for cystic fibrosis and other inherited disorders  and to test for the factor v leiden and a host of other mutations associated with predisposition to cardiovascular and other diseases 
the company has developed or plans to develop a menu of molecular diagnostic products for clinical applications that include genetic testing  pharmacogenetics  chromosomal analysis  infectious disease  and women s health 
the company also has a number of other invader r products including those for research  agricultural and other applications 
our financial results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to fluctuations in the demand for our products  timing of new product introductions and deliveries made during the quarter  the timing of research  development and grant revenues  and increases in spending  including expenses related to our product development 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
we review the accounting policies we use in reporting our financial results on a regular basis 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to accounts receivable  inventories  equipment and leasehold improvements and intangible assets 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
results may differ from these estimates due to actual outcomes being different from those on which we based our assumptions 
these estimates and judgments are reviewed by management on an ongoing basis  and by the audit committee at the end of each quarter prior to the public release of our financial results 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
restructuring and other charges the restructuring and other charges resulting from the restructuring plan in the third quarter of was recorded in accordance with eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring  staff accounting bulletin no 
 restructuring and impairment charges  and fasb statement no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the restructuring charge was comprised primarily of costs to consolidate facilities  impairment charges for abandoned leasehold improvements and equipment to be sold or abandoned  prepayment penalties related mainly to capital lease obligations on equipment to be sold or abandoned  and other costs related to the restructuring 
in calculating the cost to consolidate the facilities  we estimated the future lease and operating costs to be paid until the leases are terminated and the amount  if any  of sublease receipts for each location 
this required us to estimate the timing and costs of each lease to be terminated  the amount of operating costs  and the timing and rate at which we might be able to sublease the site 
to form our estimates for these costs  we performed an assessment of the affected facilities and considered the current market conditions for each site 
estimates were also used in our calculation of the estimated realizable value on equipment that was held for sale 
these estimates were formed based on recent history of sales of similar equipment and market conditions 
our assumptions on the lease termination payments  operating costs until terminated  and the offsetting sublease receipts may turn out to be incorrect and our actual cost may be materially different from our estimates 
long lived assets impairment equipment  leasehold improvements and amortizable identifiable intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
for assets held and used  if the sum of the expected undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value of the related asset or group of assets  a loss is recognized for the difference between the fair value and carrying value of the asset or group of assets 
for assets removed from service and held for sale  we estimate the fair market value of such assets and record an adjustment if fair value less costs to sell is lower than carrying value 
goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized  but are subject to annual impairment tests under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the annual impairment test was completed in the quarters ended september and derivative instruments we sell products in a number of countries throughout the world 
during and  we sold certain products with the resulting accounts receivable denominated in japanese yen 
we purchased foreign currency forward contracts to manage the risk associated with collections of receivables denominated in foreign currencies in the normal course of business 
these derivative instruments have maturities of less than one year and are intended to offset the effect of transaction gains and losses 
contracts outstanding at december  represented a combined us dollar equivalent commitment of approximately million 
the changes in the fair value of the derivatives and the loss or gain on the hedged asset relating to the risk being hedged are recorded currently in earnings 
inventories slow moving and obsolescence significant management judgment is required to determine the reserve for obsolete or excess inventory 
inventory on hand may exceed future demand either because of process improvements or technology advancements  the amount on hand is more than can be used to meet future need  or estimates of shelf lives may change 
we currently consider all inventory that we expect will have no activity within one year as well as any additional specifically identified inventory to be subject to a provision for excess inventory 
we also provide for the total value of inventories that we determine to be obsolete based on criteria such as changing manufacturing processes and technologies 
at december   our inventory reserves were  or of our million total gross inventories 
results of operations years ended december  and revenues 
revenues for the year ended december  of million represented an increase of million as compared to revenues of million for the year ended december  product revenues increased to million for the year ended december   from million in the year ended december  the increase in product sales during resulted from an increase in us molecular diagnostic sales and higher genomic research product sales to the japanese government compared to prior year 
we expect our molecular diagnostic revenues to increase in development revenues decreased to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in funding amounts per our development and commercialization agreement with bml  inc bml 
under the agreement  we develop assays in accordance with a mutually agreed development program for use in clinical applications by bml 
we expect our development revenues to decrease in license and royalty revenue decreased to million in the year ended december  from million for the corresponding period of the decrease is due to a decrease in license revenue from aclara 
in the year ended december   we received royalty revenue of million from aclara  per the license and supply agreement  compared to revenue of million for the license granted to aclara in the year ended december  significant customer 
we generated million  or of our revenues from sales to a major japanese research institute for use by several end users during the year ended december  as of december   million of our accounts receivable were attributable to this customer 
this customer will continue to purchase company products in  however  the timing and total of such purchases will be influenced by the funding process and amounts which are unpredictable and unknown to third wave

the equipment and leaseholds that were not sold in the auction were written down to their fair value less costs to sell 
impairment loss 
during the third quarter of  we completed the annual impairment tests required by statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
for goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives  using the assistance of an independent valuation expert 
for the goodwill analysis  the fair value of the agbio reporting unit was compared to the carrying value of the net assets of the reporting unit 
the fair value of the reporting unit was determined using a combination of discounted cash flows method and other common valuation methodologies 
for indefinite lived intangible assets  the fair values of these assets were compared to their carrying values 
based on the analyses  it was determined that goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets were impaired and consequently an impairment charge of million for the impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets was recorded during the year ended december  interest income 
interest income for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for this decrease was primarily due to lower interest rates and decreased cash and cash equivalents compared to the year ending december  interest expense

other items 
as previously announced  part of our operational consolidation plan included a reduction in the company work force 
a plan for work force reductions was implemented in the june through august timeframe 
a majority of the workforce reductions occurred in the oligo synthesis production and operations support functions and the remainder spread throughout the organization 
as of december   we employed persons 
liquidity and capital resources since our inception  we have financed our operations primarily through private placements of equity securities  research grants from federal and state government agencies  payments from strategic collaborators  equipment loans  capital leases  sale of products  a convertible note and an initial public offering 
as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million 
net cash used in operations for the year ended december  was million  compared with million in and million in the decrease was primarily due to lower operating expenses and losses 
net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended december  was million  compared to a cash usage of million in and million in capital expenditures were million in the year ended december   compared to million in and million in capital expenditures in were higher due to investments in leasehold improvements to facilities  software  and production and lab equipment

the term loan is collateralized with a month certificate of deposit 
proceeds from the issuance of common stock were million in  compared to million in and million in in  the proceeds from the issuance of common stock was primarily the result of our initial public offering of  shares of common stock in february as of december  and december   a valuation allowance equal to of our net deferred tax assets had been recognized since our future realization is not assured 
at december   we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million 
the net operating loss carryforwards will expire at various dates beginning in  if not utilized 
utilization of the net operating losses to offset future taxable income may be subject to an annual limitation due to the change of ownership provisions of federal tax laws and similar state provisions as a result of the initial public offering in february we cannot assure that our business or operations will not change in a manner that would consume available resources more rapidly than anticipated 
we also cannot assure that we will not require substantial additional funding before we can achieve profitable operations 
our capital requirements depend on numerous factors  including the following our progress with our research and development programs  our level of success in selling our products and technologies  our ability to establish and maintain successful collaborative relationships  the costs we incur in enforcing and defending our patent claims and other intellectual property rights  and the timing of purchases of additional capital 
contractual obligations the following summarizes our contractual obligations at december  and the effect those obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods in thousands less than years years over total year years contractual obligations non cancelable operating lease obligation      term loan   total obligations      item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk is currently confined to changes in foreign exchange and interest rates 
the securities in our investment portfolio are not leveraged and  due to their short term nature  are subject to minimal interest rate risk 
we currently do not hedge interest rate exposure 
due to the short term maturities of our investments  we do not believe that an increase in market rates would have any negative impact on the realized value of our investment portfolio 
to reduce foreign exchange risk  we selectively use financial instruments 
our earnings are affected by fluctuations in the value of the us dollar against foreign currencies as a result of the sales of our products in foreign markets 
forward foreign exchange contracts are used to hedge against the effects of such fluctuations 
our policy prohibits the trading of financial instruments for profit 
a discussion of our accounting policies for derivative financial instruments is included in the notes to the financial statements
