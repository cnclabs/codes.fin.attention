overview about ebay we pioneered online trading by developing an internet based marketplace in which a community of buyers and sellers are brought together in an entertaining  intuitive  easy to use environment to browse  buy and sell an enormous variety of items 
through our paypal service  we enable any business or consumer with email to send and receive online payments securely  conveniently and cost effectively 
executive operating and financial summary members of our senior management team regularly review key operating metrics such as new users  active users  listings and gross merchandise sales transacted on our global marketplace as well as new user accounts  total payment volume and off ebay transactions processed by our wholly owned paypal subsidiary 
this information allows us to monitor marketplace trends and anticipate new features and functionality that may be required to serve the needs of our users 
we believe that an understanding of the key operating metrics and how they change over time is important to investors  analysts and other parties analyzing our market opportunities and business results 
members of our senior management also regularly review key financial information including net revenues  operating income margins  earnings per share  cash flows from operations and free cash flows  which we define as operating cash flows less purchases of property and equipment 
this information allows us to monitor the profitability of our business and evaluate the effectiveness of investments that we have made and continue to make in the areas of international expansion  customer support  product development  marketing and site operations 
we believe that an understanding of key financial information and how it changes over time is important to investors  analysts and other parties analyzing our business results and future market opportunities 
we expect that our growth in net revenues during will result primarily from transaction net revenues across our us  international  and payments segments  with a potentially more significant effect of seasonality during the second and third quarters 
the expected future growth in our payments segment net revenues will also cause downward pressure on our gross margin and operating profit margin 
we continue to make investments in our business and infrastructure to help us achieve our long term growth objectives 
we expect to continue our investments in the areas of international expansion  product development  site operations and various corporate infrastructure areas 
we believe these investments are necessary to support the long term demands of our growing business 
in addition  to the extent that the 
table of contents us dollar strengthens or weakens against foreign currencies  and  in particular  the euro  the translation of these foreign currency denominated transactions into us dollars will impact our net revenues  operating expenses and net income 
the detailed discussion of our financial condition and results of operations contained herein is intended to provide information to assist investors  analysts and other parties reading this report understand the key operating metrics and financial information summarized above as well as the changes in our results of operations from year to year  the primary factors that accounted for those changes and how certain accounting principles  policies  judgments  and estimates affect our consolidated financial statements 
business combinations our historical financial statements reflect the impact of various business combinations that have been accounted for as pooling of interests and purchase transactions 
our consolidated financial statements have been retroactively restated to include the historical financial statements of all entities acquired in pooling of interests transactions 
the financial statements of entities acquired in purchase transactions are reflected in our consolidated results from the effective dates of each acquisition 
the aggregate purchase price for all acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting during the three years ended december  totaled approximately billion and was been allocated in our consolidated financial statements as follows in thousands net tangible assets identifiable intangible assets deferred tax liabilities minority interests unearned compensation goodwill tangible net assets were valued at their respective carrying amounts as we believe that these amounts approximated their current fair values at the respective acquisition dates 
the valuation of identifiable intangible assets acquired was based on management s estimates using valuation reports prepared by an independent third party valuation consultant 
such assets consist of customer lists  trademarks and tradenames  developed technologies and other acquired intangible assets including contractual agreements 
identifiable intangible assets are amortized using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of one to seven years 
we believe the straight line method of amortization best represents the distribution of the economic value of the identifiable intangible assets 
goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in each business combination 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill is no longer subject to amortization 
rather  goodwill is subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment  applying a fair value based test

the international segment includes our international online trading platforms excluding those of our paypal and billpoint subsidiaries 
the payments segment includes our global payments platform including the operations of our paypal and billpoint subsidiaries 
the payments segment reflects billpoint s historical operations and paypal s operations for the periods subsequent to october  we completed our planned wind down of billpoint in the first half of our net revenues result from fees associated with our transaction  advertising and other services in our us  international and payments segments 
transaction net revenues are derived primarily from listing  feature and final value fees paid by sellers and fees from payment processing services 
net revenues from advertising are derived principally from the sale of online banner and sponsorship advertisements for cash and through barter arrangements 
other net revenues are derived principally from contractual arrangements with third parties that provide transaction services to ebay and paypal users and also from offline services provided by our butterfields and kruse subsidiaries  which were divested in the second half of the successive year over year growth in net revenues from through  was primarily the result of increased auction and fixed price transaction activity  reflected in the growth in the number of our confirmed registered users  user activity  listings  gross merchandise sales and payment transactions processed by paypal 
our net revenue growth during the year ended december   also reflects a full year of payment transactions processed by paypal  which we acquired on october  the number of confirmed registered users from our us and international segments increased during to million at december  confirmed registered users increased during to million at december   from million at december  the increase in registered users reflects steady growth across our us and international platforms 

table of contents the number of active users on the ebay platform which excludes the internet auction and eachnet websites increased during to million at december  active users increased during to million at december   from million at december  active users are the number of users on the ebay platform who bid  bought or listed over the trailing twelve months 
we believe that increases in user activity are largely the result of our promotional efforts and our emphasis on helping our user community be successful through the introduction of new site features and functionality and expanded trust and safety programs 
the number of items listed on ebay 
com and our international sites increased by to million in  from million in  and increased in from million in this acceleration in listing growth was experienced across our us and international platforms 
gross merchandise sales from the us and international segments increased in both and significant contributions to this growth came from our us  german  us and south korean operations

as of december   paypal had million accounts  compared to million accounts at december  us and international segment net transaction revenues us segment transaction net revenues increased in and in international segment transaction net revenues increased in and in the successive year over year growth in us and international segment transaction net revenues was primarily the result of increased auction transaction activity  reflected in the growth of the number of registered users  listings and gross merchandise sales 
we experienced transaction net revenue growth across all major categories with motors  home garden  computers  consumer electronics  clothing accessories  and collectibles making the most significant dollar impact 
international segment transaction net revenues as a percentage of total transaction net revenues was in  in and in this growth is primarily the result of strong performances in germany  the united kingdom and south korea 
additionally  the relative strength of foreign currencies  primarily the euro  against the us dollar resulted in increased net revenues of approximately million during  when compared to the weighted average foreign currency exchange rates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
our operations located in europe experienced seasonally slower growth in july and august  with september and the fourth quarter of showing improved activity in all markets 
we expect that international segment transaction net revenues will continue to grow in significance to our business as we continue to develop and deploy our global online trading platform during on july   ebay began collecting value added taxes  or vat  on the fees we charge certain sellers in the european union  or eu 
we continue to work with the relevant tax authorities to clarify our obligations under these new regulations 
there have been and will continue to be substantial ongoing costs associated with complying with the vat rules throughout the eu  and the increased costs to our european users may reduce their activity on our websites and could adversely affect our international transaction net revenues 
we also believe that changes in foreign currency rates will impact our operations and to the extent that the us dollar strengthens  our foreign currency denominated transaction net revenues will be negatively impacted 
payments segment net transaction revenues payments segment transaction net revenues increased in and in the year over year growth in reflects a full year of transaction activity from paypal and substantial increases in transaction volume 
the payments segment contributed approximately of our total net transaction revenues in compared to in 
table of contents paypal payment volume totaled billion in  and transaction net revenues as a percentage of total payment volume was 
the growth in payments transaction net revenues was also positively affected by paypal s continued penetration of ebay transactions in the united states and the united kingdom  growth in our cross border international payment transactions and growth in the off ebay business 
net transaction revenues from the payments segment earned internationally totaled million during  representing of total payments segment net transaction revenues 
we expect the payments segment transaction net revenues to increase in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total transaction net revenues during advertising and other net revenues advertising and other net revenues decreased in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of total net revenues 
advertising and other net revenues totaled million in  million in and million in these amounts as a percentage of total net revenues represented in  in and in the decrease in net revenues from advertising and other services was primarily the result of a general deterioration in the online advertising market in  our decision in to no longer use america online as our sales agent in the online advertising market  and our divestiture of both of our offline businesses in we continue to view our business as primarily transaction driven and we expect advertising and other net revenues to continue to decrease as a percentage of total net revenues and possibly in absolute dollars during cost of net revenues percent percent change change in thousands  except percent changes cost of net revenues as a percentage of net revenues cost of net revenues consists primarily of costs associated with customer support  site operations and payment processing 
significant cost components include bank charges  credit card interchange  other payment processing costs  employee compensation and facilities costs for our customer support and site operations  internet connectivity charges  depreciation of equipment  amortization of required capitalization of major site and product development costs  and certain corporate overhead allocations 
cost of net revenues increased in absolute dollars and slightly as a percentage of net revenues during as compared to the increase in absolute dollars was due to a full year of payment processing costs resulting from our acquisition of paypal on october   an increase in the volume of transactions on the ebay websites  and continued development and expansion of our customer support and site operations infrastructure 
the increase in cost of net revenues as a percentage of net revenues was primarily due to the impact of paypal s higher structural costs relating to payment processing offset  in part  by ebay s site operations costs growing at a slower rate than net revenues 
payment processing costs increased to million in from million in  reflecting the full year of paypal activity in  the substantial increase in paypal s total payment volume and increased payment processing costs related to the collection of our ebay fees 
aggregate customer support and site operations costs increased million during  compared to the prior year  and resulted primarily from an increase in headcount and related employee costs of approximately million 
in addition  aggregate depreciation of site equipment and amortization of capitalized software development costs increased million as compared to costs of net revenues are expected to increase in absolute dollars and to remain generally comparable as a percentage of net revenues during cost of net revenues increased in absolute dollars but remained generally constant as a percentage of net revenues in the increase in absolute dollars was due to payment processing costs primarily resulting from our acquisition of paypal on october   an increase in the volume of transactions on the ebay websites  and continued development and expansion of our customer support and site operations 
table of contents infrastructure 
the consistency of costs of net revenues as a percentage of net revenues was primarily due to the offsetting impacts of paypal s higher structural costs relating to payment processing and ebay s cost savings as site operations costs grew at a slower rate than net revenues 
payment processing costs  which consist of credit card interchange fees  bank charges  and other processing charges increased by approximately million in the increase in aggregate customer support and site operations costs totaled million in operating expenses sales and marketing percent percent change change in thousands  except percent changes sales and marketing as a percentage of net revenues sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of advertising  tradeshow and other promotional costs  employee compensation for our category development and marketing staff  certain trust and safety programs and certain corporate overhead allocations 
sales and marketing expenses increased in absolute dollars in  but decreased as a percentage of total net revenues due to the continued cost leverage in our business and the acquisition of paypal  which presently has a significantly lower sales and marketing requirement 
growth in advertising and marketing costs as well as employee related costs comprised the majority of the increases in absolute dollars 
combined advertising and marketing costs increased million in this increase was primarily the result of our marketing programs directed towards our internet marketing and national television advertising campaigns as well as several category focused print campaigns 
employee related costs increased by million in as we continued to expand our international operations 
sales and marketing expenses are expected to increase in absolute dollars  and to remain generally comparable as a percentage of net revenues during in addition  our online marketing expenses will likely increase because of increases in the volume of  and rates for  online advertising that we expect to purchase in order to attract new customers and increase the activity on our websites 
the increase in sales and marketing expense in  was primarily the result of year over year increases in advertising costs of million  referral fees paid to marketing partners of million and other aggregate expenses related to trade shows and professional fees of million 
product development percent percent change change in thousands  except percent changes product development as a percentage of net revenues product development expenses consist primarily of employee compensation  payments to outside contractors  depreciation on equipment used for development and certain corporate overhead allocations 
product development expenses are net of required capitalization of major site and other product development efforts  including the development of our v platform architecture  global billing  seller tools and payment gateway projects 
these capitalized costs totaled million in  million in and million in  and are reflected as a cost of net revenues when amortized in future periods 
we anticipate that we will continue to devote significant resources to product development in the future as we add new features and functionality to the ebay and paypal platforms 

table of contents the increase in absolute dollars in  was primarily the result of increased headcount and computer equipment depreciation 
these increases were partially offset by the amounts capitalized in connection with major site and other product development efforts in the headcount growth was focused on hiring new employees for various platform development initiatives at ebay and paypal 
our development staff increased from at december  to  at december  product development expenses are expected to increase in absolute dollars and slightly as a percentage of net revenues in  as we develop new site features and functionality and continue to improve and expand operations across all our segments 
the increase in absolute dollars in  was primarily the result of an million increase in employee compensation costs  resulting from the growth in our development staff  which increased to at december  from at december   and a million increase in maintenance and depreciation costs for equipment used in product development

the increase in absolute dollars in  was due primarily to employee and facilities related costs  fees for external professional advisors  payment transaction loss expenses resulting from our acquisition of paypal and charges associated with various legal matters 
the increases in employee and facilities related costs resulted from the addition of paypal employees in various trust and safety functions as well as continued headcount growth in the finance  human resource and legal departments to meet the demands of our expanding business  including growing international operations and the integration of acquired businesses 
we increased our general and administrative staff from  at december  to  at december  fees for external professional advisors increased by million 
charges associated with various legal matters recorded in general and administrative expense totaled million 
paypal s payment transaction loss increased million in  reflecting a full year of consolidated operations 
paypal s payment transaction loss rate  which is the transaction loss expense as a percentage of paypal s total payment volume  was in despite higher transaction loss rates expected to be experienced as a result of increased patterns of seasonality and the buyer protection program implemented in september  we expect our full year transaction loss rate will decrease during with our continued investment in the infrastructure needed to support our business  primarily in our international and payments segments as well as in our corporate functions  we expect general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute dollars and to remain generally comparable as a percentage of net revenues during the increase in absolute dollars in  was primarily the result of increases of million in fees for external professional advisors  million in the provision for transaction losses  and million in facilities costs 
these costs increased to meet the demands of our expanding business  including operations in new countries and the integration of new businesses 
to support this growth  we increased our general and administrative staff from at december  to  at december   which includes the addition of approximately general and administrative employees resulting from our acquisition of paypal

these employer payroll taxes are recorded as a charge to operations in the period in which such options are exercised and sold based on actual gains realized by employees 
the increases in and were primarily a result of larger individual gains recognized on stock option exercises by our employees during periods in which our stock price was high relative to historic levels 
our results of operations and cash flows could vary significantly depending on the actual period that stock options are exercised by employees and  consequently  the amount of employer payroll taxes assessed 
in general  we expect payroll taxes on employee stock option gains to increase during periods in which our stock price is high relative to historic levels 
amortization of acquired intangible assets percent percent change change in thousands  except percent changes amortization of acquired intangible assets as a percentage of net revenues from time to time we have purchased  and we expect to continue purchasing  assets or businesses to accelerate category and geographic expansion  increase the features and functions available to our users and maintain a leading role in online trading 
these purchase transactions may result in the creation of acquired intangible assets and lead to a corresponding increase in the amortization expense in future periods 
intangible assets include purchased customer lists  trademarks and tradenames  developed technologies  and other intangible assets 
we amortize intangible assets  excluding goodwill  using the straight line method over estimated useful lives ranging from one to eight years 
we believe the straight line method of amortization best represents the distribution of economic value of the identified intangible assets 
goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill is subject to assessment for impairment and is no longer subject to amortization 
rather  goodwill is subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment  applying a fair value based test 
we evaluate goodwill  at a minimum  on an annual basis and whenever events and changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
impairment of goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level by comparing the reporting unit s carrying amount  including goodwill  to the fair value of the 
table of contents reporting unit 
the fair values of the reporting units are estimated using a combination of the income  or discounted cash flows  approach and the market approach  which utilizes comparable companies data 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  goodwill is considered impaired and a second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
our annual impairment test was carried out as of august  and there were no events or circumstances from that date through december  that would impact this assessment 
the increased amortization expense in primarily reflects the full year amortization resulting from our acquisition of paypal on october  amortization of acquired intangible assets decreased during  primarily from the elimination of goodwill amortization as part of our adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets on january  we expect amortization of acquired intangible assets will increase in as a result of the incremental acquired intangible assets associated with our purchase of additional ownership interests in eachnet and internet auction co

our interest and other income  net decreased in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net revenues during  primarily as a result of one time gains recognized in from the sale of certain subsidiaries  real estate properties and an equity investment that totaled million 
this decrease was offset  in part  by increased investment income on a larger aggregate balance of cash  cash equivalents and investments even though the weighted average interest rate of our portfolio declined to in from in we expect that interest and other income  net  will increase in absolute dollars during  as our cash  cash equivalents  and investments balances continue to grow 
our interest and other income  net increased during primarily as a result of one time gains from the sale of certain subsidiaries  real estate properties and an equity investment that totaled million 
these gains were offset by a decrease in interest and investment income of million resulting from lower average interest rates  despite an increase in our cash  cash equivalents and investments balances in and from decreased realized gains on the sale of investments  and a decrease in foreign exchange gains of million

in accordance with the provisions of this standard  we have included our san jose headquarters lease arrangement in our consolidated financial statements effective july  beginning july   our 
table of contents income statement reflects the reclassification of lease payments on our san jose headquarters from operating expense to interest expense 
the increase in interest expense in  is primarily the result of this new accounting standard 
we expect our interest expense will increase in absolute dollars  due to the inclusion of a full year of the interest payments on our san jose lease  and will remain generally comparable as a percentage of net revenue during the decrease in interest expense during  compared to the prior year  was primarily the result of a reduction in the outstanding mortgage note balances in connection with the sale of certain underlying properties 
impairment of certain equity investments percent percent change change in thousands  except percent changes impairment of certain equity investments as a percentage of net revenues during  and  we recorded impairment charges totaling million  million and million  respectively  as a result of the deterioration of the financial condition of certain of our private and public equity investees 
we identified these impairment losses as part of our normal process of assessing the quality of our investment portfolio 
they reflect declines in fair value and other market conditions that we believe are other than temporary 
we expect that the fair value of our equity investments will fluctuate from time to time and future impairment assessments may result in additional charges to our operating results 
provision for income taxes percent percent change change in thousands  except percent changes provision for income taxes as a percentage of net revenues effective tax rate the provision for income taxes differs from the amount computed by applying the statutory us federal rate principally due to non deductible expenses related to acquisitions  state taxes  subsidiary losses for which we have not provided a benefit and other factors that increase the effective tax rate 
these expenses are partially offset by decreases resulting from foreign income with lower effective tax rates  tax credits  and tax exempt interest income 
the lower effective tax rates in and reflect the increasing profit contribution from our international operations that have lower effective tax rates 
we receive tax deductions from the gains realized by employees on the exercise of certain non qualified stock options for which the benefit is recognized as a component of stockholders equity 
we have evaluated our deferred tax assets relating to these stock option deductions along with our other deferred tax assets and concluded that a valuation allowance is required for that portion of the total deferred tax assets that are not considered more likely than not to be realized in future periods 
to the extent that the deferred tax assets with a full valuation allowance become realizable in future periods  we will have the ability  subject to carryforward limitations  to use up to million of additional deferred tax assets to reduce future income tax liabilities 
when recognized  the tax benefit of tax deductions related to stock options are accounted for as a credit to additional paid in capital rather than a reduction of the income tax provision

third parties held minority interests in various of our subsidiaries during  and the change in minority interests in is due primarily to the minority interests portion of the net income generated by internet auction 
we expect that minority interests will continue to fluctuate in future periods 
if internet auction continues to be profitable  the minority interests adjustment on the consolidated statement of income will continue to decrease our net income by the minority investor s share of internet auction s net income 
the change in minority interests in primarily resulted from internet auction generating net income for the first time in along with our january acquisition of the remaining minority interest in billpoint 
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in accordance with the provisions of fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  we have included our san jose headquarters lease arrangement in our consolidated financial statements effective july  under this new accounting standard  our balance sheet at december   reflects additions for land and buildings totaling million  lease obligations of million and non controlling minority interests of million 
our income statement for the year ended december   reflects the reclassification of lease payments on our san jose headquarters from operating expense to interest expense  beginning with the quarters following our adoption of fin on july   a million after tax charge for cumulative depreciation for periods from lease inception through june   and incremental depreciation expense of approximately  net of tax  per quarter for the third and fourth quarters of we have adopted the provisions of fin prospectively from july   and as a result  have not restated prior periods 
the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle arising from the adoption of fin has been reflected in net income in impact of foreign currency translation during  our international net revenues  based upon the country in which the seller  payment recipient  advertiser or other service provider is located  accounted for of our consolidated net revenues  as compared to of our net revenues in and of our net revenues in the growth in our international operations has increased our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations 
net revenues and related expenses generated from international locations are denominated in the functional currencies of the local countries  and include euros  british pounds  korean won  canadian dollars and australian dollars 
the results of operations and certain of our intercompany balances associated with our international locations are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
the income statements of our international operations are translated into us dollars at the average exchange rates in each applicable period 
to the extent the us dollar weakens against foreign currencies  the translation of these foreign currency denominated transactions results in increased net revenues  operating expenses and net income 
similarly  our net revenues  operating expenses and net income will decrease when the us dollar strengthens against foreign currencies 
a significant portion of our international net revenues  operating expenses and net income are denominated in euros 
during  the us dollar weakened against the euro 
the weighted average 
table of contents translation rate changes for the euro  combined with translation rate changes in other foreign currencies  resulted in increased net revenues of approximately million in when compared to the weighted average foreign currency exchange rates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in in addition  the weighted average translation rate changes in foreign currencies increased operating expenses by approximately million in when compared to the weighted average translation rates used in we expect our international operations will continue to grow in significance as we develop and deploy our global marketplace 
as a result  foreign currency fluctuations in future periods could become more significant and may have a negative impact on our net revenues and net income 
see the information in item a under foreign currency risk for additional discussion of the impact of foreign currency translation and related hedging activities 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows year ended december  in thousands net cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities effect of exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents net increase in cash and cash equivalents we have generated annual cash provided by operating activities in amounts greater than net income in  and  driven mainly by non cash charges to earnings 
non cash charges to earnings included depreciation and amortization on our long term assets  tax benefits on the exercise of employee stock options resulting from our increasing stock price and the related increases in the personal gains recognized by our employees  provision for doubtful accounts and authorized credits resulting from increasing revenues  provision for transaction losses resulting from increased total payment volumes processed by our paypal subsidiary and other costs 
in  operating cash flows were partially offset by cash used to support working capital needs 
in and  operating cash flows were positively impacted by the net cash amounts provided by year over year changes in working capital assets and liabilities 
during  we used net cash provided by operating and financing activities to fund purchases of property and equipment  acquisitions and repayments of borrowings 
net cash provided by operating activities also contributed to an increase in our aggregate cash  cash equivalents and investments balance by million in to approximately billion 
we currently expect that fiscal cash flows from operations will continue to exceed net income 
we believe that existing cash  cash equivalents and investments  together with any cash generated from operations  will be sufficient to fund our operating activities  capital expenditures and other obligations for the foreseeable future 
however  if during that period or thereafter we are not successful in generating sufficient cash flows from operations or in raising additional capital when required in sufficient amounts and on terms acceptable to us  our business could suffer 
the net cash flows used in investing activities in  and were due primarily to the movement of cash between cash and investments  the purchase of property and equipment  and acquisitions 
purchases of property and equipment totaled million in  million in and million in purchases of property and equipment in and related mainly to purchases of computer equipment and software to support our site operations  customer support and

in  purchases of property and equipment included the million purchase of additional office space in san jose  california 
purchases of property and equipment in also included amounts for improvements to various facilities in the us and around the world as well as computer equipment and software to support our site operations  customer support and international expansion 
we expect capital expenditures for the purchase of property and equipment to approximate million during  without taking into account any acquisitions or other costs associated with the potential purchase of additional facilities 
this amount for consists primarily of hardware and software for our platform architecture  site operations and corporate information systems 
cash expended for acquisitions  net of cash acquired  totaled million in  million in and million in in  we expended cash to acquire a controlling interest in internet auction  located in south korea 
our cash acquisitions in included acquiring the remaining ownership interest in our billpoint subsidiary and a interest in eachnet  located in china 
we completed our acquisition of paypal during through the exchange of our common stock  and we did not include cash payments in the purchase price 
our cash acquisitions in included acquiring the remaining ownership interest in eachnet and an additional ownership interest in internet auction co 
the net cash flows provided by financing activities in  and were due primarily to proceeds from stock option exercises 
proceeds from stock option exercises totaled million in  million in and million in our future cash flows from stock options are difficult to project as such amounts are a function of both our stock price and the decisions by employees to exercise stock options 
in general  we expect proceeds from stock option exercises to increase during periods in which our stock price has increased 
commitments and contingencies the contractual obligations presented in the table below represent our estimates of future payments under fixed contractual obligations and commitments 
changes in our business needs  cancellation provisions  changing interest rates  and other factors may result in actual payments differing from the estimates 
we cannot provide certainty regarding the timing and amounts of payments 
we have presented below a summary of the most significant assumptions used in our determination of amounts presented in the tables  in order to assist in the review of this information within the context of our consolidated financial position  results of operations  and cash flows 
the following table summarizes our fixed contractual obligations and commitments in thousands other year ending capital operating purchase december  leases leases obligations total thereafter capital lease amounts include leases obligations associated with computer and other office equipment 
the amounts presented are consistent with contractual terms and are not expected to differ significantly  unless we decide to purchase the individual assets prior to the end of the respective lease terms 
the purchase obligation amount in also includes the assumed purchase of the corporate headquarters in san jose  california  in march  when the lease is scheduled to expire 
see note subsequent events in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents operating lease amounts include minimum rental payments under our non cancelable operating leases for office facilities  including our corporate headquarters located in san jose  california  as well as limited computer and office equipment that we utilize under lease arrangements 
the amounts presented are consistent with contractual terms and are not expected to differ significantly  unless a substantial change in our headcount needs requires us to exit an office facility early or expand our occupied space 
other purchase obligation amounts include minimum purchase commitments for advertising  computer equipment  software applications  engineering development services and other goods and services that were entered into through our ordinary course of business 
for those contractual arrangements in which there are significant performance requirements  we have developed estimates to project expected payment obligations 
these estimates have been developed based upon historical trends  when available  and our anticipated future obligations 
given the significance of such performance requirements within our advertising and other arrangements  actual payments could differ significantly from these estimates 
indemnification provisions during the ordinary course of business  in certain limited circumstances  we have included indemnification provisions within certain of our contracts 
pursuant to these agreements  we indemnify  hold harmless  and agree to reimburse the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party  generally parties with which we have commercial relations  in connection with certain intellectual property infringement claims by any third party with respect to our services 
to date  we have not incurred any costs in connection with such indemnification clauses 
subsequent events on january   we entered into an agreement with mobile 
de to acquire all of its outstanding shares for million euros approximately million at the january  exchange rate  subject to certain closing adjustments  plus acquisition costs 
mobile 
de is a classifieds website for vehicles in germany 
the acquisition  which is subject to regulatory approval in germany by the federal cartel office  is expected to close in the second quarter of the acquisition will be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
in february  we elected not to exercise certain rights to extend the lease period for our san jose corporate headquarters 
the lease on these facilities will end on march   and we are obligated to make payments to the lessor of million at lease expiration 
critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates general the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related notes requires us to make judgments  estimates  and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we have based our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
our senior management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
an accounting policy is considered to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used  or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically  could materially impact the financial statements 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
the following descriptions of critical accounting 
table of contents policies  judgments and estimates should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and other disclosures included in this report 
provisions for doubtful accounts and authorized credits our us and international segments are exposed to losses due to uncollectible accounts and credits to sellers 
provisions for these items represent our estimate of actual losses and credits based on our historical experience  are monitored monthly  and are made at the time the related revenue is recognized 
the provision for doubtful accounts is recorded as a charge to operating expense  while the authorized credits are recorded as a reduction of revenues 
the following table illustrates the provision related to doubtful accounts and authorized credits as a percentage of net revenues for   and in thousands  except percents 
years ended december  net revenues from the us and international segments provision for doubtful accounts and authorized credits provision for doubtful accounts and authorized credits as a of net revenues from the us and international segments historically  our actual losses and credits have been consistent with these provisions 
however  unexpected or significant future changes in trends could result in a material impact to future statements of income and cash flows 
based on our results for the year ended december   a basis point deviation from our estimates would have resulted in an increase or decrease in operating expenses and or net revenues of approximately million 
the following analysis demonstrates  for illustrative purposes only  the potential effect a basis point deviation from our estimates would have upon our consolidated financial statements and is not intended to provide a range of exposure or expected deviation in thousands  except per share data our basis basis points estimate points expense revenue reduction related to doubtful accounts and authorized credits income from operations net income diluted earnings per share provision for transaction losses our payments segment is exposed to transaction losses due to credit card and other payment misuse  as well as non performance of sellers who accept payment through paypal 
we establish allowances for estimated losses arising from processing customer transactions  such as charge backs for unauthorized credit card use and merchant related charge backs due to non delivery of goods or services  ach returns  and debit card overdrafts 
these allowances represent an accumulation of the estimated amounts  using an actuarial technique  necessary to provide for transaction losses incurred as of the reporting date  including those of which we have not yet been notified 
the allowances are monitored monthly and are updated based on actual claims data reported by our claims processors 
customers typically have up to days to file transaction disputes 
consequently  the time between estimating the loss provisions and realization of the actual amount is short 
the allowances are based on known facts and circumstances  internal factors including our experience with similar cases  historical trends involving loss payment patterns and the mix of transaction and loss types 
additions to the allowance  in the form of provisions  are reflected as a 
table of contents general and administrative expense in our results of operations  while write offs to the allowance are made when a loss is determined to have occurred 
recoveries  when collected  are recorded as an increase to the allowance for transaction losses 
as of december   the allowance for transaction losses totaled million and was included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet 
the following table illustrates the provision for transaction loss expense as a percentage of total payment volume from paypal operations for the period from october  through december  and for the year ended december  in thousands  except percents 
period from october  through year ended december  december  total payment volume transaction loss expense as a of total payment volume the establishment of appropriate allowances for transaction losses is an inherently uncertain process  and ultimate losses may vary from the current estimates 
we regularly update our allowance estimates as new facts become known and events occur that may impact the settlement or recovery of losses 
the allowances are maintained at a level we deem appropriate to adequately provide for losses incurred at the balance sheet date 
based on our results for the year ended december   a five basis point deviation from our estimates would have resulted in an increase or decrease in our operating expenses of approximately million 
the following analysis demonstrates  for illustrative purposes only  the potential effect a five basis point deviation from our estimates would have upon our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december   and is not intended to provide a range of exposure or expected deviation in thousands  except per share data our basis basis points estimate points transaction loss expense income from operations net income diluted earnings per share legal contingencies in connection with certain pending litigation and other claims  we have estimated the range of probable loss and provided for such losses through charges to our income statement 
these estimates have been based on our assessment of the facts and circumstances at each balance sheet date and are subject to change based upon new information and future events 
from time to time  we are involved in disputes that arise in the ordinary course of business  and we do not expect this trend to change in the future 
we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings as discussed in item legal proceedings and note commitments and contingencies litigation and other legal matters to our consolidated financial statements  which we incorporate by reference herein 
we believe that we have meritorious defenses to the claims against us  and we will defend ourselves vigorously 
however  even if successful  our defense against certain actions will be costly and could divert our management s time 
if the plaintiffs were to prevail on certain claims  we might be forced to pay significant damages and licensing fees  modify our business practices or even be prohibited from conducting a significant part of our us business 
any such results could materially harm our business and 
table of contents could result in a material adverse impact on the financial position  results of operations or cash flows of all or any of our three segments 
accounting for income taxes we are required to recognize a provision for income taxes based upon the taxable income and temporary differences for each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process requires a calculation of taxes payable under currently enacted tax laws around the world and an analysis of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of our assets and liabilities  including various accruals  allowances  depreciation and amortization 
the tax effect of these temporary differences and the estimated tax benefit from our tax net operating losses are reported as deferred tax assets and liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet 
we also assess the likelihood that our net deferred tax assets will be realized from future taxable income 
to the extent we believe that it is more likely than not that some portion  or all of  the deferred tax asset will not be realized  we establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or change the allowance in a period  we reflect the change with a corresponding increase or decrease in our tax provision in our income statement 
where the change in the valuation allowance relates to the deduction for employee stock option exercises  the change is reflected as a credit to additional paid in capital 
as employee stock option exercises are highly dependent upon our stock price  it is extremely difficult to predict the amount of deductions that will be generated from future option exercises and  therefore  for us to ascertain the amount of deferred tax assets related to employee stock option exercises that may be realized in future periods 
the deferred tax asset  net of a valuation allowance of million  totaled million at december  and was offset by deferred tax liabilities of million resulting in a net deferred tax liability of million 
in addition  due to our significant anticipated international expansion  we have not provided for us federal income and foreign withholding taxes on non us subsidiaries undistributed earnings as of december   because such earnings are intended to be reinvested indefinitely 
in the event that our future international expansion plans change and such amounts are not reinvested indefinitely  we would be subject to us income taxes partially offset by foreign tax credits 
the following table illustrates the provision for income taxes as a percentage of income before income taxes for   and in thousands  except percents year ended december  income before income taxes provision for income taxes as a of income before income taxes historically  these provisions have adequately provided for our actual income tax liabilities 
however  unexpected or significant future changes in trends could result in a material impact to future statements of income and cash flows 
based on our results for the year ended december   a one percentage point change in our provision for income taxes as a percentage of income before taxes would have resulted in an increase or decrease in expense of approximately million 
the following analysis demonstrates  for illustrative purposes only  the potential effect such a one percentage point deviation change would have upon our financial statements and is not intended to provide a range of exposure or expected deviation in thousands  except per share data our estimate provision for income taxes income before income taxes net income diluted earnings per share 
table of contents advertising and other non transaction revenues a portion of our net revenues result from fees associated with advertising and other non transaction services in our us  international and payments segments 
net revenues from advertising are derived principally from the sale of online banner and sponsorship advertisements for cash and through barter arrangements 
other non transaction net revenues are derived principally from contractual arrangements with third parties that provide transaction services to ebay users and from offline services provided by wholly owned subsidiaries that were divested in the second half of advertising and other non transaction net revenues  including barter transactions  totaled  and of our consolidated net revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively  and were primarily generated by our us segment 
revenue from barter arrangements totaled million in  million in and million in certain judgments are involved in the determination of the appropriate revenue recognition  including  but not limited to  the assessment and allocation of fair values in multiple element arrangements and the appropriateness of gross or net revenue recognition 
our advertising and other non transaction net revenues may be affected by the financial condition of the parties with whom we have these relationships and by the success of online services and promotions in general 
unlike our transaction revenues  advertising and other non transaction net revenues are derived from a highly concentrated customer base 
during the years ended december   and  all advertising and other non transaction net revenues  excluding offline revenues  were derived from approximately  and customers  respectively 
business combinations in accordance with the provisions of sfas  the purchase price of an acquired company is allocated between intangible assets and the net tangible assets of the acquired business with the residual of the purchase price recorded as goodwill 
the determination of the value of the intangible assets acquired involves certain judgments and estimates 
these judgments can include  but are not limited to  the cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future  the appropriate weighted average cost of capital  and the cost savings expected to be derived from acquiring an asset 
at december  our goodwill totaled billion and our identifiable intangible assets totaled million 
in accordance with the provisions of sfas  we assess the impairment of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets of our reportable units annually  or more often if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
this assessment is based upon a discounted cash flow analysis and analysis of our market capitalization 
the estimate of cash flow is based upon  among other things  certain assumptions about expected future operating performance and an appropriate discount rate determined by our management 
our estimates of discounted cash flows may differ from actual cash flows due to  among other things  economic conditions  changes to its business model or changes in operating performance 
significant differences between these estimates and actual cash flows could materially affect our future financial results 
we completed our annual goodwill impairment test as of august  and determined that no adjustment to the carrying value of goodwill for any of our reportable units was required 
we have determined that no events have occurred during the four months ended december  that would require updated analysis 

table of contents risk factors that may affect results of operations and financial condition the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing ebay 
other events that we do not currently anticipate or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations 
our operating results may fluctuate 
our operating results have varied on a quarterly basis during our operating history 
our operating results may fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors  many of which are outside our control 
factors that may affect our quarterly operating results include the following our ability to retain an active user base  to attract new users and to encourage existing users to list items for sale  purchase items through our service  or use our payment services  both in the us and internationally  the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures relating to the maintenance and expansion of our businesses  operations  and infrastructure  foreign or domestic government regulation  including investigations prompted by items listed  sold  or paid for by our users  our ability to comply with the requirements of entities whose services are required for our operations  such as credit card associations  the success of our geographic and product expansion  the introduction of new sites  services  and products by us or our competitors  volume  size  timing  and completion rate of transactions on our websites  consumer confidence in the safety and security of transactions on our websites  the costs and results of litigation that involves us  our ability to upgrade and develop our systems  infrastructure  and customer service capabilities to accommodate growth at a reasonable cost  our ability to keep our websites operational at a reasonable cost  our ability to develop product enhancements at a reasonable cost and to develop programs and features in a timely manner  our ability to integrate successfully and cost effectively manage our acquisitions  including paypal and  more recently  eachnet  our ability to manage paypal s transaction loss and credit card chargeback rate and payment funding mix  our ability to expand paypal s product offerings internationally including our ability to obtain any necessary regulatory approvals and to increase the acceptance of paypal by online merchants outside of the ebay marketplace  our ability to attract new personnel in a timely and effective manner  our ability to retain key employees in our businesses  our ability to expand our product offerings involving fixed price trading  the results of regulatory decisions that affect us  technical difficulties or service interruptions involving our websites or services provided to our users by third parties  the actions of our competitors  
table of contents the timing  cost and availability of advertising in traditional media and on other websites and online services  the timing of payments to us and of marketing and other expenses under existing and future contracts  the success of our brand building and marketing campaigns  the continued financial strength of our technology suppliers and other parties with which we have commercial relations  increasing consumer acceptance of the internet and other online services for commerce and  in particular  for the trading of products such as those listed on our websites  general economic conditions and those economic conditions specific to the internet and e commerce industries  and geopolitical events such as war  threat of war  or terrorist actions 
our limited operating history and the increased variety of services offered on our websites make it difficult for us to forecast the level or source of our revenues or earnings accurately 
in view of the rapidly evolving nature of our business and our limited operating history  we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful  and you should not rely upon them as an indication of future performance 
we do not have backlog  and substantially all of our net revenues each quarter come from transactions involving sales or payments during that quarter 
due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting revenues it is also difficult to forecast income statement expenses as a percentage of net revenues 
quarterly and annual income statement expenses as a percentage of net revenues may be significantly different from historical or projected rates 
our operating results in one or more future quarters may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors 
in that event  the trading price of our common stock would almost certainly decline 
we may not maintain our level of profitability 
we believe that our continued profitability at historical levels will depend in large part on our ability to do the following attract new users and keep existing users active on our websites  manage the costs of our business  including the costs associated with maintaining and developing our websites  customer support  transaction and chargeback rates  and international and product expansion  maintain sufficient transaction volume to attract buyers and sellers  increase the awareness of our brands  and provide our customers with superior community  customer support  and trading experiences 
we invest heavily in marketing and promotion  customer support  and further development of operating infrastructure for our core and recently acquired operations 
some of this investment entails long term contractual commitments 
as a result  we may be unable to adjust our spending rapidly enough to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall  which may harm our profitability 
in addition  we are spending in advance of anticipated growth  which may also harm our profitability 
there are many risks associated with our international operations 
our international expansion has been rapid and we have only limited experience in many of the countries in which we now do business 
our international business  especially in germany  the uk  canada  and south korea  has also become critical to our revenues and profits 
expansion into international markets  such as our recent entry into the people s republic of china  requires management 
table of contents attention and resources 
we have limited experience in localizing our service to conform to local cultures  standards and policies 
in many countries  we compete with local companies who understand the local market better than we do 
we may not be successful in expanding into particular international markets or in generating revenues from foreign operations 
for example  in we withdrew from the japanese market 
even if we are successful  we expect the costs of operating new sites to exceed our net revenues for at least months in most countries 
as we continue to expand internationally  including through the expansion of paypal  we are subject to risks of doing business internationally  including the following regulatory requirements  including regulation of auctioneering  professional selling  distance selling  banking  and money transmitting  that may limit or prevent the offering of ebay s and paypal s services in some jurisdictions  prevent enforceable agreements between sellers and buyers  prohibit the listing of certain categories of goods  require special licensure  or limit the transfer of information between ebay and our affiliates  legal uncertainty regarding liability for the listings and other content provided by our users  including uncertainty as a result of less internet friendly legal systems  unique local laws  and lack of clear precedent or applicable law  difficulties in integrating with local payment providers  including banks  credit and debit card associations and electronic fund transfer systems  different employee employer relationships and the existence of workers councils and labor unions  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  longer payment cycles  different accounting practices  and greater problems in collecting accounts receivable  potentially adverse tax consequences  including local taxation of our fees or of transactions on our websites  higher telecommunications and internet service provider costs  strong local competitors  different and more stringent consumer protection  data protection and other laws  cultural ambivalence towards  or non acceptance of  online trading  seasonal reductions in business activity  expenses associated with localizing our products  including offering customers the ability to transact business in the local currency  laws and business practices that favor local competitors  profit repatriation restrictions  foreign currency exchange restrictions  and exchange rate fluctuations  changes in a specific country s or region s political or economic conditions  and differing intellectual property laws 
some of these factors may cause our international costs of doing business to exceed our comparable domestic costs 
to the extent we expand our international operations and have additional portions of our international revenues denominated in foreign currencies  we also could become subject to increased difficulties in collecting accounts receivable and risks relating to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations is discussed in more detail under we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates  below 
we intend to expand paypal s services internationally 
both ebay and paypal have limited experience with the payments business outside of the us in some countries  expansion of paypal s business may require a close commercial relationship with one or more local banks 
we do not know if these or other 
table of contents factors may prevent  delay  or limit paypal s expansion or reduce its profitability 
any limitation on our ability to expand paypal internationally could harm our business 
our investment in eachnet is subject to risks and uncertainties relating to the laws and regulations of the people s republic of china 
in july  we completed the acquisition of the remaining outstanding capital stock and options of eachnet 
eachnet is a delaware corporation and a foreign person under the laws of the people s republic of china  or prc  and is subject to many of the risks of doing business internationally described above under there are many risks associated with our international operations 
the prc currently regulates its internet sector through regulations restricting the scope of foreign investment and through the enforcement of content restrictions on the internet 
while many aspects of these regulations remain unclear  they purport to limit and require licensing of various aspects of the provision of internet information services 
these regulations have created substantial uncertainties regarding the legality of foreign investments in prc internet companies  including eachnet and the business operations of such companies 
in order to meet local ownership and regulatory licensing requirements  the eachnet website is operated through a foreign owned enterprise indirectly owned by eachnet inc  which acts in cooperation with a local prc company owned by certain eachnet employees 
we believe eachnet s current ownership structure complies with all existing prc laws  rules  and regulations 
there are  however  substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation of current prc laws and regulations  and it is possible that the prc government will ultimately take a view contrary to ours 
there are also uncertainties regarding eachnet s ability to enforce contractual relationships it has entered into with respect to management and control of the company s business 
if eachnet were found to be in violation of any existing or future prc laws or regulations  it could be subject to fines and other financial penalties  have its business and internet content provider licenses revoked  or be forced to discontinue its business entirely 
we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
net revenues outside the united states accounted for approximately of our net revenues in because we conduct a significant and growing portion of our business outside the united states  we face exposure to adverse movements in non us currency exchange rates 
in connection with its multi currency service  paypal fixes exchange rates twice per day  and may face financial exposure if it incorrectly fixes the exchange rate 
paypal also holds some corporate funds in non us currencies to facilitate customer withdrawals  and thus its financial results are affected by the translation of these non us currencies into non us dollars 
in addition  the results of operations of our internationally focused websites are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of the applicable subsidiaries are translated from the local currency into us dollars upon consolidation 
if the us dollar weakens against foreign currencies  as it did during  the translation of these foreign currency denominated transactions will result in increased net revenues  operating expenses  and net income 
the change in weighted average foreign currency exchange rates in relative to the comparable rates used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements resulted in an increase in net revenue of approximately million and an increase in operating expenses of approximately million 
similarly  our net revenues  operating expenses  and net income will decrease if the us dollar strengthens against foreign currencies 
as exchange rates vary  net sales and other operating results  when translated  may differ materially from expectations 
in particular  to the extent the us dollar strengthens against the euro and british pound  our european revenues and profits will be reduced as a result of these translation adjustments 
our business may be subject to sales and other taxes 
we do not collect sales or other similar taxes on goods or services sold by users through our services 
one or more states or any foreign country may seek to impose sales  use  or value added tax collection or record keeping obligations on companies such as ebay that engage in or facilitate online commerce 
such taxes could be imposed if  for example  we were ever deemed to be an auctioneer or the agent of our 
table of contents sellers 
several proposals have been made at the state and local level that would impose additional taxes on the sale of goods and services through the internet 
these proposals  if adopted  could substantially impair the growth of e commerce  and could diminish our opportunity to derive financial benefit from our activities 
in and  the us federal government enacted legislation prohibiting states or other local authorities from imposing access or discriminatory taxes on the internet through november  the expiration of this moratorium may permit new access or discriminatory taxes on the internet that could adversely affect our business 
legislation has also been introduced in the us congress to override the supreme court s quill decision  which limits the ability of state governments to require sellers outside of their own state to collect and remit sales taxes on goods purchased by in state residents 
passage of such legislation and the imposition of such sales tax requirements would adversely affect our sellers and our business 
on july   ebay began collecting value added tax  or vat  on the fees we charge sellers in the european union  or eu 
we continue to work with the relevant tax authorities to clarify our obligations under these new regulations 
there have been and will continue to be substantial ongoing costs associated with complying with the vat rules throughout the eu  and the increased costs to our european users may reduce their activity on our websites and could adversely affect our international transaction net revenues 
a successful assertion by one or more states or any foreign country that we should collect sales or other taxes on the exchange of merchandise or services on our system would harm our business 
our business may be harmed by fraudulent activities on our websites and disputes between users of our services 
paypal faces significant risks of loss due to fraud and disputes between senders and recipients  including merchant fraud and other disputes over the quality of goods and services  unauthorized use of credit card and bank account information and identity theft  the need to provide effective customer support to process disputes between senders and recipients  potential breaches of system security  potential employee fraud  and use of paypal s system by customers to make or accept payment for illegal or improper purposes 
for the year ended december   paypal s provision for transaction losses totaled million  representing of paypal s total payment volume 
failure to deal effectively with fraudulent transactions and customer disputes would increase paypal s loss rate and harm its business 
the highly automated nature of  and liquidity offered by  paypal s payment service makes paypal an attractive target for fraud 
in configuring its service  paypal faces an inherent trade off between customer convenience and security 
identity thieves and those committing fraud using stolen credit card or bank account numbers  often in bulk and in conjunction with automated mechanisms of online communication  potentially can steal large amounts of money from businesses such as paypal s 
we believe that several of paypal s current and former competitors in the electronic payments business have gone out of business or significantly restricted their businesses largely due to losses from this type of fraud 
we expect that technically knowledgeable criminals will continue to attempt to circumvent paypal s anti fraud systems 
in addition  paypal s service could be subject to employee fraud or other internal security breaches  and paypal is required to reimburse customers for any funds stolen as a result of such breaches 
if paypal fails to prevent external or internal fraud  our business will be harmed 
paypal incurs substantial losses from merchant fraud  including claims from customers that merchants have not performed or that their goods or services do not match the merchant s description 
paypal also incurs losses from claims that the customer did not authorize the purchase  from erroneous transmissions and from customers who have closed bank accounts or have insufficient funds in them to satisfy payments 
in addition to the direct costs of such losses  if they are related to credit card transactions and become 
table of contents excessive they could result in paypal losing the right to accept credit cards for payment 
if paypal were unable to accept credit cards  the velocity of trade on ebay could decrease  in which case our business would further suffer 
paypal has been assessed substantial fines for excess chargebacks in the past  and excessive chargebacks may arise in the future 
paypal has taken measures to detect and reduce the risk of fraud  but these measures may not be effective 
if these measures do not succeed  our business will suffer 
in addition  prior to september  some card issuers treated purchases made through paypal as the purchase of a money transfer service rather than the purchase of goods and services  which resulted in reduced chargeback rights for the consumer if the consumer did not receive the goods or received unsatisfactory goods 
paypal could be required to provide consumers full chargeback rights in such pre september cases  even if the normal time for exercising chargeback rights has expired 
paypal must also now absorb the costs of chargebacks from all card issuers for goods that are not delivered or are not as described  which may result in increased losses from merchant fraud and from disputes over the quality of goods and services 
in october  paypal launched a new buyer protection program that will refund buyers up to in certain ebay transactions if they do not receive the goods they purchased or if the goods are significantly not as described 
in the event that paypal makes such a refund  it will seek to collect reimbursement from the seller  but may not be able to receive any funds from the seller 
the paypal buyer protection program has increased paypal s loss rate and could cause future fluctuations 
ebay faces similar risks to those of paypal with respect to fraudulent activities  although ebay s risks may to some extent be less significant 
ebay periodically receives complaints from users who did not receive the purchase price or the goods that were to have been exchanged 
in some cases individuals have been arrested and convicted for fraudulent activities using our websites 
while ebay can suspend the accounts of users who fail to fulfill their delivery obligations to other users  ebay does not have the ability to require users to make payments or deliver goods  or otherwise make users whole other than through our limited buyer protection programs 
other than through these programs  ebay does not compensate users who believe they have been defrauded by other users 
ebay also periodically receives complaints from buyers as to the quality of the goods purchased 
we expect to continue to receive communications from users requesting reimbursement or threatening or commencing legal action against us if no reimbursement is made 
our liability for these sort of claims is only beginning to be clarified and may be higher in some non us jurisdictions than it is in the us litigation of this sort could be costly for us  divert management attention  result in increased costs of doing business  lead to adverse judgments  or could otherwise harm our business 
in addition  affected users will likely complain to regulatory agencies that could take action against us  including imposing fines or seeking injunctions 
negative publicity generated as a result of fraudulent or deceptive conduct by users of our ebay and paypal services is increasing  and such publicity could damage our reputation  reduce our ability to attract new users and diminish the value of our brand name 
paypal s success in reducing fraud losses depends in part on its ability to restrict the withdrawal of customer funds while it investigates suspicious transactions 
paypal has been and could again be sued by plaintiffs and has received inquiries from governmental entities regarding its account restriction and disclosure practices 
if the results of these lawsuits or inquiries are adverse to paypal  it could be required to pay substantial damages and restructure its anti fraud processes in ways that would harm its business 
as part of paypal s program to reduce fraud losses  it may temporarily restrict the ability of customers to withdraw their funds if those funds or the customer s account activity are identified by paypal s anti fraud models as suspicious 
paypal is subject to purported class action lawsuits challenging its procedures and disclosures with respect to suspicious accounts  and alleging that those procedures and disclosures violate federal and state law on consumer protection and unfair business practice and are inconsistent with paypal s user agreement 
in addition  many customers who are subject to such restrictions complain to regulatory agencies 
as a result of customer complaints  paypal has also received inquiries regarding its 
table of contents restriction and disclosure practices from the federal trade commission and the attorneys general of a number of states 
if paypal s processes are found to violate federal or state law on consumer protection and unfair business practices  it could be subject to an enforcement action or fines 
if paypal loses the litigation described above or becomes subject to an enforcement action  it could be required to restructure its anti fraud processes in ways that would harm its business  and to pay substantial damages or fines 
even if paypal is able to defend itself successfully  the litigation or enforcement action could cause damage to its reputation  could consume substantial amounts of its management s time and attention  and could require paypal to change its customer service and operations in ways that could increase its costs and decrease the effectiveness of its anti fraud program 
changes to card association rules or practices could negatively affect paypal s service and  if it does not comply with the rules  could result in a termination of paypal s ability to accept credit cards 
if paypal is unable to accept credit cards  our business would suffer 
because paypal is not a bank  it cannot belong to or directly access the visa and mastercard credit card associations 
as a result  paypal must rely on banks or payment processors to process transactions 
paypal is required by its processors to comply with credit card association operating rules  and paypal has agreed to reimburse its processors for any fines they are assessed by credit card associations as a result of processing payments for paypal 
the credit card associations and their member banks set and interpret the credit card rules 
some of those member banks compete with paypal 
visa  mastercard  american express  or discover could adopt new operating rules or re interpret existing rules which paypal and or its processors might find difficult or even impossible to follow 
as a result  paypal could lose its ability to give customers the option of using credit cards to fund their payments 
if paypal were unable to accept credit cards  its business would be seriously damaged 
in addition  the velocity of trade on ebay could decrease and our business would further suffer 
in  both visa and mastercard adopted new operating rules for internet payment services like paypal 
in order to comply with the associations new rules  paypal and its credit card processors have implemented changes to existing business processes for us customers  and have worked aggressively throughout on changes with respect to processes for transactions involving international customers 
paypal and its processors completed the implementation of these changes with respect to canadian and european customers in february any problems with this implementation could result in fines  the amount of which would be within visa s and mastercard s discretion 
paypal and its processors could be unable to implement the necessary changes with respect to customers outside the us  canada  and europe  which could result in fines or the inability of paypal to process mastercard payments for international merchants in certain countries 
paypal also could be subject to fines from mastercard and visa if it fails to register and conduct additional monitoring with respect to the activities of merchants that are considered high risk  primarily certain merchants that sell digital content 
paypal s credit card processors have passed on to paypal fines of  in and  through march in the first quarter of relating to paypal s failure to detect the use of its service by certain high risk merchants using the paypal service 
increases in credit card processing fees could increase paypal s costs  affect its profitability  or otherwise limit its operations 
from time to time  visa  mastercard  american express and discover may increase the interchange fees that they charge for each transaction using one of their cards 
mastercard and visa have each announced increases to their credit card interchange fees effective april visa and mastercard both implemented a decrease in their debit card interchange fees in august as a result of the settlement of litigation  but the settlement agreement required them to maintain these lower interchange fees only until january  and they have announced increases in debit card interchange fees  in january and april  respectively  to levels close to those that prevailed prior to august paypal s credit card processors have the right to pass any increases in interchange fees on to paypal 
such increased fees will increase paypal s operating costs and reduce its profit margins 

table of contents if paypal were found to be subject to or in violation of any us laws or regulations governing banking  money transmission or electronic funds transfers  it could be subject to liability and forced to change its business practices 
we believe that the licensing or approval requirements of the us office of the comptroller of the currency  the federal reserve board and other federal or state agencies that regulate banks  bank holding companies  or other types of providers of electronic commerce services do not apply to paypal  except for certain money transmitter licenses mentioned below 
however  one or more states may conclude that paypal is engaged in an unauthorized banking business 
paypal received written communications from regulatory authorities in new york and louisiana in early expressing the view that its service as it formerly operated constituted an unauthorized banking business  and from authorities in california and idaho in that its service might constitute an unauthorized banking business 
paypal has taken steps to address these states concerns and received a conclusion in from the new york banking department that its current business model does not constitute illegal banking 
paypal also has obtained licenses to operate as a money transmitter in california  louisiana  idaho and many other states 
however  we cannot guarantee that the steps paypal has taken to address state regulatory concerns will be effective in all states 
if paypal is found to be engaged in an unauthorized banking business in one or more states  it might be subject to monetary penalties and adverse publicity and might be required to cease doing business with residents of those states 
even if the steps it has taken to resolve these states concerns are deemed sufficient by the state regulatory authorities  paypal could be subject to fines and penalties for its prior activities 
the need to comply with state laws prohibiting unauthorized banking activities could also limit paypal s ability to enhance its services in the future 
any change to paypal s business practices that makes the service less attractive to customers or prohibits its use by residents of a particular jurisdiction could decrease the velocity of trade on ebay  which would further harm our business 
a number of states have enacted legislation regulating money transmitters and paypal has applied for licenses under this legislation in jurisdictions 
to date  paypal has obtained licenses in of these jurisdictions 
as a licensed money transmitter  paypal is subject to bonding requirements  restrictions on its investment of customer funds  reporting requirements  and inspection by state regulatory agencies 
if paypal s pending applications were denied  or if it were found to be subject to and in violation of any money services laws or regulations  paypal also could be subject to liability  forced to cease doing business with residents of certain states  or forced to change its business practices 
any change to paypal s business practices that makes the service less attractive to customers or prohibits its use by residents of a particular jurisdiction could decrease the velocity of trade on ebay  which would further harm our business 
even if paypal is not forced to change its business practices  it could be required to obtain licenses or regulatory approvals that could impose a substantial cost on paypal 
although there have been no definitive interpretations to date  paypal has assumed that its service is subject to the electronic fund transfer act and regulation e of the federal reserve board 
as a result  among other things  paypal must provide advance disclosure of changes to its service  follow specified error resolution procedures and absorb losses above from transactions not authorized by the consumer 
in addition  paypal is subject to the financial privacy provisions of the gramm leach bliley act and related regulations 
as a result  some customer financial information that paypal receives is subject to limitations on reuse and disclosure 
existing and potential future privacy laws may limit paypal s ability to develop new products and services that make use of data gathered through its service 
the provisions of these laws and related regulations are complicated  and paypal does not have extensive experience in complying with them 
even technical violations of these laws can result in penalties of up to  for each non compliant transaction 
during  paypal processed approximately  transactions per day  and any violations could expose paypal to significant liability 

table of contents paypal s status under banking or financial services laws or other laws in countries outside the us is unclear 
the cost of obtaining any required licenses or regulatory approvals in these countries could affect paypal s future profitability 
paypal currently allows its customers with credit cards to send payments from countries outside the us  and to receive payments in of those countries 
in of these countries  customers can withdraw funds to local bank accounts 
in the fourth quarter of  paypal began offering customers the ability to send or receive payments denominated in pounds  euros  canadian dollars or yen  in addition to us dollars 
in february  paypal europe ltd  a wholly subsidiary of paypal  received a license to operate as an electronic money institution in the united kingdom as a vehicle for providing localized versions of paypal s service to customers in the european union 
paypal has completed the migration of all eu customers to that subsidiary 
fifteen of the countries whose residents can use the paypal service are members of the european union 
as paypal europe develops localized services for the domestic market in these countries  it will seek approval to implement such localized service through an expedited passport notification process 
any delay in obtaining clearance through the passport process could force paypal to delay its plans for expanding its business 
paypal has filed passport notices for germany  france  netherlands  belgium and austria 
paypal europe is subject to significant fines or other enforcement action if it violates the disclosure  reporting  anti money laundering  capitalization  funds management or other requirements imposed on electronic money institutions 
in the countries that are not members of the european union  it is not clear whether paypal s us based service is subject to local law or  if it is subject to local law  whether such local law requires a payment processor like paypal to be licensed as a bank or financial institution or otherwise 
even if paypal is not currently required to obtain a license in those countries  future localization or targeted marketing of paypal s service in those countries could require licensure 
even if paypal is not required to obtain a license  other laws of those countries such as data protection laws may apply 
if paypal were found to be subject to and in violation of any foreign laws or regulations  it could be subject to liability  forced to change its business practices or forced to suspend providing services to customers in one or more countries 
alternatively  paypal could be required to obtain licenses or regulatory approvals that could impose a substantial cost on it and involve considerable delay to the provision or development of its product 
delay or failure to receive such a license would require paypal to change its business practices or features in ways that would adversely affect paypal s international expansion plans and could require paypal to suspend providing services to customers in one or more countries 
our auction business may be subject to regulation which could require us to modify our business practices 
numerous states and foreign jurisdictions  including the state of california  where our headquarters are located  have regulations regarding how auctions may be conducted and the liability of auctioneers in conducting such auctions 
no final legal determination has been made as to whether the california regulations apply to our business and little precedent exists in this area 
several states and some foreign jurisdictions have attempted  and may attempt in the future  to impose such regulations upon us or our users  which could harm our business 
we are currently subject to potential regulation under the office of banks and real estate in illinois concerning the applicability of the illinois auction law to our services 
in august  illinois amended its auction law to provide for a special regulatory regime for internet auction listing services 
we expect to register as an internet auction listing service in illinois following the adoption of regulations under the amended statute 
although we do not expect this registration to have a negative impact on our business  other regulatory and licensure claims could result in costly litigation or could require us to change our manner of doing business in ways that increase our costs or reduce our revenues or force us to prohibit listings of certain items for some locations 
we could also be subject to fines or other penalties 
any of these outcomes could harm our business 
we are subject to regulations relating to consumer privacy 
several domestic jurisdictions have proposed  and california  minnesota  utah  and vermont have recently passed  legislation that would limit the uses of personal user information gathered online or offline 

table of contents many jurisdictions already have such laws and continuously consider strengthening them  especially against online services 
ebay and paypal in certain instances are subject to some of these current laws 
paypal may be subject to recently enacted legislation in several states and countries imposing greater restrictions on the ability of financial services companies to share user information with third parties without affirmative user consent 
however  the fair credit reporting act  or fcra  a federal statute enacted in to protect consumer privacy  includes a provision preempting conflicting state laws on the sharing of information between corporate affiliates 
the preemptive provisions of fcra were permanently extended last year  thus ensuring that paypal and ebay are not subject to the laws of each individual state with respect to matters within the scope of fcra  but remain subject to the provisions of fcra 
the us federal trade commission also has settled several proceedings against companies regarding the manner in which personal information is collected from users and provided to third parties 
specific statutes intended to protect user privacy have been passed in many non us jurisdictions  including virtually every non us jurisdiction in which we currently have a localized website 
compliance with these laws  given the tight integration of our systems across different countries and the need to move data to facilitate transactions amongst our users eg  to payment companies  shipping companies  etc  is both necessary and difficult 
failure to comply could subject us to lawsuits  fines  criminal penalties  statutory damages  adverse publicity  and other losses that could harm our business 
changes to existing laws or the passage of new laws intended to address these issues could directly affect the way we do business or could create uncertainty on the internet 
this could reduce demand for our services  increase the cost of doing business as a result of litigation costs or increased service or delivery costs  or otherwise harm our business 
new and existing regulations could harm our business 
we are subject to the same foreign and domestic laws as other companies conducting business on and off the internet 
today  there are still relatively few laws specifically directed towards online services 
however  due to the increasing popularity and use of the internet and online services  many laws relating to the internet are being debated at all levels of government around the world and it is possible that such laws and regulations will be adopted 
these laws and regulations could cover issues such as user privacy  freedom of expression  pricing  fraud  content and quality of products and services  taxation  advertising  intellectual property rights  and information security 
applicability to the internet of existing laws governing issues such as property ownership  copyrights and other intellectual property issues  taxation  libel and defamation  obscenity  and personal privacy is uncertain 
the vast majority of these laws were adopted prior to the advent of the internet and related technologies and  as a result  do not contemplate or address the unique issues of the internet and related technologies 
those laws that do reference the internet  such as the us digital millennium copyright act and the european union s eu directive on distance selling and electronic commerce have only recently begun to be interpreted by the courts and implemented by the eu member states  so their applicability and scope remain somewhat uncertain 
as our activities and the types of goods listed on our site expand  regulatory agencies may claim that we or our users are subject to licensure in their jurisdiction  either with respect to our services in general  or in order to allow the sale of certain items eg  real estate  event tickets  boats  automobiles 
in addition  because our services are accessible worldwide  and we facilitate sales of goods to users worldwide  foreign jurisdictions may claim that we are required to comply with their laws 
for example  the australian high court has ruled that a us website in certain circumstances must comply with australian laws regarding libel 
as we have expanded and localized our international activities  we have become obligated to comply with the laws of the countries in which we operate 
laws regulating internet companies outside of the us may be less favorable than those in the us  giving greater rights to consumers  content owners  and users 
compliance may be more costly or may require us to change our business practices or restrict our service offerings relative to those in the us our failure to comply with foreign laws could subject us to penalties ranging from criminal fines to bans on our services 

table of contents paypal s financial success will remain highly sensitive to changes in the rate at which its customers fund payments using credit cards rather than bank account transfers or existing paypal account balances 
paypal s profitability could be harmed if the rate at which customers fund using credit cards goes up 
paypal pays significant transaction fees when senders fund payment transactions using credit cards  nominal fees when customers fund payment transactions by electronic transfer of funds from bank accounts  and no fees when customers fund payment transactions from an existing paypal account balance 
during  senders funded of paypal s payment volume using credit cards 
senders may resist funding payments by electronic transfer from bank accounts because of the greater protection offered by credit cards  including the ability to dispute and reverse charges if merchandise is not delivered or is not as described  because of frequent flier miles or other incentives offered by credit cards  because of the ability to defer payment  or because of generalized fears regarding privacy or loss of control in providing bank account information to a third party 
paypal has limited experience in managing and accounting accurately for large amounts of customer funds 
paypal s failure to manage these funds properly would harm its business 
paypal s ability to manage and account accurately for customer funds requires a high level of internal controls 
paypal has neither an established operating history nor proven management experience in maintaining  over a long term  these internal controls 
as paypal s business continues to grow  it must strengthen its internal controls accordingly 
paypal s success requires significant public confidence in its ability to handle large and growing transaction volumes and amounts of customer funds 
any failure to maintain necessary controls or to manage accurately customer funds could diminish customer use of paypal s product severely 
our failure to manage growth could harm us 
we are currently expanding our headcount  facilities  and infrastructure in the us  internationally  and with paypal 
we anticipate that further expansion will be required to address potential growth in our customer base and number of listings and payment transactions  as well as our expansion into new geographic areas  types of goods  and alternative methods of sale 
this expansion has placed  and we expect it will continue to place  a significant strain on our management  operational and financial resources 
the areas that are put under strain by our growth include the following the websites 
we must constantly add new hardware  update software and add new engineering personnel to accommodate the increased use of our and our subsidiaries websites and the new products and features we are regularly introducing 
this upgrade process is expensive  and the increased complexity of our websites increases the cost of additional enhancements 
if we are unable to upgrade our technology  transaction processing systems  security infrastructure  or network infrastructure to accommodate increased traffic or transaction volume  our business could be harmed 
adverse consequences could include unanticipated system disruptions  slower response times  degradation in levels of customer support  impaired quality of users experiences of our services  impaired quality of services for third party application developers using our externally accessible application programming interface  or api  and delays in reporting accurate financial information 
our failure to provide an increasing level of new features and functionality in a cost effective manner also could result in these consequences 
we may be unable to effectively upgrade and expand our systems in a timely manner or to integrate smoothly with our existing systems any newly developed or purchased technologies or businesses such as paypal 
we are in the midst of significant multi year projects to enhance our current technical architecture 
if these projects are not successful  our business could be harmed 
we have experienced periodic unscheduled downtime 
continued unscheduled downtime would harm our business and also could anger users of our websites and reduce future revenues 
customer support 
we are expanding our customer support operations to accommodate the increased number of users and transactions on our websites and the increased level of trust and 
table of contents safety activity we provide worldwide 
if we are unable to provide these operations in a cost effective manner  users of our websites may have negative experiences  current and future revenues could suffer  and our operating margins may decrease 
customer accounts 
our revenues depend on prompt and accurate billing processes 
we are in the midst of a significant project to enhance our billing software 
failure to successfully complete this project or grow our transaction processing capabilities to accommodate the increasing number of transactions that must be billed would harm our ability to collect revenue and our business 
we must continue to hire  train  and manage new employees at a rapid rate 
if our new hires perform poorly  if we are unsuccessful in hiring  training  managing  and integrating these new employees  or if we are not successful in retaining our existing employees  our business may be harmed 
to manage the expected growth of our operations and personnel  we will need to improve our transaction processing  operational and financial systems  procedures  and controls 
this is a special challenge as we acquire new operations with different systems 
our current and planned personnel  systems  procedures  and controls may not be adequate to support our future operations 
the additional headcount and capital investments we are adding increase our cost base  which will make it more difficult for us to offset any future revenue shortfalls by expense reductions in the short term 
our business is adversely affected by anything that causes our users to spend less time on their computers  including seasonal factors and national events 
anything that diverts our users from their customary level of usage of our websites could adversely affect our business 
we would therefore be adversely affected by geopolitical events such as war  the threat of war  or terrorist activity 
similarly  our results of operations historically have been seasonal because many of our users reduce their activities on our websites with the onset of good weather during the summer months  and on and around national holidays 
we have historically experienced our strongest quarters of online growth in our first and fourth fiscal quarters 
paypal has shown similar seasonality  except that its strongest quarter of online growth has historically been the fourth fiscal quarter 
we expect these patterns of seasonality to become more pronounced as our websites gain acceptance by a broader base of mainstream users and as the size of our european operations  which experience greater seasonality  grows relative to our other operations 
our business may be harmed if our services are used for illegal purposes 
the law relating to the liability of providers of online services for the activities of their users on their service is currently unsettled in the united states and internationally 
we are aware that certain goods  such as firearms  other weapons  adult material  tobacco products  alcohol  and other goods that may be subject to regulation  have been listed and traded on our service 
we may be unable to prevent our users from selling unlawful goods or selling goods in an unlawful manner  and we may be subject to allegations of civil or criminal liability for unlawful activities carried out by users through our service 
we have been subject to several lawsuits based upon such allegations 
our korean subsidiary and one of its employees were recently found criminally liable for a listing on the korean subsidiary s website 
in order to reduce our exposure to this liability  we have prohibited the listing of certain items and increased the number of personnel reviewing questionable items 
in the future  we may implement other protective measures that could require us to spend substantial resources or discontinue certain service offerings 
any costs incurred as a result of potential liability relating to the sale of unlawful goods or the unlawful sale of goods could harm our business 
in addition  we have received significant and continuing media attention relating to the listing or sale of unlawful goods on our websites 
this negative publicity could damage our reputation and diminish the value of our brand name 
it also could make users reluctant to continue to use our services 
paypal s payment system is also susceptible to potentially illegal or improper uses 
these may include illegal online gambling  fraudulent sales of goods or services  illicit sales of prescription medications or controlled substances  piracy of software and other intellectual property  money laundering  bank fraud  child pornography trafficking  prohibited sales of alcoholic beverages or tobacco products  and online 
table of contents securities fraud 
despite measures paypal has taken to detect and lessen the risk of this kind of conduct  illegal activities may be funded using paypal 
paypal is subject to money laundering laws and regulations that prohibit  among other things  its involvement in transferring the proceeds of criminal activities 
although paypal has adopted a program to comply with these laws and regulations  any errors or failure to implement the program properly could lead to lawsuits  administrative action  and prosecution by the government 
in july  paypal reached agreement with the us attorney for the eastern district of missouri that it would pay million as a civil forfeiture to settle allegations that its provision of services to online gambling merchants violated provisions of the usa patriot act and further agreed to have its compliance program reviewed by an independent audit firm 
paypal is also subject to regulations that require it to report suspicious activities involving transactions of  or more and may be required to obtain and keep more detailed records on the senders and recipients in certain transfers of  or more 
the interpretation of suspicious activities in this context is uncertain 
future regulations under the usa patriot act may require paypal to revise the procedures it uses to verify the identity of its customers and to monitor more closely international transactions 
these regulations could impose significant costs on paypal and make it more difficult for new customers to join its network 
paypal could be required to learn more about its customers before opening an account  to obtain additional verification of international customers and to monitor its customers activities more closely 
these requirements  as well as any additional restrictions imposed by visa  mastercard  american express and discover  could raise paypal s costs significantly and reduce the attractiveness of its product 
failure to comply with federal and state money laundering laws could result in significant criminal and civil lawsuits  penalties  and forfeiture of significant assets 
we are subject to intellectual property and other litigation 
in april  our european subsidiaries  ebay gmbh and ebay international ag  were sued by montres rolex sa and certain of its affiliates in the regional court of cologne  germany 
the suit subsequently was transferred to the regional court in dusseldorf  germany 
rolex alleged that our subsidiaries were infringing rolex s trademarks as a result of users selling counterfeit rolex watches through our german website 
the suit also alleged unfair competition 
rolex sought an order forbidding the sale of rolex branded watches on the website as well as damages 
in december  a trial was held in the matter and the court ruled in favor of ebay on all causes of action 
rolex appealed the ruling to the higher regional court of dusseldorf and the appeal was heard on october  on february   the court rejected rolex s appeal and ruled in our favor 
if it so chooses  rolex may appeal the ruling to the german federal supreme court 
in september  a complaint was filed by mercexchange llc against us  our half 
com subsidiary and returnbuy  inc in the us district court for the eastern district of virginia no 
cv alleging infringement of three patents relating to online auction technology  multiple database searching and electronic consignment systems and seeking a permanent injunction and damages including treble damages for willful infringement 
in october  the court granted in part our summary judgment motion  effectively invalidating the patent related to online auction technology and rendering it unenforceable 
this ruling left only two patents in the case 
trial of the matter began on april  in may  the jury returned a verdict finding that ebay had willfully infringed one and half 
com had willfully infringed both of the patents in the suit  awarding million in compensatory damages 
both parties filed post trial motions  and in august  the court entered judgment for mercexchange in the amount of million  plus pre judgment interest and post judgment interest in an amount to be determined 
we have appealed the judgment and mercexchange has filed a cross appeal 
we continue to believe that the verdict against us in the trial was incorrect and intend to continue to defend ourselves vigorously 
however  even if successful  our defense against this action will continue to be costly 
in addition  as a precautionary measure  we have modified certain functionality of our websites and business practices in a manner which we believe makes them non infringing 
nonetheless  if we are not successful in appealing the court s ruling  we might be forced to pay significant additional damages and licensing fees 

table of contents in august  charles e 
hill associates  inc filed a lawsuit in the us district court for the eastern district of texas no

the suit seeks an injunction against continuing infringement  unspecified damages  including treble damages for willful infringement  and interest  costs  expenses  and fees 
in january  the case was transferred to the us district court for the southern district of indiana 
after pending in indiana for almost a year  the case was transferred back to the us district court for the eastern district of texas in december we are currently awaiting the judge s scheduling order in the case 
we believe that we have meritorious defenses and intend to defend ourselves vigorously 
in february  paypal was sued in california state court no 
cv in a purported class action alleging that its restriction of customer accounts and failure to promptly unrestrict legitimate accounts violates california state consumer protection laws and is an unfair business practice and a breach of paypal s user agreement 
this action was re filed with a different named plaintiff in june no 
cv  and a related action was also filed in the us district court for the northern district of california in june no 
c 
in march  paypal was sued in the us district court for the northern district of california no 
c in a purported class action alleging that its restrictions of customer accounts and failure to promptly unrestrict legitimate accounts violates federal and state consumer protection and unfair business practice laws 
the federal court has denied paypal s motion to compel individual arbitration as required by the paypal user agreement and has invalidated that provision of the user agreement 
paypal has appealed that decision to the us court of appeals for the ninth circuit 
the two federal court actions have been consolidated into a single case  and the state court action has been stayed pending developments in the federal case 
in september  the plaintiffs filed their motion for class certification 
in november  the parties tentatively reached agreement as to the monetary terms for settlement of the disputes and we fully accrued for this tentative settlement amount in our income statement for the three months and year ended december  the parties have notified the court that they need time to negotiate and document other terms of any resulting agreement  and the class certification hearing has been rescheduled for march  if paypal is unable to prevail in these lawsuits or settle them on acceptable terms  it may have to pay substantial damages and change its anti fraud operations in a manner that will harm its business 
even if paypal s defense is successful or if it is able to settle the lawsuits  the litigation could damage paypal s reputation  require significant management time  and require changes to its customer service and operations that could increase its costs and decrease the effectiveness of its anti fraud program 
following the announcement of the paypal merger in july  three purported class action complaints were filed in the delaware court of chancery by paypal stockholders 
the two california state court actions were consolidated and stayed 
all of the complaints named as defendants paypal and each member of its board of directors as well as ebay 
the complaints were purported class actions that alleged that  among other things  ebay controlled paypal prior to the execution of their merger agreement  the defendants breached fiduciary duties they assertedly owed to paypal s stockholders in connection with paypal entering into the merger agreement  and the exchange ratio in the merger was unfair and inadequate 
the plaintiffs sought  among other things  an award of unspecified compensatory damages 
in january  the plaintiffs in the consolidated delaware actions voluntarily dismissed these actions without prejudice 
the consolidated california actions remain pending  but there has been no activity in them for over a year and the plaintiffs have indicated their intent to dismiss these actions 
in september  bank one delaware formerly known as first usa bank  na filed a complaint against paypal in the na district court for the district of delaware no 
cv alleging infringement of two first usa patents relating to assigning an alias to a credit card so as to eliminate the need for the physical presence of the card in a financial transaction

at t claims that paypal s and billpoint s payment services infringe its patent  and seeks monetary damages and injunctive relief 
on december   ebay and paypal answered the complaint  denied infringement of at t s patent  and filed counterclaims 
the case is at a very early stage  with trial currently scheduled for april we believe that we have meritorious defenses to this suit and intend to defend ourselves vigorously 
even if our defense is successful  the litigation could be costly and require significant management time 
in may  tumbleweed communications corporation filed a complaint against paypal alleging infringement of two patents relating to electronic document delivery 
tumbleweed subsequently amended the complaint to add ebay as a defendant  and later amended the complaint to add a third related patent 
on december   the parties entered into a settlement agreement dismissing the lawsuit  including counterclaims filed by paypal  and entered into a patent cross licensing agreement 
the terms of the settlement are confidential 
other third parties have from time to time claimed  and others may claim in the future  that we have infringed their intellectual property rights 
we have been notified of several potential patent disputes  and expect that we will increasingly be subject to patent infringement claims as our services expand in scope and complexity 
in particular  we expect to face additional patent infringement claims involving services we provide  including various aspects of our payments business 
we have in the past been forced to litigate such claims 
we may also become more vulnerable to intellectual property claims as laws such as the digital millennium copyright act are interpreted by the courts and as we expand into jurisdictions where the underlying laws with respect to the potential liability of online intermediaries like ourselves is less favorable 
we expect that we will increasingly be subject to copyright and trademark infringement claims as the geographical reach of our services expands 
these claims  whether meritorious or not  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation  cause service upgrade delays  require expensive changes in our methods of doing business  or could require us to enter into costly royalty or licensing agreements 
from time to time  we are involved in other disputes that arise in the ordinary course of business 
the number and significance of these disputes is increasing as our business expands and our company grows larger 
any claims against us  whether meritorious or not  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation  require significant amounts of management time  and result in the diversion of significant operational resources 
government inquiries may lead to charges or penalties 
in january  we received initial requests to produce certain records and information to the federal government relating to an investigation of possible illegal transactions in connection with our websites 
we were informed that the inquiry includes an examination of our practices with respect to these transactions 
we have continued to provide further information in connection with this ongoing inquiry 
in order to protect the investigation  the court has ordered that no further public disclosures be made with respect to the matter 
should this or any other investigation lead to civil or criminal charges against us  we would likely be harmed by negative publicity  the cost of litigation  the diversion of management time  and any fines or penalties assessed 
a large number of transactions occur on our websites 
we believe that government regulators have received a substantial number of consumer complaints about both ebay and paypal  which  while small as a percentage of our total transactions  are large in aggregate numbers 
as a result  we have from time to time been contacted by various foreign and domestic governmental regulatory agencies that have questions about our operations and the steps we take to protect our users from fraud 
both ebay and paypal are likely to receive additional inquiries from regulatory agencies in the future  which may lead to action against either company 
we have responded to all inquiries from regulatory agencies by describing our 
table of contents current and planned antifraud efforts  customer support procedures and operating procedures 
if one or more of these agencies is not satisfied with our response to current or future inquiries  we could be subject to fines or other penalties  or forced to change our operating practices in ways that could harm our business 
we are subject to laws relating to the use and transfer of personally identifiable information about our users and their transfers  especially outside of the us violation of these laws  which in many cases apply not only to third party transfers but also to transfers of information between ourselves and our subsidiaries  and between ourselves  our subsidiaries  and other parties with which we have commercial relations  could subject us to significant penalties and negative publicity and could adversely affect us 
our business is subject to online commerce security risks 
to succeed  online commerce and communications must provide a secure transmission of confidential information over public networks 
our security measures may not prevent security breaches that could harm our business 
currently  a significant number of our users authorize us to bill their credit card accounts directly for all transaction fees charged by us 
paypal s users routinely provide credit card and other financial information 
we rely on encryption and authentication technology licensed from third parties to provide the security and authentication technology to effect secure transmission of confidential information  including customer credit card numbers 
advances in computer capabilities  new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other developments may result in a compromise or breach of the technology used by us to protect customer transaction data 
a number of websites have reported breaches of their security 
any compromise of our security could harm our reputation and  therefore  our business 
in addition  a party who is able to circumvent our security measures could misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions in our operations 
our servers are also vulnerable to computer viruses  physical or electronic break ins  and similar disruptions  and we have experienced denial of service type attacks on our system that have made all or portions of our websites unavailable for periods of time 
we may need to expend significant resources to protect against security breaches or to address problems caused by breaches 
these issues are likely to become more difficult as we expand the number of places where we operate 
security breaches could damage our reputation and expose us to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability 
our insurance policies carry low coverage limits  which may not be adequate to reimburse us for losses caused by security breaches 
in addition  our users  as well as those of other prominent internet companies  have been and will continue to be targeted by parties using fraudulent emails to misappropriate passwords  credit card numbers  or other personal information 
these emails appear to be legitimate emails sent by ebay or paypal  but direct recipients to fake websites operated by the sender of the email or request that the recipient send a password or other confidential information via email 
we actively pursue the parties responsible for these attempts at misappropriation and encourage our users to divulge sensitive information only after they have verified that they are on our legitimate websites  but we cannot entirely eliminate these types of activities 
in addition to harming our users  these fraudulent emails may damage our reputation  reduce our ability to attract new users to our websites  and diminish the value of our brand names 
our business may be harmed by the listing or sale by our users of pirated or counterfeit items 
we have received in the past  and we anticipate receiving in the future  communications alleging that certain items listed or sold through our service by our users infringe third party copyrights  trademarks and tradenames  or other intellectual property rights 
although we have sought to work actively with the content community to eliminate infringing listings on our websites  some content owners have expressed the view that our efforts are insufficient 
content owners have been active in defending their rights against online companies  including ebay 
allegations of infringement of intellectual property rights have resulted in litigation against us from time to time 
such litigation is costly for us  could result in increased costs of 
table of contents doing business through adverse judgment or settlement  could require us to change our business practices in expensive ways  or could otherwise harm our business 
litigation against other online companies could result in interpretations of the law that could also require us to change our business practices or otherwise increase our costs 
we are subject to risks associated with information disseminated through our service 
the law relating to the liability of online services companies for information carried on or disseminated through their services is currently unsettled 
claims could be made against online services companies under both us and foreign law for defamation  libel  invasion of privacy  negligence  copyright or trademark infringement  or other theories based on the nature and content of the materials disseminated through their services 
several private lawsuits seeking to impose liability upon us under a number of these theories have been brought against us 
in addition  domestic and foreign legislation has been proposed that prohibits or imposes liability for the transmission over the internet of certain types of information 
our service features a feedback forum  which includes information from users regarding other users 
although all such feedback is generated by users and not by us  claims of defamation or other injury have been made in the past and could be made in the future against us for content posted in the feedback forum 
claims like these are more likely and may have a higher probability of success in jurisdictions outside the us where laws governing internet transactions are unsettled 
if we become liable for information provided by our users and carried on our service in any jurisdiction in which we operate  we could be directly harmed and we may be forced to implement new measures to reduce our exposure to this liability 
this may require us to expend substantial resources or to discontinue certain service offerings  which would negatively affect our financial results 
in addition  the increased attention focused upon liability issues as a result of these lawsuits and legislative proposals could harm our reputation or otherwise impact the growth of our business 
any costs incurred as a result of this potential liability could harm our business 
customer complaints or negative publicity about our customer service could diminish use of our services adversely and  as a result  our business could suffer 
customer complaints or negative publicity about our customer service could severely diminish consumer confidence in and use of our services 
breaches of our customers privacy and our security measures could have the same effect 
measures we sometimes take to combat risks of fraud and breaches of privacy and security can damage relations with our customers 
these measures heighten the need for prompt and accurate customer service to resolve irregularities and disputes 
effective customer service requires significant personnel expense  and this expense  if not managed properly  could impact our profitability significantly 
any inability by us to manage or train our customer service representatives properly could compromise our ability to handle customer complaints effectively 
if we do not handle customer complaints effectively  our reputation may suffer and we may lose our customers confidence 
because it is providing a financial service and operating in a more regulated environment  paypal  unlike ebay  must provide telephone as well as email customer service and must resolve certain customer contacts within shorter time frames 
paypal has received negative publicity with respect to its customer service and is the subject of purported class action lawsuits and state attorney general inquiries alleging  among other things  failure to resolve promptly certain account restrictions 
if paypal is unable to provide quality customer support operations in a cost effective manner  its users may have negative experiences  paypal may receive additional negative publicity and its ability to attract new customers may be damaged 
current and future revenues could suffer  or its operating margins may decrease 
in addition  negative publicity about or experiences with paypal s customer support could cause ebay s reputation to suffer or affect consumer confidence in ebay as a whole 
acquisitions could result in operating difficulties  dilution and other harmful consequences 
we have acquired a number of businesses  including our acquisitions of half 
com  internet auction  ibazar  neocom  paypal  carad  eachnet  and fairmarket 
we recently announced that we have agreed 
table of contents to acquire mobile 
de  a german classified automobile listing website  subject to receipt of regulatory approval 
we expect to continue to evaluate and consider a wide array of potential strategic transactions  including business combinations  acquisitions and dispositions of businesses  technologies  services  products and other assets  including interests in our existing subsidiaries and joint ventures 
at any given time we may be engaged in discussions or negotiations with respect to one or more of such transactions 
any of such transactions could be material to our financial condition and results of operations 
there is no assurance that any such discussions or negotiations will result in the consummation of any transaction 
the process of integrating any acquired business may create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures and is itself risky 
the areas where we may face difficulties include diversion of management time  as well as a shift of focus from operating the businesses to issues of integration and future products  declining employee morale and retention issues resulting from changes in compensation  reporting relationships  future prospects  or the direction of the business  the need to integrate each company s accounting  management information  human resource and other administrative systems to permit effective management  and the lack of control if such integration is delayed or not implemented  the need to implement controls  procedures and policies appropriate for a larger public company at companies that prior to acquisition had lacked such controls  procedures and policies  and in some cases  the need to transition operations onto the existing ebay platform 
foreign acquisitions involve special risks  including those related to integration of operations across different cultures and languages  currency risks  and the particular economic  political  and regulatory risks associated with specific countries 
moreover  we may not realize the anticipated benefits of any or all of our acquisitions 
as a result of future acquisitions or mergers  we might need to issue additional equity securities  spend our cash  or incur debt  contingent liabilities  or amortization expenses related to intangible assets  any of which could reduce our profitability and harm our business 
system failures could harm our business 
any interruption in the availability of our websites will reduce our revenues and profits  and our future revenues and profits could be harmed if our users believe that our system is unreliable 
although our systems have been designed around industry standard architectures to reduce downtime in the event of outages or catastrophic occurrences  they remain vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes  floods  fires  power loss  telecommunication failures  terrorist attacks  computer viruses  computer denial of service attacks  and similar events 
some of our systems  including the paypal site and paypal s customer support operations  are not fully redundant  and our disaster recovery planning is not sufficient for all eventualities 
paypal  in particular  could be offline for a number of days in the event of a disaster in northern california 
our systems are also subject to break ins  sabotage  intentional acts of vandalism  and potential disruption if the operators of these facilities have financial difficulties 
despite any precautions we may take  the occurrence of a natural disaster  a decision by any of our third party hosting providers to close a facility we use without adequate notice for financial or other reasons  or other unanticipated problems at our hosting facilities could result in lengthy interruptions in our services 
in addition  the failure by our hosting facilities to provide our required data communications capacity could result in interruptions in our service 
we do not carry business interruption insurance sufficient to compensate us for losses that may result from interruptions in our service as a result of system failures 
we have experienced system failures from time to time 
ebay s primary website has been interrupted for periods of up to hours 
in addition to placing increased burdens on our engineering staff  these outages create a flood of user questions and complaints that need to be addressed by our customer support personnel 
any unscheduled interruption in our services results in an immediate loss of revenues that can be substantial and may cause some users to switch to our competitors 
if we experience frequent or persistent system failures on our websites  our reputation and brand could be permanently harmed 
we 
table of contents have been taking steps to increase the reliability and redundancy of our systems 
these steps are expensive  reduce our margins  and may not be successful in reducing the frequency or duration of unscheduled downtime 
our infrastructure could prove unable to handle a larger volume of customer transactions 
any failure to accommodate transaction growth could impair customer satisfaction  lead to a loss of customers  impair our ability to add customers  or increase our costs  all of which would harm our business 
because our customers may use our products for critical transactions  any errors  defects  or other infrastructure problems could result in damage to our customers businesses 
these customers could seek significant compensation from us for their losses 
even if unsuccessful  this type of claim likely would be time consuming and costly for us to address 
our stock price has been and may continue to be extremely volatile 
the trading price of our common stock has been and is likely to be extremely volatile 
our stock price could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of factors  including the following actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly operating results  unscheduled system downtime  additions or departures of key personnel  announcements of technological innovations or new services by us or our competitors  changes in or failure to meet financial estimates by securities analysts  initiation of or developments in litigation affecting us  conditions or trends in the internet and online commerce industries  changes in the market valuations of other internet companies  developments in regulation  announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions  strategic partnerships  joint ventures  new products or capital commitments  unanticipated economic or political events  sales of our common stock or other securities in the open market  and other events or factors  including these described in this risk factors that may affect results of operations and financial condition section and others that may be beyond our control 
in addition  the trading prices of internet stocks in general  and ours in particular  have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations in recent periods 
these fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies 
the valuation of our stock remains extraordinarily high based on conventional valuation standards such as price to earnings and price to sales ratios 
the trading price of our common stock has increased enormously from our initial public offering price and from our stock price during this trading price and valuation may not be sustained 
negative changes in the public s perception of the prospects of internet or e commerce or technology companies have in the past and may in the future depress our stock price regardless of our results 
other broad market and industry factors may decrease the market price of our common stock  regardless of our operating performance 
market fluctuations  as well as general political and economic conditions  such as recession or interest rate or currency rate fluctuations  also may decrease the market price of our common stock 
securities class action litigation is often instituted following declines in the market price of a company s securities 
litigation of this type could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources 

table of contents problems with third parties who provide services to our users could harm us 
a number of parties provide services to our users that indirectly benefit us 
such services include seller tools that automate and manage listings  merchant tools that manage listings and interface with inventory management software  and other services 
in many cases we have contractual agreements with these companies that give us a direct financial interest in their success  while in other cases we have none 
in either circumstance  financial  regulatory  or other problems that prevent these companies from providing services to our users could reduce the number of listings on our websites or make completing transactions on our websites more difficult  and thereby harm our business 
any security breach at one of these companies could also affect our customers and harm our business 
although we generally have been able to renew or extend the terms of contractual arrangements with these third party service providers on acceptable terms  there can be no assurance that we will continue to be able to do so in the future 
other companies or governmental agencies may view our behavior as anti competitive 
other companies have in the past and may in the future allege that actions taken by us violate the antitrust or competition laws of the us or other countries  or otherwise constitute unfair competition 
such claims typically are very expensive to defend  involve negative publicity and diversion of management time and effort and could result in significant judgments against us  all of which would adversely affect us 
we have provided information to the antitrust division of the us department of justice in connection with an inquiry into our conduct with respect to auction aggregators including our licensing program and a previously settled lawsuit against bidder s edge 
although the antitrust division has closed this inquiry  if the department of justice or any other antitrust agency were to open other investigations of our activities  we would likely be harmed by negative publicity  the costs of the action  possible private antitrust lawsuits  the diversion of management time and effort and penalties we might suffer if we ultimately were not to prevail 
we depend on the continued growth of online commerce 
the business of selling goods over the internet  particularly through online trading  is dynamic and relatively new 
acceptance of and growth in use of the internet as a medium for consumer commerce may not continue 
concerns about fraud  privacy  and other problems may discourage additional consumers from adopting the internet as a medium of commerce 
in particular  our websites require users to make publicly available personal information that some potential users may be unwilling to provide 
these concerns may increase as additional publicity over privacy issues on ebay or generally over the internet increase 
market acceptance for recently introduced services and products over the internet is highly uncertain  and there are few proven services and products 
in order to expand our user base  we must appeal to and acquire consumers who historically have used traditional means of commerce to purchase goods 
if these consumers prove to be less active than our earlier users  and we are unable to gain efficiencies in our operating costs  including our cost of acquiring new customers  our business could be adversely impacted 
we depend on key personnel 
our future performance depends substantially on the continued services of our senior management and other key personnel 
our future performance also will depend on our ability to retain and motivate our other officers and key personnel 
the loss of the services of any of our executive officers or other key employees could harm our business 
we do not have long term employment agreements with any of our key personnel  we do not maintain any key person life insurance policies  and our chief executive officer has fully vested the vast majority of her equity incentives 
our new businesses all depend on attracting and retaining key personnel 
our future success also will depend on our ability to attract  train  retain and motivate highly skilled technical  managerial  marketing and customer support personnel 
competition for these personnel is intense  and we may be unable to successfully attract  integrate or retain sufficiently qualified personnel 
in making employment decisions  particularly in the internet and 
table of contents high technology industries  job candidates often consider the value of the stock options they are to receive in connection with their employment 
fluctuations in our stock price may make it more difficult to retain and motivate employees whose stock option strike prices are substantially above current market prices 
our industry is intensely competitive 
we currently or potentially compete with a number of companies providing both particular categories of goods and broader ranges of goods 
the internet provides new  rapidly evolving and intensely competitive channels for the sale of all types of goods 
we expect competition to intensify in the future 
the barriers to entry into these channels are relatively low  and current offline and new competitors can easily launch online sites at a nominal cost using commercially available software or partnering with any one of a number of successful electronic commerce companies 
our broad based competitors include the vast majority of traditional department  warehouse  discount  and general merchandise stores  emerging online retailers  online classified services  and other shopping channels such as offline and online home shopping networks 
these include most prominently wal mart  kmart  target  sears  macy s  jc penney  costco  office depot  staples  officemax  sam s club  amazon 
com  buy 
com  aol 
com  yahoo shopping  msn  qvc  and home shopping network hsn 
com 
a number of companies have launched a variety of services that provide new channels for buyers to find and buy items from sellers of all sizes 
for example  sites such as buy 
com  dealtime  google s froogle  mysimon 
com  nextag 
com  and yahoo product search offer shopping search engines that allow consumers to search the internet for specified products 
similarly  sellers are increasingly acquiring new customers by paying for search related advertisements on search engine sites 
we use product search engines and paid search advertising to channel users to our sites  but these services also have the potential to divert users to other online shopping destinations 
we also face competition from local  regional  and national specialty retailers and exchanges in each of our categories of products 
many competitors have been successful at establishing marketplaces that cater to a particular retail category  such as vehicles  tickets  or sporting goods 
additional category specific competitors include antiques and art bonhams butterfields  christie s  sotheby s  ruby lane  tias  allposters

com  fao inc fao schwarz  zany brainy  the right start our international websites compete with similar online and offline channels in each of their vertical categories in most countries 
in addition  they compete with general online e commerce sites  such as quelle and otto in germany  yahoo kimo in taiwan  daum in south korea  taobao and a proposed partnership between sina 
com and yahoo in china  and amazon in the uk and other countries 
in some of these countries  there are online sites that have much larger customer bases and greater brand recognition than we do  and in each of these countries there are competitors that have a better understanding of local culture and commerce than we do 
the principal competitive factors for ebay include the following ability to attract buyers and sellers  volume of transactions and price and selection of goods  customer service  and brand recognition 

table of contents with respect to our online competition  additional competitive factors include community cohesion and interaction  system reliability  reliability of delivery and payment  website convenience and accessibility  level of service fees  and quality of search tools 
some current and potential competitors have longer company operating histories  larger customer bases and greater brand recognition in other business and internet sectors than we do 
some of these competitors also have significantly greater financial  marketing  technical and other resources 
other online trading services may be acquired by  receive investments from  or enter into other commercial relationships with larger  well established and well financed companies 
as a result  some of our competitors with other revenue sources may be able to devote more resources to marketing and promotional campaigns  adopt more aggressive pricing policies and devote substantially more resources to website and systems development than we can 
some of our competitors have offered services for free and others may do this as well 
we may be unable to compete successfully against current and future competitors 
in addition  certain offline competitors may encourage manufacturers to limit or cease distribution of their products to dealers who sell through online channels such as ebay  or may attempt to use existing or future government regulation to prohibit or limit online commerce in certain categories of goods or services 
the adoption by manufacturers or government authorities of policies or regulations discouraging the sales of goods or services over the internet could force ebay users to stop selling certain products on our site 
increased competition or anti internet distribution policies or regulations may result in reduced operating margins  loss of market share and diminished value of our brand 
in order to respond to changes in the competitive environment  we may  from time to time  make pricing  service or marketing decisions or acquisitions that could harm our business 
for example  we have implemented a buyer protection program that generally insures items up to a value of  with a deductible  for users with a non negative feedback rating at no cost to the user  and paypal recently implemented a similar buyer protection program covering losses from selected ebay sellers up to  with no deductible 
in addition  certain competitors may offer or continue to offer free shipping or other transaction related services  which could be impractical or inefficient for ebay users to match 
new technologies may increase the competitive pressures by enabling our competitors to offer a lower cost service 
although we have established internet traffic arrangements with several large online services and search engine companies  these arrangements may not be renewed on commercially reasonable terms or these companies may decide to promote competitive services 
even if these arrangements are renewed  they may not result in increased usage of our service 
in addition  companies that control user access to transactions through network access  internet browsers  or search engines  could promote our competitors  channel current or potential users to their vertically integrated electronic commerce sites or their advertisers sites  attempt to restrict our access  or charge us substantial fees for inclusion 
the market for paypal s product is emerging  intensely competitive  and characterized by rapid technological change 
paypal competes with existing online and off line payment methods  including  among others credit card merchant processors that offer their services to online merchants  including first data  paymentech  wells fargo  and ipayment  and payment gateways  including cybersource  verisign  and authorize 
net  western union auction payment at bidpay 
com and western union moneyzap 
western union is a subsidiary of first data  
table of contents yahoo paydirect offered by yahoo and hsbc  current and announced payment services offered by amazon 
com  checkfree  processors that provide online merchants the ability to offer their customers the option of paying for purchases from their bank account  including certegy and telecheck  a subsidiary of first data  and providers of traditional payment methods  particularly credit cards  checks  money orders  and automated clearing house transactions 
some of these competitors have longer operating histories  significantly greater financial  technical  marketing  customer service and other resources  greater name recognition  or a larger base of customers in affiliated businesses than paypal 
paypal s competitors may respond to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements faster and more effectively than paypal 
they may devote greater resources to the development  promotion  and sale of products and services than paypal  and they may offer lower prices 
some of these competitors have offered  and may continue to offer  their services for free in order to gain market share  and paypal may be forced to lower its prices in response 
competing services tied to established banks and other financial institutions may offer greater liquidity and engender greater consumer confidence in the safety and efficacy of their services than paypal 
if these competitors acquired significant market share  this could result in paypal losing market share 
paypal s service relies on the credit card networks  the automated clearing house network in the us  and similar bank clearing networks overseas 
associations of traditional financial institutions such as visa  mastercard and the national automated clearing house association  or nacha  generally set the features of these payment methods 
changes in these associations rules could negatively affect paypal s competitive position 
overseas  paypal faces competition from similar channels and payment methods in most countries and from regional and national online and offline competitors in each country including visa s visa direct  mastercard s moneysend  ing s waypay and royal bank of scotland s world pay in the european community  nochex  moneybookers  and royal bank of scotland s fastpay in the uk  certapay and hyperwallet in canada  paymate in australia and inicis in south korea 
in addition  in certain countries  such as germany  electronic funds transfer is a leading method of payment for both online and offline transactions 
as in the us  established banks and other financial institutions that do not currently offer online payments could quickly and easily develop such a service 
effective july   financial institutions in the european union are restricted from charging customers higher fees for many cross border euro payments than they charge for domestic euro payments 
this development could increase the effectiveness of using traditional financial institutions instead of paypal for european customers seeking to complete cross border payments 
half 
com competes directly with online and offline retailers in its product categories such as amazon 
com  as well as with traditional offline and online sellers of new and used books  videos and cds  consumer electronics  and other products 
our business depends on the development and maintenance of the internet infrastructure 
the success of our service will depend largely on the development and maintenance of the internet infrastructure 
this includes maintenance of a reliable network backbone with the necessary speed  data capacity  and security  as well as timely development of complementary products  for providing reliable internet access and services 
the internet has experienced  and is likely to continue to experience  significant growth in the numbers of users and amount of traffic 
the internet infrastructure may be unable to support such demands 
in addition  the performance of the internet may be harmed by increased number of users or bandwidth requirements or by viruses  worms  and similar programs 
the backbone computers of the internet have been the targets of such programs 
the internet has experienced a variety 
table of contents of outages and other delays as a result of damage to portions of its infrastructure  and it could face outages and delays in the future 
these outages and delays could reduce the level of internet usage as well as the level of traffic and the processing transactions on our service 
we must keep pace with rapid technological change to remain competitive 
our competitive arena is characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards  frequent new service and product introductions and enhancements  and changing customer demands 
these characteristics are caused in part by the emerging and changing nature of the internet 
our future success therefore will depend on our ability to adapt to rapidly changing technologies and evolving industry standards and to improve the performance  features  and reliability of our service 
our failure to adapt to such changes would harm our business 
new technologies  such as the development of a peer to peer personal trading technology  could adversely affect us 
in addition  the widespread adoption of new internet  networking  or telecommunications technologies or other technological changes could require us to make substantial expenditures to modify or adapt our services or infrastructure 
we need to develop new services  features and functions in order to expand 
we plan to expand our operations by developing new or complementary services  products or transaction formats and expanding the breadth and depth of our pre trade and post trade services 
we may be unable to expand our operations in a cost effective or timely manner 
we are pursuing strategic relationships with other companies to provide many of these services 
as a result  we may be unable to control the quality of these services or address problems that arise 
expanding our operations in this manner also will require significant additional expenses and development  operations and other resources and will strain our management  financial and operational resources 
the lack of acceptance of any new businesses or services could harm our business  damage our reputation  and diminish the value of our brand 
our growth will depend on our ability to develop our brand 
we believe that our historical growth has been largely attributable to word of mouth 
both ebay and paypal have benefited from frequent and high visibility media exposure both nationally and locally 
we believe that continuing to strengthen our brand will be critical to achieving widespread acceptance of our services 
promoting and positioning our brand will depend largely on the success of our marketing efforts and our ability to provide high quality services 
in order to promote our brand  we will need to increase our marketing budget and otherwise increase our financial commitment to creating and maintaining brand loyalty among users 
brand promotion activities may not yield increased revenues  and even if they do  any increased revenues may not offset the expenses we incurred in building our brand 
if we do attract new users to our services  they may not conduct transactions over our services on a regular basis 
if we fail to promote and maintain our brand or incur substantial expenses in an unsuccessful attempt to promote and maintain our brand  our business would be harmed 
we may be unable to protect or enforce our own intellectual property rights adequately 
we regard the protection of our trademarks  copyrights  patents  domain names  trade dress and trade secrets as critical to our success 
we aggressively protect our intellectual property rights by relying on a combination of trademark  copyright  patent  trade dress and trade secret laws  and through the domain name dispute resolution system 
we also rely on contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary rights in products and services 
we have entered into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors  and nondisclosure agreements with parties with whom we conduct business in order to limit access to and disclosure of our proprietary information 
these contractual arrangements and the other steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property may not prevent misappropriation of our technology or deter independent development of similar technologies by others 
we pursue the registration of our domain names  trademarks  and service marks in the us and internationally 
effective trademark  copyright  patent  trade dress  trade secret  and domain name protection is very expensive to maintain and 
table of contents may require litigation 
we must protect our trademarks  patents  and domain names in an increasing number of jurisdictions  a process that is expensive and may not be successful in every location 
we have licensed in the past  and expect to license in the future  certain of our proprietary rights  such as trademarks or copyrighted material  to others 
these licensees may take actions that diminish the value of our proprietary rights or harm our reputation 
we are subject to the risks of owning real property 
we own real property including land  buildings and interests in a partnership holding land and buildings  primarily related to our operations 
we have little experience in managing real property 
ownership of this property subjects us to risks  including the possibility of environmental contamination and the costs associated with fixing any environmental problems  adverse changes in the value of these properties  due to interest rate changes  changes in the neighborhoods in which the properties are located  or other factors  the possible need for structural improvements in order to comply with zoning  seismic  disability act  or other requirements  and possible disputes with tenants  neighboring owners  or others 
some anti takeover provisions may affect the price of our common stock 
our board of directors has the authority to issue up to  shares of preferred stock and to determine the preferences  rights and privileges of those shares without any further vote or action by the stockholders 
the rights of the holders of common stock may be harmed by the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future 
some provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could have the effect of making it more difficult for a potential acquiror to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock 
these include provisions that provide for a classified board of directors  prohibit stockholders from taking action by written consent and restrict the ability of stockholders to call special meetings 
we are also subject to provisions of delaware law that prohibit us from engaging in any business combination with any interested stockholder for a period of three years from the date the person became an interested stockholder  unless certain conditions are met 
this restriction could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control 

table of contents item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents  short term and long term investments in a variety of securities  including government and corporate obligations and money market funds 
these securities are generally classified as available for sale and consequently are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net of estimated tax 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry varying degrees of interest rate risk 
the fair market value of our fixed rate securities may be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates 
in general  securities with longer maturities are subject to greater interest rate risk than those with shorter maturities 
while floating rate securities generally are subject to less interest rate risk than fixed rate securities  floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates decrease 
due in part to these factors  our investment income may fall short of expectations or we may suffer losses in principal if securities are sold that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
as of december   our fixed income investments earned a pretax yield of approximately  with a weighted average maturity of months 
if interest rates were to instantaneously increase decrease by basis points  the fair market value of the total investment portfolio could decrease increase by approximately million 
we entered into two interest rate swaps on june and july   with notional amounts totaling million to reduce the impact of changes in interest rates on a portion of the floating rate operating lease for our primary office facilities 
the interest rate swaps allow us to receive floating rate receipts based on the london interbank offered rate  or libor  in exchange for making fixed rate payments which effectively changes our interest rate exposure on our operating lease from a floating rate to a fixed rate on million of the total million notional amount of our corporate headquarters facility lease commitment 
the balance of million remains at a floating rate of interest based on the spread over month libor 
if the month libor rates were to increase decrease by basis points  then our payments would increase decrease by  per quarter 
equity price risk we are exposed to equity price risk on the marketable portion of equity investments we hold  typically as the result of strategic investments in third parties that are subject to considerable market risk due to their volatility

foreign currency risk international net revenues result from transactions by our foreign operations and are typically denominated in the local currency of each country 
these operations also incur most of their expenses in the local currency 
accordingly  our foreign operations use the local currency  which is primarily the euro as their functional currency 
our international operations are subject to risks typical of international 
table of contents operations  including  but not limited to  differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  other regulations and restrictions  and foreign exchange rate volatility

foreign exchange rate fluctuations may adversely impact our financial position as the assets and liabilities of our foreign operations are translated into us dollars in preparing our consolidated balance sheet

when there is a change in foreign currency exchange rates  the conversion of the foreign subsidiaries financial statements into the us dollars will lead to a translation gain or loss 
translation exposure is the change in the book value of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses that results from changes in foreign currency exchange rates

the premium cost was approximately  and the net loss on the options totaled approximately  which was recorded in other income and expense in the notional amount of forward contracts entered into in was million euro 
the net loss on these forward contracts totaled approximately  and was recorded in other income and expense in all contracts that hedge translation exposure mature ratably over the quarter in which they are executed
