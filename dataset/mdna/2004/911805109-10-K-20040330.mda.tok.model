item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following is management s discussion and analysis of significant factors  which have affected the company s liquidity  capital resources and results of operations during the periods included in the accompanying financial statements 
the discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
due to uncertainties in the minerals business  the company s actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in any such forward looking statements 
general overview us energy corp 
use or the company and its subsidiaries historically have been involved in the acquisition  exploration  development and production of properties prospective for hard rock minerals including lead  zinc  silver  molybdenum  gold  uranium  oil and gas and commercial real estate 
the company manages all of its operations through a joint venture  usecc joint venture usecc  with one of its subsidiary companies  crested corp 
crested of which it owns a consolidated 
the narrative discussion of this md a refers only to use or the company but includes the consolidated financial statement of crested  rocky mountain gas  inc rmg  plateau resources ltd 
plateau  usecc and other subsidiaries 
the company has entered into partnerships through which it either joint ventured or leased properties with non related parties for the development and production of certain of its mineral properties 
due to either depressed metal market prices or disputes in certain of the partnerships  all mineral properties have either been sold  reclaimed or are shut down 
see items and above except coalbed methane 
the company has had no production from any of its mineral properties during the periods from may  through december   except coalbed methane 
the company formed rmg to enter into the coalbed methane cbm business in the acquisition of leases and acreage for the exploration  development and production of coalbed methane has become the primary business focus of the company 
at december   the company on a consolidated basis  owned of rmg 
rmg has purchased or leased acreage for cbm exploration and development 
rmg has entered into various agreements and joint operating agreements to develop and produce coalbed methane from these properties 
management of the company plan to create value in rmg by growing rmg into an industry recognized producer of cbm 
management believes the fundamentals of natural gas supply and demand are  and will remain favorable well into the future 
management further believes that the investments the company has made in rmg will provide a solid base of cash flows into the future 
the price that rmg receives for the sale of its coalbed methane is based on the colorado interstate gas index cig for the northern rockies 
historically  the highest prices realized on the cig over a twelve month period are during the months of december and january and the lowest prices realized are during the months of late summer or early fall 
calendar did not follow this trend as gas prices rose from a low of per mcf thousand cubic feet in january to a high of per mcf in march the following table represents a summary of historical cig prices prices per mcf month high month low month average december although management believes that gas prices will increase over the long term from present levels  no assurance can be given that will happen 
gas prices are directly affected by weather conditions  which impact heating and cooling requirements  electrical generation needs and the amount of gas being produced by those companies in the gas production business 
all of these factors are variable and cannot be accurately predicted 
many of the company s industry competitors are very large international companies that are well funded 
critical accounting policies asset impairments we assess the impairment of property and equipment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
oil and gas producing activities we follow the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas properties 
accordingly  all costs associated with acquisition  exploration and development of oil and gas reserves  including directly related overhead costs  are capitalized 
reclamation liabilities the company s policy is to accrue the liability for future reclamation costs of its mineral properties based on the current estimate of the future reclamation costs as determined by internal and external experts 
revenue recognition revenues are reported on a gross revenue basis and are recorded at the time services are provided or the commodity is sold 
use of accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
recent accounting pronouncements sfas effective january   the company adopted sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligation 
the statement requires the company to record the fair value of the reclamation liability on its shut down mining and gas properties as of the date the liability is incurred 
the statement further requires the company to review the liability each quarter and determine if a change is required as well as accrete the total liability on a quarterly basis for the future liability 
the company will also deduct any actual funds expended for reclamation during the quarter in which it occurs 
as a result of the company taking impairment allowances in prior periods on its shut down mining properties  it has no remaining book value for these properties 
see note b 
liquidity and capital resources during the year ended december   operations resulted in a loss of  and consumed  of cash 
the company increased cash and cash equivalents during the same period by  investing activities provided  as a result of the sale of cbm properties  sale of property and the reduction  after the approval of the nuclear regulatory commission nrc  of the cash bond for reclamation obligations 
the increase in cash from investing activities of  was as a result of the sale of the company s and rmg s common stock 
cash provided by investing activities was partly used to pay down third party debt 
during the year ended december   the company contributed its interest in producing methane gas properties to a new entity  pinnacle gas resources  inc pinnacle see item above and note f 
the company will therefore not be receiving revenues from those properties 
rmg continues to evaluate cbm properties and plans on generating cash flows from methane gas production 
see note p 
capital resources a major component of the company s future cash flow projections is the ultimate resolution of litigation with nukem  inc nukem over issues relating to sheep mountain partners smp partnership 
on august   the us district court of colorado entered a judgment in favor of the company against nukem in the amount of  nukem has appealed this judgment to the th circuit court of appeals cca 
the company has filed a cross appeal and answer to nukem s appeal 
see item above 
should the th cca affirm the district court s order and judgment and or grant the additional claims made by the company  the liquidity of the company will be significantly improved 
although no assurance can be given as to the outcome of the appeal  nukem was required to post a supersedeas bond in the full amount of the judgment with interest 
during the year ended december   the company sold its interests in the town site operations to a non affiliated entity  the cactus group cactus 
as a result of the sale of the town site  use received cash of  and a promissory note from cactus in the amount of  use is to receive  in payments from cactus during calendar all of these payments will be applied to interest only 
cactus will continue to make monthly payments  primarily interest  until august at which time a balloon payment of million is due 
other sources of capital are cash on hand  collection of receivables  receipt of monthly payments from an industry partner for the purchase of an interest in rmg s cbm properties  contractual funding of drilling and development programs by non affiliates  sale of excess equipment and real estate properties  a line of credit with a commercial bank  and equity financing of the company s subsidiaries 
the company has a  line of credit with a commercial bank 
the line of credit is secured by certain real estate holdings and equipment 
at december   the full line of credit was available 
the line of credit could be used for short term working capital needs associated with operations 
capital requirements the company will continue to maintain its uranium properties in a shut down mode during unless an industry partner funds the development costs of the properties 
the company anticipates funding its gold property through and completing an equity funding in canada which will provide the funds necessary to place that property into production 
the company will also use its capital resources during to pay down debt and general and administrative expenses and reclamation costs associated with the smp and plateau uranium properties 
maintaining uranium properties smp uranium properties the care and maintenance costs associated with the sheep mountain uranium mineral properties decreased by  from  as of december  to approximately  per month at december  included in the average monthly cost during the year ended december   is ongoing reclamation work on the smp properties 
it is anticipated that a total of  in reclamation costs will be incurred during plateau resources uranium properties plateau owns and maintains the shootaring canyon uranium mill the shootaring mill 
during the year ended december   plateau requested a change in the status of the shootaring mill from active to reclamation from the nrc 
the nrc granted the change in license status  which generated a surplus in the cash bond account of approximately million  which was released to plateau 
during the year ended december   plateau performed approximately  in reclamation on the velvet and tony m mines and the shootaring mill 
no further reclamation expenses are anticipated on the velvet and tony m mine properties 
it is estimated that the company will incur approximately  in reclamation costs at the shootaring mill during calendar although reclamation has been initiated on the plateau properties  management of the company continues to evaluate the future of the properties as a result of the significant increases in the market price for uranium to approximately lb 
uo in march from approximately lb 
in march the cash costs per month  including reclamation costs  at the plateau properties during calendar were approximately  per month 
these costs are projected to decrease to  per month during the year ending december  sutter gold mining company sgmc properties due to the recent increase in the price of gold  management of sgmc has decided to place its properties into production 
no extensive development work or mill construction will be initiated until such time as funding from either debt or equity sources is in place 
the goal of the company s management is to have sgmc properties be self supporting and not require any capital resources commitment from the company 
until such time as sgmc is able to raise its own capital  the company will continue to fund sgmc 
management projects that the total cash costs to be incurred in getting sgmc funded either through debt or equity will not exceed  see note p 
no reclamation costs are projected to be incurred on the sgmc properties during development of coalbed methane properties the majority of the costs during the year ended december  for the development of rmg s cbm properties  was funded through an agreement that rmg entered into with ccbm  inc ccbm a subsidiary of carrizo oil and gas of houston  texas 
at december   the balance remaining under this arrangement was  one half of which was for the benefit of rmg 
see part above 
after this drilling commitment is completed by ccbm  rmg will have to fund its working interest amount on wells drilled 
during the year ended december   rmg and ccbm entered into a subscription and contribution agreement with credit suisse first boston private equity parties csfb to form pinnacle gas resources  inc pinnacle 
as a result of the formation of pinnacle  rmg and ccbm contributed certain undeveloped and producing cbm properties to pinnacle 
rmg has the opportunity to increase its ownership in pinnacle by purchasing common stock in pinnacle through the exercise of options 
any increase in rmg s equity would be offset by contributions made by the other owners of pinnacle 
see part i transaction with pinnacle gas resources  inc management of the company does not anticipate exercising these options during calendar unless surplus capital resources are received 
rmg has no capital commitments on the properties contributed to pinnacle 
see note f 
rmg continues to pursue other investment and production opportunities in the cbm business 
on january   rmg purchased the assets of a non affiliated entity  which included both producing and non producing properties 
the purchase of these cbm assets was accomplished by the issuance of common stock and warrants of both rmg and use and cash  the majority of which was borrowed as a result of mezzanine financing through petrobridge investment management  llc petrobridge 
see part i acquisition of producing and non producing properties from hi pro production  llc and note p 
all cash flows from the sale of gas from the hi pro properties are pledged to petrobridge for the loan to purchase the hi pro property 
see note p and part i  acquisition of producing and non producing properties from hi pro production  llc 
the hi pro acquisition debt also requires minimum net production volumes through june  and maintenance of financial ratios 
the hi pro properties are held by rmg i  llc  a wholly owned subsidiary of rmg and are the sole collateral of the debt financing entity 
in addition  we don t expect the lenders under the mezzanine credit facility to fund more than the drilling and completion of five wells on proved undeveloped locations on the properties 
future equity financing by rmg  or industry financings  will be needed for rmg i  llc to drill and complete wells on the substantial undeveloped acreage acquired from hi pro 
new production from this acreage could be needed to service the acquisition debt to offset the impact of declining production from the producing properties and or low gas prices 
the petrobridge credit facility will fund the drilling and completion of five wells on proved undeveloped locations on the hi pro properties 
future equity financing by rmg  or industry financings  will be needed for rmg i  llc to drill and complete wells on the substantial undeveloped acreage acquired from hi pro 
as a result of rmg s sale of property interests and the formation of joint operating ventures with industry partners  it is not anticipated that the company s capital resources will be used to fund rmg operations during the balance of liquidity summary the company s capital resources on hand at december  were sufficient to fund mine standby costs  limited reclamation and general and administrative expenses 
development of our gold property and undeveloped cbm properties will require funding from either debt or equity sources 
results of operations during the periods presented  the company has discontinued certain operations 
reclassifications to previously published financial statements have therefore been made to reflect ongoing operations and the effect of the discontinued operations 
the company changed its year end to december effective december  the company began focusing its direction on the coal bed methane industry during the year ended may  at the same time the company began selling its other assets that produced revenues from commercial real estate operations  construction and drilling operations and the commercial repair of aircraft 
the company has entered the coal bed methane industry and anticipates revenues from the production of coal bed methane during calendar cash flows are projected to begin being recognized in calendar after debt on the company s newly acquired coal bed methane properties is retired 
year ended december  compared to the year ended may  revenues revenues for the twelve months ended december  consisted of  from real estate operations   from gas sales and  from management fees 
revenues from real estate operations during the fiscal year ended may  were  the decrease in real estate revenues was as a result of reduced sales of commercial real estate during the twelve months ended december  during fiscal the company sold a tract of land in california which was no longer needed for the sgmc development plan for operations 
during the year ended december  the company reported  in gas sales 
there were no similar revenues during the twelve months ended may  as the company had no production of coal bed methane gas at may  the company recognized a minimal increase in management fee revenues during the year ended december  to  over the  recognized in management fee revenues during the twelve months ended may  management fee revenues were actually reduced after june when rmg contributed its producing and certain undeveloped properties to pinnacle 
although rmg provided the transitional accounting services for pinnacle through december   it received only its actual cost for those services 
costs and expenses costs and expenses for the year ended december  were  as compared to  for the year ended may  costs and expenses of real estate operations and the cost of real estate sold decreased by  during that twelve months ended december  when compared to the costs and expenses incurred during the fiscal year ended may  this decrease was primarily as a result of a tract of no longer needed 
real estate was sold by sgmc during the year ended may  while no similar sales occurred during the year ended december  during the year ended december  the company recognized  in gas operating expenses 
no similar expenses were recorded during the fiscal year ended may  as the company had not yet begun producing gas at that time 
mineral holding costs decreased by  to  at december  from  at may  this decrease was as a result of the company placing all its mining properties on a shut down status and reducing costs of holding those properties 
general and administrative costs increased by  during the twelve months ended december  over the twelve months ended may  this increase was as a result of several non cash items 
non cash items which were expensed during the year ended december  were depreciation and amortization of  accretion of asset retirement obligations of  amortization of debt discount of  amortization of non cash services of  and non cash compensation of  for a total of  the amortization of debt discount increased primarily as a result of the acceleration in the discount amortization due to the conversion of approximately one half of the debt under the terms of million of debt to common shares of the company s common stock 
on january   the company adopted sfas  accounting for asset retirement obligation 
under the terms of this accounting standard  the company is required to record the fair value of the reclamation liability on its shut down mining and gas properties as of the date that the liability was incurred 
the accounting standard further requires the company to review the liability and determine if a change in estimate is required as well as accrete the total liability for the future liability 
as a result of the adoption of this accounting standard  the company recorded the non cash accretion of non cash compensation increased as a result of the initial funding of the stock award plan whereby five of the executive officers of the company were granted a total of  shares of common stock at per share 
under the plan  each officer is to receive  shares of common stock annually under the condition that the shares cannot be sold until the officer s death or retirement 
the plan was effective in and had not been funded 
the funding for the twelve months ended december was therefore retroactive for two years 
in addition to the increase due to the funding of the stock award plan  the funding for the esop as well as the amortization of the deferred compensation recorded in prior periods were both for a full twelve months as compared to only seven months in the prior period 
the increase in the amortization of non cash services during the year ended december  resulted from the issuance of additional stock and warrants for legal and financial consulting services 
these services related to the formation of pinnacle and litigation with phelps dodge 
other income and expenses during the fiscal year ended may  the company recognized  in gains from the sale of assets while during the year ended december  the company recognized only  the company was selling the majority of its construction equipment during the years ended may  and the majority of the surplus equipment to be sold was sold during those two years 
interest income decreased  during the year ended december  when compared to the year ended may  this reduction in revenues occurred as a result of the company having less amounts of cash invested in interest bearing accounts during the year ended december  in may of the company borrowed million from third party lenders 
during the year ended december  the company recorded interest on this debt while there was not interest paid on this debt during fiscal effective january  the company adopted sfas accounting for asset retirement obligations which requires the company to record the fair value of the reclamation liability on its shut down mining and gas properties as of the date that the liability is incurred 
the company is further required to accrete the total liability for the full value of the future liability 
as a result of adopting this new accounting policy the company recorded a cumulative effect of accounting change of  as well as an accretion expense of operations for the year ended december  resulted in a loss of  or per share as compared to a loss of  or per share during fiscal seven months ended december  compared to the seven months ended december revenues during the seven months ended december   the company recognized  in revenues as compared to  in revenues during the seven months ended december  this increase of  in revenues was primarily as a result of the production and sale of cbm gas during the seven months ended december  of  while no revenues from cbm production were recognized during the same period of the previous year 
through the purchase of the bobcat field  rmg began selling cbm gas during the seven months ended december  as anticipated  production from these newly developed wells was lower than it will be in the future 
additionally  the market price for natural gas was very low during the summer and fall months of these reasons along with high start up and operating costs of  resulted in a loss from operations for cbm of  management believes with increased production volumes  reduced ongoing operating costs and increased market prices for natural gas  the cbm properties will show profits and cash flows during costs and expenses costs and expenses during the seven months ended december were  as compared to costs and expenses of  during the seven months ended december  this reduction of  was as a result of a reduction in the holding costs of shut down mineral properties and an ongoing cost cutting program 
these reductions in operating costs were offset primarily by the operating costs associated with cbm 
other income and expenses during the seven months ended december   the company recognized a loss on the sale of assets of  while it recognized a gain on the sale of assets during the seven months ended december  of  the company also had an increase in interest expense of  during the seven months ended december  over the same period of the previous year as a result of the interest on the company s convertible debt 
operations for the seven months ended december   resulted in a loss of  or per share as compared to a loss of  or per share for the seven months ended december  fiscal compared to fiscal revenues revenues from operations decreased by  to  during fiscal from the  recognized during fiscal components of this decrease are reductions mineral sales of  mineral royalties of  and management fees of  mineral sales during fiscal resulted from the purchase of uranium oxide on the open market to fill uranium sales contracts and the sale of a uranium contract to a third party 
we did not supply any of the uranium sold under the contracts from production out of our mines 
we have not produced any minerals from mines for several years 
the uranium contracts expired and no molybdenum advance royalties have been received since there were no mineral sales during fiscal while there was one delivery under a uranium contract as well as the sale of one of the company s uranium contracts to a third party during fiscal currently  the company does not have any delivery contracts for uranium or any other mineral 
depending on the outcome of the smp litigation  the company may well have cis pounds of uranium for which it will need to obtain delivery contracts 
the company holds a gross royalty on the mt 
emmons molybdenum deposit near crested butte  co 
under the provisions of the royalty agreement  the company and crested are to receive  pounds of molybdenum or its cash equivalent annually as an advance royalty 
the royalty agreement was originally made with amax inc amax  which was purchased by cyprus minerals company in and changed its name to cyprus amax minerals company cyprus amax 
in  cyprus amax was purchased by phelps dodge corporation pd 
amax and cyprus amax had made the advance royalty payments to usecc on a timely basis 
pd made one advance royalty payment and ceased making payments in fiscal pd suspended payments under the advance royalty agreement and has sued the company 
the company has filed counter claims against phelps dodge requesting that the advance royalty be reinstated and other issues 
it is not known what the outcome of this litigation will be 
management fees were reduced by  in fiscal from the prior period due to reduced activity in the entities from which management fees are collected 
costs and expenses during fiscal  costs and expenses were reduced by  this reduction came about as a result of holding costs of mineral properties being reduced by  as a result of the company reducing costs associated with mineral properties that are shut down 
the general and administrative costs were reduced by  in addition to these reductions in costs and expenses  the company recognized an expense of  in abandonment of mining equipment during fiscal there was no abandonment expense in fiscal these reductions in costs and expenses were offset by increases in impairment of goodwill of  provision for doubtful accounts of  and other expenses of  the impairment of goodwill came as a result of the company purchasing an additional of rmg equity or  shares of rmg stock by issuing  shares of the company s common stock 
the shares of the company s common stock were valued at per share 
an impairment of  was taken on this investment in rmg as rmg had no gas production and the impairment brought the total investment in rmg in line with the fair market value of the rmg assets 
a provision for doubtful accounts was provided on the balance of a note receivable that the company held for the sale of ruby mining company to admiralty corporation 
the note was in the original amount of  and had been reduced to  the note went in default during fiscal at which time the company began negotiations with admiralty to resolve the issue of the outstanding balance 
terms were reached which required admiralty to pay interest on the note  plus accrued interest  through august  at which time the entire note balance would come due 
because of the financial condition of admiralty  it is not known if that company will be able to pay the balance of the note when due 
the entire amount of the note was therefore reserved 
other income and expenses gain on sale of assets income decreased by  during fiscal to  this decrease was as a result of the sale of a majority of the surplus mining equipment that the company had for sale during the prior year 
during fiscal  there was no income from litigation settlements while during fiscal there was  in litigation settlement as a result of the company settling all issues pertaining to the litigation initiated by kennecott 
interest income increased by  during fiscal over fiscal as did interest expense which increased by  for the same period 
these increases were as a result of larger amounts of cash invested in interest bearing accounts and increased debt 
operations for the twelve months ended may   resulted in a net loss of  or per share as compared to net income of  or per share for the previous year 
future operations we have generated operating losses for the year ended december   the seven months ended december  and in each of the three fiscal years ended may  as a result of costs associated with shut down mineral properties 
we have discontinued our focus on these properties and at december   we are committed to be in the cbm business well into the future 
effects of changes in prices mineral operations are significantly affected by changes in commodity prices 
as prices for a particular mineral increase  prices for prospects for that mineral also increase  making acquisitions of such properties costly  and sales advantageous 
conversely  a price decline facilitates acquisitions of properties containing that mineral  but makes sales of such properties more difficult 
operational impacts of changes in mineral commodity prices are common in the mining industry 
natural gas 
our decision to expand into the cbm gas industry was predicated on the projections for natural gas demand and prices 
the company is confident that it can maintain its costs at cbm industry standards but cannot predict what will happen to the price of cbm gas 
uranium and gold 
changes in the prices of uranium and gold are not expected to materially affect our operations during molybdenum and oil 
changes in prices of molybdenum and petroleum are not expected to materially affect our operations during contractual obligations 
the company had two divisions of contractual obligations as of december  debt to third parties of  the payments are      and  for the years ended december  through  and thereafter  respectively  and asset retirement obligations of  which will be paid over a period of five to seven years
