critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that our most critical accounting policies upon which our financial condition depends  and which involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments are as follows allowance for loan losses arriving at an appropriate level of allowance for loan losses involves a high degree of judgment 
the company s allowance for loan losses provides for probable losses based upon evaluations of known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio 
management uses historical information to assess the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses as well as the prevailing business environment  as it is affected by changing economic conditions and various external factors  which may impact the portfolio in ways currently unforeseen 
the allowance is increased by provisions for loan losses and by recoveries of loans previously charged off and reduced by loans charged off 
for a full discussion of the company s methodology of assessing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  see the allowance for loan loss and provision for loan loss sections within the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation below 
income taxes the company estimates income tax expense based on the amount we expect to owe various tax authorities 
taxes are discussed in more detail in note of the consolidated financial statements 
accrued taxes represent the net estimated amount due to or to be received from taxing authorities 
in estimating accrued taxes  management assesses the relative merits and risks of the appropriate tax treatment of transactions taking into account statutory  judicial and regulatory guidance in the context of our tax position 
although the company uses available information to record accrued income taxes  underlying estimates and assumptions can change over time as a result of unanticipated events or circumstances such as changes in tax laws influencing the company s overall tax position 
valuation of goodwill intangible assets and analysis for impairment independent bank corp

table of contents entire institution 
for acquisitions under the purchase method and the acquisition of financial institution branches  the company is required to record assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their fair value which is an estimate determined by the use of internal or other valuation techniques 
these valuation estimates result in goodwill and other intangible assets 
goodwill is subject to ongoing periodic impairment tests and is evaluated using various fair value techniques including multiples of price equity and price earnings ratios 

table of contents executive level overview the company s results of operations are largely dependent on net interest income  which is the difference between the interest earned on loans and securities and interest paid on deposits and borrowings 
the results of operations are also affected by the level of income fees from loans  deposits  mortgage banking  and investment management fees  as well as operating expenses  the provision for loan losses  the impact of federal and state income taxes  and the relative levels of interest rates and economic activity 
in  the company anticipated a compression in the net interest margin due to the low interest rate environment as well as an intentionally shortened duration of the securities portfolio and a strategic focus on origination of more adjustable rate lending verses fixed rate lending 
see below for the trend in the historical monthly five year treasury note constant maturity yield beginning in january of through december of as an example of the continued low interest rate environment and the company s monthly net interest margin for the same periods 
historical monthly five year treasury note constant maturity yield bar chart monthly net interest margin fully tax equivalent bar chart 
table of contents shortening the duration of the securities portfolio allowed the company to limit price  interest and extension risk in the prevailing low rate environment 
the origination of more adjustable rate lending has positioned the company to realize a higher rate of return when in a rising interest rate environment 
net interest income decreased million during as compared to the following pie charts represent the change in mix of adjustable rate loans and fixed rate loans from through mix of adjustable rate and fixed rate loans pie chart includes fixed rate commercial real estate loans  the majority of which reprice after years 
to mitigate the impact of a declining net interest margin the company focused on non interest income opportunities  particularly mortgage banking income  and non interest expense control 
the residential lending division focused on increasing production to take advantage of the refinance market as well as retooling to focus on the purchase market 
this resulted in an increase of million in mortgage banking income in as compared to service charges on deposit accounts increased million in compared to total non interest income increased million  excluding securities gains  mitigating much of the decrease in net interest income 
additionally  the company focused on expense control resulting in a modest increase of only in over when excluding a prepayment penalty recognized on the prepayment of federal home loan bank fhlb borrowings in and an impairment charge on a worldcom bond following the announcement of fraud in the company was successful in managing the modest increase in expenses despite additional pension expense of  in lower loan loss provision and a decrease in minority interest expense also contributed to the company s success in in  the company was able to reduce the level of loan loss provisioning as compared to by million due to continued strong asset quality and generally improving economic conditions 
minority interest expense was significantly less than in prior years  less in compare to as a result of the company refinancing its trust preferred securities in and looking ahead to  the company expects continued net interest margin compression  however at a slower rate than in  as assets continue to re price to current interest rates without the capacity to re price deposits in correlation to assets 
management plans to mitigate the impact of the continued compression with prudent asset growth  non interest income growth generation  and expense control 
additionally  there are a number of initiatives that are expected to contribute to and beyond 
these initiatives include a new business banking model designed to improve our penetration of the smaller business banking market  investment in additional new business development capabilities and process improvements within commercial lending  
table of contents continued investment in the company s residential lending unit to provide for a greater breadth of products to its customers with a greater level of expertise  new branches in the north attleboro and taunton raynham markets  the acquisition of falmouth bank corp  a sales coaching and sales training program designed to improve deposit gathering and revenue generation from our branch network  and increased advertising and business development spending approximately million designed to position the company to take full advantage of near term in market turmoil resulting from recent merger and acquisition activity

table of contents were constituted largely by fixed home equity loans as well as loans secured by recreational vehicles  motor homes  boats  mobile homes  and motorcycles 
other consumer loans have consisted primarily of cash reserve loans  home equity lines and small business lines 
the balances of other consumer loans increased million to million  or  in compared to million  in this is mainly due to an increase of million in home equity lines of credit to million at december  cash reserve loans are designed to afford the bank s customers overdraft protection 
cash reserve loans are made pursuant to previously approved unsecured cash reserve lines of credit 
the rate on these loans is subject to change due to market conditions 
as of december  and  million  for both periods  had been committed to but was unused under cash reserve lines of credit 
home equity loans may be made as a term loan or under a revolving line of credit secured by a first or second mortgage on the borrower s residence

generally  the actual maturity of loans is substantially less than their contractual maturity due to prepayments and  in the case of real estate loans  due on sale clauses  which generally gives the bank the right to declare a loan immediately due and payable in the event that  among other things  the borrower sells the property subject to the mortgage and the loan is not repaid 
the average life of real estate loans tends to increase when current real estate loan rates are higher than rates on mortgages in the portfolio and  conversely  tends to decrease when rates on mortgages in the portfolio are higher than current real estate loan rates 
under the latter scenario  the weighted average yield on the portfolio tends to decrease as higher yielding loans are repaid or refinanced at lower rates 
due to the fact that the bank may  consistent with industry practice  roll over a significant portion of commercial and commercial real estate loans at or immediately prior to their maturity by renewing the loans on substantially similar or revised terms  the principal repayments actually received by the bank are anticipated to be significantly less than the amounts contractually due in any particular period 
in addition  a loan  or a portion of a loan  may not be repaid due to the borrower s inability to satisfy the contractual obligations of the loan 
the principal balance of loans serviced by the bank for investors amounted to million at december  and million at december  under its mortgage servicing arrangements  the bank generally continues to collect payments on loans  to inspect the mortgaged property  to make insurance

asset quality rockland trust company actively manages all delinquent loans in accordance with formally drafted policies and established procedures 
in addition  rockland trust company s board of directors reviews delinquency statistics  by loan type  on a monthly basis 
delinquency the bank s philosophy toward managing its loan portfolios is predicated upon careful monitoring which stresses early detection and response to delinquent and default situations 
the bank seeks to make arrangements to resolve any delinquent or default situation over the shortest possible time frame 
generally  the bank requires that a delinquency notice be mailed to a borrower upon expiration of a grace period typically no longer than days beyond the due date 
reminder notices and telephone calls may be issued prior to the expiration of the grace period 
if the delinquent status is not resolved within a reasonable time frame following the mailing of a delinquency notice  the bank s personnel charged with managing its loan portfolios  contacts the borrower to ascertain the reasons for delinquency and the prospects for payment 
any subsequent actions taken to resolve the delinquency will depend upon the nature of the loan and the length of time that the loan has been delinquent 
the borrower s needs are considered as much as reasonably possible without jeopardizing the bank s position 
a late charge is usually assessed on loans upon expiration of the grace period 
on loans secured by one to four family  owner occupied properties  the bank attempts to work out an alternative payment schedule with the borrower in order to avoid foreclosure action 
if such efforts do not result in a satisfactory arrangement  the loan is referred to legal counsel whereupon counsel initiates foreclosure proceedings 
at any time prior to a sale of the property at foreclosure  the bank may and will terminate foreclosure proceedings if the borrower is able to work out a satisfactory payment plan 
on loans secured by commercial real estate or other business assets  the bank similarly seeks to reach a satisfactory payment plan so as to avoid foreclosure or liquidation

in addition  certain commercial and real estate loans that are more than days past due may be kept on an accruing status if the loan is well secured and in the process of collection 
as a general rule  a commercial or real estate loan more than days past due with respect to principal or interest is classified as a nonaccrual loan 
income accruals are suspended on all nonaccrual loans and all previously accrued and uncollected interest is reversed against current income 
a loan remains on nonaccrual status until it becomes current with respect to principal and interest  when the loan is liquidated  or when the loan is determined to be uncollectible and is charged off against the allowance for loan losses 
nonperforming assets nonperforming assets are comprised of nonperforming loans  nonperforming securities and other real estate owned oreo 
nonperforming loans consist of loans that are more than days past due but still accruing interest and nonaccrual loans 
oreo includes properties held by the bank as a result of foreclosure or by acceptance of a deed in lieu of foreclosure 
as of december   nonperforming assets totaled million  an increase of  or  from the prior year end 
nonperforming assets represented of total assets for the year ending december  and for the year ending december  there were no oreo or nonperforming securities for the periods ended december  or december

in the course of resolving nonperforming loans  the bank may choose to restructure the contractual terms of certain commercial and real estate loans 
terms may be modified to fit the ability of the borrower to repay in line with its current financial status 
it is the bank s policy to maintain restructured loans on nonaccrual status for approximately six months before management considers its return to accrual status 
at december   the bank had  of restructured loans 
at december   the bank had two potential problem loans not included in nonperforming loans with an outstanding balance of million 
real estate acquired by the bank through foreclosure proceedings or the acceptance of a deed in lieu of foreclosure is classified as oreo 
when property is acquired  it is recorded at the lesser of the loan s remaining principal balance or the estimated fair value of the property acquired  less estimated costs to sell 
any loan balance in excess of the estimated fair value less estimated cost to sell on the date of transfer is charged to the allowance for loan losses on that date 
all costs incurred thereafter in maintaining the property  as well as subsequent declines in fair value are charged to non interest expense 
interest income that would have been recognized for the years ended december   and  if nonperforming loans at the respective dates had been performing in accordance with their original terms approximated   and  respectively 
the actual amount of interest that was collected on these nonaccrual and restructured loans during each of those periods and included in interest income was approximately   and  respectively 

table of contents a loan is considered impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that the bank will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
factors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status  collateral value  and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due 
loans that experience insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls generally are not classified as impaired 
management determines the significance of payment delays and payment shortfalls on a case by case basis  taking into consideration all of the circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower  including the length of the delay  the reasons for the delay  the borrower s prior payment record  and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed 
impairment is measured on a loan by loan basis for commercial  commercial real estate  and construction loans by either the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  the loan s obtainable market price  or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans are collectively evaluated for impairment 
accordingly  the bank does not separately identify individual  consumer  or residential loans for impairment disclosures 
at december   impaired loans include all commercial real estate loans and commercial and industrial loans on nonaccrual status and restructured loans 
total impaired loans at december  and were million for both years 
allowance for loan losses while management uses available information to recognize losses on loans  future additions to the allowance may be necessary based on increases in nonperforming loans  changes in economic conditions  or for other reasons 
various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the bank s allowance for loan losses 
federal reserve regulators examined the company in the first quarter of and the bank was most recently examined by the federal deposit insurance corporation  fdic  in the third quarter of no additional provision for loan losses was required as a result of these examinations 
the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level that management considers adequate to provide for potential loan losses based upon evaluation of known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio 
the allowance is increased by provisions for loan losses and by recoveries of loans previously charged off and reduced by loans charged off 
in  the bank established a separate credit quality discount as a reduction of the loan balances acquired from fleetboston financial 
this credit quality discount represents inherent losses in the acquired loan portfolio 
the level of credit quality discount was million at december  and there was no longer any credit quality discount remaining as of december  the total allowances for loan losses was million at december   compared to million at december  including the credit quality discount

table of contents the allowance for loan losses is allocated to various loan categories as part of the bank s process of evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
allocated allowances increased by approximately million to million at december  with increases shown in each of the various loan categories except consumer installment  which exhibited a decrease 
increased amounts of allowance allocated to three major portfolio components commercial industrial  real estate commercial  and real estate residential represented approximately of the total increase in allocated allowances from december  the increase in the amount of allowance allocated to the commercial industrial portfolio component is attributed to the combined impact of portfolio growth and the re categorization of certain loans 
certain loans have been re categorized based upon the results of loan reviews conducted both internally and by third party loan review consultants 
loans that have been re categorized in a manner requiring increased amounts of allowance to be allocated represented approximately of balances outstanding in this category at december  the increase in the amount of allowance allocated to the real estate commercial portfolio component is attributed to the combination of growth of portfolio balances and the re categorization of certain loans 
balances outstanding in this loan category at december  increased by compared to balances outstanding at december  certain loans in this subset of the loan portfolio also have been re categorized based upon the results of loan reviews conducted both internally and by third party loan review consultants 
loans that have been re categorized in a manner requiring increased amounts of allowance to be allocated represented approximately of balances outstanding in this loan category at december  the increase in the amount of allowance allocated to the real estate residential portfolio component is a direct result of growth in the residential mortgage and home equity subsets of this component of the loan portfolio 
outstanding balances at december  in each of these subcategories grew by and  respectively  and by combined as a whole  from december  the decrease in the amount of allowance allocated to the consumer installment portfolio segment reflects lower loan volume in the indirect automobile financing subset of the loan types that compose this segment 
the following table summarizes the allocation of the allowance for loan losses for the years indicated table summary of allocation of allowance for loan losses at december  percent of percent of percent of percent of percent of loans in loans in loans in loans in loans in category credit category credit category credit category category allowance to total allowance quality to total allowance quality to total allowance quality to total allowance to total amount loans amount discount loans amount discount loans amount discount loans amount loans dollars in thousands allocated allowance commercial industrial real estate commercial real estate construction real estate residential consumer installment consumer other imprecision allowance  na  na  na  na  na total allowance for loan losses allocated allowance for loan losses are determined using both a formula based approach applied to groups of loans and an analysis of certain individual loans for impairment 
the formula based approach evaluates groups of loans to determine the allocation appropriate within each portfolio segment 
individual loans within the commercial industrial  real estate commercial and 
table of contents real estate construction loan portfolio segments are assigned internal risk ratings to group them with other loans possessing similar risk characteristics 
the level of allowance allocable to each group of risk rated loans is then determined by management applying a loss factor that estimates the amount of probable loss inherent in each category 
the assigned loss factor for each risk rating is a formula based assessment of historical loss data  portfolio characteristics  economic trends  overall market conditions  past experience and management s analysis of considerations of probable loan loss based on these factors 
a similar formula based approach  using a point in time credit grade distribution  was developed for the consumer installment segment of the loan portfolio 
this method was developed in response both to the significance of the balance and the seasoning of this segment of the portfolio which has allowed for a more analytical overview of its inherent risk characteristics 
this method has been combined with subjective factors  which reflect changing environmental conditions in the consumer installment loan market 
the result of this analytical combined approach provided an allowance allocation for installment loans of million at december   compared with million at december  allocations for residential real estate and other consumer loan categories are principally determined by applying loss factors that represent management s estimate of probable or expected losses inherent in those categories 
in each segment  inherent losses are estimated  based on a formula based assessment of historical loss data  portfolio characteristics  economic trends  overall market conditions  past loan loss experience and management s considerations of probable loan loss based on these factors 
the other method used to allocate the allowances for loan losses entails the assignment of allowance amounts to individual loans on the basis of loan impairment 
certain loans are evaluated individually and are judged to be impaired when management believes it is probable that the bank will not collect all of the contractual interest and principal payments as scheduled in the loan agreement 
under this method  loans are selected for evaluation based on a change in internal risk rating  occurrence of delinquency  loan classification or non accrual status 
a specific allowance amount is allocated to an individual loan when such loan has been deemed impaired and when the amount of a probable loss is able to be estimated on the basis of a 
fair value of collateral  b 
present value of anticipated future cash flows or c 
the loan s observable fair market price 
loans with a specific allowance and the amount of such allowance totaled  and  respectively at december  and  and  respectively  at december  a portion of the allowance for loan loss is not allocated to any specific segment of the loan portfolio 
this non specific allowance is maintained for two primary reasons a 
there exists an inherent subjectivity and imprecision to the analytical processes employed and b 
the prevailing business environment  as it is affected by changing economic conditions and various external factors  may impact the portfolio in ways currently unforeseen 
moreover  management has identified certain risk factors  which could impact the degree of loss sustained within the portfolio 
these include a 
market risk factors  such as the effects of economic variability on the entire portfolio  and b 
unique portfolio risk factors that are inherent characteristics of the bank s loan portfolio 
market risk factors may consist of changes to general economic and business conditions that may impact the bank s loan portfolio customer base in terms of ability to repay and that may result in changes in value of underlying collateral 
unique portfolio risk factors may include industry concentration or covariant industry concentrations  geographic concentrations or trends that may exacerbate losses resulting from economic events which the bank may not be able to fully diversify out of its portfolio 
due to the imprecise nature of the loan loss estimation process and ever changing conditions  these risk attributes may not be adequately captured in data related to the formula based loan loss components used to determine allocations in the bank s analysis of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
management  therefore  has established and maintains a non specific allowance for loan losses 
the amount of this measurement imprecision allocation was million at december   compared to million at december  management decreased the measurement imprecision allocation primarily based on its assessment of the effects of changing economic conditions in the united states on borrowers in its loan portfolio 
through the fiscal year ending december   the general state of the us economy has exhibited signs of improvement following a period of well publicized weakness in and  including a contraction in gross 
table of contents domestic product gdp and rising rates of unemployment 
national economic conditions notwithstanding  the credit quality of the bank s loan portfolio has remained stable and the incidence of default within the portfolio has not increased substantially through the year ended december  management  nonetheless  has maintained an allocation for measurement imprecision of million at december  this amount has been decreased by million from a million allocation for measurement imprecision at december  as of december   the allowance for loan losses totaled million as compared to million at december  based on the processes described above  management believes that the level of the allowance for possible loan losses at december  is adequate
