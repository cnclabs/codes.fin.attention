item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general we are a diversified financial institution holding company which conducts operations through the bank  ccm and comcap 
on december   we completed a reorganization  pursuant to which we became the holding company for ccm 
immediately following this transaction  we acquired the bank 
our reorganization with ccm was treated as a reorganization of entities under common control in a manner consistent with a pooling of interests for accounting purposes and  as a result  periods prior to december  have been restated to reflect such reorganization 
our acquisition of the bank was treated as a purchase for accounting purposes 
consequently  financial information at and for the periods prior to december  consists of information relating to commercial capital bancorp and ccm  while financial information at and for the periods after december  consists of information relating to commercial capital bancorp  the bank and ccm 
information at and for the years ended december  and also includes comcap  which was acquired by commercial capital bancorp on july  in addition  because of the relatively recent date of our acquisition of the bank  we have omitted financial information for the year of the acquisition and prior thereto from certain tables included herein because such information is not meaningful 
following the formation of ccm in  our revenue primarily consisted of transaction driven  noninterest sources of income  including cash gains on the sale of loans to third parties 
to a lesser extent  ccm also earned net interest income with respect to its loans for the brief period of time that ccm warehoused the loans pending their sale 
the funding for ccm s mortgage banking activities was provided through a warehouse line of credit 
the acquisition of the bank in december permitted us to broaden our sources and types of revenue  while at the same time provided us with access to additional sources of funds 
the acquisition of the bank provided us with the opportunity to acquire a portion of the loans originated by ccm and increase our purchases of mortgage backed securities  retaining such loans and investments in the bank s portfolio and increasing our net interest income 
consequently  the acquisition of the bank provided us with an ongoing source of recurring spread income to supplement the transaction driven  noninterest income we were earning with respect to our mortgage banking activities conducted by ccm 
the acquisition of the bank also provided us with alternative product sources for funding our operations  including deposits  securities sold under reverse repurchase agreements  and fhlb advances 
our access to transaction deposits is particularly valuable to our business strategy because such deposits are generally more relationship driven and less interest rate sensitive 
during  we emphasized growth of the bank s balance sheet and during  we increased our emphasis on growing our retail franchise and opened a banking office in south orange county 
from november through march  we issued million in trust preferred securities and contributed the net proceeds to the bank to support balance sheet growth 
to further support our growth strategy  in december  we completed the initial public offering of our common stock and raised net proceeds of million 
in january  we issued additional common stock pursuant to the exercise of an over allotment option granted to our underwriters which raised additional proceeds of million 
during  we issued an additional million of trust preferred securities  million in september and million in december  with the net proceeds contributed to the bank to support additional growth 
effective april   we realigned our lending operations by moving the origination  underwriting and processing functions  as well as the related personnel  from ccm to the bank 
the realignment  which resulted in the bank becoming the originator of most of our loans  immediately enabled the bank to hold a significantly increased percentage of our loan originations  while further streamlining the lending process 
prior to the realignment  the bank was limited to acquiring less than of ccm s loan production by affiliate transaction regulations governing purchases of loans from non bank affiliates 
the original structure also created redundant processes and operations that have now been eliminated 
ccm will continue to actively maintain and utilize its independent third party warehouse line of credit to fund and sell those loans which the bank elects to assign to ccm for various reasons  including the bank s loans to one borrower limits  capital constraints  geographic concentrations of loans and other reasons as determined by management 
in september  the bank opened a banking office in la jolla  california 
the new banking office serves our existing client relationships in san diego county  the third most populous county in california  behind los angeles and orange counties 
in december  the bank announced its plans to open a banking office in beverly hills  california which is expected to open during the middle of and which will serve the most populous county in california 
we already have an established market presence in los angeles county  having originated and funded approximately billion of multi family and commercial real estate loans and attracted approximately million in deposits at december  during the fourth quarter of  the bank also formed the financial services group  a new business deposit division within relationship banking  which attracted approximately million of deposits  predominately transaction accounts  during its first two months of operations 
critical accounting policies the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  and the notes thereto  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make a number of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in our consolidated financial statements 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors and circumstances 
we believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable in the circumstances  however  actual results may differ significantly from these estimates and assumptions which could have a material impact on the carrying value of assets and liabilities at the balance sheet dates and our results of operations for the reporting periods 
our allowance for loan losses is established through a provision for loan losses charged to expense 
loans are charged against the allowance for loan losses when management believes that collectibility of the principal is unlikely 
the allowance is an amount that management believes will be adequate to absorb estimated losses on existing loans that may become uncollectible based on evaluation of the collectability of loans and prior loan loss experience 
this evaluation also takes into consideration such factors as changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio  overall portfolio quality  review of specific problem loans and current economic conditions that may affect the borrower s ability to pay 
while management uses the best information available to make its evaluation  future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary if there are significant changes in economic or other conditions 
for additional information  see business asset quality allowance for loan losses in item hereof 
our stock compensation plans currently include a stock option plan and restricted stock award agreements 
the stock option plan is accounted for using the intrinsic value method of statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and the restricted stock award agreements were accounted for as a variable plan until the underlying awards became fixed at the end of subsequent to the number of shares under the restricted stock award agreements becoming fixed  the remaining value of the restricted stock awards are being recorded as compensation expense over the vesting period 
fair value of our common stock for purposes of determining compensation expense was based on contemporaneous cash transactions and other equity transactions  prior to our initial public offering in december operating segments our primary operating segments consist of the bank and ccm which are separate operating subsidiaries 
for total assets and statement of operations information on our primary operating segments as of and for the years ended december   and  see note to our consolidated financial statements included in item hereof 
changes in financial condition general 
total assets increased from million at december  to billion at december  the growth in total assets is due to a number of factors 
loans held for investment  net of the allowance for loan losses  increased by million  or as we retained a larger amount of originated loans during as a result of the realignment of the company s lending operations on april  hereinafter referred to as the realignment 
see business general in item hereof 
in addition  our securities portfolio  consisting primarily of mortgage backed securities which are insured or guaranteed by us government agencies or government sponsored enterprises  increased by million  or  during total deposits have grown from million at december  to million at december  borrowings  including fhlb advances  reverse repurchase agreements and warehouse lines of credit  also increased by million during this growth has been supported by retained earnings  the issuance of common stock and the issuance of trust preferred securities 
cash and cash equivalents 
cash and cash equivalents consisting of cash and due from banks  restricted cash and federal funds sold amounted to million at december  and million at december  we manage our cash and cash equivalents based upon our need for liquidity and we generally attempt to limit our cash and cash equivalents by investing our excess liquidity in higher yielding assets such as loans or securities 
see liquidity and capital resources 
securities 
we have significantly increased our securities portfolio during the periods presented  primarily through the purchase of mortgage backed securities which are insured or guaranteed by us government agencies or government sponsored enterprises such as ginnie mae  freddie mac and fannie mae 
we invest in such securities as a means to enhance our returns  as well as to manage our liquidity and capital 
our securities portfolio amounted to million  or  of our total assets at december  and million  or of our total assets  at december  at december  and december   all of our securities consisted of us government agency mortgage backed securities except for a  investment in a us government security at both year ends 
such securities generally increase the overall credit quality of our assets because they are triple a aaa rated  have underlying insurance or guarantees  require less capital under risk based regulatory capital requirements than non insured or non guaranteed mortgage loans  are more liquid than individual mortgage loans and may be used to more efficiently collateralize our borrowings or other obligations 
at december   all of our securities portfolio was classified as available for sale and reported at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and instead reported as a separate component of stockholders equity 
at december   our securities classified as available for sale had an aggregate of million of unrealized losses 
see business investment activities in item hereof 
net loans held for investment 
net loans held for investment increased million  or  from million at december  to billion at december  the realignment resulted in the bank becoming the originator of most of our loans  and enabled the bank to hold a significantly increased percentage of our core loan originations 
we retained for investment a record million  or  of our core loan originations for the year ended december   compared to million  or  for the year ended december  we define core loan originations as total loan originations net of loans that are funded through our strategic alliance with greystone servicing corporation  a fannie mae dus lender  and our other broker and conduit channels 
as a result of the realignment  we anticipate retaining a greater percentage of our core loan originations than we were able to prior to the realignment since the bank was limited by federal regulations to purchasing less than of ccm s loan production 
ccm continues to actively maintain and utilize its independent  third party provided  warehouse line of credit to fund and sell those loans which the bank elects to assign to ccm for reasons which may include the bank s loans to one borrower limits  capital constraints  geographic concentrations or for other reasons as determined by management 
our average loan size for both the multi family and commercial real estate loans held for investment portfolios at december  was million and million  respectively

during the fourth quarter of  the bank formed the financial services group  a new business deposit division within relationship banking  which attracted approximately million of deposits  predominately transaction account deposits  during its first two months of operations 
see business sources of funds deposits in item hereof 
borrowings 
our primary source of funds has historically consisted of borrowings  primarily fhlb advances  securities sold under agreements to repurchase  a warehouse line of credit and trust preferred securities 
total borrowings amounted to million at december  and million at december  advances from the fhlb of san francisco amounted to million at december  and million at december  advances from the fhlb of san francisco are made pursuant to several different credit programs  each of which has its own interest rate and range of maturities 
the bank utilizes fhlb of san francisco advances as a funding source for its banking operations due to the attractive interest rates currently offered by the fhlb of san francisco and to manage its interest rate risk by utilizing various maturities made available through the fhlb of san francisco 
reverse repurchase agreements amounted to million at december  and million at december  reverse repurchase agreements represent a competitive cost short term funding source 
see business sources of funds borrowings in item hereof and asset and liability management 
ccm s mortgage banking operations are primarily funded by a warehouse line of credit 
the warehouse line of credit amounted to million at december  and million at december  at december   ccm had one warehouse line of credit agreement outstanding with rfc  which provides for borrowings of up to million 
ccm currently pays interest at the one month libor plus basis points

each issuance of trust preferred securities has a year maturity  a five year call feature and pays interest at a designated margin over either six month or three month libor 
the issuance of trust preferred securities has increased the bank s tier capital through our contribution of virtually all of the net proceeds to the bank 
see business sources of funds borrowings in item hereof 
stockholders equity 
stockholders equity increased from million at december  to million at december  the increase in stockholders equity reflected the million in net income and the million of net proceeds from the issuance of additional shares of common stock when the underwriters of our public offering exercised their over allotment option in january in addition  stockholders equity increased by  during for the amortization and delivery of restricted stock awards as well as a million increase due to the exercise of stock options 
these increases in stockholder s equity were partially offset by a million decrease in the mark to market of securities  net of taxes 
results of operations general 
our results of operations have historically been derived primarily from the results of two of our wholly owned subsidiaries  the bank and ccm 
the bank has become a greater contributor to our earnings as a result of the realignment 
our results of operations depend substantially on our net interest income  which is the difference between interest income on interest earning assets  consisting primarily of loans receivable  securities and other short term investments  and interest expense on interest bearing liabilities  consisting primarily of deposits and borrowings 
our results of operations are also driven by our generation of noninterest income  consisting of income from our mortgage banking operations ie  cash gains on sales of loans and mortgage banking fees  as well as banking  servicing and trust fees 
in addition  beginning in the third quarter of  we also began earning brokerage fees from comcap 
other factors contributing to our results of operations include our provisions for loan losses  gains on sales of securities and income taxes as well as the level of our noninterest expenses  such as compensation and benefits  occupancy and equipment and miscellaneous other operating expenses 
we reported net income of million  million and million for the years ending december   and as a result of our deploying the proceeds raised in connection with our stock offerings during  and the additional capital raised from our issuance of trust preferred securities  as well as retained earnings  we were able to substantially increase our net income during the years ended december   and these increases reflect significant increases in net interest income resulting from an increase in interest earning assets 
during the year ended december   we reported a return on average assets of and a return on average stockholders equity of  as compared to a return on average assets of and a return on average stockholders equity of for the year ended december  and a return on average assets of and a return on average stockholders equity of for the year ended december  the lower return on average equity in compared to is due to the higher average equity as a result of our initial public offering in december net interest income 
net interest income is determined by our interest rate spread ie  the difference between the yields earned on our interest earning assets and the rates paid on our interest bearing liabilities and the relative amounts of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income totaled million  million and million during the years ended december   and  respectively 
the significant increases in net interest income  reflect the substantial increases in interest earning assets  primarily loans and securities 
the increases in our interest earning assets reflect our strategy of growing our loan and securities portfolio through our retention of multifamily and commercial real estate loans and the purchase of mortgage backed securities 
beginning in the fourth quarter of and continuing through the years ended december   and  we have been extending the durations of our borrowings  primarily fhlb advances 
in addition  during and  we prepaid million and million  respectively  of fixed rate fhlb advances and replaced them with lower costing  longer duration  fixed rate fhlb advances

during the year ended december   we purchased million of securities and sold or experienced repayments or prepayments of million 
during the year ended december   we purchased million of securities and sold or experienced repayments or prepayments of million and decreased our investment in year mortgage backed securities and increased our investment in year and year mortgage backed securities 
during the year ended december   we purchased million of securities and sold or experienced repayments or prepayments of million and increased our investments in adjustable rate mortgage backed securities 
the effect on interest income of the increase in the average balance of securities during the years ended december   and was partially offset by a decrease in the average yield earned on such assets during these periods 
the decrease in the average yield during the years ended december   and was due to a combination of the general decline in market rates of interest as well as a shortening of the duration of our securities portfolio during such periods 
as a result of the foregoing  the average yield earned on securities and other interest earning assets declined from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  interest expense

our average balance of borrowings has increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the effect on interest expense of the increases in the average balance of borrowings was partially offset by decreases in the average rate paid on borrowings due to the general decline in market rates of interest during such periods 
as discussed previously  we have been lengthening the durations of our borrowings starting in the fourth quarter of partially through the prepayment of million and million during and  respectively  in fixed rate fhlb advances and replacing them with lower costing  longer duration fhlb advances 
the average rate paid on borrowings declined from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  asset quality and the provision for loan losses 
at december   we had one nonperforming business loan with an outstanding principal balance of  which is our only nonperforming asset and impaired loan 
this loan has been restructured and is performing in accordance with its revised terms 
nonperforming assets represented of total assets at december  we had no nonperforming assets at december  or december  during  we had a net charge off of  on one business line of credit 
no multifamily or commercial real estate loan is more than one payment past due at december  at december   our multi family real estate loans held for investment  at origination  had a weighted average loan to value ratio of  and a weighted average debt coverage ratio of  and commercial real estate loans  at origination  had a weighted average loan to value ratio of  and a weighted average debt coverage ratio of 
we recorded provisions for loan losses of million  million and  for the years ended december  and and  respectively 
we completed our comprehensive asset quality review during the third quarter of and used this current information to calculate the allowance for loan losses based on  among other qualitative and quantitative factors  updated industry and peer comparison data 
this comprehensive review indicated that a provision for loan losses for the third and fourth quarters of was not required  despite the significant growth in loans  and that the allowance for loan losses is adequate to cover potential losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
future additions to the allowance for loan losses may be required as a result of the factors described below 
see business asset quality allowance for loan losses in item hereof 
management believes that its allowance for loan losses at december  was adequate 
nevertheless  there can be no assurance that additions to such allowance will not be necessary in future periods  particularly as we continue to grow our multi family residential and commercial loan portfolios 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review our valuation allowance 
these agencies may require increases to the allowance based on their judgments of the information available to them at the time of their examination 
noninterest income 
the following table sets forth information regarding our noninterest income for the periods shown

a significant portion of our noninterest income is derived from our mortgage banking activities 
income earned from our mortgage banking operations is considered recurring core income for us and consists of cash gains on sales of loans which are generally sold at a premium in excess of of the loan amount  and mortgage banking fees ie  fees received on the conduit and brokered loan originations less commissions paid to our loan agents 
total noninterest income increased by million  or  during the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   primarily due to a million increase in gain on sale of securities  and a  increase in banking and servicing fees which was partially offset by a decline of million in gain on sale of loans 
we generated the gain on sales of securities as we restructure our investment portfolio to respond to changes in the interest rate environment 
the higher banking and servicing fees reflects the receipt of prepayment fees as we experienced a larger volume of prepayments during compared to the decline in the gain on sale of loans is due to the restructure which resulted in the bank retaining a greater percentage of loan originations instead of ccm s selling loans to third parties 
during the year ended december   ccm sold  servicing released  million of loans to third parties as compared to million of such sales during the year ended december  the increase in mortgage banking fees reflects an increase in the amount of loans originated and sold through conduit and brokered channels during the year ended december   as compared to the same period in the increase in bank owned life insurance boli income is due to additional purchases of boli to fund benefit costs

the relatively high effective tax rate for the year december  reflected goodwill amortization which was not deductible for tax purposes 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we were no longer required to amortize our goodwill as of january  income allocated to minority interest 
on december   we acquired approximately of the outstanding shares of common stock of the bank 
we acquired the remaining outstanding shares of common stock of the bank on december  for a cash purchase price of million 
consequently  for the period between december  and december   we allocated a portion of the bank s net income to this minority interest 
this resulted in a  allocation of income to minority interest for the year ended december  as a result of our purchase of the remaining shares of common stock of the bank on december   the bank is now a wholly owned subsidiary 
asset and liability management general 
changes in interest rates can have a variety of effects on our business 
in particular  changes in interest rates affect our net interest income  net interest margin  net income  the value of our securities portfolio  and the volume of loan originations 
our asset and liability management function is under the guidance of the bank s alco  which is comprised of the bank s senior executive officers 
the alco meets at least quarterly to review  among other things  the sensitivity of the bank s earnings to interest rate changes  the book and market values of assets and liabilities  unrealized gains and losses  purchase and sale activity and maturities of loans  investments and borrowings 
in connection therewith  the alco reviews the bank s liquidity  cash flow needs  the repricing and maturities of loans  investments  deposits and borrowings and current market conditions and interest rates 
the principal objectives of our asset and liability management function are to evaluate the interest rate risk inherent in certain balance sheet items and off balance sheet commitments  determine the appropriate level of risk given our business focus  operating environment  capital and liquidity requirements and performance objectives  establish prudent asset concentration guidelines and manage that risk within board approved guidelines 
through such management  we seek to reduce the vulnerability of our earnings to changes in interest rates 
in addition to quarterly alco meetings  the bank s management reviews  on an on going basis  the sensitivity of the bank s earnings to interest rate changes in connection with its evaluation of potential loans and securities to be acquired  the pricing of deposits and various forms of borrowings  and other operating and strategic decisions made on behalf of the bank 
consequently  the bank s management is constantly engaged in a dynamic process of evaluating pricing  volumes and mix of both assets and liabilities as they relate to earnings vulnerability and volatility in varying interest rate environments 
the alco s and management s primary interest rate sensitivity monitoring tool is an asset liability simulation model which is run on an as needed basis at least quarterly and is designed to capture the dynamics of balance sheet  rate and spread movements and to quantify variations in net interest income  net interest margin and net income under different interest rate environments 
the bank also utilizes  for regulatory purposes  market value analysis  which addresses the change in equity value resulting from movements in interest rates 
the market value of equity is estimated by valuing the bank s assets and liabilities 
the extent to which assets have gained or lost value in relation to the gains or losses of liabilities determines the appreciation or depreciation in equity on a market value basis 
market value analysis is intended to evaluate the impact of immediate and sustained interest rate shifts of the current yield curve upon the market value of the current balance sheet 
a more conventional but limited alco monitoring tool involves an analysis of the extent to which assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive and measuring the bank s interest rate sensitivity gap 
an asset or liability is said to be interest rate sensitive within a specific time period if it will mature or reprice within that time period 
the interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within a given time period 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities 
a gap is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceed interest rate sensitive assets 
during a period of rising interest rates  a negative gap would tend to adversely affect net interest income  while a positive gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income 
during a period of falling interest rates  a negative gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income  while a positive gap would tend to affect net interest income adversely 
at december   the bank s interest earning assets which mature or reprice within one year exceeded its interest bearing liabilities with similar characteristics by million  or of total assets 
one of the primary goals of the bank s alco is to effectively model and manage the duration of the bank s assets and liabilities so that the respective durations and cash flows of such assets and liabilities are matched as closely as possible 
this can be accomplished either by adjusting the bank s balance sheet or by utilizing off balance sheet instruments in order to synthetically adjust the duration of the bank s assets and or liabilities 
the bank has not historically used interest rate swaps  options  futures or other instruments to manage its interest rate risk and  instead  manages such risk on its balance sheet by investing in adjustable rate loans  purchasing mortgage backed securities with selected average lives and durations and adjusting the maturities of its borrowings  as described below 
at december   billion  or  of the bank s total loans consisted of multi family residential or commercial real estate loans 
the bank s multi family residential and commercial real estate loans either consist of pure adjustable rate loans indexed to various cmt or libor based indices or are hybrid adjustable rate loans which are fixed for a period of up to seven years and then adjust based on a spread  determined at origination  over the applicable index 
at december   of the bank s billion of total multi family and commercial real estate loans held for investment  billion  or  had interest rates which adjust within a five year period  of which million  or  had interest rates which adjust within a one year period 
the bank s securities portfolio consists primarily of us government agency mortgage backed securities 
during  the bank continued decreasing its investment in fixed rate us government agency mortgage backed securities which mature in years and increasing its investment in similar securities that mature within years 
the bank also began investing in hybrid agency mortgage backed securities with an initial fixed rate period of seven years  adjusting to a current market rate index  either one year cmt or one year libor  plus a margin thereafter 
at december   million  or  of the bank s mortgage backed securities portfolio carried maturities of years or less while million  or  of the bank s mortgage backed securities are seven year hybrids with year final maturities 
prior to  the bank primarily relied on shorter term sources of funds in order to fund its operations 
beginning in the fourth quarter of and continuing in  management began to extend the maturities on its borrowings  primarily through term fhlb advances 
in addition  the bank has placed a greater emphasis on attracting deposit relationships which provide money market and other transaction accounts 
at december   million  or  of the bank s fhlb advances  excluding the remaining purchase accounting adjustment of million  matured in excess of one year million of which are callable by the fhlb of san francisco and the bank had million of transaction accounts  which represented of total deposits as of such date 
the following table summarizes the anticipated maturities or repricing of the bank s assets and liabilities as of december   based on the information and assumptions set forth in the notes below 
within twelve months more than one year to three years more than three years to five years over five years total dollars in thousands assets cash and due from banks securities single family residential loans multi family residential loans commercial real estate loans commercial business and consumer loans other assets total liabilities certificates of deposit demand deposit accounts now accounts money market account savings accounts fhlb advances securities sold under agreements to repurchase other liabilities total excess deficiency of total assets over total liabilities cumulative excess deficiency of total assets over total liabilities cumulative excess deficiency of total assets over total liabilities footnotes on following page comprised of us government securities and mortgage backed securities which are classified as available for sale 
reflects estimated prepayments in the current interest rate environment 
includes fhlb stock 
adjustable rate loans are included in the period in which interest rates are next scheduled to adjust rather than in the period in which they are due  and fixed rate loans are included in the periods in which they are scheduled to be repaid  based on scheduled amortization  in each case as adjusted to take into account estimated prepayments 
includes loan premiums  deferred fees  goodwill  bank owned life insurance  accrued interest receivable and other assets 
although the bank s negotiable order of withdrawal now accounts  money market accounts and savings accounts are subject to immediate potential repricing  management considers a certain amount of such accounts to be core deposits having longer effective durations 
the above table assumes the following allocation of principal balances for now accounts  money market accounts and savings accounts during the first twelve months  during years and during years 
if the principal balance for now accounts  money market accounts and savings accounts were allocated entirely to the first twelve months  the bank s interest bearing liabilities which mature or reprice within one year would have exceeded its interest earning assets with similar characteristics by million  or of total assets 
adjustable rate advances are included in the period in which interest rates are next scheduled to adjust rather than in the period in which they are due  and fixed rate advances are included in the periods in which they are scheduled to mature 
balances include the amortization of the remaining purchase accounting adjustment of million at december  includes accrued interest payable and other liabilities 
although gap analysis is a useful measurement device available to management in determining the existence of interest rate exposure  its static focus as of a particular date makes it necessary to utilize other techniques in measuring exposure to changes in interest rates 
for example  gap analysis is limited in its ability to predict trends in future earnings and makes no assumptions about changes in prepayment tendencies  deposit or loan maturity preferences or repricing time lags that may occur in response to a change in the interest rate environment 
as a result of the foregoing limitations  the bank also uses a dynamic  internally generated  interest sensitivity analysis that incorporates detailed information on the bank s loans  investments  deposits and borrowings into an asset liability management model designed for financial institutions 
this analysis measures interest rate risk by computing changes in the bank s net interest income  net interest margin and net income taking into account the bank s budget  index lags  rate floors and caps  scheduled and unscheduled repayment of principal  redirection of cash flows and lags of deposit rates in the event of assumed changes in interest rates 
this analysis assesses the effect on net interest income  net interest margin and net income in the event of an increase or decrease in interest rates  assuming such increase decrease occurs ratably over the next twelve months and remains constant over the subsequent twelve months 
based on the sensitivity analysis performed by the bank  a gradual increase in interest rates of basis points during the twelve months following december  would decrease projected net interest income  while a decline in interest rates of basis points would increase projected net interest income by 
management believes that all of the assumptions used in the foregoing analysis to evaluate the vulnerability of its net interest income to changes in interest rates approximate actual experiences and considers them to be reasonable 
however  the interest rate sensitivity of the bank s assets and liabilities and the estimated effects of changes in interest rates on the bank s net interest income indicated in the above table could vary substantially if different assumptions were used or if actual experience differs from the projections on which they are based 
although our asset and liability management function is primarily focused on the bank  ccm and commercial capital bancorp are also generally exposed to interest rate risk 
changes in interest rates affect ccm s net interest income with respect to its loans held for sale 
commercial capital bancorp has million of trust preferred securities which have interest rates tied to libor and adjust each months or months 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity 
the objective of liquidity management is to ensure that we have the continuing ability to maintain cash flows that are adequate to fund our operations and meet our debt obligations and other commitments on a timely and cost effective basis 
our liquidity management is both a daily and long term function of funds management 
liquid assets are generally invested in short term investments such as federal funds sold 
if we require funds beyond our ability to generate them internally  various forms of both short and long term borrowings provide an additional source of funds 
liquidity management at the bank focuses on its ability to generate sufficient cash to meet the funding needs of current loan demand  deposit withdrawals  principal and interest payments with respect to outstanding borrowings and to pay operating expenses 
it is the bank s policy to maintain greater liquidity than required in order to be in a position to fund loan originations and investments 
the bank monitors its liquidity in accordance with guidelines established by its board of directors and applicable regulatory requirements 
the bank s need for liquidity is affected by its loan activity  net changes in deposit levels and the scheduled maturities of its borrowings 
liquidity demand resulting from net reductions in deposits is usually caused by factors over which the bank has limited control 
the principal sources of the bank s liquidity consist of deposits  interest and principal payments and prepayments  its ability to sell assets at market prices and its ability to pledge its unencumbered assets as collateral for borrowings  advances from the fhlb of san francisco and reverse repurchase agreements 
at december   the bank had million in available fhlb borrowing capacity  and million of unencumbered securities available to either be borrowed against or sold 
furthermore  we have historically been able to sell loans in excess of their carrying values during varying interest rate cycles 
consequently  based on our past experience  management believes that the bank s loans can generally be sold for more than their carrying values and the bank may in the future securitize a portion of its loans 
at december   the bank had outstanding commitments including unused lines of credit to originate and or purchase loans of million 
certificates of deposit which are scheduled to mature within one year totaled million at december   and borrowings that are scheduled to mature within the same period amounted to million at such date 
liquidity management at ccm focuses on ccm s ability to generate sufficient cash to fund its loan commitments  to make principal and interest payments with respect to outstanding borrowings and to pay its operating expenses 
ccm s need for liquidity is affected by the level of its loan commitments and loan demand  its ability to sell the loans that it originates and the amount of time ccm holds its loans pending their sale 
ccm s principal sources of liquidity consist of proceeds generated from the sale of loans and its warehouse line of credit 
at december   ccm had million in available borrowing capacity under its warehouse line of credit 
at december   ccm had outstanding commitments to originate loans of million 
liquidity management at the holding company level focuses on commercial capital bancorp s ability to generate sufficient cash to fund its operating expenses 
at december   our annual interest payments with respect to our outstanding trust preferred securities amounted to million in the aggregate  based on the applicable interest rate at that date 
such interest payments are currently expected to be funded by cash and liquid investments at commercial capital bancorp  which amounted to million at december   and dividends from ccm 
to the extent that ccm were at some future date to lack the capacity to pay dividends to us  we would require dividends from the bank to satisfy our obligations 
the availability of dividends from the bank is limited by various statutes and regulations 
it is possible  depending upon the financial condition of the bank  and other factors  that the ots could assert that payments of dividends or other payments by the bank are an unsafe or unsound practice 
as of december   after taking into consideration limitations contained in its warehouse line of credit  ccm could pay up to  in dividends to us 
as of such date  the bank could dividend up to million to us without having to file an application with the ots  provided the ots received prior notice of such distribution under applicable ots regulations 
capital resources

contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements the following table presents our contractual cash obligations  excluding deposits  as of december  total payment due period less than one year one to three years four to five years after five years dollars in thousands contractual cash obligations fhlb advances warehouse line of credit securities sold under agreements to repurchase trust preferred securities lease obligations total contractual cash obligations net of purchase accounting adjustments of million 
consists of advances which have a scheduled ten year maturity but can be redeemed by the fhlb of san francisco at their option on a quarterly basis 
in the normal course of business  we enter into off balance sheet arrangements consisting of commitments to fund multi family and commercial real estate loans and lines of credit 
the following table presents these off balance sheet arrangements at december  unfunded commitments amount of commitment expiration per period less than one year one to three years four to five years after five years dollars in thousands commercial and mortgage banking commitments lines of credit multi family and commercial real estate loans total commercial and mortgage banking commitments these off balance sheet arrangements do not have a significant effect on our liquidity and capital resources 
see liquidity and capital resources 
see footnote p and footnote to our consolidated financial statements in item hereof for information on how we account for these loan commitments 
inflation and changing prices our consolidated financial statements and related data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars except with respect to loans held for sale and available for sale securities which are carried at market value  without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
unlike most industrial companies  substantially all of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on our performance than the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
revised december  consolidation of variable interest entities  which addresses how a business enterprise should evaluate whether it has a controlling financial interest in an entity through means other than voting rights and accordingly should consolidate the entity 
fin r replaces fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  which was issued in january the company will be required to apply fin r to variable interests in variable interest entities  or vies  created after december  for variable interests in vies created before january   the interpretation will be applied beginning on january  for any vies that must be consolidated under fin r that were created before january   the assets  liabilities and noncontrolling interests of the vie initially would be measured at their carrying amounts with any difference between the net amount added to the balance sheet and any previously recognized interest being recognized as the cumulative effect of an accounting change 
if determining the carrying amounts is not practicable  fair value at the date fin r first applies may be used to measure the assets  liabilities and noncontrolling interest of the vie 
the company has evaluated the impact of applying fin r to existing vies in which it has variable interests  and it is anticipated that the effect on the company s consolidated statement of financial condition could be an increase of approximately million to both assets and liabilities due to the deconsolidation of subsidiary trusts 
see footnote to the company s consolidated financial statements for additional information required by fin r 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity sfas 
sfas requires issuers to classify as liabilities or assets in some circumstances three classes of freestanding financial instruments that embody obligations for the issuer 
generally  sfas is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise will be effective as of january   except for mandatorily redeemable instruments 
for certain mandatorily redeemable financial instruments  sfas will be effective for the company on january  the effective date has been deferred indefinitely for certain other types of mandatorily redeemable financial instruments 
sfas is to be implemented by reporting the cumulative effect of a change in an accounting principle for financial instruments created before may  and still existing at the beginning of the interim period of adoption 
the adoption of sfas did not have a material effect on the company s financial statements  as the trust preferred securities of the company s subsidiary trusts continued to be reported as a liability on the consolidated statements of financial condition
