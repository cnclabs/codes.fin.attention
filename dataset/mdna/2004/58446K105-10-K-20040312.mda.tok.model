item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations reference is made to the risk factors below for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ from expectations and any of our forward looking statements contained herein 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended december   and overview we significantly expanded our business in through acquisitions 
all acquisitions have been accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and  therefore  our historical results of operations include the results of operations for each acquired system subsequent to its respective acquisition date 
on june   we acquired from at t broadband  llc cable systems in the state of missouri serving approximately  basic subscribers for a purchase price of approximately million 
on july   we acquired from at t broadband cable systems in the states of georgia  illinois and iowa serving approximately  basic subscribers for an aggregate purchase price of approximately billion 
the at t cable systems substantially increased the size of our cable operations and caused significant changes in our financial position  including a substantially higher amount of total debt 
as a result  these acquisitions affect the comparability of our historical results of operations 
in  we completed our planned network upgrade program that significantly increased bandwidth and enabled interactivity 
as of december   approximately of our cable network was upgraded with mhz to mhz bandwidth capacity and about of our homes passed were activated with two way communications capability 
as of the same date  approximately of our basic subscribers were served by our largest headend facilities 
expressed in megahertz  or mhz  bandwidth represents a system s capacity to deliver telecommunication services 
a headend facility is the location where signals are received and processed for distribution over a cable system 
our upgraded network allows us to introduce additional programming and other services such as digital video  high speed internet access  video on demand  high definition television and  beginning in the fourth quarter of  internet protocol telephony service  which is sometimes referred to as voice over internet protocol  or voip telephony 
we currently offer video and data bundles 
voip telephony will allow us to offer an attractive triple play bundle of video  data and voice products and services 
bundled products and services offer our subscribers key benefits such as a single provider contact for provisioning  billing and customer care 
we face increasing competition for our video programming services  most notably from direct broadcast satellite service  or dbs service providers 
in  competitive pressure from dbs service providers intensified when they launched local television channels in additional markets representing an estimated of our basic subscriber base 
since they have been permitted to deliver local television broadcast signals beginning in  directv  inc and echostar communications corporation  the two largest dbs service providers  have been increasing the number of markets in which they deliver these local television signals 
these local into local launches were usually accompanied by heavy marketing and advertising and were the primary cause of our loss of basic subscribers in as of december   local to local launches in our markets represented an estimated of our basic subscribers 

table of contents actual results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  the following table sets forth the consolidated statements of operations for the years ended december  and dollars in thousands year ended december  change change revenues costs and expenses service costs selling  general and administrative expenses corporate expenses depreciation and amortization operating income interest expense  net gain loss on derivative instruments  net    nm other expense net loss before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes net loss revenues the following table sets forth revenue information for the years ended december  and dollars in thousands year ended december  of of amount revenues amount revenues change change video data advertising video revenues represent monthly subscription fees charged to customers for our core cable television products and services including basic  expanded basic and analog premium programming  digital cable television programming services  wire maintenance  equipment rental and services to commercial establishments  pay per view charges  installation and reconnection fees  late payment fees  and other ancillary revenues 
data revenues primarily represent monthly subscription fees charged to customers for our data products and services and equipment rental fee 
franchise fees charged to customers for payment to local franchising authorities are included in their corresponding revenue category 
revenues rose attributable to a increase in high speed data customers and basic rate increases applied on our video customers  driven in large part by our own programming cost increases 

table of contents video revenues increased as a result of the aforementioned basic rate increases  partially offset by a decline in basic subscribers after adjusting for small acquisitions and divestitures during our loss in basic subscribers resulted primarily from greater competitive pressures by dbs service providers  particularly in those markets where we experienced their local to local launches 
to reverse this video customer trend  we are increasing our customer retention efforts and our emphasis on bundling  enhancing and differentiating our video products and services with video on demand  high definition television and digital video recorders 
data revenues rose due  in large part  to a increase in data customers from  to  we expect this customer trend in our data business to continue and anticipate continued demand for our high speed data service 
advertising revenues increased primarily as a result of bringing in house certain markets previously managed by third parties 
instead of receiving advertising revenues which are net of commissions paid to the third parties  we now record the full revenues from these markets with the related expenses  including in house commissions  which are recorded as selling  general and administrative expenses 
costs and expenses service costs include fees paid to programming suppliers  expenses related to wages and salaries of technical personnel  who maintain our cable network and perform customer installation activities  high speed internet access costs  including costs of bandwidth connectivity  customer provisioning and technical support for our customers  and plant operating costs  such as utilities and pole rental expense 
programming costs  which are payments to programmers for content and are generally paid on a per subscriber basis  have historically increased due to both increases in the rates charged for existing programming services and the introduction of new programming services to our basic subscribers 
service costs increased over the prior year  which included million of one time incremental costs related to our transition to our mediacom online high speed internet access service 
these costs represented the excess over the agreed upon charges owed to our former high speed provider that were incurred in the first quarter of excluding these incremental costs  service costs would have increased or million 
approximately half of this increase was due to servicing the growth in our data customers of  with the balance primarily represented by increases in unit costs for basic programming 
the increase in total programming costs  however  was partially offset by the aforementioned decline in basic subscribers as well as a decrease in analog premium service units 
as a percentage of revenues  service costs were for the year ended december   as compared with for the year ended december  we expect continued increases in programming costs and will continue to pass through some portion of these increases to our customers 
under the federal communication commission s existing cable rate regulations  we are allowed to increase our rates for cable television services to more than cover any increases in the programming 
however  competitive conditions or other factors in the marketplace may limit our ability to increase our rates 
selling  general and administrative expenses include wages and salaries for our call center  customer service and support  and administrative personnel  franchise fees and taxes  and expenses related to billing  telecommunications  marketing  bad debt  advertising and office administration 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased  principally due to higher customer support  marketing  call center and bad debt expenses  and higher taxes and fees 
customer support expenses increased as a result of higher staffing levels and employee commissions 
we expect customer support expense increases to moderate as customer support staffing is now at an appropriate level 
marketing expenses rose to support the digital television and data products and services  to cover the costs of advertising campaigns we deployed to counter competitive pressures from dbs  and to pay commissions to our marketing personnel 
we expect to maintain this level of marketing expense going forward 
expenses relating to our call centers  mainly customer service personnel and telecommunications costs  increased as a result of increased staffing and higher call volumes experienced during the year 
we expect call center expense increases to moderate  as recent call volumes have meaningfully decreased and call center staffing is now at an appropriate level 
bad debt expense rose primarily as a result of higher customer churn and the implementation throughout the year of tighter customer credit controls 
we expect bad debt expense to moderate as we continue to improve our customer credit controls 
as a percentage of revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses were for the year ended december   as compared with for the year ended december  
table of contents we expect continued growth in advanced services  which include digital cable and high speed internet access and  in late  the launch of voip telephony service 
as a result  we expect our cost of services and selling  general and administrative expenses to increase 
corporate expenses reflect compensation of corporate employees and other corporate overhead 
corporate expenses decreased to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  this was due to the recognition of million of non cash stock charges during the year ended december   which represented vesting in equity interests granted to certain members of our management team  offset by a greater number of corporate employees and increases in salaries  legal and other professional fees  and insurance premiums 
as a percentage of revenues  corporate expenses were for the year ended december   as compared with for the year ended december  depreciation and amortization decreased to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to changes  effective july   in the estimated useful lives of our cable systems and equipment in conjunction with the completion of our network upgrade and rebuild program 
these changes reduced depreciation by million for the year ended december  this decrease was offset in part by increased depreciation for investments in our cable network and ongoing investments to continue the rollout of products and services such as video on demand  high definition television and high speed internet access 
we expect depreciation and amortization to decrease in as a result of the full year impact of the changes in estimated lives 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
interest expense  net interest expense  net  remained relatively flat year over year 
this was primarily due to higher average indebtedness offset by a decrease in market interest rates on our variable rate debt 
gain loss on derivative instruments  net our stated strategy is to manage our interest expense using a combination of fixed and variable interest rate debt 
we enter into interest rate exchange agreements  or interest rate swaps  to fix the interest rate on a portion of our variable rate debt to reduce the potential volatility in our interest expense due to changes in variable market interest rates 
as of december  we had interest rate swaps with an aggregate principal amount of million  compared to million as of december  these interest rate swaps are accounted for as fair value hedges of debt instruments as prescribed by sfas no 
the changes in their mark to market values are derived from changes in variable market interest rates and the decrease in their time to maturity 
the aggregate change in value is reported as either a noncash gain or loss on derivative instruments  net 
gain on derivative instruments  net  was million for the year ended december   as compared to loss on derivative instruments  net of million for the year ended december  other expense other expense was million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  other expense primarily represents amortization of deferred financing costs and fees on unused credit commitments 
other expense for the year ended december  was partly offset by a gain on sale of investments of million 
net loss due to the factors described above  we generated a net loss of million for the year ended december  as compared to a net loss of million for the year ended december

in addition  corporate expenses included million and million of non cash stock charges for the years ended december  and  respectively 
as a percentage of revenues  corporate expenses were for the years ended december  and december  depreciation and amortization increased to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  this was due to the depreciation and amortization expense associated with our purchase of the at t cable systems in mid  which had a full year impact in  and ongoing investments primarily to upgrade and rebuild our cable systems 
this increase was substantially offset by the adoption of sfas  effective january   which reduced amortization expense by million during the year ended december  interest expense  net interest expense  net  increased to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  this was due primarily to additional indebtedness resulting from the acquisitions of the at t cable systems and the ongoing investments in our cable systems  which increased our average indebtedness partially offset by a decrease in interest rates on our variable rate debt

loss on derivative instruments  net  was million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  
table of contents other expense income other expense was million for the year ended december   as compared to million of other income for the year ended december  other expense represents fees on unused credit commitments under our bank credit facilities  and amortization of deferred financing costs 
other income in reflected the recognition of the remaining million of deferred revenue resulting from the termination of our contract with softnet systems 
net loss due to the factors described above  we generated a net loss of million for the year ended december  as compared to a net loss of million for the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources as an integral part of our business plan  we have significantly invested  and will continue to invest  additional capital in our cable network to enhance its reliability and capacity  which will allow for the introduction of new advanced broadband services 
we also will continue to pursue a business strategy that includes selective acquisitions 
we expect to fund our capital requirements through a combination of internally generated funds  and amounts available under our bank credit facilities 
operating activities net cash flows provided by operating activities increased  or million  to million  reflecting a significant reduction in our net loss  partially offset by an million reduction in working capital accounts  mostly attributable to the decrease in our accounts payable balances 
investing activities net cash flows used in investing activities consist principally of investments in our cable network 
during  investing activities decreased by million  or to million 
this decrease reflected significantly lower capital expenditures in due to the completion of our planned network upgrade and rebuild program 
our capital expenditures were million including million of capital expenditures financed through capital leases  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
as of december   as a result of our cumulative capital investment in our network upgrade program  approximately of our cable network was upgraded with mhz to mhz bandwidth capacity and about of our homes passed were activated with two way communications capability 
at year end  our digital cable service was available to approximately of our basic subscribers  and our high speed internet access service was marketed to about homes passed by our cable systems 
with the completion of our planned network upgrade program  we expect prospective capital expenditures to consist primarily of the costs of new advanced service installations and equipment  new plant construction and network replacement 
we expect to invest approximately million to million in capital expenditures in financing activities net cash flows provided by financing activities decreased to million for the year ended december  this reflected a reduction in borrowings as a result of decreases in our capital expenditures resulting from the wind down of our network upgrade program in we own our cable systems through our two principal subsidiaries  mediacom broadband llc and mediacom llc 
the operating subsidiaries of mediacom broadband llc have a billion bank credit facility expiring in september  of which million was outstanding as of december  the operating subsidiaries of mediacom llc have two bank credit facilities aggregating billion  of which million was outstanding as of december  mediacom llc s bank credit facilities expire in september and december  however  their final maturities are subject to earlier repayment on dates ranging from june to december if mediacom llc does not refinance its million senior notes due april prior to march  
table of contents we have entered into interest rate exchange agreements  which expire from june through march  to hedge million of floating rate debt 
under the terms of all of our interest rate exchange agreements  we are exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other parties to the interest rate exchange agreements 
however  due to the high creditworthiness of our counterparties  we do not anticipate their nonperformance 
as of the date of this report  about of our outstanding indebtedness was at fixed interest rates or subject to interest rate protection 
as of december   our total debt was billion and we had unused credit commitments of about million under all of our bank credit facilities and our annualized cost of debt capital was approximately 
as of january   after giving effect to scheduled step downs in the maximum leverage covenants in our bank credit facilities  approximately million could be borrowed and used for general corporate purposes under the most restrictive covenants in our debt arrangements 
we were in compliance with all debt covenants as of  and for all periods in  the year ended december  as of december   approximately million of letters of credit were issued to various parties to secure our performance relating to insurance and franchise requirements 
although we have not generated earnings sufficient to cover fixed charges  we have generated cash and obtained financing sufficient to meet our short term requirements  including our debt service  working capital and capital expenditures 
we expect that we will continue to be able to generate funds and obtain financing sufficient to service our long term business plan  service our debt obligations and complete any future acquisitions 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain sufficient financing  or  if we were able to do so  that the terms would be favorable to us 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commercial commitments for the five years subsequent to december  and thereafter capital debt leases operating leases total dollars in thousands thereafter total cash obligations includes million of convertible senior notes due 
table of contents critical accounting policies the foregoing discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
periodically  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to doubtful accounts  long lived assets  capitalized costs and accruals 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that the application of the critical accounting policies discussed below requires significant judgments and estimates on the part of management 
for a summary of our accounting policies  see note of our consolidated financial statements 
property  plant and equipment we capitalize the costs of new construction and replacement of our cable transmission and distribution facilities and new cable service installations 
capitalized costs include all direct labor and materials as well as certain indirect costs and are based on historical construction and installation costs 
capitalized costs are recorded as additions to property  plant and equipment and depreciate over the life of the related asset 
we perform periodic evaluations of the estimates used to determine the amount of costs that are capitalized 
any changes to these estimates  which may be significant  would be applied during the period in which the evaluations were completed 
income taxes we account for income taxes using the liability method as stipulated by sfas no 
accounting for income taxes 
this method generally provides that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized for temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities and anticipated benefit of utilizing net operating loss carryforwards 
we assess the likelihood of realization of deferred tax assets and net operating loss carryforwards by considering the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  taxable income in future periods and tax planning strategies 
at december   we have recorded a net deferred tax asset valuation allowance of approximately million 
we will continue to monitor the need for the deferred tax asset valuation allowance in and beyond as we anticipate to report accounting earnings 
intangibles our cable systems operate under non exclusive franchises granted by state and local governmental authorities for varying lengths of time 
we acquired these cable franchises through acquisitions of cable systems and were accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
we have concluded that our cable franchise rights have an indefinite useful life since  among other things  there are no legal  regulatory  contractual  competitive  economic or other factors limiting the period over which these cable franchise rights contribute to our revenues 
accordingly  with our adoption of sfas no 
 we no longer amortize the cable franchise rights and other indefinite lived assets 
instead  such assets are tested annually for impairment  or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
based on the guidance outlined in emerging issues task force  or eitf  issue no 
 we determined that the unit of accounting for testing franchise value for impairment resides at a cable system cluster level 
such level reflects the financial reporting level managed and reviewed by the corporate office ie  chief operating decision maker as well as how we allocated capital resources and utilize the assets 
lastly  the unit reporting level reflects the level at which the purchase method of accounting for our acquisitions was originally recorded 
we have three cable system clusters  or reporting units  for the purpose of applying sfas no 
we assess the fair value of our franchise costs based on a discounted cash flow methodology 
if the determined fair value of our franchise costs is less the carrying amount on the financial statements  an impairment charge would be recognized for the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the assets 
to test the impairment of the goodwill carried on our financial statements  the fair value of the cable system cluster s tangible and intangible assets including franchise value other than goodwill is deducted from the cable system cluster s fair value 
the balance represents the fair value of goodwill which is then compared to the carrying value of goodwill to determine if there is any impairment 

table of contents upon adoption of sfas no 
 we determined that no impairment of our franchise costs and goodwill existed as of january  subsequent impairment tests as of september and  reflected no impairment of our franchise costs and goodwill 
our use of discounted cash flow analyses in determining the fair value of each cable system cluster involves certain assumptions and estimates  which are consistent with the expectations of buyers and sellers of cable systems in determining fair value 
significant impairment in value resulting in impairment charges may result if these estimates and assumptions used in the fair value determination change in the future 
impairment of long lived assets we follow the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets and provides guidance on classification and accounting for such assets when held for sale or abandonment 
there have been no changes in our circumstances that would indicate that we would need to perform an impairment review 
recent accounting pronouncements the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  in december  which amends i sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition for an entity that voluntarily changes to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation  ii the disclosure provisions of sfas no 
to require prominent disclosure about the effects on reported net income of an entity s accounting policy decisions with respect to stock based employee compensation  and iii accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 interim financial reporting  to require disclosure about those effects in interim financial information 
we adopted sfas no 
on january  we did not change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
accordingly  the adoption of sfas no 
did not affect our financial condition or results of operations 
in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
amends and clarifies financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
in general  sfas no 
is effective for contracts entered into or modified after june  and for hedging relationships designated after june  we adopted sfas no 
on july   and such adoption did not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas no 
establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures in its statement of financial position certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
in accordance with sfas no 
 certain financial instruments that embody obligations for the issuer are required to be classified as liabilities 
sfas no 
is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise shall be effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  we adopted sfas no 
on july   and such adoption did not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
inflation and changing prices our systems costs and expenses are subject to inflation and price fluctuations 
such changes in costs and expenses can generally be passed through to subscribers 
programming costs have historically increased at rates in excess of inflation and are expected to continue to do so 
we believe that under the federal communications commission s existing cable rate regulations we may increase rates for cable television services to more than cover any increases in programming 
however  competitive conditions and other factors in the marketplace may limit our ability to increase our rates 

table of contents risk factors we have a history of net losses 
we have a history of net losses 
we reported net losses of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  however we reported net income of million and million for the third and fourth quarters of  respectively 
the principal reasons for our prior net losses include the depreciation and amortization expenses associated with our acquisitions  the capital expenditures related to expanding and upgrading our cable systems and interest costs on borrowed money 
we are a holding company with no operations and we depend on our operating subsidiaries for cash to fund our obligations 
as a holding company  we do not have any operations or hold any assets other than our investments in and our advances to our operating subsidiaries 
consequently  our subsidiaries conduct all of our consolidated operations and own substantially all of our consolidated assets 
the only source of cash we have to pay interest on  and repay the principal of  our indebtedness and to meet our other obligations is the cash that our subsidiaries generate from their operations and their borrowings 
our subsidiaries are not obligated to make funds available to us 
our subsidiaries ability to make payments to us will depend upon their operating results and will be subject to applicable laws and contractual restrictions  including the agreements governing our subsidiary credit facilities and other indebtedness 
those agreements permit our subsidiaries to distribute cash to us under certain circumstances  but only so long as there is no default under any of such agreements 
we have grown rapidly and have a limited history of operating all of our current cable systems  which may make it difficult for you to evaluate our performance 
we began operations in and have grown rapidly since then  principally through acquisitions 
in late  we completed acquisitions that doubled the number of subscribers served by our cable systems 
in june and july  we made other acquisitions that again doubled our subscribers 
as a result  you have limited information upon which to evaluate our performance in managing all of our current systems  and our historical financial information may not be indicative of the future results we can achieve with our cable systems 
we have substantial existing debt and may incur substantial additional debt  which could adversely affect our ability to obtain financing in the future and require our operating subsidiaries to apply a substantial portion of their cash flow to debt service 
our total debt as of december  was approximately billion 
our interest expense for the year ended december  was million 
we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flows to permit us  or our subsidiaries  to repay indebtedness or that refinancing of that indebtedness will be possible on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
this high level of debt and our debt service obligations could have material consequences  including that our ability to access new sources of financing for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions or other purposes may be limited  we may need to use a large portion of our revenues to pay interest on borrowings under our subsidiary credit facilities and our senior notes  which will reduce the amount of money available to finance our operations  capital expenditures and other activities  some of our debt has a variable rate of interest  which may expose us to the risk of increased interest rates  we may be more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse developments in our business  we may be less flexible in responding to changing business and economic conditions  including increased competition and demand for new products and services  
table of contents we may be at a disadvantage when compared to those of our competitors that have less debt  and we may not be able to fully implement our business strategy 
a default under our indentures or our subsidiary credit facilities could result in an acceleration of our indebtedness and other material adverse effects 
the agreements and instruments governing our own and our subsidiaries indebtedness contain numerous financial and operating covenants 
the breach of any of these covenants could cause a default  which could result in the indebtedness becoming immediately due and payable 
if this were to occur  we would be unable to adequately finance our operations 
in addition  a default could result in a default or acceleration of our other indebtedness subject to cross default provisions 
if this occurs  we may not be able to pay our debts or borrow sufficient funds to refinance them 
even if new financing is available  it may not be on terms that are acceptable to us 
the membership interests of our operating subsidiaries are pledged as security under the respective subsidiary credit facilities 
a default under one of our subsidiary credit facilities could result in a foreclosure by the lenders on the membership interests pledged under that facility 
because we are dependent upon our operating subsidiaries for all of our revenues  a foreclosure would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the terms of our indebtedness could materially limit our financial and operating flexibility 
several of the covenants contained in the agreements and instruments governing our own and our subsidiaries indebtedness could materially limit our financial and operating flexibility by restricting  among other things  our ability and the ability of our operating subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness  create liens and other encumbrances  pay dividends and make other payments  investments  loans and guarantees  enter into transactions with related parties  sell or otherwise dispose of assets and merge or consolidate with another entity  repurchase or redeem capital stock  other equity interests or debt  pledge assets  and issue capital stock or other equity interests 
complying with these covenants could cause us to take actions that we otherwise would not take or cause us not to take actions that we otherwise would take 
we may not be able to obtain additional capital to continue the development of our business 
we have invested substantial capital for the upgrade  expansion and maintenance of our cable systems and the launch and expansion of new or additional services 
while we have completed our planned system upgrades  if there is accelerated growth in our digital cable and data customers  or we decide to introduce new advanced services  or the cost to provide these services increases  we may need to make unplanned additional capital expenditures 
we may not be able to obtain the funds necessary to finance additional capital requirements through internally generated funds  additional borrowings or other sources 
if we are unable to obtain these funds  we would not be able to implement our business strategy and our results of operations would be adversely affected 

table of contents if we are unable to keep pace with technological change  our business and results of operations could be adversely affected 
the cable business is characterized by rapid technological change and the introduction of new products and services 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to fund the capital expenditures necessary to keep pace with future technological developments 
we also cannot assure you that we will successfully anticipate the demand of our customers for products and services requiring new technology 
this type of rapid technological change could adversely affect our ability to maintain or expand our systems and respond to competitive pressures 
an inability to maintain and expand our systems and provide advanced services in a timely manner  or to anticipate the demands of the market place  could adversely affect our ability to compete and our results of operations 
if we are unsuccessful in implementing our growth strategy  our business and results of operations could be adversely affected 
we expect that a substantial portion of our future growth in revenues will come from the expansion of relatively new services  the introduction of new ones and acquisitions of additional cable systems 
relatively new services include high speed internet access service  digital cable services  video on demand  and hdtv 
we plan to offer voip telephony service to our subscribers beginning with certain markets in the second half of and expanding to additional markets in subsequent years 
we may not be able to successfully expand existing services or introduce voip telephony due to unpredictable technical  operational or regulatory challenges 
it is also possible that these services will not generate significant revenue growth 
we may not be successful in identifying attractive acquisition targets or obtaining the financing necessary to complete future acquisitions 
among other things  in recent years  the cable television industry has undergone dramatic consolidation  which has reduced the number of future acquisition prospects and may increase the purchase price for any acquisitions we pursue 
our programming costs are increasing  and our business and results of operations will be adversely affected if we cannot pass through a sufficient part of the additional costs to subscribers 
our programming costs have been  and are expected to continue to be  one of our largest single expense items 
in recent years  the cable and satellite video industries have experienced a rapid increase in the cost of programming  particularly sports programming 
this increase in programming costs is expected to continue  and we may not be able to pass all programming cost increases on to our customers 
in addition  as we add programming to our basic and expanded basic programming tiers  we may not be able pass all of our costs of the additional programming on to our customers without the potential loss of basic subscribers 
to the extent that we are unable to pass increased or additional programming costs through to subscribers  our business and results of operations will be adversely affected 
we also expect to be subject to increasing financial and other demands by broadcasters to obtain the required consents for the transmission of broadcast programming to our subscribers 
we cannot predict the impact of these negotiations on our business and results of operations or the effect on our subscribers should we be required to suspend the carriage of this programming 
failure to negotiate or renew programming contracts could adversely affect our business and results of operations 
from time to time  the contracts covering the programming services carried on our cable systems expire  and we generally provide such services to our customers without written contracts with the respective program suppliers as we negotiate contract renewals 
while we could obtain access to most of these programming services through a national programming purchasing cooperative or by relying on certain protective provisions of the communications act  we are unable to guarantee that we will be able to provide without interruption any programming service that is not covered by a written contract 
prolonged loss of access to certain of these programming services could result in our customers switching to our competitors or have other material adverse effects on our business and results of operations 

table of contents we may not be able to compete effectively in the highly competitive media and telecommunications industries 
the communications industry in which we operate is highly competitive and is often subject to rapid and significant changes and developments in the marketplace and in the regulatory and legislative environment 
in some instances  we compete against companies with fewer regulatory burdens  easier access to financing  greater resources and operating capabilities  greater brand name recognition and long standing relationships with regulatory authorities 
our traditional cable television business faces direct competition from other cable companies  municipal owned utilities  telephone companies  and  most significantly  from dbs service providers 
our high speed internet access service is subject to competition from telephone companies using digital subscriber line technology  dbs service providers and other internet service providers 
we also face competition from over the air television and radio broadcasters and from other communications and entertainment media such as movie theaters  live entertainment and sports events  newspapers and home video products 
we anticipate that future advances in communications technology and new business combinations and alliances in the communications industry could lead to the introduction of new competitors and products and services that may compete with our businesses 
we cannot assure you that our upgraded cable systems will allow us to compete effectively 
additionally  if we expand and introduce new and enhanced telecommunications services  we will be subject to competition from new and established telecommunications providers 
we cannot predict the extent to which competition may affect our business and results of operations in the future 
continued growth of dbs service providers could adversely affect our business and results of operations 
direct broadcast satellite service providers have grown at a rate far exceeding the recent cable television industry growth rate and have emerged as the cable industry s most significant competitors 
dbs service consists of television programming transmitted via high powered satellites to individual homes  each served by a small satellite dish 
according to recent industry reports  dbs service providers currently deliver video programming services to over million individual households  condominiums  apartments and office complexes in the united states 
the two largest dbs companies  directv  inc and echostar communications corporation  provide service to substantially all of these dbs customers and are each among the four largest providers of multichannel video programming services based on reported customers 
the news corporation limited  or news corporation  recently acquired a significant interest in directv 
affiliation with news corporation could strengthen directv s competitive positioning  as news corporation also owns fox television network and several cable programming services 
a recently launched direct broadcast service  voom  has begun offering primarily hdtv services on a national basis 
legislation permitting dbs service providers to transmit local broadcast signals was enacted on november  this eliminated a significant competitive advantage that cable system operators had over dbs service providers 
dbs service providers deliver local broadcast signals in many markets that we serve 
they are developing ways to bring advanced communications services to their customers 
they are currently offering satellite delivered high speed internet access services 
they and certain phone companies are also now jointly offering bundled services that include video  voice and high speed internet access 
we may not be able to obtain critical items at a reasonable cost or when required  which could adversely affect business  financial condition and results of operations 
we depend on third party suppliers for equipment  software  services and other items that are critical for the operation of our cable systems and the provision of advanced services  including analog and digital set top converter boxes  servers and routers  fiber optic cable  telephone circuits  software  the backbone telecommunications network for our internet access service and construction services for expansion and upgrades of our cable systems 
these items are available from a limited number of suppliers 
demand for these items has increased with the general growth in demand for internet and telecommunications services 
we typically do not carry significant inventories of equipment 
moreover  if there are no suppliers that are able to provide set top converter boxes that comply with evolving internet and telecommunications standards or that are compatible with other equipment and software that we use  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
if we are unable to obtain critical equipment  software  services or other items on a timely basis and at an acceptable cost  our ability to offer our products and services and roll out advanced services may be impaired  and our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

table of contents the loss of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our success is substantially dependent upon the retention and continued performance of our key personnel  including rocco b 
commisso  our chairman and chief executive officer 
we have not entered into an employment agreement with mr 
commisso 
if mr 
commisso or any of our other key personnel cease to be employed by us for any reason  our business could be materially adversely affected 
we do not currently maintain key man life insurance on mr 
commisso or other key personnel 
in addition  our subsidiary credit facilities provide that a default will result if any person or group  other than mr 
commisso and certain of his affiliates  becomes the beneficial owner of an amount of aggregate voting power of our common stock on a fully diluted basis that equals or exceeds the greater of i and ii the amount of aggregate voting power of our common stock on a fully diluted basis owned by mr 
commisso and such affiliates at the time 
our chairman and chief executive officer has the ability to control all major corporate decisions  and a sale of his stock could result in a change of control that would have unpredictable effects 
rocco b 
commisso  our chairman and chief executive officer  beneficially owned our common stock representing approximately of the combined voting power as of december  as a result  mr 
commisso will generally have the ability to control the outcome of all matters requiring stockholder approval  including the election of our entire board of directors  the approval of any merger or consolidation and the sale of all or substantially all of our assets 
in addition  mr 
commisso s voting power may have the effect of discouraging offers to acquire mediacom because any such acquisition would require his consent 
we cannot assure you that mr 
commisso will maintain all or any portion of his ownership or that he would continue as an officer or director if he sold a significant part of his stock 
the disposition by mr 
commisso of a sufficient number of shares could result in a change in control of our company  and we cannot assure you that a change of control would not adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
as noted above  it could also result in a default under our subsidiary credit agreements 
our cable television business is subject to extensive governmental regulation 
the cable television industry is subject to extensive legislation and regulation at the federal and local levels  and  in some instances  at the state level 
many aspects of such regulation are currently the subject of judicial and administrative proceedings and legislative and administrative proposals 
we expect that court actions and regulatory proceedings will continue to refine our rights and obligations under applicable federal  state and local laws 
the results of these judicial and administrative proceedings and legislative activities may materially affect our business operations 
local authorities grant us non exclusive franchises that permit us to operate our cable systems 
we renew or renegotiate these franchises from time to time 
local franchising authorities may demand concessions  or other commitments  as a condition to renewal  and these concessions or other commitments could be costly to obtain 
the communications act contains renewal procedures and criteria designed to protect incumbent franchisees against arbitrary denials of renewal  and although such act requires the local franchising authorities to take into account the costs of meeting such concessions or commitments  there is no assurance that we will not be compelled to meet their demands in order to obtain renewals 
we cannot predict whether any of the markets in which we operate will expand the regulation of our cable systems in the future or the impact that any such expanded regulation may have upon our business 
similarly  due to the increasing popularity and use of commercial online services and the internet  it is possible that a number of laws and regulations may be adopted with respect to commercial online services and the internet 
these include laws covering such issues as privacy  access to some types of content by minors  pricing  bulk e mail or spam  encryption standards  consumer protection  electronic commerce  taxation of e commerce  copyright infringement and other intellectual property matters 
the adoption of such laws or regulations in the future may decrease the growth of such services and the internet  which could in turn decrease the demand for our cable modem service  increase our costs of providing such service or have other adverse effects on our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents our franchises are non exclusive and local franchising authorities may grant competing franchises in our markets 
our cable systems are operated under non exclusive franchises granted by local franchising authorities 
as a result  competing operators of cable systems and other potential competitors  such as municipal utility providers  may be granted franchises and may build cable systems in markets where we hold franchises 
any such competition could adversely affect our business 
the existence of multiple cable systems in the same geographic area is generally referred to as an overbuild 
as of the filing date of this report  approximately of the homes passed by our cable systems were overbuilt by other cable operators 
we cannot assure you that competition from overbuilders will not develop in other markets that we now serve or will serve after any future acquisitions 
pending fcc and court proceedings could adversely affect our internet access service 
the legal and regulatory status of providing high speed internet access service by cable television companies is uncertain 
the adoption of new rules by the fcc or rulings in court proceedings could place additional costs and regulatory burdens on us  reduce our anticipated revenues or increase our anticipated costs for this service  complicate the franchise renewal process  result in greater competition or otherwise adversely affect our business 
the fcc has issued a declaratory ruling that cable modem service  as it is currently offered  is properly classified as an interstate information service that is not subject to common carrier regulation 
however  the fcc is still considering the following whether to require cable companies to provide capacity on their systems to other entities to deliver high speed internet directly to customers  also known as open access  whether certain other regulatory requirements do or should apply to cable modem service  and whether and to what extent cable modem service should be subject to local franchise authorities regulatory requirements or franchise fees 
there can be no assurance that regulatory authorities will not impose open access or similar requirements on us as part of an industry wide requirement 
such requirements could have a negative impact on our business and results of operations 
we may become subject to additional regulatory burdens when we offer telephony service 
the regulatory obligations of internet protocol telephony are currently under consideration by the fcc and state authorities 
if our planned voip telephony service is deemed by regulators to be a telecommunications service or a state regulated telephone service  such service could subject us to significant regulation as well as higher fees for pole attachments 
the additional regulatory requirements could cause us to incur additional costs and we may not be able to meet them in a timely manner 
we may be subject to legal liability because of the acts of our internet service customers or because of our own negligence 
our cable modem service enables individuals to access the internet and to exchange information  generate content  conduct business and engage in various online activities on an international basis 
the law relating to the liability of providers of these online services for activities of their users is currently unsettled both within the united states and abroad 
potentially  third parties could seek to hold us liable for the actions and omissions of our cable modem service customers  such as defamation  negligence  copyright or trademark infringement  fraud or other theories based on the nature and content of information that our customers use our service to post  download or distribute 
we also could be subject to similar claims based on the content of other websites to which we provide links or third party products  services or content that we may offer through our internet service 
due to the global nature of the web  it is possible that the governments of other states and foreign countries might attempt to regulate its transmissions or prosecute us for violations of their laws 
it is also possible that information provided directly by us will contain errors or otherwise be negligently provided to users  resulting in third parties making claims against us 
for example  we offer web based email services  which expose us to potential risks  such as liabilities or claims resulting from unsolicited email  lost or misdirected messages  illegal or fraudulent use of email  or interruptions or delays in email service 
to date  no one has filed such a claim against us 
however  in the future someone may file such a claim against us in either a domestic or international jurisdiction and may succeed in imposing liability on us 
our defense of any such actions could be costly and involve significant distraction of our management and other resources 
if we are held or threatened with significant liability  we may decide to take actions to reduce our exposure to this type of liability 
this may require us to spend significant amounts of money for new equipment and may also require us to discontinue offering some features or our cable modem service 

table of contents since we launched our proprietary mediacom online sm internet service in february  we from time to time receive notices of claimed infringements by our cable modem service users 
the owners of copyrights and trademarks have been increasingly active in seeking to prevent use of the internet to violate their rights 
in many cases  their claims of infringement are based on the acts of customers of an internet service provider for example  a customer s use of an internet service or the resources it provides to post  download or disseminate copyrighted music or other content without the consent of the copyright owner or to seek to profit from the use of the goodwill associated with another person s trademark 
in some cases  copyright and trademark owners have sought to recover damages from the internet service provider  as well as or instead of the customer 
the law relating to the potential liability of internet service providers in these circumstances is unsettled 
in  congress adopted the digital millennium copyright act  which is intended to grant isps protection against certain claims of copyright infringement resulting from the actions of customers  provided that the isp complies with certain requirements 
so far  congress has not adopted similar protections for trademark infringement claims 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  we manage our interest expense using a combination of fixed and variable interest rate debt 
we enter into interest rate exchange agreements  or interest rate swaps  to fix the interest rate on a portion of our variable interest rate debt to reduce the potential volatility in our interest expense that would otherwise result from changes in market interest rates 
as of december   we had interest rate exchange agreements with various banks pursuant to which the interest rate on million is fixed at a weighted average rate of approximately  plus the average applicable margin over the eurodollar rate option under our bank credit agreements 
under the terms of the interest rate exchange agreements  which expire from through  we are exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other parties 
however  due to the high creditworthiness of our counterparties  we do not anticipate their nonperformance 
at december   based on the mark to market valuation  we would have paid approximately million if we terminated these agreements  inclusive of accrued interest 
the change in the mark to market value of our interest rate exchange agreements is reflected as either a noncash gain or loss on derivative instruments  net  in consolidated statement of operations 
for the year ended december  we had a net gain of million 
we have no plans to change our hedging strategy as outline above 
future gains or losses on derivative instruments are largely dependent on changes in variable market interest rates  which we cannot predict  and the reduction in the time to maturity of our existing interest rate exchange agreements 
all else being equal  as time elapses on our interest rate exchange agreements  the mark to market gains or losses we have incurred under our interest rate exchange agreements will reduce  resulting in corresponding losses or gains  respectively  on derivative instruments 
if we maintain these agreements to maturity  their ultimate value will be zero  and all gains or losses on derivative instruments  net  recognized to date will have been reversed 
the table below provides the expected maturity and estimated fair value of our debt as of december  dollars in thousands 
see note to our consolidated financial statements
