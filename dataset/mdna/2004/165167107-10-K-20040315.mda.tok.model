executive summary chesapeake is the largest producer of natural gas in the mid continent and is among the six largest independent producers of natural gas in the us at the end of  we owned interests in approximately  producing oil and gas wells 
our primary operating area is the mid continent region of the united states  which includes oklahoma  western arkansas  southwestern kansas and the texas panhandle 
we are building secondary operating areas in the permian basin of western texas and eastern new mexico and in the south texas and texas gulf coast regions 
the company has achieved its current position as a result of a series of key management decisions made during the past six years 
these decisions included favoring gas over oil  establishing regional dominance in our operating areas  delivering value added growth through a balance of drilling and acquisitions and managing risk through opportunistic oil and natural gas hedging 
oil and natural gas production for was bcfe  an increase of bcfe  or  over the bcfe produced in of this bcfe in year over year production growth  an estimated bcfe was a result of organic drillbit growth while bcfe was generated from acquisitions 
we estimate our organic growth rate during was  well above the company s forecasted organic growth rate of 
we have increased our production annually for consecutive years  which we believe is one of the best track records in the industry 
in addition  the fourth quarter was chesapeake s tenth consecutive quarter of sequential production growth 
during the past ten quarters  chesapeake s production has increased  for an average sequential quarterly growth rate of and an annualized growth rate of chesapeake began with estimated proved reserves of  bcfe and ended the year with  bcfe  an increase of bcfe  or 
taking into account production of bcfe  reserve replacement during the year was  bcfe  or  at a finding and acquisition cost of per mcfe 
our year end proved reserves were proved developed 
independent third party reservoir engineers evaluated of our estimated proved reserves at year end of the  bcfe of proved reserve additions  acquisitions added bcfe at a cost of per mcfe and drilling  including positive revisions to previous estimates  added bcfe for a reserve replacement rate from drilling of at a cost of per mcfe 
additionally  we continued to invest in our future in we made unproved property purchases of million and incurred geological and geophysical expenditures of million and lease acquisition expenditures of million 
during  chesapeake drilled net operated wells and participated in another net wells operated by other companies 
chesapeake s drilling costs were million for operated wells and million for non operated wells 
the company s success rate was for operated wells and for non operated wells 
chesapeake has an active property consolidation program that is focused on corporate and property acquisitions of up to million 
during  we acquired approximately bcfe of proved reserves for a total cost of billion primarily in nine transactions of more than million each 
pro forma for two large acquisitions completed in january  we spent billion to acquire  bcfe of proved reserves in as of december   chesapeake s estimated future net cash flows discounted at before taxes pv were billion using field differential adjusted prices of per bo based on a nymex year end price of per bo and per mcf based on a nymex year end price of per mcf 
pv as of december  was billion using field differential adjusted prices of per bo based on a nymex year end price of per bo and per mcf based on a nymex year end price of per mcf 
pro forma for acquisitions completed in january  our proved reserves at year end were  bcfe and had a pv value of billion 
chesapeake continues to focus on improving the strength of its balance sheet 
at the beginning of the year  the company s total debt as a percentage of total capitalization total capitalization is the sum of total debt and stockholders equity was and debt per proved mcfe was per mcfe 
by year end pro forma for the reserves acquired in january and the related financings and debt exchanges completed in january  the company s debt as a percentage of total capitalization had decreased to and debt per proved mcfe had decreased to per mcfe  reductions of and  respectively 
key goals of management are to reduce debt to below of total capitalization and debt per mcfe of proved reserves to below liquidity and capital resources sources of liquidity and uses of funds our primary source of liquidity to meet operating expenses and fund capital expenditures other than for large acquisitions is cash flow from operations in based on our current production  price and expense assumptions  we expect cash flow from operations will exceed our drilling capital expenditures 
our budget for drilling  land and seismic activities during is currently between million and million 
while we believe this level of exploration and development will be sufficient to increase our reserves in and achieve our target of a increase in production over production inclusive of acquisitions completed in january  higher drilling and field operating costs  drilling results that alter planned development schedules  acquisitions or other factors could cause us to revise our drilling program  which is largely discretionary 
any cash flow from operations not needed to fund our drilling program will be available for acquisitions  debt repayment or other general corporate purposes in cash provided by operating activities exclusive of changes in assets and liabilities was million in  compared to million in and million in the million increase from to was primarily due to higher realized prices and higher volumes of oil and gas production 
the million decrease from to was primarily due to decreased oil and gas revenues resulting from lower prices partially offset by higher volumes produced 
we expect that production volumes will be higher than in and that cash provided by operating activities in will exceed levels 
while a precipitous decline in gas prices in would significantly affect the amount of cash flow that would be generated from operations  we have of our expected oil production in hedged at an average nymex price of per barrel of oil and of our expected natural gas production in hedged at an average nymex price of per mcf 
this level of hedging provides certainty of the cash flow we will receive for a substantial portion of our production 
depending on changes in oil and gas futures markets and management s view of underlying oil and natural gas supply and demand trends  however  we may increase or decrease our current hedging positions 
another source of liquidity is our million revolving bank credit facility with a committed borrowing base of million which matures in may at march   we had million of indebtedness under the bank credit facility 
we use the facility to fund daily operating activities and acquisitions as needed 
we borrowed and repaid million in and million in  and we borrowed million and repaid million in under the facility 
we incurred million  million and million of financing costs related to the credit facility in  and  respectively  as a result of amendments to the credit facility agreement 
we believe that our available cash  cash provided by operating activities and funds available under our bank credit facility will be sufficient to fund our operating  interest and general and administrative expenses  our capital expenditure budget  our short term contractual obligations and dividend payments at current levels for the foreseeable future 
the public markets have been our principal source of capital to finance large acquisitions 
we have sold debt and equity in both public and private offerings in the past  and we expect that these sources of capital will continue to be available to us in the future for acquisitions 
nevertheless  we caution you that ready access to capital on reasonable terms and the availability of desirable acquisition targets at attractive prices are subject to many uncertainties  as explained under risk factors in item business 
the following table reflects the proceeds from sales of securities we issued in  and in millions total proceeds net proceeds total proceeds net proceeds total proceeds net proceeds unsecured senior notes guaranteed by subsidiaries convertible preferred stock common stock total we used million and million to pay common stock dividends in and  respectively  and we paid dividends of million  million and million on our preferred stock in  and we received million  million and million from the exercise of employee and director stock options in  and  respectively 
we used million to purchase treasury stock in to fund our matching contributions to the k make up plan 
historically  we have used significant amounts of funds to purchase and retire outstanding company senior notes 
in  we purchased and subsequently retired million of our senior notes for million  including redemption premium of million 
in  we purchased and subsequently retired million of our senior notes for million  including redemption premium of million 
in  we used million to purchase or redeem various chesapeake and gothic senior notes 
we paid million for make whole provisions in the fourth quarter related to the exchange of our common stock for ram energy  inc common stock which occurred in march cash used in investing activities increased to  million in  compared to million in and million in the following table shows our capital expenditures during these years in millions exploration and development drilling acquisitions of oil and gas properties and companies deposit for pending acquisitions investment in securities of other companies drilling rigs  plants and gathering systems office buildings and other administrative total through divestitures of oil and gas properties  we received million in  million in and million  including million for the sale of our canadian subsidiary  in sales of other assets and recoveries of investments in securities of other companies provided million  million and million of cash in  and  respectively 
during and early  we took several steps to improve our capital structure  including the transactions described below under investing and financing transactions 
these transactions enabled us to extend our average maturity of long term debt to over nine years with an average interest rate of 
the company s debt as a percentage of total capitalization decreased to pro forma for january and february securities transactions and debt per proved mcfe decreased to per mcfe 
reducing debt to below of total capitalization and reducing debt per mcfe of proved reserves to below are key goals of our business strategy 
our accounts receivable are primarily from purchasers of oil and natural gas million at december  and exploration and production companies which own interests in properties we operate million at december  
this industry concentration has the potential to impact our overall exposure to credit risk  either positively or negatively  in that our customers may be similarly affected by changes in economic  industry or other conditions 
we generally require letters of credit for receivables from customers which are judged to have sub standard credit  unless the credit risk can otherwise be mitigated 
our liquidity is not dependent on the use of off balance sheet financing arrangements  such as the securitization of receivables or obtaining access to assets through special purpose entities 
we have not relied on off balance sheet financing arrangements in the past and we do not intend to rely on such arrangements in the future as a source of liquidity 
we are not a commercial paper issuer 
investing and financing transactions the following describes significant investing and financing transactions that we completed in and in january and february investing transactions first quarter mid continent properties from a wholly owned subsidiary of oneok  inc cash consideration of million of which million was paid in anadarko basin properties in western oklahoma and texas panhandle from el paso corporation cash consideration of approximately million bray field properties in southern oklahoma from vintage petroleum  inc cash consideration of approximately million million shares  or approximately  of pioneer drilling company common stock million second quarter oxley petroleum company  arkoma basin properties in eastern oklahoma and western arkansas cash consideration of approximately million third quarter beckham county  oklahoma producing properties  gas gathering system and gas treatment plant cash consideration of approximately million limited partnership interest in eagle energy partnership i  lp  a gas marketing company million fourth quarter limited partnership interest in texas vicksburg holding lp  which conducts e p operations through several partnerships million south texas properties from laredo energy  lp and its partners cash consideration of approximately million permian basin properties cash consideration of million january concho resources inc  permian basin and mid continent properties cash consideration of approximately million of which million was paid in south texas properties cash consideration of approximately million of which million was paid in financing transactions first quarter private placement of million senior notes due public offering of million shares of common stock at per share private placement of million of cumulative convertible preferred stock third quarter privately negotiated exchange of million of senior notes due and accrued interest of million for million of senior notes due and accrued interest of million and million of senior notes due and accrued interest of million fourth quarter privately negotiated exchange of million of senior notes due and accrued interest of million for million of senior notes due and accrued interest of million and million of senior notes due privately negotiated exchange of million of senior notes due and accrued interest of million for million of senior notes due and accrued interest of million and million of senior notes due and accrued interest of million private placement of million senior notes due public offering of  shares of convertible preferred stock at per share paid million including premium of million for million of senior notes due pursuant to cash tender offer january and february public offering of million shares of common stock at per share public exchange of million of senior notes due and accrued interest of million and additional million of senior notes due and accrued interest of million for million of senior notes due and accrued interest of million privately negotiated exchanges of million of senior notes due and accrued interest of million for million of senior notes due and accrued interest of million and million of senior notes due and accrued interest of million contractual obligations we have a million revolving bank credit facility with a committed borrowing base of million which matures in may as of december   we had no outstanding borrowings under this facility and had utilized million of the facility for various letters of credit 
borrowings under the facility are collateralized by certain producing oil and gas properties and bear interest at either i the greater of the reference rate of union bank of california  na  or the federal funds effective rate plus or ii london interbank offered rate libor  at our option  plus a margin that varies according to our senior unsecured long term debt rating 
the collateral value and borrowing base are redetermined periodically 
the unused portion of the facility is subject to an annual commitment fee of 
interest is payable quarterly or  if libor applies  it may be payable at more frequent intervals 
the credit facility agreement contains various covenants and restrictive provisions which limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness  sell properties  pay dividends  purchase or redeem our capital stock  make investments or loans or purchase certain of our senior notes  and create liens 
the credit facility agreement requires us to maintain a current ratio as defined of at least to and a fixed charge coverage ratio as defined of at least to at december   our current ratio was to and our fixed charge coverage ratio was to if we should fail to perform our obligations under these and other covenants  the revolving credit commitment could be terminated and any outstanding borrowings under the facility could be declared immediately due and payable 
such acceleration  if involving a principal amount of million or more  would constitute an event of default under our senior note indentures  which could in turn result in the acceleration of our senior note indebtedness 
the credit facility agreement also has cross default provisions that apply to other indebtedness we may have with an outstanding principal amount in excess of million 
as of december   senior notes represented approximately billion of our long term debt and consisted of the following in thousands senior notes due a senior notes due senior notes due senior notes due senior notes due senior notes due senior notes due senior notes due discount on senior notes discount for interest rate swap and swaption a this amount was classified as long term debt based on our ability and intent to satisfy this obligation with funding from our bank credit facility 
following the debt exchanges which occurred in january and february and excluding the senior notes which were paid in march and the senior notes which were called for redemption in march  our pro forma senior notes payable as of december  consisted of the following senior notes due senior notes due senior notes due senior notes due senior notes due senior notes due discount on senior notes no scheduled principal payments are required on any of the senior notes until  when million is due 
debt ratings for the senior notes are ba by moody s investor service  bb by standard poor s ratings services and bb by fitch ratings 
debt ratings for our secured bank credit facility are ba by moody s investor service  bbb by standard poor s ratings services and bb by fitch ratings 
our senior notes are unsecured senior obligations of chesapeake and rank equally with all of our other unsecured indebtedness 
all of our wholly owned subsidiaries except chesapeake energy marketing  inc  mayfield processing  llc and midcon compression  llc guarantee the notes 
the indentures permit us to redeem the senior notes at any time at specified make whole or redemption prices 
the indentures for the     and senior notes contain covenants limiting our ability and our restricted subsidiaries ability to incur additional indebtedness  pay dividends on our capital stock or redeem  repurchase or retire our capital stock or subordinated indebtedness  make investments and other restricted payments  create restrictions on the payment of dividends or other amounts to us from our restricted subsidiaries  incur liens  engage in transactions with affiliates  sell assets  and consolidate  merge or transfer assets 
the debt incurrence covenants do not affect our ability to borrow under or expand our secured credit facility 
as of december   we estimate that secured commercial bank indebtedness of approximately  million could have been incurred under the most restrictive indenture covenant 
the indenture covenants do not apply to our marketing subsidiaries  chesapeake energy marketing  inc  mayfield processing  llc and midcon compression  lp  which are our only unrestricted subsidiaries 
the table below summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations standby letters of credit other long term obligations total contractual cash obligations some of our commodity price and financial risk management arrangements require us to deliver cash collateral or other assurances of performance to the counterparties in the event that our payment obligations with respect to our commodity price and financial risk management transactions exceed certain levels 
at december   we were required to post million of collateral and at march   we were required to post million of collateral 
future collateral requirements are uncertain and will depend on arrangements with our counterparties  highly volatile natural gas and oil prices  and fluctuations in interest rates 
hedging activities oil and gas hedging activities our results of operations and operating cash flows are impacted by changes in market prices for oil and gas 
to mitigate a portion of the exposure to adverse market changes  we have entered into various derivative instruments  including swaps  counter swaps locking in the value of certain swaps  cap swaps  basis protection swaps and call options 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk contains a description of each of these instruments 
hedging allows us to predict with greater certainty the effective prices we will receive for our hedged oil and gas production 
we closely monitor the fair value of our hedging contracts and may elect to settle a contract prior to its scheduled maturity date in order to lock in a gain or loss 
commodity markets are volatile  and chesapeake s hedging activity is dynamic 
mark to market positions under oil and gas hedging contracts fluctuate with commodity prices 
as described above under contractual obligations  we may be required to deliver cash collateral or other assurances of performance if our payment obligations to our hedging counterparties exceed levels stated in our contracts 
realized gains and losses from our oil and gas derivatives resulted in a net decrease in oil and gas sales of million or per mcfe in  a net increase of million or per mcfe in and a net increase of million or per mcfe in oil and gas sales also includes changes in the fair value of oil and gas derivatives that do not qualify as cash flow hedges under sfas  as well as gains losses on ineffectiveness of instruments designated as cash flow hedges 
unrealized gains losses included in oil and gas sales in  and were million  million and million  respectively 
included in these unrealized gains losses are gains losses on ineffectiveness of cash flow hedges of million in  million in and million in changes in the fair value of oil and gas derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges  to the extent effective in offsetting cash flows attributable to the hedged commodities  and locked in gains and losses of derivative contracts are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income until the month of related production 
these unrealized losses  net of related tax effects  totaled million and million as of december  and  respectively 
based upon the market prices at december   we expect to transfer to earnings approximately million of the balance in accumulated other comprehensive income during the next months 
a detailed explanation of accounting for oil and gas derivatives under sfas appears under application of critical accounting policies hedging elsewhere in this item the fair value of our oil and gas derivative instruments is recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as assets or liabilities

by entering into interest rate swaps  we convert a portion of our fixed rate debt to floating rate debt 
to the extent the interest rate swaps have been designated as fair value hedges  changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument and the corresponding debt are reflected as adjustments to interest expense in the corresponding months covered by the derivative agreement 
the following describes interest rate swaps entered into during and  all of which were terminated prior to contractual maturity for cash settlements in thousands date initiated fair value at december  date closed cash settlement received gains recognized in gains recognized in gains to be recognized in march a july   c june b july   august b january august b  january   a this instrument was designated as a fair value hedge with changes in the fair value recorded as an adjustment to the debt 
upon termination of the hedging relationship  the previously recorded changes in the fair value of the debt are amortized to earnings over the term of the debt 
b these instruments were not designated as fair value hedges  therefore  changes in the fair value were recorded as adjustments to interest expense 
c of this amount  million was recognized as a reduction to the loss on repurchases of debt upon retirement of notes 
in april  chesapeake entered into a swaption with an unrelated counterparty with respect to its senior notes due the notional amount of the swaption was million  which was the principal amount then outstanding under the senior notes 
the senior notes included a call option whereby chesapeake may redeem the debt at declining redemption prices beginning in march under the swaption  the counterparty received the option to elect whether or not to enter into an interest rate swap with chesapeake in march  and chesapeake received million 
the interest rate swap  if executed by the counterparty  requires chesapeake to pay a fixed rate of while the counterparty pays chesapeake a floating rate of month libor plus 
additionally  if the counterparty elects to enter into the interest rate swap  it may also elect to force chesapeake to settle the transaction at the then current value of the interest rate swap 
according to sfas  a fair value hedge relationship exists between the embedded call option in the senior notes and the swaption 
the fair value of the swaption is recorded on the consolidated balance sheets as a liability  and the carrying amount of the debt is adjusted by the change in the fair value of the call option subsequent to the initiation of the swaption 
any resulting differences are recorded currently as ineffectiveness in the consolidated statements of operations as an adjustment to interest expense 
during the third quarter  we exchanged and subsequently retired million of our senior notes 
the exchange of debt was treated as a modification rather than an extinguishment 
accordingly  the adjustment to the carrying value of the debt of million related to the application of hedge accounting was reflected as a discount on the notes issued in the exchange transaction and will be amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method 
during the fourth quarter  we purchased and subsequently retired million of the remaining million of senior notes pursuant to a tender offer and recorded a million loss related to the removal of the fair value designation of the corresponding amount of the swaption 
temporary fluctuations in the fair value of the portion of the swaption no longer designated as a fair value hedge are recorded as adjustments to interest expense 
we recorded a million unrealized loss in interest expense during due to a decline in the fair value of the portion of the swaption no longer designated as a fair value hedge 
as of december   the remaining notional amount of the swaption designated as a fair value hedge was million 
we have recorded an adjustment to the carrying amount of the debt of million which represents the temporary fluctuations in the fair value of the call option included in the million principal amount of senior notes 
since the inception of the swaption  we have recorded a change in the fair market value of the swaption from a million liability to a million liability  an increase of million 
we have recorded as additional interest expense million to reflect ineffectiveness after giving effect to the removal of the designation of a portion of the swaption as a fair value hedge under sfas as described previously 
on february   chesapeake and the counterparty agreed to extend the counterparty s right to require chesapeake to settle the transaction on march  to april  on march   the counterparty exercised its option to enter into the interest rate swap effective march  on april  and each succeeding march  the counterparty may elect to terminate the swap and cause it to be settled at the then current value of the interest rate swap 
we may elect to terminate the swap and cause it to be settled at the then current value of the interest rate swap at any time during the term of the swap 
cash payments related to the interest rate swap  if initiated  or as a result of cash settlement at termination  will be recorded as adjustments to earnings 
results of operations general 
for the year ended december   chesapeake had net income of million  or per diluted common share  on total revenues of  million 
this compares to net income of million  or per diluted common share  on total revenues of million during the year ended december   and net income of million  or per diluted common share  on total revenues of million during the year ended december  the net income includes  on a pre tax basis  a million loss on repurchases of debt  a million provision for legal settlements  million in net unrealized gains on oil and gas and interest rate derivatives and a million impairment of our investment in seven seas petroleum inc the net income includes  on a pre tax basis  million in net unrealized losses on oil and gas and interest rate derivatives  a million impairment of our investment in seven seas petroleum inc and a million loss on repurchases of debt 
the net income included  on a pre tax basis  million in net unrealized gains on oil and gas derivatives  a million impairment of certain equity investments  a million gain on the sale of our canadian subsidiary  a million cost for an unsecured standby credit facility associated with the acquisition of gothic energy corporation and a million loss on repurchases of debt 
oil and gas sales 
during  oil and gas sales were  million versus million in and million in in  chesapeake produced bcfe at a weighted average price of per mcfe  compared to bcfe produced in at a weighted average price of per mcfe  and bcfe produced in at a weighted average price of per mcfe weighted average prices for all years discussed exclude the effect of unrealized gains or losses on derivatives 
the increase in prices in resulted in an increase in revenue of million and increased production resulted in a million increase  for a total increase in revenues of million excluding unrealized gains or losses on oil and gas derivatives 
the change in oil and gas prices has a significant impact on our oil and gas revenues and cash flows 
assuming production levels  a change of per mcf of gas produced would result in an increase or decrease in revenues and cash flow of approximately million and million  respectively  and a change of per barrel of oil produced would result in an increase or decrease in revenues and cash flows of approximately million and million  respectively  without considering the effect of derivative activities 
for  we realized an average price per barrel of oil of  compared to in and in weighted average prices for all years discussed exclude the effect of unrealized gains or losses on derivatives 
natural gas prices realized per mcf excluding unrealized gains or losses on derivatives were  and in  and  respectively 
realized gains or losses from our oil and gas derivatives resulted in a net decrease in oil and gas revenues of million or per mcfe in  a net increase of million or per mcfe in and a net increase of million or per mcfe in year over year changes in oil and gas sales during the last three years were also affected by unrealized gains losses on oil and gas derivatives  which were million in  million in and million in the following table shows our production by region for  and years ended december  mmcfe percent mmcfe percent mmcfe percent mid continent south texas and texas gulf coast permian basin williston basin and other canada total production natural gas production represented approximately of our total production volume on an equivalent basis in  compared to in and the increase in production from through is due to the combination of organic production growth during the period as well as acquisitions completed in and oil and gas marketing sales 
chesapeake realized million in oil and gas marketing sales for third parties in  with corresponding oil and gas marketing expenses of million  for a net margin of million 
sales for third parties include the sale of oil and gas from wells not operated by chesapeake  as well as the sale of oil and gas from working interest owners other than chesapeake in wells operated by chesapeake 
this compares to sales of million and million  expenses of million and million  and margins of million and million in and  respectively 
in  chesapeake realized an increase in volumes and prices related to oil and gas marketing sales 
in  the increase in volume was partially offset by a decrease in oil and gas prices 
production expenses 
production expenses  which include lifting costs and ad valorem taxes  were million in  compared to million and million in and  respectively 
on a unit of production basis  production expenses were per mcfe in compared to and per mcfe in and  respectively 
the decrease in costs on a per unit basis in is due primarily to lower production costs associated with properties acquired during the year and realization of efficiencies from higher scale of operations in the mid continent region 
the increase in was primarily due to higher field service costs and higher production costs associated with properties acquired during we expect that production expenses per mcfe in will range from to 
production taxes 
production taxes were million in compared to million in and million in on a unit of production basis  production taxes were  and per mcfe in  and  respectively 
the increase in of million was due to an increase in the average wellhead prices received for natural gas and the loss of certain oklahoma severance tax exemptions resulting from natural gas prices exceeding a pre determined ceiling during the period 
the decrease in of million was due to a decrease in the average wellhead prices received for natural gas 
in general  production taxes are calculated using value based formulas that produce higher per unit costs when oil and gas prices are higher 
we expect production taxes per mcfe to range from to in based on an assumption that oil and natural gas wellhead prices range from to per mcfe 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses  which are net of internal payroll and non payroll costs capitalized in our oil and gas properties see note of notes to consolidated financial statements  were million in  million in and million in the increase in and is the result of the company s growth related to the various acquisitions which occurred in and this growth has resulted in a substantial increase in employees and related costs 
we anticipate that general and administrative expenses for will be between and per mcfe produced  which is approximately the same level as chesapeake follows the full cost method of accounting under which all costs associated with property acquisition  exploration and development activities are capitalized 
we capitalize internal costs that can be directly identified with our acquisition  exploration and development activities and do not include any costs related to production  general corporate overhead or similar activities 
we capitalized million  million and million of internal costs in  and  respectively  directly related to our oil and gas exploration and development efforts 
provision for legal settlements 
we have entered into a settlement agreement  effective december   to resolve a legal proceeding brought against us by certain royalty owners 
under the terms of the settlement  we will refund oklahoma royalty owners million  including interest 
the refund amount includes million relating to marketing fees which we have previously paid into the court and charged to provision for legal settlements million in the first quarter and million in 
in the third and fourth quarter  we accrued an additional million related to the settlement 
a description of the settlement is included in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
at the beginning of  we had a reserve of approximately million for potential liability associated with a number of cases alleging the cessation of leases in the west panhandle field of the texas panhandle 
during  we reversed approximately million of this accrued liability  and we reversed the remaining million in as of december   there are no outstanding liabilities related to these cases 
oil and gas depreciation  depletion and amortization 
depreciation  depletion and amortization of oil and gas properties was million  million and million during  and  respectively 
the average dd a rate per mcfe  which is a function of capitalized costs  future development costs  and the related underlying reserves in the periods presented  was all domestic  all domestic and in us and in canada in  and  respectively 
we expect the dd a rate to be between and per mcfe produced 
the increase in the average rate from to is primarily the result of higher drilling costs and higher costs associated with acquisitions 
depreciation and amortization of other assets 
depreciation and amortization of other assets was million in  compared to million in and million in the increases in and were primarily the result of higher depreciation costs on fixed assets related to capital expenditures made in both years 
other property and equipment costs are depreciated on a straight line basis 
buildings are depreciated over years  drilling rigs are depreciated over years and all other property and equipment are depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the assets  which range from two to fifteen years 
to the extent drilling rigs are used to drill our wells  a substantial portion of the depreciation is capitalized in oil and gas properties as exploration or development costs 
we expect depreciation and amortization of other assets to be between and per mcfe produced 
interest and other income 
interest and other income was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the income consisted of million of interest income  a million loss on our equity investment in pioneer drilling company  a million gain on the final settlement of the sale of our canadian subsidiary  and million of miscellaneous income 
the income consisted of million in interest income  million of interest accrued on our investment in seven seas  a million gain on the sale of our ram notes  a million loss on our investment in petroleum place and million of miscellaneous income 
the income consisted of million of interest income on our investment in seven seas notes and million of interest income on our ram notes 
interest expense 
interest expense increased to million in  compared to million in and million in the increase in is due to a million increase in average long term borrowings in compared to the increase in is due to a million increase in average long term borrowings in compared to in addition to the interest expense reported  we capitalized million of interest during  compared to million capitalized in  and million capitalized in on significant investments in unproved properties that were not being currently depreciated  depleted or amortized and on which exploration activities were in progress 
interest is capitalized using the weighted average interest rate on our outstanding borrowings 
we expect interest expense to be between and per mcfe produced 
from time to time  we enter into derivative instruments designed to mitigate our exposure to the volatility in interest rates 
for interest rate derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges in accordance with sfas  changes in fair value of interest rate derivatives are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets as assets liabilities and the debt s carrying value amount is adjusted by the change in the fair value of the debt subsequent to the initiation of the derivative 
any resulting differences are recorded currently as ineffectiveness in the consolidated statements of operations as an adjustment to interest expense 
included in interest expense in are a realized gain of million related to interest rate derivatives and an unrealized loss on interest rate derivatives of million 
included in interest expense in are a realized gain of million related to interest rate derivatives and an unrealized loss on interest rate derivatives of million 
there were no such gains or losses in a detailed explanation of our interest rate hedging appears under the caption hedging activities interest rate hedging elsewhere in this item loss on investment in seven seas 
in july  chesapeake purchased million principal amount of senior secured notes due issued by seven seas petroleum inc and detachable seven year warrants to purchase approximately million shares of seven seas common stock at an exercise price of approximately per share 
in the third quarter of  chesapeake recorded an impairment of million representing of the cost allocated to our seven seas common stock warrants 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded an additional impairment of million to reduce our net investment in the senior secured notes  including accrued interest  to million  representing chesapeake s anticipated share of the net proceeds from the liquidation of seven seas assets in bankruptcy 
in the third quarter of  we received approximately million in proceeds from the sale of its principal assets 
seven seas reported in october that it had no source of additional cash flow and only contingent assets remaining  the value of which were highly speculative 
accordingly  in the fourth quarter of  we determined that any remaining assets of seven seas would not be adequate for us to realize the remaining investment on our books 
at that time  we recorded an impairment of million which reduced the carrying value of our investment to zero 
loss on repurchases of debt 
during  we purchased and subsequently retired million of our senior notes due for a total consideration of million  including accrued interest of million and million of redemption premium 
in connection with this repurchase transaction we recorded a pre tax loss of million  consisting of million of redemption premium  million write off of unamortized debt issue costs and notes discount  million of transaction costs  and a write off of the call option value of million carried as a discount on the senior notes based on the hedging relationship between the notes and the swaption 
during  we purchased and subsequently retired million of our senior notes due for total consideration of million  including accrued interest of million and million of redemption premium partially offset by a million gain from interest rate hedging activities associated with the retired debt 
during  we purchased or redeemed million principal amount of our senior notes  million principal amount of the senior secured notes of gothic production corporation  a chesapeake subsidiary  and million principal amount of our senior notes 
the purchase and redemption of these notes included payment of aggregate make whole and redemption premiums of million and the write off of unamortized debt costs and debt issue premiums resulting in a pre tax loss of million 
impairments of investments in securities 
during we recorded impairments to two equity investments of million 
the majority of this impairment was related to our investment in ram energy  inc in march  we issued million shares of chesapeake common stock in exchange for of ram s outstanding common stock 
our shares were valued at each  or million in total 
during  we recorded our equity in ram s net losses  which had the effect of reducing our carrying value in these securities to million 
in december  we sold the ram shares for minimal consideration 
in addition  we reduced the carrying value of our million investment in an internet based oil and gas business by million to million 
gain on sale of canadian subsidiary 
in october  we sold our canadian subsidiary  which had oil and gas operations primarily in northeast british columbia  for approximately million 
under full cost accounting  our investment in these canadian oil and gas properties was treated as a separate cost center for accounting purposes 
as a result of the sale of this cost center  any gain or loss on the disposition was required to be recognized in current earnings 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a gain on sale of our canadian subsidiary of million 
provision benefit for income taxes 
chesapeake recorded income tax expense of million in  compared to income tax expense of million in and income tax expense of million in all income tax expense for and was related to our domestic operations 
income tax expense for was comprised of million related to our domestic operations  million related to our canadian operations and million related to the sale of our canadian subsidiary 
as of december   we determined that it was more likely than not that million of the deferred tax assets related to louisiana net operating losses will not be realized and we recorded a valuation allowance equal to such amounts 
during  we determined that it was more likely than not that an additional million of the deferred tax assets related to louisiana net operating losses will not be realized and we recorded an additional valuation allowance equal to such amounts 
cumulative effect of accounting change 
effective january   chesapeake adopted sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
upon adoption of sfas  we recorded the discounted fair value of our expected future obligations of million  a cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle as an increase to earnings of million net of income taxes and an increase in net oil and gas properties of million 
application of critical accounting policies readers of this document and users of the information contained in it should be aware of how certain events may impact our financial results based on the accounting policies in place 
the four policies we consider to be the most significant are discussed below 
the company s management has discussed each critical accounting policy with the audit committee of the company s board of directors 
the selection and application of accounting policies is an important process that changes as our business changes and as accounting rules are developed 
accounting rules generally do not involve a selection among alternatives  but involve an implementation and interpretation of existing rules and the use of judgment to the specific set of circumstances existing in our business 
hedging 
from time to time  chesapeake uses commodity price and financial risk management instruments to mitigate our exposure to price fluctuations in oil and natural gas and interest rates 
recognized gains and losses on derivative contracts are reported as a component of the related transaction 
results of oil and gas derivative transactions are reflected in oil and gas sales  and results of interest rate hedging transactions are reflected in interest expense 
the changes in the fair value of derivative instruments not qualifying for designation as either cash flow or fair value hedges that occur prior to maturity are reported currently in the consolidated statement of operations as unrealized gains losses within oil and gas sales or interest expense 
effective january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that derivative instruments including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts be recorded at fair value and included in the consolidated balance sheet as assets or liabilities 
the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation  which is established at the inception of a derivative 
for derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges  changes in fair value  to the extent the hedge is effective  are recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
any change in the fair value resulting from ineffectiveness  as defined by sfas  is recognized immediately in oil and gas sales 
for derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges in accordance with sfas  changes in fair value  as well as the offsetting changes in the estimated fair value of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk  are recognized currently in earnings 
differences between the changes in the fair values of the hedged item and the derivative instrument  if any  represent gains or losses on ineffectiveness and are reflected currently in interest expense 
hedge effectiveness is measured at least quarterly based on the relative changes in fair value between the derivative contract and the hedged item over time 
changes in fair value of contracts that do not qualify as hedges or are not designated as hedges are also recognized currently in earnings 
see hedging activities below and item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for additional information regarding our hedging activities 
one of the primary factors that can have an impact on our results of operations is the method used to value our derivatives 
we have established the fair value of all derivative instruments using estimates determined by our counterparties and subsequently evaluated internally using established index prices and other sources 
these values are based upon  among other things  futures prices  volatility  time to maturity and credit risk 
the values we report in our financial statements change as these estimates are revised to reflect actual results  changes in market conditions or other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
another factor that can impact our results of operations each period is our ability to estimate the level of correlation between future changes in the fair value of the hedge instruments and the transactions being hedged  both at the inception and on an ongoing basis 
this correlation is complicated since energy commodity prices  the primary risk we hedge  have quality and location differences that can be difficult to hedge effectively 
the factors underlying our estimates of fair value and our assessment of correlation of our hedging derivatives are impacted by actual results and changes in conditions that affect these factors  many of which are beyond our control 
due to the volatility of oil and natural gas prices and  to a lesser extent  interest rates  the company s financial condition and results of operations can be significantly impacted by changes in the market value of our derivative instruments 
as of december   and  the net market value of our derivatives was a liability of million  a liability of million and an asset of million  respectively 
with respect to our derivatives held as of december   an increase or decrease in natural gas prices of per mmbtu would decrease or increase the estimated fair value of our derivatives by approximately million 
an increase or decrease in crude oil prices of per barrel would decrease or increase the estimated fair value of our derivatives by approximately million 
oil and gas properties 
the accounting for our business is subject to special accounting rules that are unique to the oil and gas industry 
there are two allowable methods of accounting for oil and gas business activities the successful efforts method and the full cost method 
chesapeake follows the full cost method of accounting under which all costs associated with property acquisition  exploration and development activities are capitalized 
we also capitalize internal costs that can be directly identified with our acquisition  exploration and development activities and do not include any costs related to production  general corporate overhead or similar activities 
under the successful efforts method  geological and geophysical costs and costs of carrying and retaining undeveloped properties are charged to expense as incurred 
costs of drilling exploratory wells that do not result in proved reserves are charged to expense 
depreciation  depletion  amortization and impairment of oil and gas properties are generally calculated on a well by well or lease or field basis versus the aggregated full cost pool basis 
additionally  gain or loss is generally recognized on all sales of oil and gas properties under the successful efforts method 
as a result  our financial statements will differ from companies that apply the successful efforts method since we will generally reflect a higher level of capitalized costs as well as a higher oil and gas depreciation  depletion and amortization rate 
capitalized costs are amortized on a composite unit of production method based on proved oil and gas reserves 
as of december   approximately of our present value discounted at of estimated future net revenues of proved reserves was evaluated by independent petroleum engineers  with the balance evaluated by our internal reservoir engineers 
in addition  our internal engineers reevaluate our reserves on a quarterly basis 
depreciation  depletion and amortization expense is based on the amount of estimated reserves 
if we maintain the same level of production year over year  the depreciation  depletion and amortization expense may be significantly different if our estimate of remaining reserves changes significantly 
proceeds from the sale of properties are accounted for as reductions of capitalized costs unless such sales involve a significant change in the relationship between costs and the value of proved reserves or the underlying value of unproved properties  in which case a gain or loss is recognized 
no income is recognized in connection with contractual services provided by chesapeake on properties in which we hold an economic interest 
the costs of unproved properties are excluded from amortization until the properties are evaluated 
we review all of our unevaluated properties quarterly to determine whether or not and to what extent proved reserves have been assigned to the properties  and otherwise if impairment has occurred 
unevaluated properties are grouped by major producing area where individual property costs are not significant and are assessed individually when individual costs are significant 
we review the carrying value of our oil and gas properties under the full cost accounting rules of the securities and exchange commission on a quarterly basis 
this quarterly review is referred to as a ceiling test 
under the ceiling test  capitalized costs  less accumulated amortization and related deferred income taxes  may not exceed an amount equal to the sum of the present value of estimated future net revenues less estimated future expenditures to be incurred in developing and producing the proved reserves  less any related income tax effects 
the two primary factors impacting this test are reserve levels and current prices  and their associated impact on the present value of estimated future net revenues 
revisions to estimates of natural gas and oil reserves and or an increase or decrease in prices can have a material impact on the present value of estimated future net revenues 
the process of estimating natural gas and oil reserves is very complex  requiring significant decisions in the evaluation of available geological  geophysical  engineering and economic data 
the data for a given property may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors  including additional development activity  evolving production history and a continual reassessment of the viability of production under changing economic conditions 
as a result  material revisions to existing reserve estimates occur from time to time 
although every reasonable effort is made to ensure that reserve estimates reported represent the most accurate assessments possible  the subjective decisions and variances in available data for various properties increases the likelihood of significant changes in these estimates 
in addition  the prices of natural gas and oil are volatile and change from period to period 
price changes directly impact the estimated revenues from our properties and the associated present value of future net revenues 
such changes also impact the economic life of our properties and thereby affect the quantity of reserves that can be assigned to a property 
the volatility of oil and natural gas prices and the impact of revisions to reserve estimates can have a significant impact on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
our oil and gas depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a rates have fluctuated between per mcfe in to per mcfe in reflecting the impact of changes in prices and finding costs during these periods 
as of december   a decrease in natural gas prices of per mcf and a decrease in oil prices of per barrel would reduce the company s estimated proved reserves of  bcfe by bcfe and bcfe  respectively  and would also reduce the company s present value of estimated future net revenues by approximately million and million  respectively 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and intangible assets were issued by the financial accounting standards board in june and became effective for us on july  and january   respectively 
sfas requires all business combinations initiated after june  to be accounted for using the purchase method 
additionally  sfas requires companies to disaggregate and report separately from goodwill certain intangible assets 
sfas establishes new guidelines for accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets 
under sfas  goodwill and certain other intangible assets are not amortized  but rather are reviewed annually for impairment 
the emerging issues task forces eitf is considering two issues related to the reporting of oil and gas mineral rights 
issue no 
s  application of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets to oil and gas companies  considers whether oil and gas drilling rights are subject to the classification and disclosure provisions of sfas if they are intangible assets 
chesapeake classifies the cost of oil and gas mineral rights as property and equipment and believes that this is consistent with oil and gas accounting and industry practice 
if the eitf determines that oil and gas mineral rights are intangible assets and are subject to the applicable classification and disclosure provisions of sfas  we estimate that million and million would be classified on our consolidated balance sheets as intangible undeveloped leasehold and billion and million would be classified as intangible developed leasehold as of december  and  respectively 
these amounts are net of accumulated dd a 
there would be no effect on the consolidated statements of operations or cash flows as the intangible assets related to oil and gas mineral rights would continue to be amortized under the full cost method of accounting 
we will continue to classify our oil and gas mineral rights held under lease and other contractual rights representing the right to extract such reserves as tangible oil and gas properties until further guidance is provided 
income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate the federal and state income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which chesapeake operates 
this process involves estimating the actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as derivative instruments  depreciation  depletion and amortization  and certain accrued liabilities for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences and the net operating loss carryforwards result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess  using all available positive and negative evidence  the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
if we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent chesapeake establishes a valuation allowance or increases or decreases this allowance in a period  we must include an expense or reduction of expense within the tax provisions in the consolidated statement of operations 
under sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  an enterprise must use judgment in considering the relative impact of negative and positive evidence 
the weight given to the potential effect of negative and positive evidence should be commensurate with the extent to which it can be objectively verified 
the more negative evidence that exists a the more positive evidence is necessary and b the more difficult it is to support a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed for some portion or all of the deferred tax asset 
among the more significant types of evidence that we consider are taxable income projections in future years  whether the carryforward period is so brief that it would limit realization of tax benefits  future sales and operating cost projections that will produce more than enough taxable income to realize the deferred tax asset based on existing sales prices and cost structures  and our earnings history exclusive of the loss that created the future deductible amount coupled with evidence indicating that the loss is an aberration rather than a continuing condition 
if a natural gas and oil prices were to decrease significantly below present levels and if such decreases were considered other than temporary  b exploration  drilling and operating costs were to increase significantly beyond current levels  or c we were confronted with any other significantly negative evidence pertaining to our ability to realize our nol carryforwards prior to their expiration  we may be required to provide a valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset 
as of december  we have a deferred tax asset of million  of which only million had an associated valuation allowance 
accounting for business combinations 
our business has grown substantially through acquisitions and our business strategy is to continue to pursue acquisitions as opportunities arise 
prior to the issuance of sfas  accounting for business combinations in  we applied the guidance provided by accounting principles board opinion apb no 
 and its interpretations  as well as various other authoritative literature and interpretations that address issues encountered in accounting for business combinations 
we have accounted for all of our business combinations using the purchase method  which is the only method permitted under sfas the accounting for business combinations is complicated and involves the use of significant judgment 
under the purchase method of accounting  a business combination is accounted for at a purchase price based upon the fair value of the consideration given  whether in the form of cash  assets  stock or the assumption of liabilities 
the assets and liabilities acquired are measured at their fair values  and the purchase price is allocated to the assets and liabilities based upon these fair values 
the excess of the cost of an acquired entity  if any  over the net of the amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recognized as goodwill 
the excess of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed over the cost of an acquired entity  if any  is allocated as a pro rata reduction of the amounts that otherwise would have been assigned to certain of the acquired assets 
determining the fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired involves the use of judgment  since some of the assets and liabilities acquired do not have fair values that are readily determinable 
different techniques may be used to determine fair values  including market prices  where available  appraisals  comparisons to transactions for similar assets and liabilities and present value of estimated future cash flows  among others 
since these estimates involve the use of significant judgment  they can change as new information becomes available 
each of the business combinations completed during the past five years were of small to medium sized exploration and production companies with oil and gas interests primarily in the mid continent 
we believe that the consideration we have paid to acquire these companies has represented the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired at the time of acquisition 
consequently  we have not recognized any goodwill from any of our business combinations  nor do we expect to recognize any goodwill from similar business combinations that we may complete in the future 
disclosures about effects of transactions with related parties as of december   we had accrued accounts receivable from our chief executive officer and chief operating officer of million and million  respectively  representing billings for december which were paid in january since chesapeake was founded in  our ceo and coo have acquired small working interests in certain of our oil and gas properties by participating in our drilling activities 
joint interest billing accounts of the ceo and coo are settled in cash 
under their employment agreements  the ceo and coo are permitted to participate in all  or none  of the wells drilled by or on behalf of chesapeake during each calendar quarter  but they are not allowed to participate only in selected wells 
a participation election is required to be received by the compensation committee of chesapeake s board of directors days prior to the start of a quarter 
their participation is permitted only under the terms outlined in their employment agreements  which  among other things  limit their individual participation to a maximum working interest of in a well and prohibits participation in situations where chesapeake s working interest would be reduced below as a result of their participation 
in october  we sold chesapeake canada corporation  a wholly owned subsidiary  for net proceeds of approximately million 
our ceo and coo each received million related to their fractional ownership interest in these canadian assets  which they acquired and paid for pursuant to the terms of their employment agreements 
the portion of the proceeds allocated to our ceo and coo was based upon the estimated fair values of the assets sold as determined by management and the independent members of our board of directors using a methodology similar to that used by chesapeake for acquisitions of assets from disinterested third parties 
during  and  we paid legal fees of   and  respectively  for legal services provided by a law firm of which a director is a member 
recently issued accounting standards during and  the financial accounting standards board issued the following statements of financial accounting standards which were reviewed by chesapeake to determine the potential impact on our financial statements upon adoption 
in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas is effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december  we adopted this standard during the quarter ended march  and it did not have any impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in november  the fasb issued fasb interpretation  or fin guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantee of indebtedness of others 
fin requires that upon issuance of a guarantee  the guarantor must recognize a liability for the fair value of the obligation it assumes under that guarantee 
fin s provisions for initial recognition and measurement should be applied on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  the guarantor s previous accounting for guarantees that were issued before the date of fin s initial application may not be revised or restated to reflect the effect of the recognition and measurement provisions of the interpretation 
the disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements of both interim and annual periods that end after december  chesapeake is not a guarantor under any significant guarantees and thus this interpretation is not expected to have a significant effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
in january  the fasb issued financial interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of arb no 
fin is an interpretation of accounting research bulletin  consolidated financial statements  and addresses consolidation of variable interest entities vies by business enterprises 
the primary objective of fin is to provide guidance on the identification and financial reporting of entities over which control is achieved through means other than voting rights  such entities are known as vies 
fin requires an enterprise to consolidate a vie if that enterprise has a variable interest that will absorb a majority of the entity s expected losses  receive a majority of the entity s expected residual returns  or both 
an enterprise shall consider the rights and obligations conveyed by its variable interest in making this determination 
at december   chesapeake did not have any entities that would qualify for consolidation in accordance with the provisions of fin  as amended 
therefore  the adoption of fin  as amended  did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in march  the fasb issued sfas no 
 amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas is effective for contracts entered into or modified after june  this statement amends and clarifies financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts collectively referred to as derivatives and for hedging activities under sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
we adopted this standard during the quarter ended september  and it did not have any impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may  and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  this statement establishes new standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within the scope of this statement as a liability because the financial instrument embodies an obligation of the issuer 
this statement applies to certain forms of mandatorily redeemable financial instruments including certain types of preferred stock  written put options and forward contracts 
adoption of this standard did not have any significant impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in december  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin  revenue recognition 
sab revises or rescinds certain guidance included in previously issued staff accounting bulletins in order to make this interpretive guidance consistent with current authoritative accounting and auditing guidance and sec rules and regulations relating to revenue recognition 
this bulletin was effective immediately upon issuance 
chesapeake s current revenue recognition policies comply with sab forward looking statements this report includes forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of forward looking statements give our current expectations or forecasts of future events 
they include statements regarding oil and gas reserve estimates  planned capital expenditures  the drilling of oil and gas wells and future acquisitions  expected oil and gas production  cash flow and anticipated liquidity  business strategy and other plans and objectives for future operations  expected future expenses and utilization of net operating loss carryforwards 
statements concerning the fair values of derivative contracts and their estimated contribution to our future results of operations are based upon market information as of a specific date 
these market prices are subject to significant volatility 
although we believe the expectations and forecasts reflected in these and other forward looking statements are reasonable  we can give no assurance they will prove to have been correct 
they can be affected by inaccurate assumptions or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties 
factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expected results are described under risk factors in item and include the volatility of oil and gas prices  our substantial indebtedness  the strength and financial resources of our competitors  the cost and availability of drilling and production services  our commodity price risk management activities  including counterparty contract performance risk  uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of oil and gas reserves  projecting future rates of production and the timing of development expenditures  our ability to replace reserves  the availability of capital  uncertainties in evaluating oil and gas reserves of acquired properties and associated potential liabilities  declines in the values of our oil and gas properties resulting in ceiling test write downs  drilling and operating risks  our ability to generate future taxable income sufficient to utilize our nols before expiration  future ownership changes which could result in additional limitations to our nols  adverse effects of governmental and environmental regulation  losses possible from pending or future litigation  and the loss of officers or key employees 
we caution you not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements  which speak only as of the date of this report  and we undertake no obligation to update this information 
we urge you to carefully review and consider the disclosures made in this and our other reports filed with the securities and exchange commission that attempt to advise interested parties of the risks and factors that may affect our business 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk oil and gas hedging activities our results of operations and operating cash flows are impacted by changes in market prices for oil and gas 
to mitigate a portion of the exposure to adverse market changes  we have entered into various derivative instruments 
as of december   our oil and gas derivative instruments were comprised of swaps  cap swaps  basis protection swaps and call options 
these instruments allow us to predict with greater certainty the effective oil and gas prices to be received for our hedged production 
although derivatives often fail to achieve effectiveness for accounting purposes  we believe our derivative instruments continue to be highly effective in achieving the risk management objectives for which they were intended 
for swap instruments  we receive a fixed price for the hedged commodity and pay a floating market price  as defined in each instrument  to the counterparty 
the fixed price payment and the floating price payment are netted  resulting in a net amount due to or from the counterparty 
for cap swaps  chesapeake receives a fixed price and pays a floating market price 
the fixed price received by chesapeake includes a premium in exchange for a cap limiting the counterparty s exposure 
in other words  there is no limit to chesapeake s exposure but there is a limit to the downside exposure of the counterparty 
because this derivative includes a written put option ie  the cap  cap swaps do not qualify for designation as cash flow hedges in accordance with sfas since the combination of the hedged item and the written put option do not provide as much potential for favorable cash flows as exposure to unfavorable cash flows 
basis protection swaps are arrangements that guarantee a price differential of oil or gas from a specified delivery point 
chesapeake receives a payment from the counterparty if the price differential is greater than the stated terms of the contract and pays the counterparty if the price differential is less than the stated terms of the contract 
for call options  chesapeake receives a cash premium from the counterparty in exchange for the sale of a call option 
if the floating price exceeds the fixed price of the call option  then chesapeake pays the counterparty such excess 
if the floating price settles below the fixed price of the call option  no payment is due from chesapeake 
chesapeake enters into counter swaps from time to time for the purpose of locking in the value of a swap 
under the counter swap  chesapeake receives a floating price for the hedged commodity and pays a fixed price to the counterparty 
the counter swap is effective in locking in the value of a swap since subsequent changes in the market value of the swap are entirely offset by subsequent changes in the market value of the counter swap 
we refer to this locked in value as a locked swap 
at the time chesapeake enters into a counter swap  chesapeake removes the original swap s designation as a cash flow hedge and classifies the original swap as a non qualifying hedge under sfas the reason for this new designation is that collectively the swap and the counter swap no longer hedge the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows 
instead  the swap and counter swap effectively lock in a specific gain or loss that will be unaffected by subsequent variability in oil and gas prices 
any locked in gain or loss is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and reclassified to oil and gas sales in the month of related production 
in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
 chesapeake nets the value of its derivative arrangements with the same counterparty in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets  to the extent that a legal right of set off exists 
gains or losses from derivative transactions are reflected as adjustments to oil and gas sales on the consolidated statements of operations 
pursuant to sfas  certain derivatives do not qualify for designation as cash flow hedges 
changes in the fair value of these non qualifying derivatives that occur prior to their maturity ie  temporary fluctuations in value are reported currently in the consolidated statements of operations as unrealized gains losses within oil and gas sales 
unrealized gains losses included in oil and gas sales in  and were million  million and million  respectively 
following provisions of sfas  changes in the fair value of derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges  to the extent they are effective in offsetting cash flows attributable to the hedged risk  are recorded in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
any change in fair value resulting from ineffectiveness is recognized currently in oil and gas sales 
we recorded a gain loss on ineffectiveness of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
as of december   we had the following open oil and gas derivative instruments designed to hedge a portion of our oil and gas production for periods after december volume weighted average strike price weighted average put strike price weighted average call strike price weighted average differential sfas hedge premiums received fair value at december  in thousands natural gas mmbtu swaps  yes   yes   yes  yes  basis protection swaps  no   no   no   no   no   no  cap swaps  no   no   no  call options  no   locked swaps no  total gas oil bbls cap swaps  no  total oil total gas and oil we have established the fair value of all derivative instruments using estimates of fair value reported by our counterparties and subsequently evaluated internally using established index prices and other sources 
the actual contribution to our future results of operations will be based on the market prices at the time of settlement and may be more or less than the fair value estimates used at december  based upon the market prices at december   we expect to transfer approximately million of loss included in the balance in accumulated other comprehensive income to earnings during the next months when the transactions actually occur 
all transactions hedged as of december  are expected to mature by december   with the exception of the basis protection swaps which extend through additional information concerning the fair value of our oil and gas derivative instruments is as follows december  in thousands fair value of contracts outstanding  beginning of year change in fair value of contracts during the period contracts realized or otherwise settled during the period fair value of new contracts when entered into during the period fair value of contracts when closed during the period fair value of contracts outstanding  end of year the change in the fair value of our derivative instruments since january  resulted from an increase in market prices for natural gas and crude oil relative to the hedged price 
derivative instruments reflected as current in the consolidated balance sheet represent the estimated fair value of derivative instrument settlements scheduled to occur over the subsequent twelve month period based on market prices for oil and gas as of the consolidated balance sheet date 
the derivative settlement amounts are not due and payable until the month in which the related underlying hedged transaction occurs 
interest rate risk the table below presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 
the fair value of the fixed rate long term debt has been estimated based on quoted market prices 
years of maturity thereafter total fair value in millions liabilities long term debt  including current portion fixed rate average interest rate this amount does not include the discount included in long term debt of million  the effect of interest rate swaps of million and the effect of the swaption of million 
changes in interest rates affect the amount of interest we earn on our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments and the interest rate we pay on borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
all of our other long term indebtedness is fixed rate and therefore does not expose us to the risk of earnings or cash flow loss due to changes in market interest rates 
however  changes in interest rates do affect the fair value of our debt 
interest rate hedging we also utilize hedging strategies to manage the exposure our fixed rate senior notes have to interest rate changes 
by entering into interest rate swaps  we convert a portion of our fixed rate debt to floating rate debt 
to the extent the interest rate swaps have been designated as fair value hedges  changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument and the corresponding debt are reflected as adjustments to interest expense in the corresponding months covered by the derivative agreement

since the inception of the swaption  we have recorded a change in the fair market value of the swaption from a million liability to a million liability  an increase of million 
we have recorded as additional interest expense million to reflect ineffectiveness after giving effect to the removal of the designation of a portion of the swaption as a fair value hedge under sfas as described previously 
on february   chesapeake and the counterparty agreed to extend the counterparty s right to require chesapeake to settle the transaction on march  to april  on march   the counterparty exercised its option to enter into the interest rate swap effective march  on april  and each succeeding march  the counterparty may elect to terminate the swap and cause it to be settled at the then current value of the interest rate swap 
we may elect to terminate the swap and cause it to be settled at the then current value of the interest rate swap at any time during the term of the swap 
cash payments related to the interest rate swap  if initiated  or as a result of cash settlement at termination  will be recorded as adjustments to interest expense
