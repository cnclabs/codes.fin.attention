item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations all comparisons under this heading among   and refer to the week period ended october   and to the week periods ended september   and september   respectively  unless otherwise indicated 
the company acquired qdoba restaurant corporation qdoba  operator and franchisor of qdoba mexican grill  on january  qdoba s operations are included since the date of acquisition  which includes weeks of operations in fiscal year restatement of prior financial information following the review of the accounting adjustments cited in a november   form k filing by cke restaurants  inc  and after discussions with the company s independent auditors  kpmg llp  the company determined on december  that one item  related to the treatment of lease accounting and leasehold depreciation  applied to the company  and that it is appropriate to adjust certain prior financial statements 
the resulting adjustments are all non cash and have no material impact on the company s cash flows  cash position  revenues  same store sales  earnings from operations plus depreciation and amortization  or the company s compliance with the covenants under its senior credit facility 
these adjustments were not attributable to any material non compliance by the company  as a result of any misconduct  with any financial reporting requirements under securities laws  and the company believes there will not be any further adjustments as a result of its internal review of this matter 
the issue requiring restatement relates to the company s historical accounting practice of depreciating its buildings on leased land  leasehold improvements  and certain intangible assets  over a period that included both the initial term of the lease and its option periods or the useful life of the asset  if shorter 
concurrently  the company has used the initial lease term in determining whether each of its leases was an operating lease or a capital lease and in calculating its straight line rent expense 
the company believed that these longstanding accounting treatments were appropriate under generally accepted accounting principles 
however  after noting the k filing of cke restaurants  inc  and following discussions with kpmg llp  the company has now interpreted the authoritative accounting literature to require that the company use the same lease term for depreciating buildings on leased land  leasehold improvements and certain intangible assets as it uses in determining capital versus operating leases and calculating straight line rent expense 
accordingly  the company has adopted the following policy management will generally limit the depreciable lives for its buildings on leased land  leasehold improvements and certain intangible assets  which are subject to a lease  to the initial lease term 
however  in circumstances where the company would incur an economic penalty by not exercising one or more option periods  the company may include one or more option periods when determining the depreciation period 
in either circumstance  the company s policy requires consistency when calculating the depreciation period  in classifying the lease  and in computing straight line rent expense 
as a result of this change  the company s financial results have been adjusted as follows dollars in thousands  except per share data fiscal year beg 
retained diluted diluted diluted end 
retained earnings earnings eps earnings eps earnings eps earnings as reported adjustments to depreciation amortization  net of taxes as restated as reported in the company s fiscal earnings release dated november  the company expects that in future years  depreciation and amortization expense will increase by approximately million per year assuming stable levels of capital expenditures going forward 
the following management s discussion and analysis takes into account the effects of these adjustments 

table of contents overview as of october   jack in the box inc the company owned  operated and franchised  jack in the box quick service restaurants and qdoba mexican grill qdoba fast casual restaurants  primarily in the western and southern united states

the company also derives revenue from distribution sales to jack in the box and qdoba franchises  retail sales from fuel and convenience stores quick stuff  royalties from franchised restaurants  rents from real estate leased to certain franchisees  franchise fees  and the sale of company operated restaurants to franchisees 
the quick serve restaurant industry has become more complex and challenging in recent years 
challenges presently facing the sector include higher levels of consumer expectations  intense competition with respect to market share  restaurant locations  labor  and menu and product development  the emergence of a new fast casual restaurant segment  changes in the economy and trends for healthier eating 
to address these challenges and others  and support our goal of transitioning to a national restaurant company  management has developed a two part strategic plan centered around reinvention of the jack in the box brand and multifaceted growth

the following summarizes the most significant events occurring in fiscal year increase in company operated restaurant sales 
quality improvements to our menu and new product innovations have contributed to increased sales trends 
in  same store sales at jack in the box company operated restaurants increased compared with a decrease of in restaurant operating margin 
fiscal year restaurant operating margin improved to of sales from in  primarily due to control of labor  restaurant managed costs  and occupancy costs resulting in part from profit improvement program initiatives  as well as additional leverage on higher sales  which more than offset higher food costs 
refinancing transaction 
in the first quarter of fiscal year  we secured new financing intended to provide a more flexible capital structure  facilitate the execution of our strategic plan  and decrease borrowing costs 
in connection with the refinancing  we recorded a million charge to interest expense for the early retirement of debt 
in addition to providing us with a more flexible capital structure  this refinancing transaction is expected to lower our borrowing costs over the life of our new term loan 
credit facility amendment 
in the third quarter of fiscal year  we amended the million term loan portion of our credit facility to achieve an approximate basis point reduction in our borrowing rate over the term of the loan 
fees paid in association with the repricing were customary for such arrangements of this type and were not material 
purchase option 
during fiscal year  we exercised our purchase options under certain lease agreements and acquired approximately jack in the box restaurant properties 
by year end  we had subsequently sold and leased back most of these properties  at more favorable rates 
brand reinvention progress 
our initiative to reinvent the jack in the box brand is bringing higher quality products to our menu  better and more consistent guest service and re imaged restaurant facilities 
a new fast casual restaurant concept also emerged from our brand reinvention efforts

the percentage decrease in compared with primarily relates to effective management of labor  restaurant managed costs  and occupancy costs  resulting from profit improvement program initiatives  as well as additional leverage on higher sales 
the percentage increase in compared with  is primarily due to higher workers compensation insurance expenses  utilities  costs related to our new point of sale system  and reduced leverage from lower psa sales 
in  these cost increases were partially offset by reductions in incentive compensation and intangibles amortization expense attributable to the reclassification of our trading area rights to goodwill  which is no longer amortized per the provisions of sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets

fiscal year includes an unusual pre tax charge of million related to the assumption of certain lease obligations arising from the recent bankruptcy of the chi chi s restaurant chain  which was previously owned by the company 
the company anticipates it will not incur any additional charges related to the chi chi s bankruptcy in future years 
fiscal year also includes charges of million to settle a class action lawsuit in california  and million for impairment and lease exit costs related to the closure of eight under performing restaurants 
excluding these aforementioned charges  which were and of revenues in and  respectively  selling  general and administrative expenses were approximately of revenues in  in the company believes it is useful to provide the impact that these items in and had on selling  general and administrative expenses because it facilitates more relevant comparisons to prior period financial results and to the results of the company s competitors 
interest expense was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
in  the increase in interest expense primarily relates to the refinancing of the company s term loan and the early redemption of its senior subordinated notes  which resulted in a million charge for the payment of a call premium and the write off of deferred financing fees 
this charge was partially offset by favorable interest rates from the refinancing and subsequent repricing of the company s credit facility in interest expense in compared with includes costs associated with the early retirement of our higher interest rate financing lease obligations  the amortization of fees associated with the company s refinancing in january  and an increase in total debt  primarily due to the acquisition of qdoba

the company believes it is useful to provide the impact that the unusual items in each year had on net earnings and earnings per share amounts because it facilitates more relevant comparisons to prior period financial results and to the results of the company s competitors 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources general 
cash and cash equivalents increased million to million at october  from million at the beginning of the fiscal year  primarily due to strong operating cash flows  payments from franchisees on notes receivable  reduced working capital requirements  and proceeds from sales of restaurants to franchisees 
we generally reinvest available cash flows from operations to develop new or enhance existing restaurants  to reduce borrowings under the revolving credit agreement  as well as to repurchase shares of our common stock 
financial condition 
the company and the restaurant industry in general  maintain relatively low levels of accounts receivable and inventories  and vendors grant trade credit for purchases such as food and supplies 
we also continually invest in our business through the addition of new units and refurbishment of existing units  which are reflected as long term assets and not as part of working capital 
as a result  we typically maintain a working capital deficit  which was million at october  our current ratio increased to to at october  compared with to at september   primarily reflecting an increase in cash flow as discussed above 
new financing 
on january   we secured a new senior term loan and amended our revolving credit facility  each with extended maturities 
our new financing is intended to provide a more flexible capital structure  facilitate the execution of our strategic plan  and decrease borrowing costs 
furthermore  the new term loan provides for a more favorable repayment schedule set at per year for the first years of the year term 
during the third quarter  we amended the term loan portion of our credit facility  to achieve an approximate basis point reduction in our borrowing rate over the loan term 
fees paid in connection with the repricing were customary for such arrangements of this type and not material 
our credit facility  as amended  provides borrowings in the aggregate amount of million and is comprised of i a million revolving credit facility maturing on january   and ii a million term loan maturing on january   both with a rate of london interbank offered rate libor plus 
the credit facility requires the payment of an annual commitment fee based on the unused portion of the credit facility 
the annual commitment rate and the credit facility s interest rates are based on a financial leverage ratio  as defined in the credit agreement 
to secure our respective obligations under the credit facility  the company and certain of its subsidiaries granted liens in substantially all personal property assets 
under certain circumstances  the company and each of its certain subsidiaries will be required to grant liens in certain real property assets to secure their respective obligations under the new credit facility 
additionally  certain of our real and personal property secure other indebtedness of the company 
at october   we had no borrowings under our revolving credit facility and had letters of credit outstanding of million 
we used the proceeds from the new term loan to refinance our existing million term loan and redeem million of senior subordinated notes due april   which resulted in a pre tax charge to interest expense of million 
the amended revolving credit facility is intended to support general corporate purposes 
we are subject to a number of covenants under our various debt instruments  including limitations on additional borrowings  acquisitions  loans to franchisees  capital expenditures  lease commitments and dividend payments  as well as requirements to maintain certain financial ratios  cash flows and net worth 
solely as a result of the restatements as described under restatement of prior financial information  the company had a technical non compliance with one non financial covenant in its credit facility 
the company requested and received the appropriate waiver to cure the technical violation and  as a result of filing the restated financial statements  was in compliance with all debt covenants 
total debt outstanding increased slightly to million at october  from million at the beginning of the fiscal year  primarily due to an increase in capital lease obligations associated with new restaurant equipment leases 
other transactions 
during fiscal year  we exercised our purchase option under certain lease arrangements and purchased approximately jack in the box restaurant properties 
by year end  we had subsequently sold and leased back most of these properties at more favorable rental rates 
in january  we entered into financing lease arrangements with two limited partnerships that related to restaurants 
at the inception of the financing lease arrangements  we recorded cash and cash held in trust  and established financing lease obligations of approximately million requiring semi annual payments to cover interest and sinking fund obligations due in equal installments on january  and november  in 
table of contents january  we paid a million fee to retire the debt early 
the fee was charged to interest expense in the first quarter of fiscal year when the obligations were retired 
we used borrowings under our credit facility and previous sinking fund payments to reacquire the interests in the restaurant properties and retire the high interest rate bearing financing lease obligations 
sale of company operated restaurants 
during the last three years we have continued our strategy of selectively selling company operated restaurants to franchisees  selling   and restaurants in   and  respectively 
proceeds from the sale of company operated restaurants and collections on notes receivable  primarily related to such sales  were million  million and million  respectively 
share repurchases 
in fiscal years and  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of our outstanding common stock in the open market 
under these authorizations  the company repurchased   and  shares of jack in the box common stock at a cost of million  million and million during fiscal years  and  respectively 
as of october  we had million of repurchase availability remaining under the authorization  which was fully utilized by october  these stock repurchase programs were intended to increase shareholder value and offset the dilutive effect of stock option exercises 
acquisition 
on january   we acquired qdoba  operator and franchiser of qdoba mexican grill  for approximately million in cash 
the primary assets acquired include million in net property and equipment and other long term assets  million in intangible assets and million in goodwill 
qdoba operates in the fast casual segment of the restaurant industry and  as of october   operated or franchised restaurants in states 
this acquisition is consistent with the company s long term strategy to transition from a regional quick service restaurant chain to a national restaurant company 
contractual obligations and commitments

capital expenditures 
capital expenditures  including capital lease obligations  were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
cash flows used for additions to property and equipment were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the increase in cash flows utilized in compared with related primarily to a decision to finance the new innovation center utilizing the company s operating cash flows instead of through a sale and leaseback transaction 
increases in jack in the box restaurant improvements and qdoba capital expenditures  primarily related to new company operated restaurants  also contributed to the overall increase  but to a lesser extent 
in  a decrease in new site development resulted in the decline in capital expenditures compared with 
table of contents in fiscal year  capital expenditures are expected to be million to million 
we plan to open a moderate number of new jack in the box restaurants  and under our brand reinvention strategy  plan to upgrade approximately of our restaurant facilities to create a unique new look for jack in the box restaurants at a cost of approximately  per restaurant 
we also plan to expand our jbx grill test  if successful  to dallas by the end of the fiscal pension funding 
during  we elected to contribute million to our qualified defined benefit pension plans from available cash on hand  compared with million in and million in the additional funding contribution in was determined based on an annual actuarial review of the plans and was intended to fully fund the qualified plans accumulated benefit obligation at the measurement date 
future liquidity 
we require capital principally to grow the business through new restaurant construction  as well as to maintain  improve and refurbish existing restaurants  and for general operating purposes 
our primary short term and long term sources of liquidity are expected to be cash flows from operations  the revolving bank credit facility  and the sale and leaseback of certain restaurant properties 
additional potential sources of liquidity include the sale of company operated restaurants to franchisees 
based upon current levels of operations and anticipated growth  we expect that cash flows from operations  combined with other financing alternatives in place or available  will be sufficient to meet debt service  capital expenditure and working capital requirements 
discussion of critical accounting policies we have identified the following as the company s most critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results and require management s most subjective and complex judgments 
information regarding the company s other significant accounting policies are disclosed in note of our consolidated financial statements 
pension benefits the company sponsors pension and other retirement plans in various forms covering those employees who meet certain eligibility requirements 
several statistical and other factors which attempt to anticipate future events are used in calculating the expense and liability related to the plans  including assumptions about the discount rate  expected return on plan assets and the rate of increase in compensation levels  as determined by the company using specified guidelines 
in addition  our outside actuarial consultants also use certain statistical factors such as turnover  retirement and mortality rates to estimate the company s future benefit obligations 
the actuarial assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower turnover and retirement rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants 
these differences may impact the amount of pension expense recorded by the company 
due principally to fiscal company contributions  as well as increases in interest rates and in the return on plan assets  the pension expense in fiscal year is expected to approximate fiscal year pension expense 
self insurance the company is self insured for a portion of its current and prior years losses related to its workers compensation  general liability  automotive  medical and dental programs 
in estimating the company s self insurance reserves  we utilize independent actuarial estimates of expected losses  which are based on statistical analyses of historical data 
these assumptions are closely monitored and adjusted when warranted by changing circumstances 
should a greater amount of claims occur compared to what was estimated  or medical costs increase beyond what was expected  reserves might not be sufficient  and additional expense may be recorded 
while medical and dental costs are anticipated to increase very modestly in fiscal year  related to the new health care coverage being offered to all crew members  we expect these cost increases to be offset by savings realized from reduced crew turnover 

table of contents long lived assets property  equipment and certain other assets  including amortized intangible assets  are reviewed for impairment when indicators of impairment are present 
this review includes a market level analysis and evaluations of restaurant operating performance from operations and marketing management 
when indicators of impairment are present  we perform an impairment analysis on a restaurant by restaurant basis 
if the sum of undiscounted future cash flows is less than the net carrying value of the asset  we recognize an impairment loss by the amount which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset 
our estimates of future cash flows may differ from actual cash flows due to  among other things  economic conditions or changes in operating performance 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we recorded impairment charges totaling approximately million related to eight under performing restaurants scheduled for closure in fiscal year in fiscal  we recorded an immaterial impairment charge related to four restaurants we intend to close in upon the expiration of their leases 
during  we noted no other indicators of impairment of our long lived assets 
goodwill and other intangibles we also evaluate goodwill and intangible assets not subject to amortization annually  or more frequently if indicators of impairment are present 
if the determined fair values of these assets are less than the related carrying amounts an impairment loss is recognized 
the methods we use to estimate fair value include future cash flow assumptions  which may differ from actual cash flows due to  among other things  economic conditions or changes in operating performance 
during the fourth quarter of  we reviewed the carrying value of our goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets and determined that no impairment existed as of october  allowances for doubtful accounts our trade receivables consist primarily of amounts due from franchisees for rents on subleased sites  royalties and distribution sales 
we also have receivables related to short term financing provided on the sale of company operated restaurants to certain qualified franchisees 
we continually monitor amounts due from franchisees and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our franchisees to make required payments 
this estimate is based on our assessment of the collectibility of specific franchisee accounts  as well as a general allowance based on historical trends  the financial condition of our franchisees  consideration of the general economy and the aging of such receivables 
the company has good relationships with its franchisees and high collection rates  however  if the future financial condition of our franchisees were to deteriorate  resulting in their inability to make specific required payments  additions to the allowance for doubtful accounts may be required 
legal accruals the company is subject to claims and lawsuits in the ordinary course of its business 
a determination of the amount accrued  if any  for these contingencies is made after analysis of each matter 
we continually evaluate such accruals and may increase or decrease accrued amounts as we deem appropriate 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary exposure relating to financial instruments is to changes in interest rates 
our credit facility  which is comprised of a revolving credit facility and a term loan  bears interest at an annual rate equal to the prime rate or the libor plus an applicable margin based on a financial leverage ratio 
the majority of the credit facility borrowings are libor based 
as of october   our applicable margins for the libor based revolving loans and term loan were set at 
a hypothetical one percent increase in short term interest rates  based on the outstanding balance of our revolving credit facility and term loan at october   would result in an estimated increase of million in annual interest expense 
changes in interest rates also impact our pension expense  as do changes in the expected long term rate of return on our pension plan assets 
an assumed discount rate is used in determining the present value of future cash outflows currently expected to be required to satisfy the pension benefit obligation when due 
additionally  an assumed long term rate of return on plan assets is used in determining the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide the benefits to meet our projected benefit obligation 
a hypothetical basis point reduction in the assumed discount rate and expected long term rate of return on plan assets would result in an estimated increase of million and million  respectively  in our future annual pension expense 
we are also exposed to the impact of commodity and utility price fluctuations related to unpredictable factors such as weather and various other market conditions outside our control 
our ability to recover increased costs through higher prices is limited by the competitive environment in which we operate 
from time to time we enter into futures and option contracts to manage these fluctuations 
open futures and option contracts at october  were not significant 
at october   we had no other material financial instruments subject to significant market exposure
