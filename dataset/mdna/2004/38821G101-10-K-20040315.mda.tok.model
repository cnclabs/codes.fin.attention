item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion is intended to assist you in understanding our financial position as of december  and  and our results of operations for each of the years in the three year period ended december  this discussion should be read with our consolidated financial statements and their notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the discussion of our results of operations and financial condition contains statements relating to our future results  including certain projections and trends  which constitute forward looking statements 
certain risks and uncertainties may cause actual results to be materially different from projected results contained in these forward looking statements and other disclosures 
these risks and uncertainties are more fully described under forward looking statements and exposures below 
as used herein  unless otherwise required by the context  the term grant prideco refers to grant prideco  inc and the terms we  our  and similar words refer to grant prideco and its subsidiaries 
the use herein of such terms as group  organization  we  us  our and its  or references to specific entities  are not intended to be a precise description of corporate relationships 
general we are the world leader in drill stem technology development and drill pipe manufacturing  sales and service  a global leader in drill bit technology  manufacturing  sales and service  and a leading provider of high performance engineered connections and premium tubular products and services 
we operate primarily through four business segments drilling products and services  drill bits  tubular technology and services  and marine products and services 
our drill bits segment is comprised entirely of reedhycalog  which we purchased from schlumberger on december  market trends and outlook our business is materially dependent on the level of oil and gas drilling activity worldwide  which  in turn  depends on the level of capital spending by major  independent  and state owned exploration and production companies 
this capital spending is driven by current prices for oil and gas and the perceived stability and sustainability of those prices 
all of our business segments generally track the level of domestic and international drilling activity  however their revenues  cash flows  and profitability follow the rig count at different stages within the market cycles 
drill pipe demand is also a function of customer inventory levels and typically lags changes in the worldwide rig count until customers no longer have sufficient inventory to sustain current and near term expected future activity 
drill bit demand and our drill bits segment s earnings and cash flows have closely tracked the worldwide rig count 
results from our tubular technology and services segment generally follows changes in north american offshore  deep drilling  natural gas rig counts  but short term demand is also affected by inventories held by octg distributors 
demand for our marine products and services generally follows the level of offshore and deepwater drilling activity which  although dependent upon prices for oil and gas  is less likely to follow short term changes in oil and gas prices as these projects are more capital intensive and are typically based upon long term forecasts for oil and gas prices 
during the three year period ended december   the revenues  profitability  and cash flows from each of our business segments have been significantly impacted by changes in oil and gas prices and rig counts  which were highly volatile during this period 
the following table sets forth certain information with respect to oil and gas prices at the dates indicated and the north american us and canadian and international rig counts for the periods reflected year ended december  wti oil a average ending henry hub gas b average ending north american rig count c average    ending    international rig count c average ending a price per barrel of west texas intermediate wti crude as of the dates presented above

b price per mmbtu as of the dates presented above

c source baker hughes rig count excludes onshore china and russia 
future market trends and expectations looking forward  we anticipate that our results will be based on the level of drilling activity and our customers views regarding the sustainability of that activity 
these perceptions  in turn  will depend on their views regarding the sustainability of oil and natural gas prices 
commodity prices have been particularly strong during the first few months of  and this has resulted in some increased drilling activity 
we expect this higher activity to result in strong revenues from our drill bits segment  however  these higher activity levels have not translated into the level of increased demand historically experienced by our drilling products and services and our tubular technology and services segments due to drill pipe inventory levels held by our customers and octg inventories held by our distributors 
as a result  any ultimate increase in activity for these segments  as well as the timing of such recovery  is difficult to predict 
in addition  our tubular technology and services segment is particularly influenced by the gulf of mexico rig count  which has remained flat 
our future results also could be affected by recent changes in steel prices  which have significantly increased since the end of  caused primarily by significant increases in the prices paid by our suppliers for scrap and coke utilized in their operations 
as a result  our costs for tubulars utilized to manufacture tool joints  drill collars  and heavy weight drill pipe have increased 
in addition  rising steel costs could offset some of the projected benefits from our vertical integration in china 
our partner in our austrian joint venture also is seeking to renegotiate its supply contract for billets to our voest alpine affiliate 
although we intend to increase the prices that we charge to our customers to pass along any cost increases borne by us as a result of these recent changes in steel prices  there is no assurance that we will be able to successfully accomplish this in all regions in which we operate 
to the extent we are unable to do so  our results of operations would be adversely affected 
when planning our operations for  we relied on various assumptions including little improvement in drilling activity or drill pipe demand 
as a result  we have forecasted that we would again sell less drill pipe than consumed by our customer base in as they continue to draw down their inventories of these items 
we have also forecasted productivity improvements resulting from our manufacturing rationalization project being executed in early and cost reductions from vertical integration in china 
these improvements will be partially offset by increased expenses from inflation and the strengthening euro 
our assumptions and estimates regarding future earnings are considered forward looking statements and are subject to the risks and uncertainties inherent in such statements  including those summarized under forward looking statements and exposures beginning on page of this report 
using these assumptions  we expect to earn between and per share during before any severance charges associated with our manufacturing rationalization or other unusual  unknown  or special items

 goodwill and other intangible assets effective january  consolidated operating income was million in  compared to million in  including other charges mentioned above 
other operating expense sales and marketing  general and administrative  and research and engineering as a percentage of revenue increased from in to in this increase relates primarily to our drill bits segment  which has a significant worldwide sales and marketing infrastructure and an extensive research and engineering program 
drilling products and services our drilling products and services segment revenues decreased million  or  in as compared to and operating income decreased million  or  for the same period 
included in operating income were fixed asset write downs of million related to our decision to consolidate our drill stem manufacturing operations based upon a rationalization study that was completed during the fourth quarter of included in operating income were fixed asset write downs of million related to efficiency and automation initiatives primarily at our operations located in mexico 
operating margin of in was down from in including charges 
during  drill pipe footage sold increased million feet  from million feet sold to million feet sold when compared to  and average sales price per foot decreased by 
the decrease in price reflects a shift in product mix from higher margin  large diameter  drilling products to lower margin  small diameter  drilling products 
also contributing to the decrease in revenues are decreased sales of tool joints and heavy weight drill pipe in these decreases are partially offset by incremental revenues for related to the majority purchase of jiangsu shuguang grant prideco tubular limited jsg in march drill bits on december   we acquired reedhycalog  which comprises our drill bits segment 
our drill bits segment reported revenues of million in as compared to million in operating income was million in  which includes million of transition costs related to the integration of reedhycalog  and the operating income margin was as compared to operating income of million and operating margin of in reedhycalog s results have strengthened throughout the year reflecting worldwide sales increases and successful market penetration of our new trex fixed cutter bit

included in operating income was a million inventory reserve charge to reflect the estimated realizable value of inventory of exited tubing product lines 
included in operating income was a charge of million related to idled fixed assets 
these revenue and operating income decreases reflect the impact of exiting the tubing product lines  starting in the first quarter of  as well as decreased premium threading and tubular processing activities 
the results also include incremental revenues and operating income related to our grey mak business that was acquired in september marine products and services our marine products and services segment revenues decreased million in as compared to and operating income decreased million  or for the same period 
operating margin of in was down from in these decreases were due primarily to the sales of our rotator subsidiary in september and our petrodrive product line in december  which were partially offset by increased sales by our xl systems product line 
operating income decreased at a greater percentage than revenues as a result of increased research and development expenses and a shift in product mix toward lower margin business 
other operations our other segment included our industrial drill pipe operations and our construction casing and water well operations 
we exited the industrial drill pipe business in the second quarter of and the construction casing and water well business with the sale of our star iron works subsidiary in the first quarter of in  we moved our joint ventures relating to pos grip technology from our marine products and services segment to our other segment 
prior periods have been restated to reflect this change 
during the first quarter of  we sold to our partner our rights to pos grip technology for jack up exploration applications and have granted our partner an option to purchase our rights to pos grip technology for subsea applications 
our other segments revenues decreased million  or  in as compared to  and operating loss increased million for the same period 
included in the operating loss are charges totaling million  which consisted of an inventory reserve charge of million to reflect the estimated realizable value of inventory for the exited industrial drill pipe product lines and asset impairments of million related to two technology joint ventures 
corporate corporate general and administrative expenses for were million compared to million in included in corporate expenses was a charge of million related to severance 
excluding this charge  corporate expenses increased due primarily to higher incentive and business development costs in as a percentage of revenues  corporate expenses remained relatively flat as a percentage of revenues in and other items our interest expense was million in compared to million in this increase was due to new debt related to the reedhycalog acquisition in december we issued million senior notes due and entered into a new senior credit facility  which includes a million term loan 
see liquidity and capital resources for further discussion of the senior credit facility 
other  net increased million in as compared to this increase relates to a million gain from favorably renegotiating a liability to our former parent  a gain on the sale of businesses of million  along with favorable foreign exchange fluctuation in these increases were partially offset by transition costs in of million associated with the reedhycalog integration 
our equity income loss decreased to an equity loss of million in from equity income of million in this decrease was primarily related to a decrease in equity income contributed by voest alpine of million due to decreased activity 
the remaining decrease relates to our equity method investments in g pex and intelliserv that have increased costs related to the continued development of their products in  coupled with equity income in related to jsg before our majority interest purchase in march our effective tax rate in was as compared to in this expected increase in the effective tax rate was due to higher foreign earnings in related to the reedhycalog acquisition  partially offset by the favorable renegotiation of a liability with our former parent 
year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the following table summarizes the results of the company in thousands twelve months ended december  revenues drilling products and services   drill bits  tubular technology and services   marine products and services   other   total revenues   operating income loss drilling products and services  a b c  d drill bits tubular technology and services  a  d marine products and services  a c  other  a c  corporate  c  e total operating income   a includes other charges of million related to inventory write offs and capitalized manufacturing variance write offs which were classified as cost of sales 
of these charges  million related to drilling products and services  million related to tubular technology and services  million related to marine products and services  and million related to our other segment 
b includes other charges of million to write off assets 
in connection with our operational review conducted in  we reassessed the viability of restructuring our relationship with octl in india and determined that a continued relationship was no longer viable 
as a result of this determination  we wrote off the remaining million of unpaid receivables and advances owed to us by octl 
also includes fixed asset write downs of million related to our decision to discontinue the manufacturing of industrial flanges 
c includes other charges of million related to severance of executive  manufacturing  and marketing employees terminated in connection with the restructuring plan that was implemented in the first quarter of the total number of employees severed was  and the amount accrued for severance was based upon the positions eliminated and our severance policy 
of these charges  million related to corporate  million related to marine products and services  and less than million related to both drilling products and services and our other segment 
d includes other charges of million  million in drilling products and services and million in tubular technology and services  related to fixed asset write downs for idle assets that were taken out of service pursuant to our ongoing automation and efficiency initiatives and were classified as held for sale 
the amount was determined by use of internal appraisals and evaluations to assess the net realizable value upon disposal based on expected future cash flows 
e includes other charges of million related to an executive employee terminated in june net income for the year ended december   after cumulative effect of accounting change of million  net of tax  was million per share on revenues of million  compared to million per share on revenues of million for the same period in during both and  our results of operations and earnings were affected by the various other charges along with reedhycalog acquisition expenses of million in in addition  we adopted the new goodwill accounting standard  which ceased the amortization of goodwill  as of january  goodwill amortization for the year ended december  was million and is included in general and administrative expenses 
drilling products and services our drilling products and services segment revenues decreased million  or  in as compared to and operating income increased million  or  in the same period 
included in operating income were charges of million related to our efficiency and automation initiatives primarily at our operations located in mexico 
included in operating income were million of inventory write offs and capitalized manufacturing variances and goodwill amortization of million 
the decrease in revenues was due primarily to a decline in the average north american rig count  and the resulting overall weak demand for our drill stem products 
however  the decrease in demand was partially offset by an increase in average pricing for drill pipe in due to a sales mix improvement toward international and offshore markets  which tend to purchase our higher priced  more technologically advanced products  coupled with an overall price increase implemented in drill bits since we acquired reedhycalog on december   its contributions were minimal since we reflect only days of activity during tubular technology and services our tubular technology and services segment revenues decreased million  or  in as compared to and operating income decreased million  or  for the same period 
included in operating income were fixed asset write downs of million related to assets held for sale 
included in operating income were million of inventory write offs and capitalized manufacturing variances 
revenues and operating income were negatively affected by a decline in the us natural gas rig count when compared to the same period last year and octg distributors purchasing at low levels in light of the weak and uncertain market conditions 
the decrease in operating income also reflects unabsorbed manufacturing costs incurred to maintain capacity for an expected industry upturn 
marine products and services our marine products and services segment revenues increased million  or  in as compared to and reported operating income of million in as compared to an operating loss of million in included in the operating loss were charges of million related to inventory write offs  capitalized manufacturing variances  and severance  and goodwill amortization of million 
in the first quarter of  we began to strengthen our xl systems products and services sales force  consolidated certain offshore selling activities  and began to build a broader product line 
additionally  in the fourth quarter of  we added a new management team 
these actions  coupled with the acquisition of our rotator subsidiary in the second quarter of  resulted in increased revenues for this segment despite the decrease in the us offshore rig count 
this segment s sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses increased as a percentage of revenues from in to in this increase was due to increased operating expenses associated with our rotator acquisition coupled with costs incurred to develop infrastructure for future growth of this segment 
other our other segment revenues decreased million  or  in as compared to and its operating loss decreased million  from an operating loss of million in to an operating loss of million in included in the operating loss are charges of million related to inventory write offs  capitalized manufacturing variances  and severance and goodwill amortization of million 
the decrease in revenues was from our industrial drill pipe operations due to decreased activity levels related to depressed fiber optic installation and construction markets 
the decrease in operating loss  excluding charges  was due to efficiencies obtained from organizational restructurings that took place in the first quarter of corporate our corporate general and administrative expenses were flat as a percentage of revenues at of revenues in and other items our interest expense of million in was flat when compared to our equity income decreased million in when compared to this decrease primarily relates to a decrease in equity income contributed by our investment in voest alpine coupled with an increase in equity losses related to development of our intelliserv joint venture 
our effective tax rate in was as compared to in this decrease in the effective tax rate for is due primarily to the effects of ceasing goodwill amortization effective january  liquidity and capital resources our liquidity depends upon our cash flow from operations  the level of availability under our senior credit facility and our ability to raise capital from third parties 
during  we reduced our borrowings under our credit facilities and increased our borrowing capacity 
as a result of these improvements  along with our financing completed in connection with the reedhycalog acquisition in december  we believe we have significantly improved our liquidity position and that we are well positioned to not only take full advantage of upturns in the market for our products and services  but to maintain our businesses and take advantage of opportunities even in the event of any downturns 
at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million  working capital of million  and unused borrowing availability of million under our revolving credit facility  compared to cash and cash equivalents of million  working capital of million and unused borrowing availability under our revolving credit facility of million at december  the following table summarizes our cash flows provided by operating activities  net cash used in investing activities  and net cash provided by financing activities for the periods presented year ended december  in thousands net cash provided by operating activities    net cash used in investing activities    net cash provided by used in financing activities    operating activities our net cash flow provided by operating activities decreased by million in as compared to cash flow before changes in operating assets and liabilities increased by million  which was offset by a use of cash of million related to net increases in operating assets and liabilities primarily accounts receivable and inventory 
these changes reflect the increased oil and gas drilling activity in when compared to our net cash flow provided by operating activities increased by million in as compared to cash flow before changes in operating assets and liabilities decreased by million in due to declines in oil and gas drilling activity 
however  this decrease was offset by a source of cash of million related to reductions in operating assets and liabilities primarily accounts receivable and inventory  reflecting our working capital management program implemented in late investing activities net cash used in investing activities decreased by million in as compared to due primarily to decreased business acquisitions during  coupled with proceeds from the sale of businesses of million and a decrease in capital expenditures for property  plant  and equipment of million 
net cash used in investing activities increased by million in as compared to due primarily to increased business acquisitions during coupled with increased capital expenditures for property  plant  and equipment 
in december  we finalized our acquisition of reedhycalog  which used approximately million in cash to fund the purchase price 
capital expenditures for property  plant  and equipment totaled million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we currently expect to expend approximately million for capital expenditures for property  plant  and equipment during this includes capital expenditures related to our capital improvement program to reduce production costs and improve efficiencies and the existing equipment base 
financing activities our net cash provided by financing activities decreased by million in as compared to in  we received net proceeds of million from the issuance of million senior notes due  coupled with net borrowings of million 
in  net repayments on total debt were million 
our net cash provided by financing activities increased by million in as compared to in  we received net proceeds of million from the issuance of million senior notes due  coupled with net borrowings of million 
senior credit facility and other long term debt our debt balances are primarily comprised of borrowings under our senior credit facility  our senior notes due  and our senior notes due we estimate our required principal and interest payments for our outstanding debt to be approximately million for senior credit facility in connection with the reedhycalog acquisition in december  we entered into a new four year million senior secured credit facility senior credit facility with a syndicate of us and foreign banks maturing on december  the senior credit facility is comprised of a million term loan consisting of a million us term loan and a million canadian term loan  and a million revolving credit facility  which includes up to million for letter of credits  consisting of a million us revolving facility and a million canadian revolving facility 
the credit facilities are guaranteed by grant prideco and all domestic subsidiaries and are secured by substantially all of our us assets  including us inventories  equipment  receivables  owned real property  and stock of certain foreign subsidiaries 
the canadian credit facilities are guaranteed by grant prideco and all us subsidiaries and are secured by substantially all of our us assets and certain of our canadian inventories  equipment  receivables  and owned real property and of the stock of certain foreign subsidiaries 
availability under the revolving credit facility  which was million as of december   is based on the collateral value of the inventories and receivables securing the credit facility 
the current outstanding principal balance of the term loans was million at december  amounts outstanding under the credit facilities accrue interest at a variable rate based on either the us prime rate plus to depending on our leverage ratio and the type of loan  whether revolving or term or libor plus to depending on our leverage ratio and the type of loan  whether revolving or term for the us denominated advances or a variable rate based on the canadian prime rate plus to depending on our leverage ratio and the type of loan  whether revolving or term or the applicable rate for canadian bankers acceptances  for canadian denominated advances 
interest on outstanding borrowings is payable monthly or  with respect to libor borrowings  either quarterly or at the end of the applicable libor period 
the us revolving credit facility also provides us with availability for stand by letters of credit 
we are required to comply with various affirmative and negative covenants which will limit our ability to incur new debt  make certain investments and acquisitions  sell assets  grant liens  and take other actions 
we are subject to financial covenants that require us to limit our capital expenditures and  under certain circumstances  require us to maintain a certain minimum fixed charge coverage ratio 
senior notes due in december  we issued million principal amount of senior notes due net proceeds from the issuance of approximately million were used  along with certain other funds  to fund the cash portion of the reedhycalog acquisition 
interest is payable june and december of each year 
after december   we may redeem all or part of the senior notes at any time at a price of of their principal amount plus an applicable premium and accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date 
the senior notes are guaranteed by all of our domestic subsidiaries 
the indenture governing the senior notes contains various covenants customary in such instruments  including restrictions to incur new debt  pay dividends  sell assets  grant liens  and other related items 
senior notes due in december  we issued million principal amount of senior notes due the senior notes were issued at a discount to yield an effective interest rate of 
net proceeds from the issuance of million were utilized to repay a million subordinated note to weatherford international  inc and to repay outstanding borrowings under our then existing revolving credit facility of approximately million 
interest is payable june and december of each year 
we may redeem all or part of the senior notes at any time at a price of of their principal amount plus an applicable premium and accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date 
the senior notes are guaranteed by all of our domestic subsidiaries 
the indenture governing the senior notes contains various covenants customary in such instruments  including restrictions to incur new debt  pay dividends  sell assets  grant liens  and other related items 
in the event there is a payment default under the senior credit facility  the and senior notes could come due 
as of december   we were in compliance with the various covenants under the senior credit facility and the and senior notes agreements 
liquidity outlook we estimate our required principal and interest payments for our outstanding debt to be approximately million for and capital expenditures for to be approximately million in the aggregate 
we currently expect to satisfy all required capital expenditures and debt service requirements during from operating cash flows  existing cash balances  and the revolver of our senior credit facility 
as of december   we had borrowed million under the senior credit facility  of which million related to the revolving credit facility borrowings  and million related to the term loan 
also  million had been used to support outstanding letters of credit 
net borrowing availability was million 
based on our current projected capital expenditures and required principal and interest payments  our operating cash flows  existing cash balances  and estimated availability under the senior credit facility  we believe we can satisfy all of our expected commitments during the next months and will have sufficient liquidity in the event of a prolonged market downturn to not only maintain our existing operations but to take advantage of strategic opportunities that may present themselves during any such period 
acquisitions and expansions will be financed from cash flow from operations  borrowings under our senior credit facility  or through a combination of the issuance of additional equity and debt financing  as appropriate 
any future financing will be arranged to meet our requirements  with the timing  amount  and form of issue dependent on the prevailing market and general economic conditions 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commercial commitments at december  in thousands after contractual obligations total year years years years long term debt      capital lease obligations   operating leases      purchase commitments open ended   closed ended total contractual obligations      after total year years years years commercial commitments standby letters of credit    tax matters as a result of our spinoff from weatherford  subsequent to april  we are no longer able to combine the results of our operations with those of weatherford in reporting income for united states federal income tax purposes and for income tax purposes in states and foreign countries in which we do business 
under the terms of a tax allocation agreement with weatherford  we will not have the future benefit of any prior tax losses or benefits incurred as part of a consolidated return with weatherford 
moreover  we will be liable to weatherford for any corporate level taxes incurred by weatherford as a result of the spinoff  except to the extent the taxes arise solely as a result of a change of control of weatherford 
we believe these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our earnings 
related party transactions until april   we were a wholly owned subsidiary of weatherford 
we were spun off from weatherford on april   through a distribution by weatherford to its stockholders of all of our common stock 
weatherford no longer owns any interest in our company 
prior to our annual meeting held in may  we had seven directors  five of which also served on the board of weatherford 
following the annual meeting  we now have nine directors  of which only three serve on weatherford s board 
in connection with the spinoff  we entered into a preferred supplier agreement with weatherford in which weatherford agreed to purchase at least of its requirements of drill stem products from us  subject to certain exceptions 
in return  we agreed to sell those products at prices not greater than that at which we sell to similarly situated customers  and we provided weatherford a million credit towards the purchase of those products 
during  we extended the term of this contract by two years and reduced the unused preferred supplier credit balance by million 
at december   the remaining credit balance was million 
weatherford purchased approximately million of drill stem products from us during weatherford also purchased api tubing and accessory threading services from us aggregating million during our drill bits segment sells drill bits worldwide to oil and gas operators  including newfield exploration company newfield 
in addition  a division of our tubular technology and services segment also sells accessories directly to newfield 
two of our directors  mr 
trice and mr 
hendrix  are directors of newfield and mr 
trice is newfield s president and chief executive officer 
during  newfield purchased approximately million of products from us 
during  we renewed a supply contract with voest alpine under which we agreed to purchase a minimum of  metric tons of green tubulars during and  metric tons per year thereafter through july this euro denominated contract fixes the price of steel green tubes within a range  and it limits total price increases to over the life of the contract 
because this agreement requires us to purchase tubulars or pay a penalty regardless of our needs  purchases under this agreement may be made for inventory or we may be forced to pay a penalty during periods of low customer demand 
the maximum penalties due under the contract would be euros for every metric ton that a two year average of purchases fell below the annual purchase minimum 
any purchases made in excess of demand would require us to use our working capital and expose us to risks of excess inventory during a downturn 
although these purchases could require a substantial expenditure  we expect that we will be able to eventually use or sell all of the tubular products we are required to purchase from voest alpine 
we currently believe we will meet our contractual commitments for without incurring unnecessary penalties or material unnecessary inventory positions 
we also believe that there are numerous other supply sources available to us at reasonably competitive prices in the event that voest alpine is not able to supply all of our requirements 
off balance sheet financing we do not have any off balance sheet hedging  financing arrangements or contracts except for those associated with our investments in three companies that are not consolidated in our financial statements voest alpine  g pex  and intelliserv 
these investments are accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
the assets and liabilities of voest alpine are summarized in note to our audited consolidated financial statements 
the two other joint ventures relate to technologies we are currently developing 
these two companies do not have any debt  other than trade payables relating primarily to research and development expenses 
additionally  voest alpine has entered into forward contracts to cover its currency risk related to accounts receivables and accounts payables and has also entered into interest rate swap agreements to reduce its exposure to changes in floating interest rate payments of its long term bonds 
recent accounting pronouncements in january  the fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin no 
was issued 
fin no 
clarifies the application of accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements  to variable interest entities  which are certain entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated support from other parties 
the interpretation is intended to achieve more consistent application of consolidation policies to variable interest entities and thus  to improve comparability between enterprises engaged in similar activities even if some of those activities are conducted through variable interest entities 
the interpretation is effective immediately for variable interest entities created after january   and to variable interest entities in which we obtained an interest after that date 
in december  the fasb issued a revision to fin no 
 fin no 
r  to clarify some of the provisions of fin no 
and to exempt certain entities from its requirements 
under the new guidance  special effective date provisions apply to enterprises that have fully or partially applied fin no 
prior to issuance of this revised interpretation 
otherwise  application of fin no 
r is required in financial statements of public entities that have interests in structures that are commonly referred to as special purpose entities for periods ending after december  application by public entities  other than small business issuers  for all other types of variable interest entities is required in financial statements for periods ending after march  we are currently analyzing the potential impact  if any  this interpretation will have on our consolidated results of operations and its financial condition  with respect to entities acquired before february  in may  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas no 
establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas no 
requires that financial instruments within its scope be classified as an asset or liability 
sfas no 
is effective for all financial instruments entered into or modified after may  and must be applied to the our existing financial instruments effective july   the beginning of the first fiscal period after june  we adopted sfas no 
in the third quarter of and there was no impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition 
critical accounting policies and estimates our significant accounting policies are fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
certain of our accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates 
by their nature  these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
these judgments are based on our historical experience  terms of existing contracts  our observance of trends in the industry  information provided by our customers  and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 
actual results may differ from these judgments and assumptions 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with our sales agreements  which is on the date of customer acceptance  where the manufacturing process is complete  the customer has been provided with all proper inspection and other required documentation  title and risk of loss has passed to the customer  collectability is reasonably assured  and we have met all of our delivery obligations 
with respect to our drill bits segment  for consignment and performance sales  revenue is recognized when the customer runs the drill bit 
customer advances or deposits are deferred and recognized as revenue when we have completed all of our performance obligations related to the sale 
we also recognize revenue for services as they are performed 
allowances for bad debts are provided based on specific account collection issues 
if actual future bad debts differ from what has been identified  additional allowances may be required 
inventories inventory costs are stated at the lower of cost or market using the first in  first out method 
we value our inventories primarily using standard costs  which approximate actual costs  that include raw materials  direct labor  and manufacturing overhead allocations 
we also perform obsolescence reviews on slow moving drill stem and tubular related inventories and establish reserves based on current assessments about future demands  market conditions  and related management initiatives 
our inventory obsolescence policy with respect to drill bits is to reserve of the cost of inventories held longer than one year and of the cost of inventories held longer than two years 
if market conditions are different than those projected by management  additional inventory reserves may be required 
business combinations the cost of business acquisitions is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition using third party appraisals and management estimates 
management s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable  but which are inherently uncertain 
in addition  estimated liabilities to exit activities of an acquired operation or an existing operation  including the exiting of contractual obligations and the termination of employees  are subject to change as management continues its assessment of operations and finalizes its integration plans 
long lived assets a review for impairment of long lived assets is performed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of long lived assets group may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset group to expected future net cash flows without interest costs to be generated by the asset group 
if such asset group is considered to be impaired  the impairment loss to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds fair value based on expected future cash flows 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value  less selling costs 
in  we recorded fixed asset write downs of million related to our drilling products and services manufacturing rationalization 
while we believe no other impairment existed at december  under accounting standards applicable at that date  different conditions or assumptions  or changes in cash flows or profitability  if significantly negative or unfavorable  could have a material adverse effect on the outcome of our impairment evaluation and our financial condition or future results of operations 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives are subject to annual impairment tests 
goodwill is tested for impairment using a two step process that begins with an estimation of the fair value of each of our reporting units compared with its carrying value 
if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of a reporting unit  a second step test is completed comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill to its carrying value to measure the amount of impairment 
intangible assets that are not amortized will be tested for impairment at least annually by comparing the fair values of those assets to their carrying values 
other identifiable intangible assets that are subject to amortization are amortized on a straight line basis over the years expected to be benefited  ranging from to years 
in  we recorded a goodwill impairment of million and an intangible asset write down of million related to a technology joint venture included in our other segment 
while we believe no other impairment existed at december  under accounting standards applicable at that date  different conditions or assumptions  or changes in cash flows or profitability  if significantly negative or unfavorable  could have a material adverse effect on the outcome of our impairment evaluation and our financial condition or future results of operations 
valuation allowance for deferred tax assets we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will expire before realization of the benefit or that future deductibility is not probable 
the ultimate realization of the deferred tax assets depends on the ability to generate sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character in the future 
this requires us to use estimates and make assumptions regarding significant future events such as the taxability of entities operating in the various taxing jurisdictions 
contingent liabilities we have contingent liabilities and future claims for which we have made estimates of the amount of the actual costs of these liabilities or claims 
these liabilities and claims sometimes involve threatened or actual litigation where damages have been quantified and we have made an assessment of our exposure and recorded a provision to cover an expected loss based on our experience in these matters and  when appropriate  the advice of outside counsel or other outside experts 
upon the ultimate resolution of these uncertainties  our future reported financial results will be impacted by the difference between our estimates and the actual amounts paid to settle a liability 
examples of areas where we have made important estimates of future liabilities primarily include litigation  warranty claims  and contract claims 
while management believes the recorded liabilities are adequate  inherent limitations in the estimation process may cause future actual losses to exceed expected losses 
pension plans the plan obligations and related assets of defined benefit pension plans are presented in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
plan assets  which consist primarily of marketable equity and debt instruments  are valued using market quotations as of the period end 
plan obligations and the annual pension expense are determined by independent actuaries and through the use of a number of assumptions 
key assumptions in measuring the plan obligations include the discount rate and the estimated future return on plan assets 
in determining the discount rate  the company utilizes the yield on high quality  fixed income investments currently available with maturities corresponding to the anticipated timing of the benefit payments 
asset returns are based upon the anticipated average rate of earnings expected on the invested funds of the plans 
forward looking statements and exposures in light of the sec s regulation fd  we have elected to provide in this report various forward looking statements and operational details 
we have done so to assure full market disclosure of information that we generally make available to our investors and securities analysts 
we expect to provide updates to this information on a regular basis in our periodic and current reports filed with the sec 
we have also made our investor conference calls open to all investors and encourage all investors to listen in on these calls 
we will publicly announce the call in information in a press release before such calls 
we are providing this information to assist our stockholders in better understanding our business 
these expectations reflect only our current view on these matters as of the date of this report and are subject to change based on changes of facts and circumstances 
there can be no assurance that these expectations will be met and our actual results will likely vary up or down from those currently projected 
these estimates speak only of our expectations as of the date of this report and we make no undertaking to update this information 
the absence of an update should not be considered as an affirmation of our current expectations or that facts have not changed that would impact our expectations 
in making our forward looking statements  we have made numerous assumptions regarding our operations 
although we believe  as of the date this report is filed  that these assumptions are reasonable  there can be no assurance that they will be correct in the future 
our assumptions include the following o the average north american rig count us and canada for will be  o the average international rig count for will be o commodity gas prices will not fall in a manner that would affect demand for our products or potential purchasing decisions or customer perceptions 
o drill stem demand will increase only modestly during  and u 
s land based operators will not increase purchases in meaningful quantities 
o we expect modest drill bit pricing improvements 
o we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately during o there will be no changes in domestic or worldwide political events that would have an adverse consequence upon the domestic or worldwide economies and the demand for our products and services 
in particular  we assume that organization of petroleum exporting countries opec and other oil exporting countries and organizations will take reasonable actions to insure that worldwide oil prices remain relatively stable and not fall for any prolonged period of time that would adversely affect demand for our products  and that united states current and potential military actions in afghanistan  iraq  or elsewhere will not disrupt any of our operations or demand for our products 
o any loss of drill bit sales from schlumberger  reedhycalog s former owner  will be offset by other international and domestic market share gains 
o we will expend approximately million on capital expenditures during o we will reduce our consolidated debt by approximately million during o we will not experience any material unusual losses  expenses  or charges associated with litigation  warranty claims  environmental matters  or property losses 
o our utility costs  labor costs  and other expenses will not increase substantially from their current levels 
o our manufacturing operations will not experience any material disruptions in supply or efficiencies 
o we will not incur any material currency remeasurement or transactional losses or other foreign currency losses 
o there will not be any material acquisitions or divestments during the year 
although we have made this assumption for modeling purposes  we do expect that some acquisitions and divestments will be made during the year that will affect our projections and assumptions 
o there will be no material adverse affect on our operations as a result of us trade laws during our operations and costs will not be adversely affected by any other actions under the trade laws relating to products imported by us from our foreign locations 
o in connection with the drilling products manufacturing rationalization program and the charge recorded in of million related to fixed asset write downs  we expect this rationalization to reduce operating costs by approximately million to million annually 
additional charges of approximately million related to this program are expected in the first quarter of due to severance  lease termination  and other exit costs and these costs are not included in our earnings per share estimates 
o we expect to reduce costs of our chinese operations by million as a result of our joint venture to manufacture upset to grade tubulars becoming operational 
o we expect to earn approximately million in revenues from new product introductions by our tubular technology services and marine products and services segments 
risk factors and exposures the businesses in which we operate are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could have adverse consequences on our results of operations and financial condition and that could cause actual results to be materially different from projected results contained in the forward looking statements in this report and in our other disclosures 
investors should carefully consider these risks and uncertainties when evaluating our company and the forward looking statements that we make 
these risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to  the following a decline in domestic and worldwide oil and gas drilling activity would adversely affect our results of operations 
our business is materially dependent on the level of oil and gas drilling activity in north america and worldwide  which in turn depends on the level of capital spending by major  independent and state owned exploration and production companies 
this capital spending is driven by current prices for oil and gas and the perceived stability and sustainability of those prices 
oil and gas prices have been subject to significant fluctuation in recent years in response to changes in the supply and demand for oil and gas  market uncertainty  world events  governmental actions  and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control  including o the level of north american and worldwide oil and gas exploration and production activity  o worldwide economic conditions  particularly economic conditions in north america  o oil and gas production costs  o the expected costs of developing new reserves  o national government political requirements and the policies of the opec  o the price and availability of alternative fuels  o environmental regulation  and o tax policies 
decreased demand for our products results not only from periods of lower drilling activity  but also from the resulting build up of customer inventory of drill pipe associated with idle rigs  which can be used on active rigs in lieu of new purchases 
the time period during which drill pipe inventory is used is a function of the number of rigs actively drilling and the expected level of drilling activity 
a decrease in the number of rigs actively drilling results in a large amount of unused drill pipe on idle rigs and a decrease in demand for new drill pipe 
an economic downturn could adversely affect demand for our products and services and our results of operations 
the us and worldwide economies have been very volatile  and their future directions are uncertain 
if north american or international economies decline unexpectedly  our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
increases in the prices of our raw materials could affect our results of operations 
we use large amounts of steel tubulars and bars in the manufacture of our products 
the price of these raw materials has a significant impact on our cost of producing products 
if we are unable to pass future raw material price increases on to our customers  our margins and results of operations could be adversely affected 
steel prices have increased significantly since the end of  caused primarily by significant increases in the prices paid by our suppliers for scrap and coke utilized in their operations 
although we have a long term supply contract with our voest alpine affiliate relating to our supply of green tubes utilized in our drill pipe operations  we do not have such supply contracts in place for our suppliers of bars and billets utilized to manufacture our tool joints  drill collars and heavy weight drill pipe 
our partner in our austrian joint venture also is seeking to renegotiate its supply contract for billets to our voest alpine affiliate 
our forward looking statements assume that we will be able to pass on to our customers any cost increases we may experience as a result of the current shortages being experienced in the worldwide steel markets 
if we are unable to  our results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
with respect to our chinese operations  we purchase green tubes from our supplier on a cost plus basis 
as such  any increase in our raw material costs that we cannot pass on to our customers could have an adverse impact on our operations 
in addition  certain of the benefits forecasted from our joint venture to manufacture upset to grade tubulars in china are based upon price differentials between our chinese supplier and our voest alpine affiliate  which may not materialize if steel prices continue to rise 
in addition  rising steel costs also have the potential to delay increases in demand for our drill stem components and premium casing products 
as drill stem products are not consumables  our customers could elect to defer purchases until such time as they determine that steel prices have stabilized or returned to more normalized conditions 
our forward looking statements do not assume that there will be any reduced demand for our drill stem products or premium casing as a result of increased prices caused by the current shortages being experienced in the worldwide steel markets 
reduced demand could adversely affect our results of operations 
due to intense competition in our industry  our revenues may decline if we do not develop  produce  and commercialize new competitive technologies and products or if we are unable to adequately protect our current and future intellectual property rights relating to our technologies and products 
the markets for our premium products and services are characterized by continual developments 
substantial improvements in the scope and quality of product function and performance can occur over a short period of time 
in order to remain competitive  we must be able to develop commercially competitive products in a timely manner in response to changes in technology 
our ability to develop new products and maintain competitive advantages depends on our ability to design and commercially market products that meet the needs of our customers  including delivery schedules and product specifications 
additionally  the time and expense invested in product development may not result in commercially feasible applications that provide revenues 
we could be required to write off our entire investment in a new product that does not reach commercial viability 
moreover  we may experience operating losses after new products are introduced and commercialized because of high start up costs  unexpected manufacturing costs or problems  or lack of demand 
many of our products and the processes we use to manufacture them have been granted us and international patent protection  or have patent applications pending 
nevertheless  patents may not be granted for our applications and  if patents are issued  the claims allowed may not be sufficient to protect our technology 
if our patents are not enforceable  or if any of our products infringe patents held by others  our financial results may be adversely affected 
our competitors may be able to independently develop technology that is similar to ours without infringing on our patents  which is especially true internationally where the protection of intellectual property rights may not be as effective 
in addition  obtaining and maintaining intellectual property protection internationally may be significantly more expensive than doing so domestically 
we may have to spend substantial time and money defending our patents and  after our patents expire  our competitors will not be legally constrained from developing products substantially similar to ours 
in addition  we are in the process of developing new products that we intend to introduce to the market during these products include new large diameter premium connectors for our tubular technology and services and marine products and services segments and drill bits 
if we are unable to introduce such products as a result of delays in our development activities  such introductions not being accepted by our end users  or delays or abandonment for other reasons  our projected results could be adversely affected 
our results of operations and financial condition are dependent upon our ability to successfully increase and decrease  without material disruption  our manufacturing capacity and expense in response to changes in demand and to maintain prices for our products  which can be adversely affected by changes in industry conditions and competitive forces 
our projections assume steady demand for our products and services during  in particular our drill stem products 
in the event demand for these products increases  we will be required to increase our production during peak demand periods with minimal operational disruption and inefficiency 
if this does not happen  or we experience difficulties in this regard  our results of operations during this ramp up for high demand periods could be adversely affected 
our international operations may experience severe interruptions due to political  economic  or other risks  which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
during  we derived approximately of our total revenues from our facilities outside the us in addition  a large part of sales from our domestic locations were for use in foreign countries 
in addition  many of our key manufacturing operations are outside of the us our operations in certain international locations  including mexico  austria  italy  china  indonesia  and singapore are subject to various political and economic conditions existing in those countries that could disrupt operations 
these risks include o changes in foreign tax laws  o changes in regulations and labor practices  o currency fluctuations and devaluations  o currency restrictions  banking crises  and limitations on repatriation of profits  and o political instability or military conflict 
our foreign operations may suffer disruptions  and we may incur losses that will not be covered by insurance 
we have not historically carried political risk insurance 
in particular  terrorist attacks and other threats to us national security and resulting us military activity throughout the world increase the possibility that our operations could be interrupted or adversely affected 
such disruption could result in our inability to ship products in a timely and cost effective manner or our inability to place contractors and employees in various countries or regions 
any material currency fluctuations or devaluations  or political events that disrupt oil and gas exploration and production or the movement of funds and assets could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 
during  approximately million of our revenues were earned by our chinese operations 
as is customary in this country  it is common for our chinese operations to settle receivables and payables through bearer bonds and notes 
recently  chinese banks have been experiencing a shortage of currencies  which could affect our ability to fully realize on these bonds and notes 
at december   we were not holding any such bearer bonds or notes 
to date  our chinese operations have not experienced significant losses as a result of such practice  however  there can be no assurance that such losses could not occur in the future 
any such losses could have a materially adverse affect on our results of operations in the period in which they occur 
we have renewed an agreement with voest alpine  an entity of which we own  to purchase green tubulars through september our future results could be adversely affected if we are unable to use or resell these tubulars 
in addition  we have agreed to be responsible for paying any anti dumping duties in the us on the resale of these tubulars  which could affect our ability to resell the tubulars in the us further  our long term supply contract with voest alpine is denominated in euros 
we have no significant offset for revenues in euros and we have not hedged for currency risk with respect to this contract 
thus  a material long term strengthening of the euro versus the us dollar could materially adversely affect our results of operations 
in connection with our business operations  we could be subject to substantial liability claims that adversely affect our results of operations 
our products are complex  and the failure of this equipment to operate properly or to meet specifications may greatly increase our customers costs of drilling a well 
in addition  many of these products are used in hazardous drilling and production applications where an accident or product failure can cause personal injury or loss of life  damage to property  equipment  or the environment  regulatory investigations and penalties  and the suspension of the end user s operations 
if our products or services fail to meet specifications or are involved in accidents or failures  we could face warranty  contract  or other litigation claims for which we may be held responsible and our reputation for providing quality products may suffer 
our insurance may not be adequate in risk coverage or policy limits to cover all losses or liabilities that we may incur or be responsible 
moreover  in the future we may not be able to maintain insurance at levels of risk coverage or policy limits that we deem adequate or at premiums that are reasonable for us  particularly in the recent environment of significant insurance premium increases 
further  any claims made under our policies will likely cause our premiums to increase 
any future damages deemed to be caused by our products or services that are assessed against us and that are not covered by insurance  or that are in excess of policy limits or subject to substantial deductibles  could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
litigation and claims for which we are not insured can occur  including employee claims  intellectual property claims  breach of contract claims  and warranty claims 
our forward looking statements assume that such uninsured claims or issues will not occur 
as outlined under our critical accounting policies  we account for warranty reserves on a specific identification basis 
as a result  a significant unexpected warranty issue during a particular quarter or year could cause a material reduction in our results of operations in the quarter or year that the reserve for such warranty is made 
we are subject to environmental  health  and safety laws and regulations that expose us to potential financial liability 
our operations are regulated under a number of federal  state  local  and foreign environmental laws and regulations  which govern  among other things  the discharge of hazardous materials into the air and water  as well as the handling  storage  and disposal of hazardous materials and the remediation of contaminated sites 
compliance with these environmental laws is a major consideration in the manufacturing of our products 
because we use and generate hazardous substances and wastes in our manufacturing operations  we may be subject to material financial liability for any investigation and clean up of such hazardous materials  and any related personal injury damages or toxic tort claims 
we have not historically carried insurance for such matters 
in addition  many of our current and former properties are or have been used for industrial purposes 
accordingly  we also may be subject to financial liabilities relating to the investigation and remediation of hazardous materials resulting from the action of previous owners or operators of industrial facilities on those sites 
liability in many instances may be imposed on us regardless of the legality of the original actions relating to the hazardous or toxic substances or whether or not we knew of  or were responsible for  the presence of those substances 
liabilities we have assumed in connection with the reedhycalog acquisition include  subject to certain exceptions  certain obligations  liabilities  costs  and expenses for violations of health  safety and environmental laws relating to the assets and include certain unknown  as well as known  obligations  liabilities  costs  and expenses arising or incurred prior to  on or after the closing date 
furthermore  with certain exceptions  we may be required to indemnify schlumberger against losses incurred in connection with or related to these assumed liabilities 
we are also subject to various federal  state  local  and foreign laws and regulations relating to safety and health conditions in our manufacturing facilities 
those laws and regulations may subject us to material financial penalties or liabilities for any noncompliance  as well as potential business disruption if any of our facilities or a portion of any facility is required to be temporarily closed as a result of any violation of those laws and regulations 
any such financial liability or business disruption could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our results of operations could be adversely affected by actions under us trade laws and new foreign entrants into us markets 
although we are a us based manufacturing company  we do own and operate international manufacturing operations that support our us based business 
if actions under us trade laws were instituted that limited our access to these products  our ability to meet our customer specifications and delivery requirements would be reduced 
any adverse effects on our ability to import products from our foreign subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
additionally  foreign producers of tubular goods have been found to have sold their products  which may include premium connections  for export to the us at prices that are lower than the cost of production  or their prices in their home market  or a major third country market 
anti dumping orders restricting the manner and price at which tubular goods from certain countries can be imported are currently in effect 
if such orders are revoked or changed  we could be exposed to increased competition from imports that could reduce our sales and market share 
in addition  the premium connections market served by our atlas bradford product line is highly competitive 
the level of competition could further increase if foreign steel mills  with their own lines of internationally accepted premium connections  more successfully penetrate the us market  which could adversely affect our results of operations 
our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected by charges associated with future operational changes implemented by management of our company 
our management recently completed a review and assessment of our drill stem manufacturing operations which resulted in a downsizing of certain of our operations  primarily in canada 
as a result of this downsizing  we wrote off during various equipment and assets that were no longer useful in our business 
we also expect to incur approximately million in severance  lease termination  and other exit costs during the first quarter of in addition to these activities  management continues to conduct company wide assessments of all of our related manufacturing strategies and practices and of our under performing product lines to determine possible improvements to manufacturing efficiencies and future profitability 
such assessment could in the future result in divestitures or operational rationalizations that result in write downs or other losses during any particular accounting period 
our forward looking statements assume that none of the results of these reviews or activities will adversely affect our results of operations in any period 
our results of operations could be adversely affected due to an implementation of a new enterprise wide resource planning erp system 
we currently are implementing a new management erp system that we believe will  in the long term  significantly enhance our information systems  internal processes and controls 
this implementation is ongoing and includes a significant amount of management s time and dedication and may distract management in unpredictable ways from our core businesses 
additionally  the erp system might not result in the anticipated benefits and may actually cause disruptions and inefficiencies in our businesses which could result in increases in our operating and other cost that could adversely affect our results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk financial instruments we are currently exposed to certain market risks arising from transactions that we enter into in the normal course of business 
these risks relate to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates 
refer to note to the financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k for additional information on financial instruments 
foreign currency risk the functional currency for a majority of our international operations is the applicable local currency 
results of operations for foreign subsidiaries with functional currencies other than the us dollar are translated using average exchange rates during the period 
assets and liabilities of these foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars using the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date  and the resulting translation adjustments are included in stockholders equity 
to the extent that business transactions in these countries are not denominated in their respective country s functional currency  we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk 
our manufacturing facilities located outside of the us incur costs in local currencies  but they tend to sell in us dollars  and in some cases owe us dollar denominated debt 
in addition  our long term supply contract with voest alpine is denominated in euros 
subsidiaries with asset and liability balances denominated in currencies other than their functional currency are remeasured in the preparation of their financial statements using a combination of current and historical exchange rates  with any resulting remeasurement adjustments included in net income during the period 
net foreign currency transaction gains losses for the years ended december    and were million  million  and million  respectively 
the foreign currency transaction gains realized in relate primarily to the strengthening of the canadian dollar and the british pound in relation to the us dollar 
the euro also strengthened in  however  the impact was not material 
interest rates we are and will be subject to market risk for changes in interest rates related primarily to our long term debt 
the following tables summarize our debt obligations at december  and  that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the tables present principal cash flows by expected maturity dates and weighted average interest rates in thousands long term debt thereafter fixed rate    average interest rate variable rate    average interest rate long term debt thereafter fixed rate     average interest rate variable rate     average interest rate excluding the senior notes  most of our long term borrowings are at variable rates 
currently  we have variable interest rate debt totaling approximately million 
these variable rate debts expose us to the risk of increased interest expense in the event of increases in short term interest rates 
if the variable interest rate were to increase by from december levels  our combined interest expense would increase by approximately million annually 
the carrying value of our variable interest rate debt approximates fair value as it bears interest at current market rates 
the fair value of financial instruments which differed from their carrying value at december  and  was as follows in millions december  carrying fair carrying fair value value value value senior notes due senior notes due
