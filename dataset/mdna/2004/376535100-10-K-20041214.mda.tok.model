overview we were incorporated under the general corporation laws of the state of maryland on may  our investment objectives are to achieve a high level of current income by investing in debt securities  consisting primarily of senior notes  senior subordinated notes and junior subordinated notes  of established private businesses that are backed by leveraged buyout funds  venture capital funds or others  with a particular emphasis on senior subordinated notes 
in addition  we may acquire existing loans that meet this profile from leveraged buyout funds  venture capital funds and others 
we also seek to provide our stockholders with long term capital growth through the appreciation in the value of warrants or other equity instruments that we may receive when we make loans 
we operate as a closed end  non diversified management investment company  and have elected to be treated as a business development company under the act 
we seek out small and medium sized businesses that meet certain criteria  including the potential for growth in cash flow  adequate assets for loan collateral  experienced management teams with a significant ownership interest in the borrower  profitable operations based on the borrower s cash flow  reasonable capitalization of the borrower usually by leveraged buyout funds or venture capital funds and the potential to realize appreciation and gain liquidity in our equity position  if any 
we anticipate that liquidity in our equity position will be achieved through a merger or acquisition of the borrower  a public offering by the borrower or by exercise of our right to require the borrower to buy back its warrants 
we lend to borrowers that need funds to finance growth  restructure their balance sheets or effect a change of control 
our loans typically range from million to million  mature in no more than seven years and accrue interest at a fixed or variable rate that exceeds the prime rate 
a number of our loans have a provision that calls for some portion of the interest payments to be deferred and added to the principal balance so that the interest is paid  together with the principal  at maturity 
this form of deferred interest is often called paid in kind or pik interest  and  when earned  we record pik interest as interest income and add the pik interest to the principal balance of the loans 
because our loans will generally be subordinated debt of private companies who typically cannot or will not expend the resources to have their debt securities rated by a credit rating agency  we expect that most  if not all  of the debt securities we acquire will be unrated 
we cannot accurately predict what ratings these loans might receive if they were in fact rated  and therefore we cannot determine whether or not they could be considered to be investment grade quality 
to the extent possible  our loans generally are collateralized by a security interest in the borrower s assets 
interest payments are generally made monthly or quarterly except to the extent of any pik interest with amortization of principal generally being deferred for several years 
the principal amount of the loans and any accrued but unpaid interest generally become due at maturity at five to seven years 
when we receive a warrant to purchase stock in a borrower in connection with a loan  the warrant will typically have an exercise price equal to the fair value of the portfolio company s common stock at the time of the loan and entitle us to purchase a modest percentage of the borrower s stock 
in addition  as a business development company under the act  we are required to make available significant managerial assistance to our portfolio companies 
prior to the externalization of our management on october   we provided these services  for which we receive fees  through our wholly owned subsidiary  gladstone capital advisers  inc upon the externalization of our management on october   our investment adviser  gladstone management  began to provide these services on our behalf and as such will receive the fees for these services which will then be credited against the management advisory fee 
the fees for these services are typically paid in part at the time a prospective portfolio company signs a non binding term sheet with us  with the remainder paid at the closing of the investment 
these fees are generally non recurring  however in some instances they may have a recurring component 
the specific services we provide vary by portfolio company  but generally consist of reviewing existing credit facilities  arranging bank financing  arranging equity financing  structuring financing from multiple lenders  structuring financing from equity investors  restructuring existing loans  raising equity and debt capital  closely monitoring the operations of the borrower  participating in its board and management meetings  being available for consultation with its officers and providing general organizational and financial guidance 
historically  we have record fees for these services as managerial assistance fee revenue for the periods in which these fees are earned by us 
prior to making an investment  we ordinarily enter into a non binding term sheet with the potential borrower 
these non binding term sheets are generally subject to a number of conditions  including but not limited to the satisfactory completion of our due diligence investigations of the potential borrower s business and reaching agreement on the legal documentation for the loan 
typically  upon execution of the non binding term sheet  the potential borrower pays us a non refundable fee for our services rendered through the date of the non binding term sheet 
we have historically recognized this as management fee revenue upon execution of the non binding term sheet 
in the event that we expend significant effort in considering and negotiating a potential investment that ultimately is not consummated  we generally will seek reimbursement from the proposed borrower for our reasonable expenses incurred in connection with the proposed transaction 
any amounts collected for expenses incurred by gladstone management in connection with unconsummated investments will be reimbursed to gladstone management 
amounts collected for these expenses incurred by us will be reimbursed to us and will be recognized as other income in the period in which such reimbursement is received 
also  in the event that we have incurred significant legal fees in connection with the transaction  we will typically seek reimbursement for these expenses from the proposed borrower 
however  there can be no guarantee that we will be successful in collecting any such reimbursements 
the only significant continuing revenue associated with the investments we have already closed is interest income and  potentially  capital gains realized in connection with the liquidation of any associated equity interest eg  warrants 
the fiscal year ended september  saw signs of improvement in the economy as well as an influx of low interest rate capital into the debt markets as compare to the fiscal year ended september  as evidence of this improvement  several of our portfolio companies saw an increase in their earnings and as such have repaid their entire outstanding loan balances earlier than the scheduled contractual maturity dates 
during the fiscal year ended september   we saw four loan investments and one syndicated loan investment repay ahead of maturity date for an aggregate return of capital of approximately million 
on september  we closed a second public offering of common stock which provided us net proceeds of approximately million 
subsequent to september   two loan investments repaid ahead of contractual maturity and one syndicated loan investment was sold for an aggregate return of capital of approximately million 
since our initial public offering in august  we have made different loans to or purchased syndicated participations in  or investments in  companies for a total of approximately million 
we are steadily working toward the consummation of more investments  both loan origination and syndicated investments 
these prospective loans are subject to  among other things  the satisfactory completion of our due diligence investigation of each borrower  acceptance of terms and structure and attainment of necessary consents 
with respect to each prospective loan  we will only agree to provide the loan if  among other things  the results of our due diligence investigations are satisfactory  the terms and conditions of the loan are acceptable and all necessary consents are received 
our management has initiated its due diligence investigations of the potential borrowers  however we cannot assure you that we will not discover facts in the course of completing our due diligence that would render a particular investment imprudent or that any of these loans will actually be made 
external adviser in july  we entered into an expense sharing arrangement with gladstone management corporation gladstone management  a registered investment adviser that serves as the external adviser to gladstone commercial corporation  a real estate investment trust affiliated with us 
under this expense sharing arrangement  gladstone management reimbursed gladstone capital advisers for a portion of our total payroll and benefits expenses based on the percentage of total hours worked by each of our employees on gladstone commercial matters 
gladstone management also reimbursed gladstone capital advisers for its pro rata portion of all other general expenses based on the percentage of total hours worked by all of our employees on gladstone commercial matters 
gladstone management further passed its share of these expenses along to gladstone commercial under a separate advisory agreement 
as a result of this expense sharing arrangement  certain of our expenses  such as rent and insurance  declined during the fiscal year ended september  following our engagement of gladstone management on october   the first day of our fiscal year  gladstone management now directly employs all of our personnel and pays its payroll  benefits  and general expenses directly 
thus  the expense sharing arrangement between gladstone capital advisers and gladstone management terminated upon the externalization of our management on october effective october   pursuant to our advisory agreement with gladstone management  we pay gladstone management an annual advisory fee of of our total assets as reduced by cash and cash equivalents pledged to creditors  payable in quarterly increments of  and an annual administrative fee of of our total assets as reduced by cash and cash equivalents pledged to creditors  payable in quarterly increments of 
we continue to pay direct expenses including  but not limited to  directors fees  legal and accounting fees  and stockholder related expenses 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported consolidated amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and revenues and expenses during the periods reported 
actual results could materially differ from those estimates 
our accounting policies are more fully described in the notes to consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report 
we have identified our investment valuation process  tax status and revenue recognition as our most critical accounting policies 
investment valuation the most significant estimate inherent in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements is the valuation of investments and the related amounts of unrealized appreciation and depreciation of investments recorded 
general valuation policy we value our investment portfolio each quarter 
we carry our investments at fair value  as determined in good faith by our board of directors 
securities that are publicly traded  if any  are valued at the closing price of the exchange or securities market on which they are listed on the valuation date 
securities which are not traded on a public exchange or securities market  but for which a limited market exists  such as participations in syndicated loans  are valued at the indicative bid price offered by the syndication agent on the valuation date 
debt and equity securities that are not publicly traded and for which a limited market does not exist or for which we have various degrees of trading restrictions are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by our board of directors 
in making the good faith determination of the value of these securities  we start with the cost basis of the security  which includes the amortized original issue discount  and pik interest  if any 
we then apply the methods set out below in valuation methods 
members of our portfolio management team prepare the valuations of our investments in portfolio companies using the most recent portfolio company financial statements and forecasts 
these individuals also consult with portfolio company senior management to obtain further updates on the portfolio company s performance  including information such as industry trends  new product development  and other operational issues 
due to the uncertainty inherent in the valuation process  such estimates of fair value may differ significantly from the values that would have been obtained had a ready market for the securities existed  and the differences could be material 
additionally  changes in the market environment and other events that may occur over the life of the investments may cause the gains or losses ultimately realized on these investments to be different than the valuations currently assigned 
no single standard for determining fair value in good faith exists since fair value depends upon circumstances of each individual case 
in general  fair value is the amount that we might reasonably expect to receive upon the current sale of the security 
as of march   we engaged standard poor s loan evaluation service s p to help evaluate the value of the majority of our loan securities other than those which are publicly traded or for which a limited market exists  as described above 
since june   our s p engagement includes evaluations on success fees conditional interest included in some loan securities 
we and s p only evaluate the value of a success fee if the probability of receiving the success fee on a given loan is above  a threshold of significance  in which case a value is assigned 
upon completing our collection of data with respect to the investments including the information described under credit information  the risk ratings of the loans described under loan grading and risk rating and the factors described under valuation methods  this valuation data is presented to s p 
s p makes its independent assessment of the data that we have assembled and assesses its own data to determine market values for the securities 
with regard to its work  s p has issued the following paragraph s p provides evaluated price opinions which are reflective of what s p believes the bid side of the market would be for each loan after careful review and analysis of descriptive  market and credit information 
each price reflects s p s best judgment based upon careful examination of a variety of market factors 
because of fluctuation in the market and in other factors beyond its control  s p cannot guarantee these evaluations 
the evaluations reflect the market prices  or estimates thereof  on the date specified 
the prices are based on comparable market prices for similar securities 
market information has been obtained from reputable secondary market sources 
although these sources are considered reliable  s p cannot guarantee their accuracy 
with our assessment and s p value estimates as a backdrop  our board of directors votes to accept or not accept the analyses and values recommended by management and s p 
at september  and september   the board of directors elected to accept the valuations recommended by s p on those loans as denoted on the schedule of investments as of september  and september  in our consolidated financial statements 
because there is a delay between when we close a loan and when the loan can be evaluated by s p  new loans are not valued immediately by s p  rather  the board of directors makes its own determination about the value of these loans in accordance with our valuation policy 
because s p does not provide values for mortgage loans or equity securities  our board of directors also determines the fair value of these investments using our valuation policy without the input of s p 
credit information we monitor a wide variety of key credit statistics that provide information regarding our portfolio companies to help us assess credit quality and portfolio performance 
we require our portfolio companies to provide annual audited and either monthly or quarterly unaudited financial statements 
using these statements  we calculate and evaluate the credit statistics 
for purposes of analyzing the financial performance of our portfolio companies  we may make certain adjustments to their cash flow statements to reflect the pro forma results of a company consistent with a change of control transaction  to reflect anticipated cost savings resulting from a merger or restructuring  costs related to new product development  compensation to previous owners  and other acquisition or restructuring related items 
for those investments for which s p prepares valuation recommendations  we provide this credit information to s p for its use in preparing its recommendations 
for those investments for which s p does not prepare valuation recommendations  management uses this credit information in connection with its preparation of valuation recommendations 
loan grading and risk rating as part of our valuation procedures we risk rate all of our loans 
our risk rating system uses a scale of to this system is used to estimate the probability of default on our debt securities and the probability of loss if there is a default 
these types of systems are referred to as risk rating systems and are used by banks and rating agencies 
the risk rating system covers both qualitative and quantitative aspects of the business and the securities we hold 
for those investments for which s p prepares valuation recommendations  we compile this information and provide it to s p for its consideration in determining its valuation recommendations 
for those investments for which s p does not prepare valuation recommendations  management uses this information to develop valuation recommendations 
we seek to have our risk rating system mirror the risk rating systems of major risk rating organizations such as those provided by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations nrsro as defined in rule a under the act 
while we seek to mirror the nrsro systems  we cannot provide any assurance that our risk rating system provides the same risk rating as a nrsro 
the following chart is an estimate of the relationship of our risk rating system to the designations used by two nrsros as they risk rate debt securities of major companies 
because we have established our system to rate debt securities of companies that are unrated by any nrsro there can be no assurance that the correlation to the nrsro set out below is accurate 
it is our understanding that most debt securities of middle market companies do not exceed the grade of bbb on a nrsro scale  so there would be no debt securities in the middle market that would meet the definition of aaa  aa or a 
therefore  our scale begins with the designation bbb as the best risk rating 
company s system first nrsro second nrsro gladstone capital s description a baa bbb probability of default pd during the next ten years is and the expected loss el is or less baa bbb pd is and the el is to ba bb pd is and the el is to ba bb pd is and the el is to ba bb pd is and the el is to b b pd is and the el is to b b pd is and the el is to b b pd is and the el is to caa ccc pd is and the el is to caa ccc pd is and the el is to caa cc pd is and the el is to n a d pd is or there is a payment default and the el is greater than a the default rates set here are for a ten year term debt  if the company s debt security is less than ten years then the probability of default is adjusted to a lower percentage for the shorter period which may move the security higher on the company s risk rating scale 
the above scale gives an indication of the probability of default and the magnitude of the loss if there is a default 
at september   the average debt security was risk rated for all debt securities and the weighted average risk rating was for all debt securities 
the following table lists the risk ratings for all of the debt securities by quarter during the fiscal year ended september  rating december  march  june  september  average weighted average highest lowest the above scale gives an indication of the probability of default and the magnitude of the loss if there is a default 
our policy is to stop accruing interest on an investment if we determine that interest is no longer collectible 
to date we have not placed any investments on non accrual 
at september  and september   no payments were past due on any of our debt securities 
we do not risk rate our equity securities 
valuation methods for debt securities  we first determine if the debt security is publicly traded ie  if it is listed on an exchange or securities market 
if it is publicly traded  then we determine the value based on the closing price for the security on the exchange or securities market on which it is listed on the valuation date 
if the security is not publicly traded  but a limited market for the security exists  such as for a participation in a syndicated loan  then we value it at the indicative bid price offered by the syndication agent on the valuation date 
at september   we determined that none of the debt securities in our portfolio were publicly traded and that there was a limited market for five debt securities in our portfolio 
at september   there was no market for any of the debt securities in our portfolio 
for debt securities that are not publicly traded and for which there is no market  we begin with the risk rating designation of the security described above 
using the risk rating designation above  we seek to determine the value of the security as if we intended to sell the security in a current sale 
to determine the current sale price of the security  we consider some or all of the following factors financial standing of the issuer of the security  comparison of the business and financial plan of the issuer with actual results  the cost of the security  the size of the security held as it relates to the liquidity of the market for such securities  contractual restrictions on the disposition of the security  pending public offering of the issuer of the security  pending reorganization activity affecting the issuer such as mergers or debt restructuring  reported prices of similar securities of the issuer or comparable issuers  ability of the issuer to obtain needed financing  changes in the economy affecting the issuer  recent purchases or sale of a security of the issuer  pricing by other buyers or sellers of similar securities  financial statements of the borrower  reports from portfolio company senior management and ownership  the type of security  cost at date of purchase  size of holding  discount from market value of unrestricted securities of the same class at the time of purchase  special reports prepared by analysts  information as to any transactions or offers with respect to the security  existence of merger proposals or tender offers affecting the securities  the collateral  the issuer s ability to make payments  the current and forecasted earnings of the issuer  sales to third parties of similar securities  statistical ratios compared to lending standards  statistical ratios compared to other similar securities  and other pertinent factors 
for those debt securities for which s p prepares valuation recommendations  we provide the foregoing information to s p for its use in preparing its recommendations 
for convertible debt  equity  success fees or other equity like securities  we first determine if there is any market for the security 
if there is a market  then we determine the value based on the market prices for the security  even if that market is not robust 
at september  and september  there was no market for any of the equity securities we owned 
if there is no market for the equity securities  then we use the same information we would use for a debt security valuation described above  except risk rating  as well as standard valuation techniques used by major valuation firms to value the equity securities of private companies 
these valuation techniques consist of discounted cash flow of the expected sale price in the future  valuation of the securities based on recent sales in comparable transactions  and a review of similar companies that are publicly traded and the market multiple of their equity securities 
at september  we had  invested  at cost  in equity securities compared to our debt portfolio with a cost basis of  at september   america s water heater rentals senior loan had an appreciation of  in its value as a result of the value applied to the success fee 
also  the value of our warrants of finn corporation had an appreciation of  at september  this aforementioned appreciation plus appreciation of  on certain other investments  for overall appreciation of  partially offsets total depreciation of  which was mainly composed of depreciation in our senior subordinated term debt investment in finn corporation excluding the warrants of  our senior subordinated term debt investment in marcal paper mills  inc of  our senior term debt investment in coyne international enterprises of  and our senior term debt investment in inca metal products corporation of  tax status federal income taxes we intend to continue to qualify for treatment as a ric under subtitle a  chapter of subchapter m of the code 
as a ric  we are not subject to federal income tax on the portion of our taxable income and gains distributed to stockholders 
to qualify as a ric  we are required to distribute to stockholders at least of investment company taxable income  as defined by the code 
we have a policy to pay out as a dividend up to of that amount 
revenue recognition interest income recognition interest income is recorded on the accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are expected to be collected 
we will stop accruing interest on investments when it is determined that interest is no longer collectible 
conditional interest or a success fee is recorded when earned upon full repayment of a loan investment 
payment in kind interest we also have some loans in our portfolio which contain a payment in kind pik provision 
the pik interest  computed at the contractual rate specified in each loan agreement  is added to the principal balance of the loan and recorded as interest income 
to maintain our status as a ric  this non cash source of income must be paid out to stockholders in the form of dividends  even though we have not yet collected the cash 
managerial assistance fees the act requires that a business development company make available managerial assistance to its portfolio companies 
prior to october   we provided managerial assistance to our portfolio companies in connection with our investments through our wholly owned subsidiary  gladstone capital advisers  inc effective october   we began providing these services through our external adviser  gladstone management 
we generally receive fees for our managerial assistance services 
these fees are normally paid at the closing of our investments in our portfolio companies  are generally non recurring and are recognized as revenue when earned 
the managerial assistance services we provide vary by investment  but generally consist of reviewing existing credit facilities  arranging bank financing  arranging equity financing  structuring financing from multiple lenders  structuring financing from equity investors  restructuring existing loans  raising equity and debt capital  closely monitoring the operations of the borrower  participating in its board and management meetings  being available for consultation with its officers and providing general organizational and financial guidance  which concludes upon closing of the loan 
any services of this nature subsequent to the closing would generally generate a separate fee at the time of completion 
from time to time  we are invited to participate as a co lender in a transaction 
in the event that we do not provide significant managerial assistance services in connection with our investment  loan fees paid to us in such situations are deferred and amortized over the life of the loan 
after october  our adviser  gladstone management  provides managerial assistance and receives the managerial assistance fees which are credited to the investment advisory fees due to the investment adviser 
results of operations comparison of the fiscal years ended september  and september  operating income operating income for the fiscal year ended september  was million as compared to million for the fiscal year ended september  this increase is primarily a result of a rise in interest income from an increase of approximately million of new investments from the prior year and the collection of approximately million of exit fees upon the full repayment of three portfolio company investments 
interest income from our investments in debt securities of private companies was approximately million  including  of pik interest  for the fiscal year ended september  as compared to million for the fiscal year ended september   including  of pik interest 
this increase was primarily the result of approximately million of new investments for the fiscal year ended september  and the collection of million of exit fees upon the full repayment of three portfolio company investments 
the decrease in pik income for the fiscal year ended september  was the result of scheduled principal repayments for one loan containing the pik provision 
the weighted average yield on our portfolio for the fiscal year ended september  was without giving effect to pik interest and after giving effect to pik interest 
the weighted average yield on our portfolio for the fiscal year ended september  was without giving effect to pik interest and after giving effect to pik interest 
the yields were computed based on the cost value of the investment portfolios 
interest income from invested cash and cash equivalents for the fiscal year ended september  was approximately  as compared to approximately  for the fiscal year ended september  this decrease was primarily caused by a decrease in cash balances as a result of million of new investments 
for the fiscal year ended september   we recorded approximately  in interest income from loans to our employees in connection with the exercise of employee stock options  as compared to approximately  in interest income from such loans for the fiscal year ended september  during the year ended september   one loan was repaid in full and two new loans were entered into as a result of employee stock option exercises

for the fiscal year ended september   this amount was comprised of  in waiver fees for certain loan covenants   in early principal payment penalty fees   in up front fees for a proposed investment and  in other income 
operating expenses operating expenses for the fiscal year ended september  were approximately million  compared to approximately million for the fiscal year ended september  this increase was primarily a result of the increase in salaries and benefits  professional fees  directors fees  financing fees incurred in connection with the credit line facility we established in fiscal year and the line of credit entered into in june  as well as interest and loan servicing expenses 
salaries and benefits for the fiscal year ended september  were approximately million  as compared to approximately million for the fiscal year ended september  the primary reason for the increase was the board of directors declaration of an  performance based bonus during the fiscal year ended september  although during the fiscal year ended september   salaries and benefits were allocated in accordance with an expense sharing arrangement with gladstone management corporation that allocated expenses to gladstone management corporation based on each employee s time spent on gladstone commercial corporation s matters  no portion of this bonus was allocated to gladstone management corporation as it was solely attributable to the performance of gladstone capital corporation 
without giving effect to the bonus  salaries and benefits slightly decreased as compared to the fiscal year ended september  although employee head count increased from the prior fiscal year  the cost of the increase was offset by the savings attributable to the expense sharing arrangement with gladstone management corporation 
as a result of the externalization of our management  effective october   we ceased incurring salaries and benefits expenses as our personnel are all now directly employed by gladstone management  which pays these expenses directly 
in connection with this transition  effective october   we are obligated to make payments to gladstone management pursuant to the terms of an investment advisory and administrative agreement with gladstone management 
rent expense for the fiscal year ended september  was approximately  as compared to  for the fiscal year ended september  this decrease in rent was due to the expense sharing arrangement with gladstone management  which allocated general expenses to gladstone management based on the ratio of all employees time spent of gladstone commercial corporation s matters to total time spent 
as a result of the externalization of our management  effective october   we ceased incurring rent expense as we assigned our obligations under our lease to gladstone management  which pays these expenses directly 
in connection with this transition  effective october   we are obligated to make payments to gladstone management pursuant to the terms of the investment advisory agreement with gladstone management 
professional fees  consisting primarily of legal and audit fees  for the fiscal year ended september  were approximately  as compared to approximately  for the fiscal year ended september  this increase is primarily due to an increase in legal fees associated with various sec filings  certain non reimbursable due diligence fees incurred in connection with syndicated investment participations  and other general corporate matters 
directors fees for the fiscal year ended september  were approximately  as compared to approximately  for the fiscal year ended september  the increase is due to the addition of two new directors during the fiscal year ended september   as well as an increase in the number of meetings during the year 
general insurance expense for the fiscal year ended september  was approximately  as compared to  for the fiscal year ended september  although overall premiums have increased  the general insurance expense decreased for the fiscal year ended september  as compared to the fiscal year ended september  as a result of the expense sharing arrangement with gladstone management which allocated general expenses to gladstone management based on a ratio of all employees time spent of gladstone commercial corporation s matter to total time spent 
as a result of the externalization of our management  effective october   we ceased incurring general insurance expenses and gladstone management now pays these expenses directly 
however  we will continue to incur insurance expense in connection with our directors and officers insurance policy 
in connection with this transition  effective october   we are obligated to make payments to gladstone management pursuant to the terms of the investment advisory agreement with gladstone management 
stockholder related costs for the fiscal year ended september  were approximately  as compared to  for the fiscal year ended september  these costs include printing charges related to annual reports and proxy solicitations as well as other stockholder required communications such as the electronic filings of sec reports 
financing fees for the fiscal year ended september  were approximately million compared to financing fees for the fiscal year ended september  of approximately  these fees represent the amortization of certain capitalized costs in connection with establishing the lines of credit 
in may  we entered into a warehouse line of credit with cibc world markets inc the interest of cibc world markets inc was subsequently assigned to deutsche bank ag in september as a result of this transaction  approximately million of capitalized fees were expensed 
some of the increase in financing fees is a result of the incurrence of financing fees related to this line of credit for the full fiscal year ended september   as compared to a shorter period of time during the fiscal year ended september  monthly fees associated with the line of credit are included in these financing fees 
we also entered into an operating line of credit with branch banking and trust company bb t in june  and likewise incurred certain transaction costs which are amortized into financing fees 
the fiscal year ended september  was the first year in which these charges were incurred 
interest expense for the fiscal year ended september  was approximately  and was incurred mainly on our borrowings from our warehouse line of credit as well as our new operating line of credit 
there was no interest expense incurred for the fiscal year ended september  as there were no borrowings outstanding under our warehouse line of credit 
loan servicing fees of approximately  were incurred for the fiscal year ended september  these fees were incurred from july  through september  in connection with a loan servicing agreement between gladstone business loan llc and gladstone management corporation  which became effective july  the loans in the portfolio were previously serviced under a similar agreement with gladstone capital advisers inc and the fees were eliminated upon consolidation of the financial results 
general and administrative expenses  consisting primarily of office operations  travel and data communications  for the fiscal year ended september  were approximately  as compared to approximately  for the fiscal year ended september  these increases were largely related to the recruiting and addition of several new employees  the expansion of our operations  as well as the disposal of inactive fixed assets  and an increase in depreciation due to the addition of new computers for new employees 
despite these increases  depreciation expense decreased overall due to the sale of all fixed assets to gladstone management on july  at net book value  and as such no depreciation was recorded for the last fiscal quarter of the fiscal year ended september  certain general and administrative expenses were allocated in accordance with the expense sharing arrangement with gladstone management  which allocated general expense to gladstone management based on the ratio of all employees time spent on gladstone commercial corporation matters which partially offset the increase in these general and administrative expenses 
as a result of the externalization of our management  effective october   we ceased incurring certain general and administrative expenses and gladstone management now pays certain of these expenses directly

the following table shows our significant contractual obligations for the repayment of debt and payment of other contractual obligations as of september  payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term liabilities reflected on the registrant s balance sheet under gaap total the information included in the table above is based upon the internal management structure that was in place as of september  we have entered into an investment advisory and administrative agreement with gladstone management that became effective on october  pursuant to the advisory agreement  we are obligate to make certain payments to gladstone management that may increase the amount of our contractual obligations in future fiscal years 
payments under the advisory agreement consist of an annual advisory fee of of our total assets as reduced by cash and cash equivalents pledged to creditors  payable in quarterly increments of  and an annual administrative fee of of our total assets as reduced by cash and cash equivalents pledged to creditors  payable in quarterly increments of 
as the payments under the advisory agreement will vary based on changes in our total assets during any give payment period  we cannot accurately predict the amount of payments under the advisory agreement 
if the advisory agreement had been effective as of september   we estimate that our total contractual obligations would have been approximately million 
this estimate is based on the amount of our total assets net of cash and cash equivalents pledged to creditors as of september  as we expect to continue to make more investments in future fiscal years  we expense that the amount of our total assets may increase  and thus  the contractual obligations attributable to advisory fee payments under the advisory agreement are likely to be higher than this estimated amount

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates 
we expect that  ultimately  approximately of the loans in our portfolio will be made at fixed rates  with approximately made at variable rates 
currently our portfolio has approximately of the total of the loan portfolio cost basis at fixed rates  approximately of the total loan portfolio cost basis at variable rates with a floor and the remaining of the total loan portfolio cost basis at variable rates 
in addition  we have two variable rate borrowing facilities 
we have a million revolving credit facility with deutsche bank ag which matures in may we also have a million line of credit agreement which matures in june to illustrate the potential impact of changes in interest rates on our net increase in stockholders equity resulting from operations  we have performed the following analysis  which assumes that our balance sheet remains constant and no further actions beyond the interest rate cap agreement are taken to alter our existing interest rate sensitivity 
under this analysis  a hypothetical increase in the one month libor by would increase our net increase in stockholders equity resulting from operations by approximately  or  over the next twelve months  compared to the net increase in stockholders equity resulting from operations for the fiscal year ended september  a hypothetical decrease in the one month libor by would decrease net increase in stockholders equity resulting from operations by approximately  or  over the next twelve months  compared to the net increase in stockholders equity resulting from operations for the fiscal year ended september  although management believes that this analysis is indicative of our existing interest rate sensitivity  it does not adjust for potential changes in credit quality  size and composition of our loan portfolio on the balance sheet and other business developments that could affect net increase in stockholders equity resulting from operations 
accordingly  no assurances can be given that actual results would not differ materially from the results under this hypothetical analysis 
in february  we entered into an interest rate cap agreement as required under our line of credit to enter into certain hedging transactions in connection with our borrowings under the line of credit 
we purchased this interest rate cap agreement with a notional amount of million for a one time  up front payment of  the interest rate cap agreement entitles us to receive payments  if any  equal to the amount by which interest payments on million at the point which one month libor exceed the interest payments on million at 
the cap expires in february this interest rate cap agreement effectively caps our interest payments on our line of credit borrowing  up to the notional amount of the interest rate cap  at five percent 
this mitigates our exposure to increases in interest rates on our borrowings on our lines of credit  which are at variable rates 
at september   the cap agreement had a fair market value of approximately  at september   the one month libor rate was approximately 
in the event that we securitize a portion of our loan portfolio  we believe that we will likely be required to enter into further hedging arrangements in the future with respect to securitized loans 
while hedging activities may mitigate our exposure to adverse fluctuations in interest rates  certain hedging transactions that we may enter into in the future  such as interest rate swap agreements  may also limit our ability to participate in the benefits of lower interest rates with respect to our portfolio of investments
