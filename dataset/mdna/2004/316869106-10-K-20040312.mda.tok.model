critical accounting policies and estimates the consolidated financial statements of filenet are prepared in conformit y with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the consolidated financial statements include our accounts and the accounts o f our wholly owned subsidiaries 
all intercompany balances and transactions hav e been eliminated 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity wit h accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of americ a requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reporte d amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements an d the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
actua l amounts could differ from estimates 
the significant accounting policies w e believe are most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating ou r reported financial results include the following revenue recognition 
filenet accounts for the licensing of software i n accordance with the american institute of certified accountants aicpa statement of position sop  software revenue recognition 
we ente r into contracts for the sale of our products and services 
the majority of thes e contracts relate to single elements and contain standard terms and conditions however  there are agreements that contain multiple elements or non standar d terms and conditions 
contract interpretation is sometimes required to determin e the appropriate accounting  including how the price should be allocated amon g the deliverable elements and when to recognize revenue 
software license revenue generated from sales through direct and indirec t channels  which do not contain multiple elements  are recognized upon shipmen t and passage of title of the related product  if the requirements of sop are met 
if the requirements of sop  including evidence of an arrangement delivery  fixed or determinable fee  collectibility or vendor specific evidenc e about the value of an element are not met at the date of shipment  revenue i s not recognized until these elements are known or resolved 
fees are deemed to b e fixed and determinable for transactions with a set price that is not subject t o refund or adjustment and payment is due within days from the invoice date software license revenue from channel partners is recognized when the product i s shipped and sale by the channel partner to a specified end user is confirmed 
for arrangements with multiple elements  we allocate revenue to eac h element of a transaction based upon its fair value as determined in reliance o n vendor specific objective evidence 
this evidence of fair value for all element s of an arrangement is based on the normal pricing and discounting practices fo r those products and services when sold separately 
if fair value of an y undelivered element cannot be determined objectively  we defer the revenue unti l all elements are delivered  services have been performed or until fair value ca n objectively be determined 
customer support contracts are renewable on an annual basis and provid e after sale support for our software  as well as software upgrades under ou r right to new versions program  on a when and if available basis 
revenue fro m post contract customer support is recognized ratably over the term of th e arrangement  which is typically months 
professional services revenue consists of consulting and implementatio n services provided to end users of our software products and technical consultin g services provided to our resellers 
consulting engagements average from one t o three months 
revenue from these services and from training classes i s recognized as such services are delivered and accepted by the customer 
revenu e and cost is recognized using the percentage of completion method for fixed pric e consulting contracts 
however  revenue and profit are subject to revision as th e contract progresses and anticipated losses on fixed price professional service s contracts are recognized in the period when they become known 
professiona l services are not required for the software to function 
we do not make change s to the standard software code in the field 
allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns 
we evaluate th e creditworthiness of our customers prior to order fulfillment  and we perfor m ongoing credit evaluations of our customers to adjust credit limits based o n payment history and the customer s current creditworthiness 
we monito r collections from our customers and maintain an allowance for estimated credi t losses that is based on historical experience and on specific custome r collection issues 
while credit losses have historically been within ou r expectations and the provisions established in our financial statements  w e cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rate s that we have in the past 
since our revenue recognition policy require s customers to be creditworthy  our accounts receivable are based on customer s whose payment is reasonably assured 
our accounts receivable are derived fro m sales to a wide variety of customers 
the following table represents the account balances for these provision s and the changes for each of the periods presented 
deductions to thes e provisions are the result of customer bad debt write offs or product returns additions to the provision are based on estimated credit losses related t o specific customer collection issues and are also based on historical experience in thousands additions balance at charged to balance beginning revenue and at end of period expenses dedu ctions of period year ended december  allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns  year ended december  allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns   year ended december  allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns   we do not believe a change in liquidity of any one customer or ou r inability to collect from any one customer would have a material adverse impac t on our consolidated financial position 
based on historical experience  we als o maintain a sales return allowance for the estimated amount of returns 
whil e product returns have historically been minimal and within our expectations an d the allowances established by us  we cannot guarantee that we will continue t o experience the same return rates that we have in the past 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
goodwill is recorded at cost and i s not amortized 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 goodwill and othe r intangible assets  which we adopted january  sfas no 
requires tha t goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer b e amortized  but instead be tested for impairment at least annually and writte n down when impaired 
on the first day of july of each year  goodwill is teste d for impairment by determining if the carrying value of each reporting uni t exceeds its fair value 
we also periodically evaluate whether events an d circumstances have occurred which indicate that the carrying value of goodwil l may not be recoverable 
we engaged an independent valuation firm to determin e the business enterprise value for each of our three reporting units and t o perform an impairment analysis as of july  in accordance with sfas the analysis indicated there was no impairment of goodwill in any of the thre e reporting units 
as of december   no impairment of goodwill has bee n recognized 
if estimates change  a materially different impairment conclusio n could result 
long lived assets 
property  plant and equipment  intangible assets  an d capitalized software costs are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation o r amortization 
they are amortized using the straight line method over estimate d useful lives of generally three to five years 
the determination of useful live s and whether or not these assets are impaired involves judgment and are reviewe d for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carryin g amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
we evaluate the carrying value o f long lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets for impairment o f value based on undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of th e asset and its eventual disposition 
while we have not experienced impairment o f intangible assets in prior periods  we cannot guarantee that there will not b e impairment in the future 
deferred income taxes 
deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects o f temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities fo r financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes 
w e maintain a valuation allowance against a portion of the deferred tax asse t related to domestic operations due to uncertainty regarding the futur e realization based on historical taxable income  projected future taxable income and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences 
i f we operate at a loss or are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income we could be required to increase the valuation allowance against all or a significant portion of our deferred tax assets  which would result in a substantial increase to our effective tax rate and could result in a materia l adverse impact on our operating results 
conversely  if we continue to generat e profits and ultimately determine that it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the remaining deferred tax assets will be utilized to offset futur e taxable income  the valuation allowance could be decreased or eliminated al l together  thereby resulting in a substantial temporary decrease to our effectiv e tax rate and an increase to additional paid in capital 
the company is currentl y assessing its valuation allowance related to our deferred tax assets 
as o f december   we have a net tax deferred asset of approximately million and valuation allowance of approximately million 
we will continu e weighing various factors throughout the year to assess the need for an y valuation allowance 
recoverability of the deferred tax assets is dependent o n continued profitability from operations 
should our level of profitabilit y continue as expected  we would likely remove the entire valuation allowance i n we would realize a one time  non cash benefit by decreasing our ta x expense causing an increase in earnings by approximately million t o million 
additionally  we would record a non cash charge to increas e additional reported paid in capital by approximately million 
research and development costs 
we expense research and development cost s as incurred 
no amounts are required to be capitalized in accordance with sfa s no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  o r otherwise marketed  because our software is substantially complete d concurrently with the establishment of technological feasibility 
overview filenet develops and markets software that helps our customers addres s their electronic content and business process management requirements electronic content is unstructured data with various object characteristics an d attributes 
electronic content includes  but is not limited to web content forms  word documents and scanned images that are not easily managed b y relational databases 
we market these enterprise software solutions to primaril y global customers in the banking  insurance  government  utilities an d telecom industries located in north america  europe and asia 
we have experienced a turbulent business environment during the last thre e years 
during this period we have witnessed dramatically reduced spending o n information technology 
only during the last half of have we see n accelerated spending on information technology from our customers 
we deriv e approximately seventy two percent of our revenue from the united states marke t and approximately twenty eight percent from international markets 
the u 
s economy is showing early indications of moderate expansion while growth i n europe remains sluggish 
growth in asia is expanding rapidly but represents a much smaller base of business for us compared to the united states market 
w e operate in an international economy and are subject to the inherent risks o f foreign exchange  regulatory compliance  intellectual property infringement an d interest rate risk 
we believe the electronic content management market wil l out perform average information technology spending based on industry analysts opinions and our own customers statements regarding their it investmen t priorities in the next several years 
there was a significant consolidation in the electronic content managemen t market space during several competitors that previously offered only poin t solutions to specific content management problems now provide a suite o f solutions rendering them as more viable competitors to us 
these competitor s must now integrate these various point solutions  based on several differen t technologies  into an application that a prospective customer could conside r deploying on an enterprise wide basis 
we have taken a different approach b y focusing primarily on internal development to provide an integrated solution 
w e have  however  acquired certain specific third party technologies that enhanc e our products capabilities 
for example  we acquired and integrated web conten t and electronic forms technologies into our filenet p framework during an d we face several challenges in executing our strategy of growth an d profitability in the future 
our strategy is to o leverage the investment we have made in research and developmen t through increased software license sales  o continue to sell our software to customers who will deploy multipl e applications across their enterprises based on the filenet p architecture  o manage our research and development expenditures through a balance d approach of internal development  offshore development  and thir d party licensing and technology acquisitions  o increase our marketing and sales productivity to effectively an d efficiently address each vertical market and each account segment  an d o maintain high customer satisfaction levels to ensure continued renewa l of maintenance contracts 
we believe we are well positioned for continued growth and profitability i f we can execute our business strategy

revenue by geography 
the following table sets forth total revenue b y geography and as a percentage of total revenue for the periods indicated revenue by geography in thousands increase increase year ended december  decrease decrease total united states revenue   europe   asia pacific   canada   other   total international revenue   total revenue   united states revenue international revenue total revenue contribution international revenue represents approximately of total revenue an d grew more rapidly than domestic revenue in both and europe is ou r largest international market and total revenues in europe grew by during th e period from to asia is a much smaller market  but produced revenu e growth of during the period from to we made significan t investments in the asia pacific region to support the revenue growth that w e believe will continue to increase in countries such as china and india 
w e expect international revenue to continue to represent a significant percentag e of total revenue 
however  international revenues will be adversely affected i f the us dollar strengthens against certain major international currencies or i f international economic conditions remain relatively weak 
revenue by reporting segment 
the following table sets forth total revenue b y reporting segment and as a percentage of total revenue for the period s indicated revenue by reporting segment in thousands increase increase year ended december  decrease decrease 
software   customer support   professional services and education   hardware   total revenue   software customer support professional services and education hardware 
total revenue contribution software 
software revenue consists of fees earned from the licensing o f our software products to our customers 
software revenue increased by i n compared to  and by in compared to the increase i n software revenue during both periods was primarily due to an increase in deman d for enterprise content management and business process management solutions additionally  our existing customers primarily drove this demand in our ke y vertical industries of banking  insurance and government 
we saw these customer s increase usage of existing applications and new applications of our software 
w e believe the it spending environment improved during the past two fiscal year s and more significantly during the last half of as we experienced the retur n of larger software deployments by some of our customers 
we believe these trend s will continue in with a moderate  but steady improvement in it spending o n enterprise content management and business process management software 
customer support 
customer support revenue consists of revenue fro m software maintenance contracts  fee for service revenues and the sale of spar e parts and supplies 
maintenance contracts entitle our customers to receiv e technical support  bug fixes and upgrades to new versions of software release s when and if available 
customer support revenue increased by in compared to and by in compared to these increases i n customer support revenue reflect an increase in our overall customer installe d base combined with a high rate of renewal in the existing customer base customer support revenue is directly related to the sale of software licenses i n prior periods 
customer support revenue grew more slowly in both and compared to the growth rate in previous years as a result of reduced softwar e sales growth in and and software support pricing pressure 
a prolonged economic slowdown negatively affects the growth rate of custome r support revenue as this revenue stream is directly related to software revenu e growth over time 
however  we believe we will continue to experience a high rat e of renewal on maintenance contracts  as our customers tend to deploy missio n critical applications using our software to manage content 
professional services and education 
professional services and educatio n revenue is generated primarily from consulting and implementation services t o end users of our software products  technical consulting services provided t o our resellers  and training services 
no modifications are made to our standar d base product code once the software has been sold 
professional services ar e generally performed on a time and material basis 
professional services an d education revenue decreased by in compared to and by i n compared to the decrease during the last two years is reflective o f the economic slow down that began in  resulting in fewer and smalle r consulting engagements and increased pricing pressures 
professional service s revenue and education revenue is dependent on the level and the nature o f software sales in prior years particularly new customer sales 
professiona l services revenue was strong in as a result of strong software sales in to new customers 
however  with the decline in software revenue in professional services revenue in started to decrease and this tren d continued into another contributing factor to the decrease in professiona l services revenue for the past two years is that software revenue has bee n characterized by repeat purchases for additional software licenses that do no t require large scale professional services engagements 
we believe we wil l experience a moderate  but steady improvement in professional services an d education revenue in based on the software revenue trends we experience d during the last half of hardware 
hardware revenue is generated primarily from the sale of ou r inch osar libraries 
hardware revenue decreased by in compared t o and by in compared to the decline in hardware revenu e reflects that hardware is not a strategic focus for us 
cost of revenue cost of revenue by reporting segment 
the following table sets forth tota l cost of revenue by reporting segment and as a percentage of total cost o f revenue by reporting segment for the periods indicated cost of revenue by reporting segment in thousands increase increase year ended december  decrease decrease software   customer support   professional services and education   hardware   total cost of revenue   software customer support professional services and education hardware total cost of revenue as a of segment revenue software 
cost of software revenue includes royalties paid to third partie s for technology embedded in our products to enhance features and functionality amortization of acquired technology  media costs  and the cost to manufactur e and distribute software 
the cost of software revenue as a percent of softwar e revenue increased by in compared to and by in compare d to the increase in cost of software revenue during both periods i s primarily the result of an increase in royalty costs due to increase d utilization of new third party software products and the amortization o f acquired technology resulting from the egrail acquisition in april and th e shana acquisition in april going forward we anticipate cost of softwar e revenue to be approximately of cost of revenue as we continue to integrat e third party technology with our products 
customer support 
cost of customer support revenue includes the cost o f customer support personnel  facility and technology infrastructure expenses i n our call centers  supplies and spare parts 
the cost of customer support revenu e as a percent of customer support revenue decreased by in compared t o and by in compared to these reductions in cost of custome r support revenue are attributable to employee reductions and efficienc y improvements in the delivery of technical support 
we expect the cost o f customer support revenue to remain at approximately of customer suppor t revenue for the near future 
professional services and education 
cost of professional services an d education revenue consists primarily of the costs of professional service s personnel  training personnel  and third party contractors 
the cost o f professional services and education revenue  as a percent of professiona l services and education revenue  decreased by in compared to an d increased by in compared to the reduction in the use of externa l third party independent consultants and lower variable compensation for interna l employees contributed to maintaining essentially flat operating costs as a percent of professional services and education revenue during both periods 
w e expect professional services and education costs as a percentage of professiona l services and education revenue to vary from period to period depending on th e utilization rates of internal resources and the mix between internal an d external service providers 
hardware 
cost of hardware revenue includes the cost of assembling our osa r library products  the cost of hardware integration personnel  warranty costs an d distribution costs 
the cost of hardware revenue decreased by in compared to and decreased by in compared to th e year to year decreases in absolute dollars are directly related to decrease d hardware revenue 
hardware cost as a percent of hardware revenue has no t decreased proportionally because fixed costs have not decreased at the same rat e as hardware revenue 
hardware is no longer a strategic focus for us 
operating expenses total operating expenses

our research and development efforts are focuse d on enhancing and maintaining our enterprise content management capabilitie s within the filenet p product line 
these efforts focus on existing products an d developing additional capabilities to our filenet p platform and suites such a s business process management  web content management  records management  tea m collaboration and other capabilities 
we seek to achieve our development objectives through both internal an d external resources  and by obtaining third party technology to enhance produc t capabilities through licensing agreements and acquisitions 
during w e initiated a program involving offshore development in lower labor cos t countries 
during we expanded this offshore development effort to includ e both product sustainment and product development activities 
during w e acquired shana to integrate their electronics forms capabilities into ou r products 
during we acquired egrail to integrate their web conten t management capabilities into our products 
see note to the notes to th e consolidated financial statements 
our research and development expense consists primarily of personnel cost s for software developers  third party contracted development efforts and relate d facilities costs 
research and development expense increased by in compared to and by in compared to the number of researc h and development personnel was in  in and in the majority of the million increase in research and developmen t expenses from to is attributable to the acquisition of shana  the ful l year cost of the egrail development team  extensive investment developmen t efforts to enhance content management with new capabilities and increase d offshore development expense 
increased numbers of internal employees resulte d in higher compensation  benefits and relocation costs related to the integratio n of the egrail and shana acquisitions in april of and  respectively the majority of the million increase in research and development expense s from to is primarily attributable to the acquisition of egrail tha t resulted in additional facility and employee expenses 
this acquisition resulte d in an increase in compensation expense primarily due to increased numbers o f personnel as well as an increase in consulting costs due to the expanded use o f contractors 
we intend to complement internal development with offshore development a s well as with third party software through oem agreements and may execut e additional technology acquisitions 
over time  we believe we will be able t o lower our per developer cost through the use of offshore resources 
however  i n the near term  some duplicate expenses will be incurred as our developmen t programs are transitioned to offshore developers 
offshore development costs fo r the months ended december  was million compared to millio n for we believe that research and development expenditures  includin g compensation of technical personnel  are essential to maintaining ou r competitive position 
we expect research and development expense to be a t approximately of revenue in the near term 
selling and marketing 
we sell our products through a direct sales forc e and our indirect channel sales partners 
our selling and marketing expens e consists primarily of salaries  benefits  sales commissions and other expense s related to the direct and indirect sales force and personnel cost for marketin g and market development programs 
selling and marketing expense increased by in compared to and decreased by in compared to the number of sales an d marketing employees was in compared to in marketing personne l increased by employees while sales personnel decreased by employees yielding the net increase of employees during this shift in sales an d marketing capacity was predicated on our customer engagement initiative  whic h we implemented in and this initiative prescribed a smaller direc t sales force  increased channel partner business and increased marketin g personnel with deep vertical industry knowledge and demand generatio n capabilities 
the increase in sales and marketing expense of million reflects a higher salary mix as well as higher variable compensation associated with highe r revenue in compared to personnel related expenses including salarie s and benefits increased million year over year 
higher software revenue i n resulted in higher commission expense of million 
travel  training recruitment and marketing programs related to the filenet p product release i n accounted for the balance of the increase 
the decrease in absolute dollar s from to was primarily due to a reduction in recruitment expenses as well as a reduction in sales commission expense 
charges in fo r severance of million related to workforce reductions and  fo r facility consolidation costs  primarily in sales  also contributed to the highe r costs in compared to and led to reduced costs in we expect selling and marketing expense to remain at approximately o f revenue in the near term 
general and administrative 
our general and administrative expense consist s primarily of salaries  benefits  and other expenses related to personnel cost s for finance  information technology  legal  human resources and genera l management  and the cost of outside professional services 
general and administrative expense increased slightly by in compared to and decreased by in compared to general an d administrative expenses remained relatively stable when comparing to and primarily as a result of expense controls 
we expect general and administrative expense to remain at approximately of revenue in the near term 
purchased in process research and development 
there was no in proces s research and development expense associated with our april acquisition o f shana 
our egrail acquisition in april of certain assets and certai n liabilities of egrail resulted in an allocation of  to in proces s research and development 
the allocation was determined through establishe d valuation techniques in the high technology industry by an independen t third party appraiser 
in process research and development was expensed upo n acquisition because technological feasibility had not been established and n o future alternative uses existed 
new product development underway at egrail a t the time of the acquisition included the next generation of their web conten t management product that was in the early stages of design and only complet e at the date of the acquisition 
the cost to complete the project was estimate d at approximately million to occur over a twelve month period 
however actual costs upon completion at march  were million 
there wa s no in process research and development expense during amortization of goodwill 
there was no amortization of goodwill expens e during and as we ceased amortizing goodwill and assembled workforc e beginning january  based on the adoption of sfas no 
in connectio n with our acquisition of certain assets from api on may   the purchas e price amount allocated to goodwill of million was being amortized i n operating expenses over a useful life of five years and assembled workforce o f  was being amortized over a useful life of three years 
assemble d workforce no longer meets the definition of a separately identified intangibl e asset under the provisions of sfas no 
 business combinations  and th e un amortized balance of  at december  was reclassified a s goodwill at january  sfas no 
was also effective for busines s combinations that occurred after june  accordingly  goodwill of million that was recorded in april in connection with the egrai l acquisition and goodwill of million that was recorded in april i n connection with the shana acquisition is not amortized 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill and other intangible assets wit h indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized  but instead be tested fo r impairment at least annually and written down when impaired 
in accordance wit h this standard  we do not amortize goodwill and indefinite life intangible asset s but evaluate their carrying value annually or when events or circumstance s indicate that their carrying value may be impaired 
as of the first day of jul y of each year  goodwill is tested for impairment by determining if the carryin g value of each reporting unit exceeds its fair value 
we engaged an independen t valuation firm to determine the business enterprise value for each of our thre e reporting units and to perform an impairment analysis as of july  i n accordance with sfas the analysis indicated there was no impairment o f goodwill in any of the three reporting units 
as of december   n o impairment of goodwill has been recognized 
if estimates change  a materiall y different impairment conclusion could result 
amortization of purchased intangible assets 
the april purchase o f egrail assets resulted in intangible assets comprised of acquired technology o f million and patents of  with assigned useful lives of five year s and two years  respectively 
the april purchase of shana resulted in million of intangible assets  comprised of acquired technology of million customer maintenance relationships of  technology manuals and desig n documents of  and non compete agreements of  all intangibl e assets for the shana acquisition were assigned a useful life of five years non compete agreements with former executives of shana were assigned a usefu l life of between two and three years 
we determined that these assets were no t impaired at december  amortization of patents are reported as researc h and development expense  amortization of non compete agreements are reported a s general and administrative expense  while acquired technology  custome r maintenance relationships and technical manuals and design documents ar e reported as cost of revenue 
interest  other income and expenses  net 
other income  net consist s primarily of interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents  short an d long term investments  and other items including foreign exchange gains an d losses and interest expense 
other income  net of other expenses  was million in  million in and million in the decrease i n from of million was primarily attributable to a lower net foreig n exchange gain of approximately  due to a significant weakening of th e dollar against the euro in  and reduced interest income of approximatel y  due to a lower weighted average interest rate in compared to the weighted average interest rate earned on cash  cash equivalents an d investments was in  in and in other expense i n included a million litigation settlement charge 
provision for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes was millio n in  compared to million in  and a benefit of million i n the effective tax rate was  and for the years ended decembe r   and  respectively 
the increased tax rate in wa s primarily due to the mix of income earned between the domestic group versus th e foreign subsidiaries 
as of december   we have a net tax deferred asse t related to domestic operations of approximately million and a valuatio n allowance of approximately million 
the company is currently assessing it s valuation allowance related to our deferred tax assets 
recoverability of th e deferred tax assets is dependent on continued profitability from operations should our level of profitability continue as expected  we would likely remov e the entire valuation allowance in we would realize a one time  non cas h benefit by decreasing our tax expense causing an increase in earnings b y approximately million to million 
additionally  we would record a non cash charge to increase additional reported paid in capital by approximatel y million 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   cash and cash equivalents  and investments wer e million  an increase of million from million at december cash provided by operating activities in was million an d resulted primarily from depreciation and amortization of million  ne t income of million  decreased accounts receivable of million an d increased accrued compensation and benefits of million 
the days sale s outstanding metric decreased to thirty six days by december  fro m forty seven days at december  due to strong collections

cash provided by operating activities in was million an d resulted primarily from net income of million  and depreciation an d amortization of million 
these were partially offset by increased account s receivable of million resulting from increased revenue in the fourt h quarter of compared to  an increase of million in prepai d expenses such as prepaid insurance due to higher insurance premiums in an d increases in prepaid royalty related to the addition of new third part y licensing agreements in  and a decrease in income tax payable of million

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relate s primarily to our investment portfolio 
we have not used derivative financia l instruments in our investment portfolio 
we place our investments wit h high quality issuers and  by policy  limit the amount of credit exposure to an y one issuer 
we protect and preserve our invested funds by limiting default market and reinvestment risk 
our investments in marketable securities consis t primarily of high grade corporate and government securities with maturities o f less than three years 
investments purchased with an original maturity of thre e months or less are considered to be cash equivalents 
we classify all of ou r investments as available for sale 
available for sale securities are carried a t fair value  with unrealized gains and losses  net of tax  reported in a separat e component of stockholders equity 
average maturity of our investment portfoli o is months  therefore  the movement of interest rates should not have a material impact on our balance sheet or income statement 
at any time  a significant increase decrease in interest rates will have a n impact on the fair market value and interest earnings of our investmen t portfolio 
we do not currently hedge this interest rate exposure 
we hav e performed a sensitivity analysis as of december  and  using a modeling technique that measures the change in the fair values arising from a hypothetical basis points and basis points adverse movement in the level s of interest rates across the entire yield curve  which are representative o f historical movements in the federal funds rate with all other variables hel d constant 
the analysis covers our investment and is based on th e weighted average maturity of our investments as of december  and the sensitivity analysis indicated that a hypothetical basis points advers e movement in interest rates would result in a loss in the fair values of ou r investment instruments of approximately  at december  an d approximately  at december  similarly a hypothetical basi s points adverse movement in interest rates would result in a loss in the fai r values of our investments of approximately  at december  an d approximately  at december  the following table provides information about our investment portfolio a t december  in thousands estimated fair cost value debt securities due in one year or less short term munis taxable   corporate   governments agencies   total due in one year   due in one to three years corporate   government agencies   total due in one to three years   grand total   actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities because the issue r of the securities may have the right to repurchase such securities 
we classif y short term investments in current assets  as all such investments are availabl e for current operations 
foreign currency fluctuations our performance can be affected by changes in foreign currency value s relative to the us dollar in relation to our revenue and operating expenses we have entered into forward foreign exchange contracts primarily to hedg e amounts due from and the net assets of selected subsidiaries denominated i n foreign currencies mainly in europe and asia pacific against fluctuations i n exchange rates 
we have not entered into forward foreign exchange contracts fo r speculative or trading purposes 
our accounting policies for these contracts ar e based on our designation of the contracts as hedging transactions 
the criteri a we use for designating a contract as a hedge include the contract s effectiveness in risk reduction and one to one matching of derivativ e instruments to underlying transactions 
gains and losses on foreign exchang e contracts are recognized in income in the same period as gains and losses on th e underlying transactions 
if an underlying hedged transaction were terminate d earlier than initially anticipated  the offsetting gain or loss on the relate d forward foreign exchange contract would be recognized in income in the sam e period 
in addition  since we enter into forward contracts only as a hedge  an y change in currency rates would not result in any material net gain or loss  a s any gain or loss on the underlying foreign currency denominated balance would b e offset by the gain or loss on the forward contract 
our forward contract s generally have an original maturity of three months 
as of december   w e had forward foreign exchange contracts outstanding totaling approximatel y  in ten currencies 
these contracts were opened on the last business da y of the quarter and mature within three months 
cumulative other comprehensive income increased from a loss of millio n in  to a gain of million at the end of  due primarily to million of unrealized foreign currency translation gains resulting from th e strengthening of the euro against the us dollar during
