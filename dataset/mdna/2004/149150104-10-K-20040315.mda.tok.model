competition the banking business in california  and specifically in the market areas served by most of the bank s branch offices  is highly competitive 
the bank competes for deposits and loans with other commercial banks  savings and thrift institutions  brokerage houses  insurance companies  mortgage companies  credit unions  credit card companies and other financial and non financial institutions and entities 
in addition  the bank also competes with other entities both governmental and private industry that are seeking to raise capital through the issuance and sale of debt and equity securities 
many of these institutions and entities offer services that are not offered directly by the bank and have substantially greater financial resources than does the bank 
the direction of federal legislation in recent years seems to favor increased competition between different types of financial institutions and to foster new entrants into the financial services market 
competitive conditions are expected to continue to intensify as legislation is enacted which will have the effect of eliminating historical barriers that limit participation in certain markets  increasing the cost of doing business for banks  or affecting the competitive balance between banks and other financial and non financial institutions and entities 
technological factors  such as on line banking and brokerage services  and economic factors are also expected to increase competitive conditions

regulation and supervision general bancorp and the bank are subject to significant regulation and restrictions by federal and state regulatory agencies 
the following discussion of statutes and regulations is only a brief summary and does not purport to be complete 
this discussion is qualified in its entirety by reference to the statutes and regulations referred to 
no assurance can be given that these statutes and regulations will not change in the future 
holding company regulation bancorp is a bank holding company within the meaning of the bank holding company act and is registered as such with the federal reserve board 
a bank holding company is required to file with the federal reserve board annual reports and other information regarding its business operations and those of its subsidiaries 
it is also subject to examination by the federal reserve board and is required to obtain federal reserve board approval before acquiring  directly or indirectly  ownership or control of any voting shares of any bank if it would thereby directly or indirectly own or control more than of the voting stock of that bank  unless it already owns a majority of the voting stock 
in  the federal reserve board adopted a policy for risk focused supervision of small bank holding companies that do not engage in significant non banking activities 
under this policy  examinations focus on whether a bank holding company has systems in place to manage the risks inherent in its business 
in analyzing risk  the federal reserve board looks at the financial condition of the holding company and its subsidiary banks  management  compliance with laws and regulations  inter company transactions and any new or contemplated activities 
the federal reserve board has by regulation determined certain activities in which a bank holding company may or may not engage 
with certain exceptions  a bank holding company may engage only in the business of banking or managing or controlling banks or furnishing services to or performing services for its subsidiary banks or activities that are closely related to banking activities 
the permissible activities and affiliations of certain bank holding companies have recently been expanded 
see section below entitled financial modernization act 
a holding company for a bank and any subsidiary which it acquires or organizes are deemed to be affiliates of the bank within the meaning set forth in the federal reserve act and are subject to the federal reserve act 
this means  for example  that there are limitations on loans by the bank to affiliates  on investments by the bank in any affiliate s stock and on the bank s taking any affiliate s stock as collateral for loans to any borrower 
all affiliate transactions must satisfy certain limitations and otherwise be on terms and conditions that are consistent with safe and sound banking practices 
in this regard  banks generally may not purchase from any affiliate a low quality asset as that term is defined in the federal reserve act 
also  transactions by the bank with an affiliate must be on substantially the same terms as would be available for non affiliates 
the bancorp and the bank are currently subject to these restrictions 
bancorp and the bank are also subject to certain restrictions with respect to underwriting  public sale and distribution of securities 
they are also prohibited from engaging in certain tie in arrangements in connection with the extension of credit 
for example  generally the bank may not extend credit on the condition that the customer obtain some additional service from the bank or its parent company  or refrain from obtaining such service from a competitor 

table of contents bank regulation federal law mandates frequent examinations of all banks  with the costs of examinations to be assessed against the bank 
the bank s primary federal regulator is the federal deposit insurance corporation  or the fdic 
the federal banking regulatory agencies have substantial enforcement powers over the depository institutions that they regulate 
civil and criminal penalties may be imposed on such institutions and persons associated with those institutions for violations of laws or regulation 
as a california state chartered bank whose accounts are insured by the fdic up to a maximum of  per depositor  the bank is subject to regulation  supervision  and regular examination by the california commissioner of financial institutions  or the california commissioner  and the fdic  and must comply with applicable regulations of the federal reserve board 
the regulations of these agencies govern most aspects of the bank s business  including the making of periodic reports  its activities relating to dividends  investments  loans  borrowings  capital requirements  certain check clearing activities  branching  mergers and acquisitions  reserves against deposits and numerous other areas 
supervision  legal action  and examination by these agencies is generally intended to protect depositors  creditors  borrowers and the deposit insurance fund and generally is not intended for the protection of stockholders 
the activities of the bank are also regulated by state law 
state law  for example  regulates certain loans to officers of the bank  directly or indirectly  or to any related corporation in which such officer is a shareholder  director  officer or employee 
subject to certain limitations  california law permits california state chartered banks to invest in the stock and equity securities of other corporations  to engage directly in  or invest directly in subsidiaries which conduct  real estate related activities including property management and real estate appraisal  and to participate in management consulting and data processing services for third parties 
the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of  or fdicia  limits the powers  including investment authority  of state banks to those activities that are either permitted to national banks  or activities that the fdic finds do not pose a significant risk to the deposit insurance fund 
in november  the fdic announced that it would make it easier for well run state banks to engage in real estate and securities underwriting  if permitted by state law 
state banks are now required to file notice of intention to engage in such activities 
fdicia places limits on brokered deposits and extends the limits to any bank that is not well capitalized or has been notified that it is in troubled condition 
a well capitalized institution which generally includes an institution that is considered well capitalized for purposes of the prompt corrective action regulations discussed below may still accept brokered deposits without restriction  unless it has been informed by its appropriate federal regulatory agency that it is in troubled condition 
all other insured depository institutions are prohibited from accepting brokered deposits unless a waiver is obtained from the fdic 
if a waiver is obtained  the interest paid on deposits may not exceed the rate paid for deposits in the bank s normal market area  or the national rate as determined in the fdic s regulation 
capital adequacy requirements the bancorp is subject to the capital adequacy regulations of the federal reserve board  and the bank is subject to the capital adequacy regulations of fdicia 
those regulations incorporate both risk based and leverage capital requirements 
each of the federal regulators has established risk based and leverage capital guidelines for banks or bank holding companies it regulates  which set total capital requirements and define capital in terms of core capital elements  or tier capital  and supplemental capital elements  or tier capital 
tier capital is generally defined as the sum of the core capital elements less goodwill and certain other deductions  notably the unrealized net gains or losses after tax adjustments on available for sale investment securities carried at fair market value 
the following items are defined as core capital elements i common shareholders equity  ii qualifying non cumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus  and iii minority interests in the equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries 
trust preferred securities may also 
table of contents constitute up to of tier capital 
supplementary capital elements include i allowance for loan and lease losses but not more than of an institution s risk weighted assets  ii perpetual preferred stock and related surplus not qualifying as core capital  iii hybrid capital instruments  perpetual debt and mandatory convertible debt instruments  and iv term subordinated debt and intermediate term preferred stock and related surplus 
the maximum amount of supplemental capital elements which qualifies as tier capital is limited to of tier capital  net of goodwill 
the minimum required ratio of qualifying total capital to total risk weighted assets  or the total risk based capital ratio  is  at least one half of which must be in the form of tier capital  and the minimum required ratio of tier capital to total risk weighted assets  or the tier risk based capital ratio  is 
risk based capital ratios are calculated to provide a measure of capital that reflects the degree of risk associated with a banking organization s operations for both transactions reported on the balance sheet as assets  and transactions  such as letters of credit and recourse arrangements  which are recorded as off balance sheet items 
under the risk based capital guidelines  the nominal dollar amounts of assets and credit equivalent amounts of off balance sheet items are multiplied by one of several risk adjustment percentages  which range from for assets with low credit risk  such as certain us treasury securities  to for assets with relatively high credit risk  such as business loans 
as of december   the bank s total risk based capital ratio was  and its tier risk based capital ratio was 
as of december   bancorp s total risk based capital ratio was and its tier risk based capital ratio was 
the risk based capital requirements also take into account concentrations of credit ie  relatively large proportions of loans involving one borrower  industry  location  collateral or loan type and the risks of non traditional activities those that have not customarily been part of the banking business 
the regulations require institutions with high or inordinate levels of risk to operate with higher minimum capital standards  and authorize the regulators to review an institution s management of such risks in assessing an institution s capital adequacy 
the risk based capital regulations also include exposure to interest rate risk as a factor that the regulators will consider in evaluating a bank s capital adequacy 
interest rate risk is the exposure of a bank s current and future earnings and equity capital arising from adverse movements in interest rates 
while interest risk is inherent in a bank s role as financial intermediary  it introduces volatility to bank earnings and to the economic value of the institution 
the fdic and the federal reserve board also require the maintenance of a leverage capital ratio designed to supplement the risk based capital guidelines 
banks and bank holding companies that have received the highest rating of the five categories used by regulators to rate banks and are not anticipating or experiencing any significant growth must maintain a ratio of tier capital net of all intangibles to adjusted total assets of at least 
all other institutions are required to maintain a leverage ratio of at least to basis points above the minimum  for a minimum of to 
pursuant to federal regulations  banks must maintain capital levels commensurate with the level of risk to which they are exposed  including the volume and severity of problem loans  and federal regulators may  however  set higher capital requirements when a bank s particular circumstances warrant 
as of december   the bank s leverage capital ratio was  and the bancorp s leverage capital ratio was  both ratios exceeding regulatory minimums 
prompt corrective action provisions federal law requires each federal banking agency to take prompt corrective action to resolve the problems of insured financial institutions  including but not limited to those that fall below one or more prescribed minimum capital ratios 
the federal banking agencies have by regulation defined the following five capital categories well capitalized total risk based capital ratio of  tier risk based capital ratio of  and leverage capital ratio of  adequately capitalized total risk based capital ratio of  tier risk based capital ratio of  and leverage capital ratio of or if the institution receives the highest rating from its primary regulator  undercapitalized total risk based capital ratio of less than  tier risk based capital 
table of contents ratio of less than  or leverage capital ratio of less than or if the institution receives the highest rating from its primary regulator  significantly undercapitalized total risk based capital ratio of less than  tier risk based capital ratio of less than  or leverage capital ratio less than  and critically undercapitalized tangible equity to total assets less than 
a bank may be treated as though it were in the next lower capital category if after notice and the opportunity for a hearing  the appropriate federal agency finds an unsafe or unsound condition or practice so warrants  but no bank may be treated as critically undercapitalized unless its actual capital ratio warrants such treatment 
at each successively lower capital category  an insured bank is subject to increased restrictions on its operations 
for example  a bank is generally prohibited from paying management fees to any controlling persons or from making capital distributions if to do so would make the bank undercapitalized 
asset growth and branching restrictions apply to undercapitalized banks  which are required to submit written capital restoration plans meeting specified requirements including a guarantee by the parent holding company  if any 
significantly undercapitalized banks are subject to broad regulatory authority  including among other things  capital directives  forced mergers  restrictions on the rates of interest they may pay on deposits  restrictions on asset growth and activities  and prohibitions on paying certain bonuses without fdic approval 
even more severe restrictions apply to critically undercapitalized banks 
most importantly  except under limited circumstances  not later than days after an insured bank becomes critically undercapitalized  the appropriate federal banking agency is required to appoint a conservator or receiver for it 
in addition to measures taken under the prompt corrective action provisions  insured banks may be subject to potential actions by the federal regulators for unsafe or unsound practices in conducting their businesses or for violations of any law  rule  regulation or any condition imposed in writing by the agency or any written agreement with the agency 
enforcement actions may include the issuance of cease and desist orders  termination of insurance of deposits in the case of a bank  the imposition of civil money penalties  the issuance of directives to increase capital  formal and informal agreements  or removal and prohibition orders against institution affiliated parties 
safety and soundness standards the federal banking agencies have also adopted guidelines establishing safety and soundness standards for all insured depository institutions 
those guidelines relate to internal controls  information systems  internal audit systems  loan underwriting and documentation  compensation and interest rate exposure 
in general  the standards are designed to assist the federal banking agencies in identifying and addressing problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired 
if an institution fails to meet these standards  the appropriate federal banking agency may require the institution to submit a compliance plan and institute enforcement proceedings if an acceptable compliance plan is not submitted 
premiums for deposit insurance the fdic regulations also implement a risk based premium system  whereby insured depository institutions are required to pay insurance premiums depending on their risk classification 
under this system  institutions such as the bank that are insured by the bank insurance fund are categorized into one of three capital categories well capitalized  adequately capitalized  and undercapitalized and one of three supervisory categories based on federal regulatory evaluations 
the three supervisory categories are financially sound with only a few minor weaknesses group a  demonstrates weaknesses that could result in significant deterioration group b  and poses a substantial probability of loss group c 

table of contents the capital ratios used by the fdic to define well capitalized  adequately capitalized and undercapitalized are the same in the fdic s prompt corrective action regulations 
the current bank insurance fund base assessment rates expressed as cents per of deposits are summarized as follows group a group b group c well capitalized adequately capitalized undercapitalized in addition  banks must pay a fluctuating amount towards the retirement of the financing corporation bonds issued in the s to assist in the recovery of the savings and loan industry 
dividends holders of bancorp common stock are entitled to receive dividends as and when declared by the board of directors out of funds legally available therefor under the laws of the state of delaware 
delaware corporations such as the bancorp may make distributions to their stockholders out of their surplus  or out of their net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend is declared and for the preceding fiscal year 
however  dividends may not be paid out of a corporation s net profits if  after the payment of the dividend  the corporation s capital would be less than the capital represented by the issued and outstanding stock of all classes having a preference upon the distribution of assets 
the federal reserve board has advised bank holding companies that it believes that payment of cash dividends in excess of current earnings from operations is inappropriate and may be cause for supervisory action 
as a result of this policy  banks and their holding companies may find it difficult to pay dividends out of retained earnings from historical periods prior to the most recent fiscal year or to take advantage of earnings generated by extraordinary items such as sales of buildings or other large assets in order to generate profits to enable payment of future dividends 
further  the federal reserve board s position that holding companies are expected to provide a source of managerial and financial strength to their subsidiary banks potentially restricts a bank holding company s ability to pay dividends 
the bank is a legal entity that is separate and distinct from its holding company 
the bancorp receives income through dividends paid by the bank 
subject to the regulatory restrictions described below  future cash dividends by the bank will depend upon management s assessment of future capital requirements  contractual restrictions  and other factors 
the powers of the board of directors of the bank to declare a cash dividend to its holding company is subject to california law  which restricts the amount available for cash dividends to the lesser of the retained earnings or the bank s net income for its last three fiscal years less any distributions to shareholders made during such period 
where the above test is not met  cash dividends may still be paid  with the prior approval of the california commissioner in an amount not exceeding the greatest of retained earnings of the bank  the net income of the bank for its last fiscal year  or the net income of the bank for its current fiscal year 
as of december   the maximum dividend that the bank could have declared  subject to regulatory approval  was million 
under the federal deposit insurance act  bank regulators also have authority to prohibit a bank from engaging in business practices which are considered to be unsafe or unsound 
it is possible  depending upon the financial condition of a bank and other factors  that such regulators could assert that the payment of dividends or other payments might  under certain circumstances  be an unsafe or unsound practice  even if technically permissible 

table of contents community reinvestment act the bank is subject to certain requirements and reporting obligations involving community reinvestment act  or cra  activities 
the cra generally requires the federal banking agencies to evaluate the record of a financial institution in meeting the credit needs of its local communities  including low and moderate income neighborhoods 
the cra further requires the agencies to take into account a financial institution s record of meeting its community credit needs when evaluating applications for  among other things  domestic branches  consummating mergers or acquisitions  or holding company formations 
in measuring a bank s compliance with its cra obligations  the regulators utilize a performance based evaluation system which bases cra ratings on the bank s actual lending service and investment performance  rather than on the extent to which the institution conducts needs assessments  documents community outreach activities or complies with other procedural requirements 
in connection with its assessment of cra performance  the fdic assigns a rating of outstanding  satisfactory  needs to improve or substantial noncompliance 
in its most recently released public reports  from january  the bank received a satisfactory rating 
other consumer protection laws and regulations examination and enforcement have become intense  and banks have been advised to monitor carefully compliance with various consumer protection laws and their implementing regulations 
the federal interagency task force on fair lending issued a policy statement on discrimination in home mortgage lending describing three methods that federal agencies will use to prove discrimination overt evidence of discrimination  evidence of disparate treatment  and evidence of disparate impact 
due to heightened regulatory concern related to compliance with consumer protection laws and regulations generally  the bank may incur additional compliance costs or be required to expend additional funds for investments in the local communities it serves 
in addition to the other laws and regulations discussed herein  the bank is subject to certain consumer and public interest laws and regulations that are designed to protect customers in transactions with banks 
while the list set forth below is not exhaustive  these laws and regulations include the truth in lending act  the truth in savings act  the electronic funds transfer act  the expedited funds availability act  the equal credit opportunity act  the fair housing act  the real estate settlement procedures act  the home mortgage disclosure act  the fair credit reporting act  the fair debt collection practices act and the right to financial privacy act 
these laws and regulations mandate certain disclosure requirements and regulate the manner in which financial institutions must deal with customers when taking deposits  making loans  collecting loans and providing other services 
the bank must comply with the applicable provisions of these laws and regulations as part of its ongoing customer relations 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations can subject it to various penalties  including but not limited to enforcement actions  injunctions  fines or criminal penalties  punitive damages to consumers and the loss of certain contractual rights 
the americans with disabilities act  in conjunction with similar california legislation  has increased the cost of doing business for banks 
the legislation requires employers with or more employees and all businesses operating commercial facilities or public accommodations to accommodate disabled employees and customers 
the americans with disabilities act has two major objectives i to prevent discrimination against disabled job applicants  job candidates and employees  and ii to provide disabled persons with ready access to commercial facilities and public accommodations 
commercial facilities  such as the bank  must ensure that all new facilities are accessible to disabled persons  and in some instances may be required to adapt existing facilities to make them accessible 
interstate banking and branching the riegle neal interstate banking and branching efficiency act of  or the interstate banking act  regulates the interstate activities of banks and bank holding companies and establishes a framework for nationwide interstate banking and branching 
since june   a bank in one state has generally been permitted to merge with a bank in another state without the need for explicit state law authorization 
however  
table of contents states were given the ability to prohibit interstate mergers with banks in their own state by opting out enacting state legislation applying equality to all out of state banks prohibiting such mergers prior to june since  adequately capitalized and managed bank holding companies have been permitted to acquire banks located in any state  subject to two exceptions first  any state may still prohibit bank holding companies from acquiring a bank which is less than five years old  and second  no interstate acquisition can be completed by a bank holding company if the acquirer would control more than of the deposits held by insured depository institutions nationwide or or more of the deposits held by insured depository institutions in any state in which the target bank has branches 
a bank may establish and operate de novo branches in any state in which that bank does not maintain a branch if that state has enacted legislation to expressly permit all out of state banks to establish branches in that state 
in  california enacted legislation to implement important provisions of the interstate banking act and to repeal california s previous interstate banking laws  which were largely preempted by the interstate banking act 
the changes effected by the interstate banking act and california laws have increased competition in the environment in which the bank operates to the extent that out of state financial institutions directly or indirectly enter the bank s market areas 
it appears that the interstate banking act has contributed to the accelerated consolidation of the banking industry 
while many large out of state banks have already entered the california market as a result of this legislation  it is not possible to predict the precise impact of this legislation on the bancorp and the bank and the competitive environment in which they operate 
financial modernization act the gramm leach bliley financial modernization act became effective march  it repealed two provisions of the glass steagall act section  which restricted the affiliation of federal reserve member banks with firms engaged principally in specified securities activities  and section  which restricted officer  director  or employee interlocks between a member bank and any company or person primarily engaged in specified securities activities 
in addition  it also contains provisions that expressly preempt any state law restricting the establishment of financial affiliations  primarily related to insurance 
the general effect of the law is to establish a comprehensive framework to permit affiliations among commercial banks  insurance companies  securities firms  and other financial service providers by revising and expanding the bank holding company act framework to permit a holding company system to engage in a full range of financial activities through a new entity known as a financial holding company 
financial activities is broadly defined to include not only banking  insurance  and securities activities  but also merchant banking and additional activities that the federal reserve  in consultation with the secretary of the treasury  determines to be financial in nature  incidental to such financial activities  or complementary activities that do not pose a substantial risk to the safety and soundness of depository institutions or the financial system generally 
generally  the financial modernization act repeals historical restrictions on  and eliminates many federal and state law barriers to  affiliations among banks  securities firms  insurance companies  and other financial service providers  provides a uniform framework for the functional regulation of the activities of banks  savings institutions  and their holding companies  broadens the activities that may be conducted by national banks  banking subsidiaries of bank holding companies  and their financial subsidiaries  provides an enhanced framework for protecting the privacy of consumer information  
table of contents adopts a number of provisions related to the capitalization  membership  corporate governance  and other measures designed to modernize the federal home loan bank system  modifies the laws governing the implementation of the cra  and addresses a variety of other legal and regulatory issues affecting both day to day operations and long term activities of financial institutions 
in order for the bancorp to take advantage of the ability to affiliate with other financial services providers  it must become a financial holding company as permitted under an amendment to the bank holding company act effected by the financial modernization act 
to do so  the bancorp would file a declaration with the federal reserve board electing to engage in activities permissible for financial holding companies and certifying that it is eligible to do so because all of its insured depository institution subsidiaries are well capitalized and well managed 
in addition  the federal reserve must also determine that the insured depository institution subsidiary has at least a satisfactory cra rating 
the bancorp currently meets the requirements to make an election to become a financial holding company  but its management has not made the determination for it to become a financial holding company 
in addition  the bancorp is examining its strategic business plan to determine whether  based on market conditions  the relative financial conditions of the bancorp and its subsidiaries  regulatory capital requirements  general economic conditions  the effect of its merger with gbc bancorp and other factors  the bancorp desires to utilize any of its expanded powers provided in the financial modernization act 
the financial modernization act required that designated federal regulatory agencies  including the fdic  the federal reserve board  the comptroller of the currency and the securities and exchange commission  publish regulations to implement certain provisions of the act 
these agencies have cooperated in the release of rules that establish minimum requirements to be followed by financial institutions for protecting the privacy of financial information provided by consumers 
the agencies rules  which establish privacy standards to be followed by state banks such as the bank  requires a financial institution to i provide notice to customers about its privacy policies and practices  ii describe the conditions under which the institution may disclose nonpublic personal information about consumers to nonaffiliated third parties  and iii provide a method for consumers to prevent the financial institution from disclosing that information to nonaffiliated third parties by opting out of that disclosure 
the financial modernization act also includes a new section of the federal deposit insurance act governing subsidiaries of state banks that engage in activities as principal that would only be permissible for a national bank to conduct in a financial subsidiary 
it expressly preserves the ability of a state bank to retain all existing subsidiaries 
because california permits commercial banks chartered by the state to engage in any activity permissible for national banks  the bank is permitted to form subsidiaries to engage in the activities authorized by the financial modernization act to the same extent as a national bank 
in order to form a financial subsidiary  a bank must be well capitalized and would be subject to the same capital deduction  risk management  and affiliate transaction rules as applicable to national banks 
the bancorp does not believe that the financial modernization act will have a material adverse effect on the bancorp s operations in the near term 
however  to the extent that it permits banks  securities firms  and insurance companies to affiliate  the financial services industry may experience further consolidation 
the financial modernization act is intended to grant to community banks certain powers as a matter of right that larger institutions have accumulated on an ad hoc basis 
nevertheless  this act may have the result of increasing the amount of competition that the bancorp and the bank face from larger institutions and other types of companies offering financial products  many of which may have substantially more financial resources 
regulation w on december   the federal reserve adopted regulation w  the rule that comprehensively implements sections a and b of the federal reserve act 
the rule became effective april  
table of contents sections a and b and regulation w limit the risks to a bank from transactions between the bank and its affiliates and limit the ability of a bank to transfer to its affiliates the benefits arising from the bank s access to insured deposits  the payment system  and the discount window and other benefits of the federal reserve system 
the statute and rule impose quantitative and qualitative limits on the ability of a bank to extend credit to  or engage in certain other transactions with  an affiliate and a nonaffiliate if an affiliate benefits from the transaction 
however  certain transactions that generally do not expose a bank to undue risk or abuse the safety net are exempted from coverage under regulation w 
historically  a subsidiary of a bank was not considered an affiliate for purposes of sections a and b  since their activities were limited to activities permissible for the bank itself 
the financial modernization act authorized financial subsidiaries that may engage in activities not permissible for a bank 
these financial subsidiaries are now considered affiliates 
certain transactions between a financial subsidiary and another affiliate of a bank are also covered by sections a and b under regulation w 
regulation w has certain exemptions  including for state chartered banks  an exemption for subsidiaries lawfully conducting non bank activities before issuance of the final rule 
an exemption for extensions of credit by a bank under a general purpose credit card where the borrower uses the credit to purchase goods or services from an affiliate of the bank  so long as less than of the aggregate amount of purchases with the card are purchases from an affiliate of the bank a bank that does not have non financial affiliates is exempt from the test 
an exemption for loans by a bank to a third party secured by securities issued by a mutual fund affiliate of the bank subject to a number of conditions 
an exemption that would permit a banking organization to engage more expeditiously in internal reorganization transactions involving a bank s purchase of assets from an affiliate subject to a number of conditions 
the final rule contains new valuation rules for a bank s investments in  and acquisitions of  affiliates 
the federal reserve expects examiners and other supervisory staff to review intercompany transactions closely for compliance with the statutes and regulation w and to resolve any violations or potential violations quickly 
sarbanes oxley act the sarbanes oxley act of implemented legislative reforms applicable to companies with securities traded publicly in the united states of america 
the sarbanes oxley act is intended to address corporate and accounting fraud and contains provisions dealing with corporate governance and management  disclosure  oversight of the accounting profession and auditor independence 
although the bancorp anticipates that it will incur additional expenses in complying with the provisions of the sarbanes oxley act  it does not expect that compliance will have a material impact on its financial conditions or results of operations 
source of strength policy according to federal reserve board policy  bank holding companies are expected to act as a source of financial strength to each subsidiary bank and to commit resources to support each such subsidiary 
usa patriot act the terrorist attacks in september impacted the financial services industry and led to the uniting and strengthening america by providing appropriate tools required to intercept and obstruct terrorism act of  or the usa patriot act 
part of the usa patriot act is the international money laundering abatement and financial anti terrorism act of  or imlafata 

table of contents imlafata authorizes the secretary of the treasury  in consultation with the heads of other government agencies  to adopt special measures applicable to banks  bank holding companies  and or other financial institutions 
these measures may include enhanced recordkeeping and reporting requirements for certain financial transactions that are of primary money laundering concern  due diligence requirements concerning the beneficial ownership of certain types of accounts  and restrictions or prohibitions on certain types of accounts with foreign financial institutions 
among its other provisions  imlafata requires each financial institution to i establish an anti money laundering program  ii establish due diligence policies  procedures  and controls with respect to its private banking accounts and correspondent banking accounts involving foreign individuals and certain foreign banks  and iii avoid establishing  maintaining  administering  or managing correspondent accounts in the united states of america for  or on behalf of  a foreign bank that does not have a physical presence in any country 
in addition  imlafata contains a provision encouraging cooperation among financial institutions  regulatory authorities and law enforcement authorities with respect to individuals  entities  and organizations engaged in  or reasonably suspected of engaging in  terrorist acts or money laundering activities 
imlafata expands the circumstances under which funds in a bank account may be forfeited and requires covered financial institutions to respond under certain circumstances to requests for information from federal banking agencies within hours 
imlafata also amends the bank holding company act and the bank merger act to require the federal banking agencies to consider the effectiveness of a financial institution s anti money laundering activities when reviewing an application under these acts 
imlafata became effective july  additional regulations were adopted during and to implement minimum standards to verify customer identity  to encourage cooperation among financial institutions  federal banking agencies  and law enforcement authorities regarding possible money laundering or terrorist activities  to prohibit the anonymous use of concentration accounts  and to require all covered financial institutions to have in place a bank secrecy act compliance program 
bancorp has not determined the impact that imlafata will have on its operations 
cross institution assessments any insured depository institution owned by a bank holding company can be assessed for losses incurred by the fdic in connection with assistance provided to  or the failure of  any other depository institution owned by the bank holding company 
audit requirements the bank is required to have an annual independent audit  alone or as a part of its bank holding company s audit  and to prepare all financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
each bank is also required to have an independent audit committee comprised entirely of outside directors or to have an audit committee with the same composition as its holding company 
under national association of securities dealers nasd certifications  the bancorp has certified that its audit committee has adopted formal written charters and meets the requisite number of directors  independence and qualification standards 
in addition  because the bank has more than billion in total assets  it is subject to the fdic requirements for audit committees of large institutions 
as such  among other requirements  the bancorp must maintain an audit committee which shall include members with banking or related financial management expertise  have access to its own outside counsel  and not include members who are large customers of the bank 
federal home loan bank system the bank is a member of the federal home loan bank fhlb of san francisco 
among other benefits  each fhlb serves as a reserve or central bank for its members within its assigned region 
each fhlb is financed primarily from the sale of consolidated obligations of the fhlb system 
each fhlb makes available loans or 
table of contents advances to its members in compliance with the policies and procedures established by the board of directors of the individual fhlb 
as an fhlb member  we would be required to own capital stock in an fhlb in an amount equal to the greater of of our aggregate outstanding principal amount of its residential mortgage loans  home purchase contracts  and similar obligations at the beginning of each calendar year  or of our fhlb advances or borrowings 
a new capital plan of the fhlb of san francisco was approved by the federal housing finance board and will be implemented on april  the new capital plan incorporates a single class of stock with a par value of per share  which may be issued  exchanged  redeemed  and repurchased only at par value 
each member is to own stock in amount equal to the greater of a membership stock requirement with an initial cap of million of membership asset value as defined  or an activity based stock requirement based on percentage of outstanding advances 
the new capital stock is redeemable on five years written notice  subject to certain conditions 
we do not believe that the initial implementation of the fhlb of san francisco s new capital plan as approved will have a material impact upon our financial condition  cash flows  or results of operations 
however  the bank could be required to purchase as much as additional capital stock or sell as much as of its proposed capital stock requirement at the discretion of the fhlb of san francisco 
impact of monetary policies the earnings and growth of the bank are largely dependent on its ability to maintain a favorable differential or spread between the yield on its interest earning assets and the rates paid on its deposits and other interest bearing liabilities 
as a result  the bank s performance is influenced by general economic conditions  both domestic and foreign  the monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government  and the policies of the regulatory agencies 
the federal reserve board implements national monetary policies such as seeking to curb inflation and combat recession by its open market operations in us government securities  by adjusting the required level of reserves for financial institutions subject to its reserve requirements and by varying the discount rate applicable to borrowings by banks from the federal reserve banks 
the actions of the federal reserve board in these areas influence the growth of bank loans  investments and deposits and also affect interest rates charged on loans and deposits 
the nature and impact of any future changes in monetary policies cannot be predicted 
environmental regulation federal  state and local regulations regarding the discharge of materials into the environment may have an impact on banks and their holding companies 
under federal law  liability for environmental damage and the cost of cleanup may be imposed upon any person or entity that owns or operates contaminated property 
state law provisions  which were modeled after federal law  impose substantially similar requirements 
both federal and state laws were amended in to provide generally that a lender who is not actively involved in operating the contaminated property will not be liable to clean up the property  even if the lender has a security interest in the property or becomes an owner of the property through foreclosure 
the economic growth act includes protection for lenders from liability under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act of by adding a new section which specifies the actions a lender may take with respect to lending and foreclosure activities without incurring environmental clean up liability or responsibility 
under this section  typical contractual provisions regarding environmental issues in the loan documentation and due diligence inspections conducted in connection with lending transactions 
table of contents will not lead to lender liability for clean up  and a lender may foreclose on contaminated property  so long as the lender merely maintains the property and moves to divest it at the earliest possible time 
under california law  a lender generally will not be liable to the state for the cost associated with cleaning up contaminated property unless the lender realized some benefit from the property  failed to divest the property promptly  caused or contributed to the release of the hazardous materials  or made the loan primarily for investment purposes 
the extent of the protection provided by both the federal and state lender protection statutes will depend on the interpretation of those statutes by administrative agencies and courts  and the bancorp cannot predict whether it will be adequately protected for the types of loans made by the bank 
in addition  the bank remains subject to the risk that a borrower s financial position will be impaired by liability under the environmental laws and that property securing a loan made by the bank may be environmentally impaired and therefore not provide adequate security for the loan 
california law provides some protection against the second risk by establishing certain additional alternative remedies for a lender in circumstances where the property securing a loan is later found to be environmentally impaired  permitting the lender to pursue remedies against the borrower other than foreclosure under the deed of trust 
the bank attempts to protect its positions against the remaining environmental risks by performing due diligence 
environmental questionnaires and information on use of toxic substances are requested as part of the bank s underwriting procedures 
the bank makes lending decisions based upon its evaluation of the collateral  the net worth of the borrower  and the borrower s capacity for unforeseen business interruptions or risks 
other pending and proposed legislation other legislative and regulatory initiatives which could affect the bancorp and the bank and the banking industry in general are pending  and additional initiatives may be proposed or introduced  before the us congress  the california legislature  and other governmental bodies in the future 
such proposals  if enacted  may further alter the structure  regulation  and competitive relationship among financial institutions  and may subject the bancorp and the bank to increased regulation  disclosure  and reporting requirements 
in addition  the various banking regulatory agencies often adopt new rules and regulations to implement and enforce existing legislation 
it cannot be predicted whether  or in what form  any such legislation or regulations may be enacted or the extent to which the business of the bancorp or the bank would be affected thereby

the increase in taxable equivalent interest income was due to a combination of the following increase in volume average interest earning assets increased million  to billion in  an increase of over interest earning assets of billion in the increase in volume added million to interest income and was primarily attributable to the merger with gbc bancorp  as well as growth in loans and securities 
decrease in rate the taxable equivalent yield on interest earning assets decreased basis points from in to in as a result of the lower interest rate environment  the yield earned on average loans decreased basis points from to in the same period 
the yield of average taxable securities decreased basis points from in to in due to prepayment  calls  and sales of higher yielding securities 
the decrease in rate reduced interest income by million 

table of contents change in the mix of interest earning assets average gross loans  which generally yield higher than other types of investments  comprised of total average interest bearing assets compared with in interest expense interest expense increased by million to million in compared with million in  primarily due to a combination of the following decrease in rate as a result of the lower interest rate environment during  the average cost of interest bearing liabilities decreased basis points to in compared with in  which reduced interest expense by million

taxable equivalent net interest margin the company s taxable equivalent net interest margin  defined as taxable equivalent net interest income to average interest earning assets  decreased basis points from in to in as a result of the and basis point drops in the federal funds rate in november and june  respectively  the prepayments  calls  and sales of higher yielding securities and the related lagging effect on our interest bearing time deposit accounts 
year compared to year taxable equivalent interest income during  we experienced compression to our taxable equivalent net interest margin due to the declining interest rate environment on a balance sheet that is asset sensitive 
during  the federal open market committee fomc  lowered the target federal funds rate by basis points in rapid succession 
in november  an additional reduction of basis points was approved by the fomc  bringing the total decrease to basis points during and as a commercial bank  most of our loans are variable rate  and reprice each time there is a change in the target federal funds rate 
in response to these conditions  we made efforts to manage our interest earning assets by increasing average loans  and made efforts to obtain lower cost core deposits  thus optimizing the mix of our deposit portfolios 
the impact of these efforts allowed us to maintain our taxable equivalent margin well above the mark during  and increased our taxable equivalent net interest income by million to million in compared with million for the increase of million to taxable equivalent interest income was due to a combination of the following increase in volume average interest earning assets increased million  to billion in  an increase of over interest earning assets of billion in the increase in total interest earning assets contributed an additional million to taxable equivalent interest income between and decrease in rate as mentioned above  the rapidly declining interest rate environment was the main factor behind our decrease in taxable equivalent interest income in  resulting in a million decrease to taxable equivalent interest income due to rate changes

on december   the california franchise tax board ftb announced its position that certain tax deductions related to rics and reits would be disallowed 
the company previously deregistered its ric in and does not expect to record any tax benefits relating to the reit in the company created these subsidiaries for the purpose of raising capital 

table of contents the company believes that the tax benefits recorded in the three prior years with respect to the ric were appropriate and fully defensible under california law in effect at the time the tax benefits were recorded 
as such  the company has not deemed it necessary to establish any additional reserves for such benefits at this time 
if  however  the ftb position were to be upheld  the company would be obligated to repay these tax benefits  together with interest and penalties 
we will continue to follow the latest developments with regards to this matter

loan commitments 
the company enters into contractual commitments to extend credit  normally with fixed expiration dated or termination clauses  at specified rates and for specific purposes 
substantially all of the company s commitments to extend credit are contingent upon customers maintaining specific credit standard at the time of loan funding 
the company minimizes its exposure to loss under these commitments by subjecting them to credit approval and monitoring procedures 
management assesses the credit risk associated with certain commitments to expend credit in determining the level of the allowance for possible loan losses 
loan commitments outstanding at december  are included in the table above

capital resources stockholders equity we obtain capital primarily from retained earnings  the issuance of additional common stock and to a lesser extent  through our dividend reinvestment plan and options exercised 
stockholders equity of million at december   was up million or compared to million at december  the increase of million in stockholders equity was due to the following million from the issuance of million shares of common stock and the assumption of unexercised gbc bancorp stock options as part of the consideration for the gbc bancorp merger  an addition of million from net income less payments of dividends on common stock of million  and several smaller factors

the amount of retained earnings available for cash dividends as of december   is restricted to approximately million under this regulation 
capital adequacy management seeks to retain the company s capital at a level sufficient to support future growth  protect depositors and stockholders  and comply with various regulatory requirements 
the primary measure of capital adequacy is based on the ratio of risk based capital to risk weighted assets 
at year end  tier risk based capital ratio of  total risk based capital ratio of  and tier leverage capital ratio of  continued to place the company in the well capitalized category  which is defined as institutions with tier risk based capital ratio equal to or greater than six percent  tier leverage capital ratio equal to or greater than five percent  and total risk based capital ratio equal to or greater than ten percent

risk elements of the loan portfolio non performing assets non performing assets include loans past due days or more and still accruing interest  non accrual loans  and other real estate owned 
the company s policy is to place loans on non accrual status if interest and principal or either interest or principal is past due days or more  or in cases where management deems the full collection of principal and interest unlikely 
after a loan is placed on non accrual status  any unpaid interest is generally reversed against current income 
thereafter  any payment is generally first applied towards the principal balance 
depending on the circumstances  management may elect to continue the accrual of interest on certain past due loans if partial payment is received and or the loan is well collateralized and in the process of collection 
the loan is generally returned to accrual status when the borrower has brought the past due principal and interest payments current and  in the opinion of management  the borrower has demonstrated the ability to make future payments of principal and interest as scheduled 
management reviews the loan portfolio regularly for problem loans 
during the ordinary course of business  management becomes aware of borrowers that may not be able to meet the contractual requirements of the loan agreements 
such loans are placed under closer supervision with consideration given to placing the loan on non accrual status  the need for an additional allowance for loan losses  and if appropriate partial or full charge off 
our non performing assets increased million or to million at year end compared to million at year end the increase was primarily due to the merger with gbc bancorp  which had nonaccrual loans of million as of the merger date  increases in accruing loans past due days or more  and an increase in the bank s nonaccrual loans during the fourth quarter of as a percentage of gross loans plus other real estate owned  our non performing assets increased to at year end from at year end the non performing loan coverage ratio  defined as the allowance for loan losses to non performing loans  decreased to at year end  from at year end

troubled debt restructurings a troubled debt restructuring is a formal restructure of a loan when the lender  for economic or legal reasons related to the borrower s financial difficulties  grants a concession to the borrower 
the concessions may be granted in various forms  including reduction in the stated interest rate  reduction in the loan balance or accrued interest  and extension of the maturity date 
troubled debt restructurings  excluding those on non accrual status  increased million to million at december   compared to million at december  at december   those restructured loans were performing under their revised terms 
impaired loans a loan is considered impaired when it is probable that a creditor will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement based on current circumstances and events 
we consider all classified and restructured loans in our evaluation of loan impairment 
the classified loans are stratified by size  and loans less than our defined selection criteria are treated as a homogeneous portfolio 
if loans meeting the defined criteria are not collateral dependent  we measure the impairment based on the present value of the 
table of contents expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate 
if loans meeting the defined criteria are collateral dependent  we measure the impairment by using the loan s observable market price or the fair value of the collateral 
if the measurement of the impaired loan is less than the recorded amount of the loan  we then recognize impairment by creating or adjusting an existing valuation allowance with a corresponding charge to the provision for loan losses 
we identified impaired loans with a recorded investment of million at year end  compared to million at year end the average balance of impaired loans was million in and million in interest collected on impaired loans totaled million in and million in the following tables present a breakdown of impaired loans and the related allowances as of the dates indicated at december  at december  recorded investment allowance net balance recorded investment allowance net balance in thousands commercial real estate other total real estate includes commercial mortgage loans  real estate construction loans  and residential mortgage loans 
loan concentration we experienced no loan concentrations to multiple borrowers in similar activities which exceeded of total loans as of december  see factors that may affect future results below for a discussion of some of the factors that may affect the matters discussed in this section 
allowance for loan losses the bank s management is committed to managing the risk in its loan portfolio by maintaining the allowance for loan losses at a level that is considered to be equal to the estimated and known risks in the loan portfolio 
with a risk management objective  the bank s management has an established monitoring system that is designed to identify impaired and potential problem loans  and to permit periodic evaluation of impairment and the adequacy level of the allowance for loan losses in a timely manner 
in addition  our board of directors has established a written loan policy that includes an effective loan review and control system to ensure that the bank maintains an adequate allowance for loan losses 
the board of directors provides oversight for the allowance evaluation process  including quarterly evaluations  and judge that it is adequate to absorb estimated losses in the loan portfolio 
the determination of the amount of the allowance for loan losses and the provision for loan losses is based on management s current judgment about the credit quality of the loan portfolio and takes into consideration known relevant internal and external factors that affect collectibility when determining the appropriate level for the allowance for loan losses 
the nature of the process by which the bank determines the appropriate allowance for loan losses requires the exercise of considerable judgment 
additions to the allowance for loan losses are made by charges to the provision for loan losses 
identified credit exposures that are determined to be uncollectible are charged against the allowance for loan losses 
recoveries of previously charged off amounts  if any  are credited to the allowance for loan losses

the percentage assigned depends on a number of factors including loan classification  the current financial condition of the borrowers and guarantors  the prevailing value of the underlying collateral  charge off history  management s knowledge of the portfolio and general economic conditions 

table of contents general allowance the unclassified portfolio is segmented on a group basis 
segmentation is determined by loan type and by identifying risk characteristics that are common to the groups of loans 
the allowance is provided to each segmented group based on the group s historical loan loss experience  the trends in delinquency  and non accrual  and other significant factors  such as national and local economy  trends and conditions  strength of management and loan staff  underwriting standards  and the concentration of credit 
at december   the general allowance for loans originated by general bank was determined based on the historical loss experience of general bank adjusted for qualitative factors 
the total allowance for loan losses consists of the above two components specific and general 
to determine the adequacy of the allowance in each of these two components  the bank employs two primary methodologies  the classification migration and the individual loan review analysis methodology 
these methodologies support the basis for determining allocations between the various loan categories and the overall adequacy of the bank s allowance to provide for probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
these methodologies are further supported by additional analysis of relevant factors such as the historical losses in the portfolio  trends in the non performing non accrual loans  loan delinquencies  the volume of the portfolio  peer group comparisons  and federal regulatory policy for loan and lease losses 
other significant factors of portfolio analysis include changes in lending policies underwriting standards  portfolio composition  and concentrations of credit  and trends in the national and local economy 
with these above methodologies  the specific allowance is for those loans internally classified and risk graded as special mention  substandard  doubtful  or loss 
additionally  the bank s management allocates a specific allowance for impaired credits  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan 
the level of the general allowance is established to provide coverage for management s estimate of the credit risk in the loan portfolio by various loan segments not covered by the specific allowance 
the table set forth below reflects management s allocation of the allowance for loan losses by loan category and the ratio of each loan category to the total loans as of the dates indicated allocation of allowance for loan losses as of december  amount percentage of loans in each category to average gross loans amount percentage of loans in each category to average gross loans amount percentage of loans in each category to average gross loans amount percentage of loans in each category to average gross loans amount percentage of loans in each category to average gross loans dollar in thousands type of loans commercial loans residential mortgage loans commercial mortgage loans real estate construction loans installment loans other loans n a total the increase in the allowance allocated to commercial loans resulted from the merger with gbc bancorp 
allowances have been allocated to a number of technology and asset based borrowers 
commercial loans also comprised of impaired loans  of nonaccrual loans and of loans over days still on accrual status at december  
table of contents because no charge offs have occurred in the residential mortgage segment over the last two years  management has reduced the allocation of the allowance allocated to this segment from million at december  to million at december  the increase in the allowance allocated to commercial real estate mortgages resulted primarily from the merger with gbc bancorp and an increase in criticized loans at the bank 
loan losses have been nominal during the last three years in this category 
because of the increased volume in this loan segment coupled with a slow economic recovery  and an uncertain degree of impact on the real estate variables such as appreciation  rate sensitivity  debt service capability  and long term profitability that drive these types of loans  management has increased the overall allowance in this segment from 
in to in the allocated allowance for construction loans has increased from million or of december  construction loans to million or of december  construction loans 
at december   million of construction loans were on non accrual status and million were past due days and still accruing interest 
during  gross charge offs of construction loans were million 
a number of condominium construction loans in the state of washington are experiencing slower than expected sales and a portion of the increase in the allocated allowance resulted from these loans 
the higher experience reserve factors from gbc bancorp s loans also contributed to the increase in the allocated allowance for construction loans 
allowances for other risks of probable loan losses that amounted to million as of december   compared to million as of december   have been included in the allocations above 
the components of the other risks that have a potential of affecting the bank s portfolio are comprised of two basic elements 
first  the bank has set aside funds to cover the risk factors of a continued slow recovery from the last recession 
the second component of other portfolio risk is the potential errors in loan classification and review methodologies 
based on these two above components of other risks  management has increased the allocation of the allowance

liquidity liquidity is our ability to maintain sufficient cash flow to meet maturing financial obligations and customer credit needs  and to take advantage of investment opportunities as they are presented in the marketplace 
our principal sources of liquidity are growth in deposits  proceeds from the maturity or sale of securities and other financial instruments  repayments from securities and loans  federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase and advances from fhlb 
at year end  our liquidity ratio defined as net cash  short term and marketable securities to net deposits and short term liabilities increased slightly to  compared to at year end to supplement its liquidity needs  the bank maintains a total credit line of million for federal funds with three correspondent banks  and master agreements with seven brokerage firms whereby up to million would be available through the sale of securities subject to repurchase 
the bank is also a shareholder of the fhlb  which enables the bank to have access to lower cost fhlb financing when necessary 
at december   the bank had a approved credit line with the fhlb of san francisco totaling million 
the total credit outstanding with the fhlb of san francisco at december   was million 
these advances are non callable and bear fixed interest rates  with million maturing in and million maturing in these borrowings are secured by residential mortgages and securities 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
liquidity can also be provided through the sale of liquid assets  which consist of federal funds sold  securities purchased under agreements to resell and securities available for sale 
at december   such assets at fair value totaled billion  with million pledged as collateral for borrowings and other 
table of contents commitments 
the remaining billion was available as additional liquidity or to be pledged as collateral for additional borrowings 
we had a significant portion of our time deposits maturing within one year or less as of december  management anticipates that there may be some outflow of these deposits upon maturity due to the keen competition in the bank s marketplace 
however  based on our historical runoff experience  we expect the outflow will not be significant and can be replenished through our normal growth in deposits 
management believes all the above mentioned sources will provide adequate liquidity for the next twelve months to the bank to meet its daily operating needs 
bancorp obtains funding for its activities primarily through dividend income contributed by the bank and proceeds from the issuance of bancorp common stock by means of the dividend reinvestment plan and exercise of stock options 
dividends paid to bancorp by the bank are subject to regulatory limitations 
the business activities of bancorp consist primarily of the operation of the bank with limited activities in other investments 
management believes bancorp s liquidity generated from its prevailing sources is sufficient to meet its operational needs

table of contents factors that may affect future results if we are unable to successfully integrate the business of gbc bancorp into ours  the business and earnings of the company may be negatively affected 
although the merger with gbc was completed in october  our integration efforts continue 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to integrate the operations of gbc bancorp without encountering difficulties  including the loss of key employees and customers  the disruption of our ongoing businesses and possible inconsistencies in corporate standards  controls  procedures and policies 
the integration will be a complex  time consuming and expensive process and may disrupt our business if not completed in a timely and efficient manner 
if we have difficulties with the integration  we might not achieve the economic benefits and cost savings we expect to result from the merger  and this would likely hurt our business and financial results 
in addition  we may experience greater than expected costs or difficulties relating to the integration of gbc bancorp or may not realize the cost savings we expect to result from the merger within the expected time frame 
the allowance for loan losses is an estimate of estimable and probable loan losses 
actual loan losses in excess of the estimate could adversely affect our net income and capital 
the allowance for loan losses is based on management s estimate of the estimable and probable losses from our loan portfolio 
if actual losses exceed the estimate  the excess losses could adversely affect our net income and capital 
such excess could also lead to larger allowances for loan losses in future periods  which could in turn adversely affect net income and capital in those periods 
we believe that the allowance for loan losses at december   is adequate to cover estimable and probable losses from its loan portfolio as of that date 
if economic conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used in the estimate or adverse developments arise with respect to our loans  future losses may occur  and increases in the allowance may be necessary 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the adequacy of our allowance 
these agencies may require us to establish additional allowances based on their judgment of the information available at the time of their examinations 
no assurance can be given that we will not sustain loan losses in excess of present or future levels of the allowance for loan losses 
fluctuations in interest rates could adversely affect our business 
the interest rate risk inherent in our lending  investing  and deposit taking activities is a significant market risk to us and our business 
income associated with interest earning assets and costs associated with interest bearing liabilities may not be affected uniformly by fluctuations in interest rates 
the magnitude and duration of changes in interest rates  events over which we have no control  may have an adverse effect on net interest income 
prepayment and early withdrawal levels  which are also impacted by changes in interest rates  can significantly affect our assets and liabilities 
increases in interest rates may adversely affect the ability of our floating rate borrowers to meet their higher payment obligations  which could in turn lead to an increase in non performing assets and net charge offs 
generally  the interest rates on interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities of the company do not change at the same rate  to the same extent  or on the same basis 
even assets and liabilities with similar maturities or periods of repricing may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in general market interest rates  while interest rates on other types of assets and liabilities may lag behind changes in general market rates 
certain assets  such as fixed and adjustable rate mortgage loans  have features that limit changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
we seek to minimize the adverse effects of changes in interest rates by structuring our asset liability composition to obtain the maximum spread 
we use interest rate sensitivity analysis and a simulation model to assist us in estimating the optimal asset liability composition 
however  such management tools have inherent 
table of contents limitations that impair their effectiveness 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in minimizing the adverse effects of changes in interest rates 
see also risks elements of the loan portfolio and market risk 
inflation and deflation may adversely affect our financial performance 
the consolidated financial statements and related financial data presented in this report have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
these principles require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars  without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation or deflation 
the primary impact of inflation on the operations of the company is reflected in increased operating costs 
conversely  deflation will tend to erode collateral values and diminish loan quality 
virtually all of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on our performance than the general levels of inflation or deflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as the price of goods and services 
as we expand our business outside of california markets  we will encounter risks that could adversely affect us 
we primarily operate in california markets with a concentration of chinese american individuals and businesses  however  one of our strategies is to expand beyond california into other domestic markets that have concentrations of chinese american individuals and businesses 
in the course of this expansion  we will encounter significant risks and uncertainties that could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
these risks and uncertainties include increased operational difficulties arising from  among other things  our ability to attract sufficient business in new markets  to manage operations in noncontiguous market areas  and to anticipate events or differences in markets in which we have no current experience 
to the extent that we expand through acquisitions  such acquisitions may also adversely harm our business  if we fail to adequately address the financial and operational risks associated with such acquisitions 
for example  risks can include difficulties in assimilating the operations  technology and personnel of the acquired company  diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  inability to maintain uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies  potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities  incurrence of additional debt and contingent liabilities  use of cash resources  large write offs  and amortization expenses related to other intangible assets with finite lives 
our financial results could be adversely affected by changes in california tax law and changes in its interpretation relating to registered investment companies and real estate investment trusts 
our effective income tax rate was lower in and than in due in large part to income tax benefits derived from a registered investment company subsidiary of the bank 
we had relied on the california tax law related to registered investment companies and on an outside tax opinion in creating this subsidiary 
in the fourth quarter of  a change in that law was enacted by the california legislature  which would deny such tax benefits from and after january  on december   the california franchise tax board ftb announced its position that certain tax deductions related to regulated investment companies as well as real estate investment trusts prior to january  would also be disallowed 
in december   we decided to deregister the registered investment company and  in february   we completed such deregistration 
in addition  in the fourth quarter of  the company reversed the net state tax benefits recorded in the first three quarters of relating to the real estate investment trust reit that it formed as a subsidiary of the bank during the company did not record any tax benefits relating to the reit in the fourth quarter of and does not expect to record any such benefits in the company believes that the tax benefits recorded in the three prior years with respect to the ric were appropriate and fully defensible under the california law in effect at the time the deductions were taken 
as such  
table of contents we have not deemed it necessary to establish any additional reserves for past tax benefits at this time 
if  however  the ftb position were to be upheld  the company would be obligated to repay these tax benefits  together with interest and penalties 
adverse economic conditions in california and other regions where the bank has operations could cause us to incur losses 
our banking operations are concentrated primarily in southern and northern california  and secondarily in new york  texas  massachusetts  and washington 
adverse economic conditions in these regions  such as the current california budget deficit and its impact could impair borrowers ability to service their loans  decrease the level and duration of deposits by customers  and erode the value of loan collateral 
these events could increase the amount of our non performing assets and have an adverse effect on our efforts to collect our non performing loans or otherwise liquidate our non performing assets including other real estate owned on terms favorable to us 
real estate securing our lending activities is also principally located in southern and northern california  and to a lesser extent  in new york  texas  massachusetts  and washington 
the value of such collateral depends upon conditions in the relevant real estate markets 
these include general or local economic conditions and neighborhood characteristics  real estate tax rates  the cost of operating the properties  governmental regulations and fiscal policies  acts of nature including earthquakes  flood and hurricanes which may result in uninsured losses  and other factors beyond our control 
the risks inherent in construction lending may adversely affect our net income 
as a result of the merger with gbc bancorp  the company has a higher proportion of real estate construction loans than it did before the merger 
the risk inherent in construction lending may adversely affect our net income 
such risks include  among other things  the possibility that contractors may fail to complete  or complete on a timely basis  construction of the relevant properties  substantial cost overruns in excess of original estimates and financing  market deterioration during construction  and lack of permanent take out financing 
loans secured by such properties also involve additional risk because such properties have no operating history 
in these loans  loan funds are advanced upon the security of the project under construction  which is of uncertain value prior to completion of construction  and the estimated operating cash flow to be generated by the completed project 
there is no assurance that such properties will be sold or leased so as to generate the cash flow anticipated by the borrower 
such consideration can affect the borrowers ability to repay their obligations to us and the value of our security interest in collateral 
our use of appraisals in deciding whether to make a loan on or secured by real property does not insure the value of the real property collateral 
in considering whether to make a loan on or secured by real property  we generally require an appraisal of such property 
however  the appraisal is only an estimate of the value of the property at the time the appraisal is made 
if the appraisal does not reflect the amount that may be obtained upon any sale or foreclosure of the property  we may not realize an amount equal to the indebtedness secured by the property 
we face substantial competition from larger competitors 
we face substantial competition for deposits and loans  as well as other banking services  throughout our market area from the major banks and financial institutions that dominate the commercial banking industry 
this may cause our cost of funds to exceed that of our competitors 
such banks and financial institutions have greater resources than us  including the ability to finance advertising campaigns and allocate their investment assets to regions of higher yield and demand 
by virtue of their larger capital bases  such institutions have substantially greater lending limits than us and perform certain functions  including trust services  which are not presently 
table of contents offered by us 
we also compete for loans and deposits  as well as other banking services  with savings and loan associations  finance companies  money market funds  brokerage houses  credit unions and non financial institutions 
adverse effects of banking regulations or changes in banking regulations could adversely affect our business 
we are regulated by significant federal and state regulation and supervision  which is primarily for the benefit and protection of our customers and not for the benefit of our stockholders 
in the past  our business has been materially affected by such regulation and supervision 
this trend is likely to continue in the future 
laws  regulations  or policies currently affecting us may change at any time 
regulatory authorities may also change their interpretation of existing laws and regulations 
such changes may  among other things  increase the cost of doing business  limit permissible activities  or affect the competitive balance between banks and other financial institutions 
it is impossible to predict the competitive impact that any such changes would have on commercial banking in general or on our business in particular 
adverse economic conditions in asia could adversely affect our business 
it is difficult to predict the behavior of the asian economy 
us economic policies  military tensions  and an unfavorable global economic condition may adversely impact the asian economy 
if the asian economic conditions deteriorate  we could be exposed to economic and transfer risk  and could experience an outflow of deposits by our asian american customers 
transfer risk may result when an entity is unable to obtain the foreign exchange needed to meet its obligations or to provide liquidity 
this may adversely impact the recoverability of investments with or loans made to such entities 
adverse economic conditions may also negatively impact asset values and the profitability and liquidity of companies operating in this region 
statutory restrictions on dividends and other distributions from the bank may adversely impact us 
a substantial portion of our cash flow comes from dividends that the bank pays to us 
various statutory provisions restrict the amount of dividends that the bank can pay without regulatory approval 
in addition  if the bank were to liquidate  the bank s creditors would be entitled to receive distributions from the assets of the bank to satisfy their claims against the bank before we  as a holder of an equity interest in the bank  would be entitled to receive any of the assets of the bank 
our need to continue to adapt to our information technology systems to allow us to provide new and expanded services could present operational issues and require significant capital spending 
as we continue to offer internet banking and other on line services to our customers  and continue to expand our existing conventional banking services  we will need to adapt our information technology systems to handle these changes in a way that meets constantly changing industry standards 
this can be very expensive and may require significant capital expenditures 
in addition  our success will depend  among other things  on our ability to provide secure and reliable services  anticipate changes in technology  and efficiently develop and introduce services that are accepted by our customers and cost effective for us to provide 
systems failures  delays  breaches of confidentiality and other problems could harm our reputation and business 
certain provisions of our charter  bylaws  and rights agreement could make the acquisition of our company more difficult 
certain provisions of our charter  bylaws  and rights agreement between us and american stock transfer and trust company  as rights agent  could make the acquisition of our company more difficult 
these provisions include authorized but unissued shares of preferred and common stock that may be issued without stockholder approval  three classes of directors serving staggered terms  preferred share purchase rights that generally become exercisable if a person or group acquires or more of our common stock or announces a 
table of contents tender offer for or more of our common stock  special requirements for stockholder proposals and nominations for director  and super majority voting requirements in certain situations including certain types of business combinations 
terrorist attacks could adversely affect us 
any terrorist attacks and responses to such activities could adversely affect the company in a number of ways  including  among others  an increase in delinquencies  bankruptcies or defaults that could result in a higher level of non performing assets  net charge offs  and provision for loan losses 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates 
the principal market risk to the company is the interest rate risk inherent in our lending  investing  and deposit taking activities  due to the fact that interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities do not reprice at the same rate  to the same extent  or on the same basis 
we actively monitor and manage our interest rate risk through analyzing the repricing characteristics of our loans  securities  and deposits on an on going basis 
the primary objective is to minimize the adverse effects of changes in interest rates on our earnings  and ultimately the underlying market value of equity  while structuring our asset liability composition to obtain the maximum spread 
management uses certain basic measurement tools in conjunction with established risk limits to regulate its interest rate exposure 
due to the limitation inherent in any individual risk management tool  we use both an interest rate sensitivity analysis and a simulation model to measure and quantify the impact to our profitability or the market value of our assets and liabilities 
the interest rate sensitivity analysis details the expected maturity and repricing opportunities  mismatch or sensitivity gap between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities over a specified time frame 
a positive gap exists when rate sensitive assets which reprice over a given time period exceed rate sensitive liabilities 
during periods of increasing interest rates  net interest margin may be enhanced with a positive gap 
a negative gap exists when rate sensitive liabilities which reprice over a given time period exceed rate sensitive assets 
during periods of rising interest rates  net interest margin may be impaired with a negative gap 
the following table indicates the maturity or repricing and rate sensitivity of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities as of december  our exposure  as reflected in the table  represents the estimated difference between the amount of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities repricing during future periods based on certain assumptions 
the interest rate sensitivity of our assets and liabilities presented in the table may vary if different assumptions were used or if actual experience differs from the assumptions used 
as reflected in the table below  we were asset sensitive with a cumulative gap ratio of a positive within three months and within one year at year end  compared with within three months and within one year at year end 
table of contents interest rate sensitivity december  interest rate sensitivity period within months over month to year over year to years over years non interest sensitive total dollars in thousands interest earning assets cash and due from banks federal funds sold securities available for sale loans receivable commercial loans residential mortgage loans commercial mortgage loans real estate construction loans installment loans other loans total loans  gross non interest earning assets  net total assets interest bearing liabilities deposits demand money market and now savings tcds under tcds and over total deposits securities sold under agreements to repurchase advances from federal home loan bank other borrowings junior subordinated debt non interest bearing other liabilities stockholders equity total liabilities and stockholders equity interest sensitivity gap cumulative interest sensitivity gap gap ratio of total assets cumulative gap ratio non accrual loans are included in non earning assets 
adjustable loans are included in the within three months category  as they are subject to an interest adjustment depending upon terms on the loan 
the company s own historical experience and decay factors are used to estimate the money market and now and the savings deposit runoff 

table of contents since interest rate sensitivity analysis does not measure the timing differences in the repricing of assets and liabilities  we use a net interest income simulation model to measure the extent of the differences in the behavior of the lending and funding rates to changing interest rates  so as to project future earnings or market values under alternative interest rate scenarios 
interest rate risk arises primarily through the company s traditional business activities of extending loans and accepting deposits 
many factors  including economic and financial conditions  movements in interest rates and consumer preferences affect the spread between interest earned on assets and interest paid on liabilities 
the net interest income simulation model is designed to measure the volatility of net interest income and net portfolio value  defined as net present value of assets and liabilities  under immediate rising or falling interest rate scenarios in basis points increments 
although the modeling is very helpful in managing interest rate risk  it does require significant assumptions for the projection of loan prepayment rates on mortgage related assets  loan volumes and pricing  and deposit and borrowing volume and pricing  that might prove inaccurate 
because these assumptions are inherently uncertain  the model cannot precisely estimate net interest income  or precisely predict the effect of higher or lower interest rates on net interest income 
actual results will differ from simulated results due to the timing  magnitude  and frequency of interest rates changes  the differences between actual experience and the assumed volume  changes in market conditions  and management strategies among other factors 
the company monitors its interest rate sensitivity and attempts to reduce the risk of a significant decrease in net interest income caused by a change in interest rates 
we establish a tolerance level in our policy to define and limit interest income volatility to a change of plus or minus when the hypothetical rate change is plus or minus basis points 
when the net interest rate simulation projects that our tolerance level will be met or exceeded  we seek corrective action after considering  among other things  market conditions  customer reaction  and the estimated impact on profitability 
at december   if interest rates were to increase instantaneously by basis points  the simulation indicated that our net interest income over the next twelve months would increase by  and if interest rates were to increase instantaneously by basis points  the simulation indicated that our net interest income over the next twelve months would increase by 
conversely  if interest rates were to decrease instantaneously by basis points  the simulation indicated that our net interest income over the next twelve months would decrease by  and if interest rates were to decrease instantaneously by basis points  the simulation indicated that our net interest income over the next twelve months would decrease by 
the company s simulation model also projects the net economic value of our portfolio of assets and liabilities 
we have established a tolerance level to value the net economic value of our portfolio of assets and liabilities in our policy to a change of plus or minus when the hypothetical rate change is plus or minus basis points 
at december   if interest rates were to increase instantaneously by basis points  the simulation indicated that the net economic value of our portfolio of assets and liabilities would decrease by  and conversely  if interest rates were to decrease instantaneously by basis points  the simulation indicated that the net economic value of our assets and liabilities would decrease by 
table of contents quantitative information about interest rate risk the following table shows our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates  categorized by expected maturity  and the instruments fair values at december   and for assets  expected maturities are based on contractual maturity 
for liabilities  we use our historical experience and decay factors to estimate the deposit runoffs of interest bearing transactional deposits 
we use certain assumptions to estimate fair values and expected maturities 
off balance sheet commitments to extend credit  letters of credit  and bill of lading guarantees represent the contractual unfunded amounts 
off balance sheet financial instruments represent fair values 
the results presented may vary if different assumptions are used or if actual experience differs from the assumptions used

however  the company enters into financial derivatives in order to seek mitigation of exposure to interest rate risks related to our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
we believe that these transactions  when properly structured and managed  may provide a hedge against inherent interest rate risk in the company s assets or liabilities and against risk in specific transactions 
in such instances  the company may protect its position through the purchase or sale of interest rate futures contracts for a specific cash or interest rate risk position 
other hedge transactions may be implemented using interest rate swaps  interest rate caps  floors  financial futures  forward rate agreements  and options on futures or bonds 
prior to considering any hedging activities  we seek to analyze the costs and benefits of the hedge in comparison to other viable alternative strategies 
all hedges will require an assessment of basis risk and must be approved by the bank s investment committee 

table of contents effective january   the company adopted sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended by sfas no 
 no 
and no 
sfas no 
establishes accounting and reporting standards for financial derivatives  including certain financial derivatives embedded in other contracts  and hedging activities 
it requires the recognition of all financial derivatives as assets or liabilities in the company s statement of financial condition and measurement of those financial derivatives at fair value 
the accounting treatment of changes in fair value is dependent upon whether or not a financial derivative is designated as a hedge and if so  the type of hedge 
upon adoption of sfas no 
 the company recognizes all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value 
fair value is based on dealer quotes  or quoted prices from instruments with similar characteristics 
the company uses financial derivatives designated for hedging activities as cash flow hedges 
for derivatives designated as cash flow hedges  changes in fair value are recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
on march   we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a major financial institution in the notional amount of million for a period of five years 
the interest rate swap was for the purpose of hedging the cash flows from a portion of our floating rate loans against declining interest rates 
the purpose of the hedge is to provide a measure of stability in the future cash receipts from such loans over the term of the swap agreement  which at december   was approximately five quarters 
at december   the fair value of the interest rate swap was million  exclusive of accrued interest  or million net of tax  compared to million  exclusive of accrued interest  or million net of tax  at december  for the twelve months ended december   net amounts totaling million were reclassified into earnings 
the estimated net amount of the existing gains within accumulated other comprehensive income that are expected to reclassify into earnings within the next months is approximately million
