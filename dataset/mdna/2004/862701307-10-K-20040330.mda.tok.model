the company experienced a decline of in revenues from to the majority of the decline in revenues was attributable to the loss of two large customers el paso corporation epc in july of and kraft in september of the remainder of the decline in sales was attributable to the loss of nine other customers and to a decline in continuing business of million 
the returns attributable to these customers were less than the company prefers today 
the company anticipates the loss of five customers during the first two quarters of many of the company s customers experienced business downturns over the last two years and a number of the lost customers  including epc and kraft  were due to customers decisions to reduce outside services and manage their indirect materials programs with their own resources 
the company has recently entered into agreements with six new customers including two large customers 
the company has actively increased its marketing efforts to expand the business in the direction of fee for services  rather than product focused 
the company has enhanced this service offering through enhanced systems capabilities and by providing more flexible solutions  including the needs of smaller sites that do not require an in plant store program onsite 
these new contracts deliver a more favorable return than historical contracts 
termination of contracts and economic downturn affecting the company s customers  negatively impacts the company s revenues and earnings  and its ability to effectively implement improvements in the in plant store program 
the company periodically reviews the financial condition of its customers and seeks to reduce asset exposure and program costs when appropriate 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company will not experience further reductions in business or asset losses 
certain statements in this item constitute forward looking statements which involve risks and uncertainties 
the company s actual results in the future could differ significantly from the results discussed or implied in such forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those related to the company s ability to obtain new customers and manage growth  the company s ability to enforce provisions of its contracts  termination of contracts by the company s customers  competition in the company s business  the company s dependence on key personnel and the effects of recession on the company and its customers 
in the event of continued economic downturn  the company could experience additional customer bankruptcies  reduced volume of business from its existing customers and lost volume due to plant shutdowns or consolidations by the company s customers 
critical accounting policies the securities and exchange commission sec has issued cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies 
the sec defines critical accounting policies as those that are both most important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results and that require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain and may change materially in subsequent periods 
the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements requires estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and related notes 
significant estimates made by the company include the following reserves and accrued liabilities the company provides reserves or accrued liabilities in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for events such as site closures  to record assets at estimated net realizable values and to record probable contingent liabilities 
in addition  in the ordinary course of business  management makes estimates of accrued liabilities to suppliers and other service providers 
the amounts of such reserves and liabilities are based on information and assumptions that the company deems reasonable and probable at the time 
the matters that give rise to such provisions are inherently uncertain and require complex and subjective judgments 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the company s review and assessment of its customers ability to make required payments 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  additional allowances might be required 
deferred tax asset valuation allowance the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  future realization of these assets in excess of the net amount recorded would increase income during that period 
likewise  should the company determine a greater possibility exists that it would not be able to realize part of or the entire net deferred tax asset in the future  a charge to income would result at the time the determination was made 
recoverability of assets the company makes significant estimates relating to the recoverability of assets  such as inventory and long lived assets and the assessment of litigation and other contingencies 
the company s ability to recover the value of its inventory depends on a number of factors  including the financial condition of its customers  the effect of changes in economic conditions and its ability to enforce provisions of its contracts in the event of disputes  through litigation if necessary 
the recoverability of long lived assets is highly dependant on the company s business volume and application of the applicable accounting standards requires significant judgments and estimates 
although the company believes the estimates and assumptions used in determining the recorded amounts of net assets and liabilities at december  are reasonable  actual results could differ materially from estimated amounts recorded in the company s consolidated financial statements 
contract terminations in may  the company announced that it agreed to terminate its in plant store services agreements with epc  its largest customer 
the company transitioned all storerooms to epc during july the company s revenues from epc for fiscal  and were million  million  and million  respectively 
there were no accounts receivable or inventory related to epc at december  during and early  the company and kraft discussed certain changes to the in plant store services agreement that would have made the kraft agreement profitable and reduced the company s working capital commitment 
as a result of the inability of the parties to reach a revised agreement  on march  the company and kraft agreed to terminate the relationship prior to the contract expiration of august during the second quarter of  the company sold its kraft inventory to kraft at normal selling prices 
the value of the sale was million and the related gross margin was million 
during the second and third quarters of  the company substantially completed the transition of all storerooms to kraft and reduced its operating costs 
the company provided inventory procurement and management services to kraft during the transition

during the second quarter of  the company recorded a charge of  related to the write down of certain fixed assets in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 
the company provides its mro procurement  handling and data management services through the in plant store program utilizing the in site operating system  the company s proprietary information system 
the company s primary investment in long lived assets is in its in site technology  including supporting equipment or systems such as personal computers and network communications 
as a result of the termination of the kraft services agreement  the company evaluated  in accordance with sfas  the recoverability of its computer technology and determined that the value was impaired from the expected underutilization 
the company measured the fair value of the long lived assets in accordance with sfas and determined the amount of impairment to be  including  related to personal computers removed from use and sold or disposed

the closing of two customers  kraft million and epc million accounted for million of the overall decrease 
revenues for the year ended december  included million related to the sale of kraft inventory in connection with the termination of the kraft services agreement 
the remaining decrease of million was due to the termination of other customer contracts of million and the reduction in our continuing business of million  partially offset by increases in revenue in our mexican operations of million and an increase in revenue relating to a one time million inventory sale to an existing customer that reduced its in plant store program during the third quarter of during  the company incurred million of costs for supplies shipped to a new customer

 revenue recognition sab 
as of december   the million of costs relating to the supplies shipped to the new customer were included in inventory on the company s consolidated balance sheet 
the supplies shipped to this customer were of a seasonal nature 
as a result of the termination of the in plant store services agreement with epc  kraft and other customers and the slowdown of the introduction of new sites  the company did not achieve historic levels of revenue during additional contract terminations and revenue declines in the company s remaining business may cause future operating results to differ significantly from historical results reported 
future growth in the company s business is highly dependant on its ability to attract new customers 
the company has reduced and may continue to reduce its operating costs as a result of the revenue declines 
such cost reductions will likely be lower than the relative sales declines because of the fixed nature of certain costs and determinations by the company that certain costs are necessary to improve the company s technology and service offerings and to obtain new business

the increase in the selling  general and administrative costs as a percentage of revenue  excluding the impact of the kraft inventory sale  from to is primarily attributable to non operational employee wages and benefits and other fixed costs as a percentage of a much lower revenue base
