item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business overview oil and gas prices  the offshore mobile rig count  and deepwater construction activity are three of the primary indicators we use to forecast the future performance of our marine contracting business 
our construction services generally follow successful drilling activities by six to eighteen months on the ocs and twelve months or longer in the deepwater arena 
the level of drilling activity is related to both short and long term trends in oil and gas prices 
while oil and natural gas prices have been at robust levels for the last two years  offshore drilling activity has yet to respond 
our primary leading indicator  the number of offshore mobile rigs contracted  is currently at approximately rigs employed in the gulf of mexico  flat with year ago levels and compared to during the first quarter of the deepwater gulf is principally being developed for oil  with the complexity of developing these reservoirs resulting in significant lead times to first production 
our business is substantially dependent upon the condition of the oil and gas industry and  in particular  the willingness of oil and gas companies to make capital expenditures for offshore exploration  drilling and production operations 
the level of capital expenditures generally depends on the prevailing view of future oil and gas prices  which are influenced by numerous factors affecting the supply and demand for oil and gas  including  but not limited to worldwide economic activity  economic and political conditions in the middle east and other oil producing regions  coordination by the organization of petroleum exporting countries  or opec  the cost of exploring for and producing oil and gas  the sale and expiration dates of offshore leases in the united states and overseas  the discovery rate of new oil and gas reserves in offshore areas  technological advances  interest rates and the cost of capital  environmental regulations  and tax policies 
the level of offshore construction activity did not increase despite higher commodity prices in we cannot assure you that activity levels will increase anytime soon 
a sustained period of low drilling and production activity or the return of lower commodity prices would likely have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
product prices impact our oil and gas operations in several respects 
we seek to acquire producing oil and gas properties that are generally in the later stages of their economic life 
the sellers potential abandonment liabilities are a significant consideration with respect to the offshore properties we have purchased to date 
although higher natural gas prices tend to reduce the number of mature properties available for sale  these higher prices typically contribute to improved operating results for ert 
in contrast  lower natural gas prices typically contribute to lower operating results for ert and a general increase in the number of mature properties available for sale 
we expanded the scope of our gas and oil operations by taking a working interest in gunnison  a deepwater gulf development of kerr mcgee oil gas corp  and participating in the ownership of the marco polo production facility 
our proved reserves at december   included the reserves assigned to our ownership position in gunnison 
these reserves constitute nearly of our total proved reserves as of december  this annual report contains estimates of our proved oil and gas reserves based upon reports audited by our independent petroleum engineers 
the process of estimating oil and gas reserves is complex  requiring significant decisions and assumptions in the evaluation of available geological  geophysical  engineering and economic data for each reservoir 
as a result  these estimates are inherently imprecise 
actual future production  cash flows  development expenditures  operating and abandonment expenses and quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves may vary substantially from those estimated in these reports 
any significant variance in these assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantity and value of our proved reserves 
regarding marine contracting  vessel utilization is historically lower during the first quarter due to winter weather conditions in the gulf and the north sea 
accordingly  we plan our drydock inspections and other routine and preventive maintenance programs during this period 
during the first quarter  a substantial number of our customers finalize capital budgets and solicit bids for construction projects 
the bid and award process during the first two quarters typically leads to the commencement of construction activities during the second and third quarters 
as a result  we have historically generated up to of our marine contracting revenues in the last six months of the year 
our operations can also be severely impacted by weather during the fourth quarter 
operation of oil and gas properties and production facilities tends to offset the impact of weather since the first and fourth quarters are typically periods of high demand and strong prices for natural gas 
due to this seasonality  full year results are not likely to be a direct multiple of any particular quarter or combination of quarters 
the following table sets forth for the periods presented average us natural gas prices  our equivalent natural gas production  the average number of offshore rigs under contract in the gulf  the number of platforms installed and removed in the gulf and the vessel utilization rates for each of the major categories of our fleet 
q q q q q q q q q q q q us natural gas prices ert oil and gas production mmcfe             rigs under contract in the gulf platform installations platform removals our average vessel utilization rate dp saturation dsv surface diving derrick barge henry hub gas daily average the midpoint index price per mmbtu for deliveries into a specific pipeline for the applicable calendar day as reported by platts gas daily in the daily price survey table 
average monthly number of rigs contracted  as reported by offshore data services 
source minerals management service and offshore data services and  installation and removal of platforms with two or more piles in the gulf 
average vessel utilization rate is calculated by dividing the total number of days the vessels in this category generated revenues by the total number of days in each quarter 
critical accounting policies our results of operations and financial condition  as reflected in the accompanying financial statements and related footnotes  are subject to management s evaluation and interpretation of business conditions  changing capital market conditions and other factors which could affect the ongoing viability of our business segments and or our customers 
we believe the most critical accounting policies in this regard are the recognition of revenue and the associated estimation of revenue allowance on gross amounts billed  evaluation of recoverability of property and equipment and goodwill balances and the accounting for decommissioning liabilities for ert 
while these issues require us to make judgments that are somewhat subjective  they are generally based on a significant amount of historical data and current market data 
ert acquisitions of producing offshore properties are recorded at the fair value exchanged at closing together with an estimate of its proportionate share of the decommissioning liability assumed in the purchase based upon its working interest ownership percentage 
in estimating the decommissioning liability assumed in offshore property acquisitions  we perform detailed estimating procedures  including engineering studies and then reflect the liability at fair value on a discounted basis as discussed below 
we follow the successful efforts method of accounting for our interests in oil and gas properties 
under the successful efforts method  the costs of successful wells and leases containing productive reserves are capitalized 
costs incurred to drill and equip development wells  including unsuccessful development wells  are capitalized 
the company also considers the following accounting policies to be the most critical to the preparation of its financial statements goodwill the company tests for the impairment of goodwill on at least an annual basis 
the company s goodwill impairment test involves a comparison of the fair value of each of the company s reporting units 
with its carrying amount 
the fair value is determined using discounted cash flows and other market related valuation models  such as earnings multiples and comparable asset market values 
these tests are influenced significantly by management estimates of future cash flows and the related expected utilization of assets 
prior to the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles sfas no 
 goodwill was amortized on a straight line basis over years 
in conjunction with the adoption of this statement  the company has discontinued the amortization of goodwill 
property and equipment property and equipment  both owned and under capital leases  are recorded at cost 
depreciation is provided primarily on the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets described in footnote to the consolidated financial statements included herein 
for long lived assets to be held and used  excluding goodwill  the company bases its evaluation on impairment indicators such as the nature of the assets  the future economic benefit of the assets  any historical or future profitability measurements and other external market conditions or factors that may be present 
if such impairment indicators are present or other factors exist that indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable  the company determines whether an impairment has occurred through the use of an undiscounted cash flows analysis of the asset at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows exist 
if an impairment has occurred  the company recognizes a loss for the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset 
the fair value of the asset is measured using quoted market prices or  in the absence of quoted market prices  is based on management s estimate of discounted cash flows 
assets are classified as held for sale when the company has a plan for disposal of certain assets and those assets meet the held for sale criteria 
the company evaluates the impairment of its oil and gas properties on a field by field basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate  but at least annually  an asset s carrying amount may not be recoverable 
unamortized capital costs are reduced to fair value if the expected undiscounted future cash flows are less than the asset s net book value 
cash flows are determined based upon proved reserves using prices and costs consistent with those used for internal decision making 
although prices used are likely to approximate market  they do not necessarily represent current market prices 
given that spot market prices are subject to volatile changes  it is the company s opinion that a long term view of market prices will lead to a more appropriate valuation of long term assets 
accounting for decommissioning liabilities sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  addresses the financial accounting and reporting obligations and retirement costs related to the retirement of tangible long lived assets 
among other things  sfas no 
requires oil and gas companies to reflect decommissioning liabilities on the face of the balance sheet at fair value on a discounted basis 
ert historically has purchased producing offshore oil and gas properties that are in the later stages of production 
in conjunction with acquiring these properties  ert assumes an obligation associated with decommissioning the property in accordance with the regulations set by government agencies 
the abandonment liability related to the acquisitions of these properties is determined through a series of management estimates 
prior to an acquisition and as part of evaluating the economics of an acquisition  ert will estimate the plug and abandonment liability 
ert personnel prepare detailed cost estimates to plug and abandon wells and remove necessary equipment in accordance with regulatory guidelines 
ert currently calculates the discounted value of the abandonment liability based on the estimated year the abandonment will occur in accordance with sfas no 
and capitalizes that portion as part of the basis acquired and records the related abandonment liability at fair value 
on an ongoing basis  ert personnel monitor the status of wells on the properties and as fields deplete and no longer produce ert will monitor the timing requirements set forth by the mms for plugging and abandoning the wells and commence abandonment operations  when applicable 
on an annual basis  ert and cal dive management personnel review and update the abandonment estimates and assumptions  for changes  among other things  in market conditions  interest rates and historical experience 
the adoption of sfas no 
resulted in a cumulative effect adjustment as of january  to record i a million decrease in the carrying values of proved properties  ii a million decrease in accumulated depreciation  depletion and amortization of property and equipment  iii a million decrease in decommissioning liabilities and iv a million increase in deferred income tax liabilities 
the net impact of items i through iv was to record a gain of million  net of tax  as a cumulative effect adjustment of a change in accounting principle in the company s consolidated statements of operations upon adoption on january  the company has no material assets that are legally restricted for purposes of settling its decommissioning liabilities 
accounting for redeemable stock in subsidiary sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity  requires that certain financial instruments  which under previous guidance were accounted for as equity  must now be accounted for as liabilities 
the financial instruments affected include mandatorily redeemable stock  certain financial instruments that require or may require the issuer to buy back some of its shares in exchange for cash or other assets and certain obligations that can be settled with shares of stock 
sfas no 
was effective for all financial instruments entered into or modified after may  as a result of this adoption  the company reclassified the million of redeemable stock in subsidiary from mezzanine classification ie  between liabilities and shareholders equity on the balance sheet to debt 
otherwise  the adoption had no impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition the company earns the majority of marine contracting revenues during the summer and fall months 
revenues are derived from billings under contracts which are typically of short duration that provide for either lump sum turnkey charges or specific time  material and equipment charges which are billed in accordance with the terms of such contracts 
the company recognizes revenue as it is earned at estimated collectible amounts 
revenues generated from specific time  materials and equipment charges contracts are generally earned over a dayrate basis and recognized as amounts are earned in accordance with contract terms 
revenues generated in the pre operation mode before a contract commences are deferred and recognized in accordance with contract terms 
direct and incremental costs associated with pre operation activities are similarly deferred and recognized over the estimated contract period 
revenue on significant turnkey contracts is recognized on the percentage of completion method based on the ratio of costs incurred to total estimated costs at completion  or achievement of certain contractual milestones if provided for in the contract 
contract price and cost estimates are reviewed periodically as work progresses and adjustments are reflected in the period in which such estimates are revised 
provisions for estimated losses on such contracts are made in the period such losses are determined 
unbilled revenue represents revenue attributable to work completed prior to year end which has not yet been invoiced 
all amounts included in unbilled revenue at december  are expected to be billed and collected within one year 
the company records revenues from the sales of crude oil and natural gas when delivery to the customer has occurred and title has transferred 
this occurs when production has been delivered to a pipeline or a barge lifting has occurred 
the company may have an interest with other producers in certain properties 
in this case the company uses the entitlements method to account for sales of production 
under the entitlements method the company may receive more or less than its entitled share of production 
if the company receives more than its entitled share of production  the imbalance is treated as a liability 
if the company receives less than its entitled share  the imbalance is recorded as an asset 
revenue allowance on gross amounts billed the company bills for work performed in accordance with the terms of the applicable contract 
the gross amount of revenue billed will include not only the billing for the original amount quoted for a project but also include billings for services provided which the company believes are allowed under the terms of the related contract but are outside the scope of the original quote 
the company establishes a revenue allowance for these additional billings based on its collections history if conditions warrant such a reserve 
foreign currency the functional currency for the company s foreign subsidiary  well ops uk limited  is the applicable local currency british pound 
results of operations for this subsidiary are translated into us dollars using average exchange rates during the period 
assets and liabilities of this foreign subsidiary are translated into us dollars using the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date and the resulting translation adjustment  which was a gain of million  net of taxes  and million  net of taxes  in and  respectively  is included as accumulated other comprehensive income  as a component of shareholders equity 
all foreign currency transaction gains and losses are recognized currently in the statements of operations 
canyon offshore  the company s rov subsidiary  has operations in the united kingdom and southeast asia sectors 
canyon conducts the majority of its affairs in these regions in us dollars which it considers the functional currency 
when currencies other than the us dollar are to be paid or received the resulting gain or loss from translation is recognized in the statements of operations 
these amounts for the years ended december  and  respectively  were not material to the company s results of operations or cash flows 
accounting for price risk management activities the company s price risk management activities involve the use of derivative financial instruments to hedge the impact of market price risk exposures primarily related to our oil and gas production 
all derivatives are reflected in our balance sheet at their fair market value 
there are two types of hedging activities hedges of cash flow exposure and hedges of fair value exposure 
the company engages primarily in cash flow hedges 
hedges of cash flow exposure are entered into to hedge a forecasted transaction or the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability 
changes in the derivative fair values that are designated as cash flow hedges are deferred to the extent that they are effective and are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income until the hedged transactions occur and are recognized in earnings 
the ineffective portion of a cash flow hedge s change in value is recognized immediately in earnings in oil and gas production revenues 
we formally document all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items  as well as our risk management objectives  strategies for undertaking various hedge transactions and our methods for assessing and testing correlation and hedge ineffectiveness 
all hedging instruments are linked to the hedged asset  liability  firm commitment or forecasted transaction 
we also assess  both at the inception of the hedge and on an on going basis  whether the derivatives that are used in our hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged items 
we discontinue hedge accounting prospectively if we determine that a derivative is no longer highly effective as a hedge or it is probable that a hedged transaction will not occur 
if hedge accounting is discontinued  deferred gains or losses on the hedging instruments are recognized in earnings immediately 
the market value of hedging instruments reflects our best estimate and is based upon exchange or over the counter quotations whenever they are available 
quoted valuations may not be available due to location differences or terms that extend beyond the period for which quotations are available 
where quotes are not available  we utilize other valuation techniques or models to estimate market values 
these modeling techniques require us to make estimations of future prices  price correlation and market volatility and liquidity 
our actual results may differ from our estimates  and these differences can be positive or negative 
during and the company entered into various cash flow hedging swap and costless collar contracts to fix cash flows relating to a portion of the company s oil and gas production 
all of these qualified for hedge accounting and none extended beyond a year and a half 
the aggregate fair market value of the swaps and collars was a liability of million and million as of december  and  respectively 
for the years ended december  and  the company recorded a net of tax million gain  and million loss  respectively  in other comprehensive income loss within shareholders equity as these hedges were highly effective 
the balance in the fair value hedge adjustments account is recognized in earnings when the hedged item is sold 
income taxes deferred income taxes are based on the difference between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
the company utilizes the liability method of computing deferred income taxes 
the liability method is based on the amount of current and future taxes payable using tax rates and laws in effect at the balance sheet date 
income taxes have been provided based upon the tax laws and rates in the countries in which operations are conducted and income is earned 
a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is recorded when it is more likely than not that some or all of the benefit from the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
see footnote to the consolidated financial statements included herein for discussion of net operating loss carry forwards and deferred income taxes 
worker s compensation claims our onshore employees are covered by worker s compensation 
offshore employees  including divers and tenders and marine crews  are covered by maritime employers liability insurance policy which covers jones act exposures 
the company incurs worker s compensation claims in the normal course of business  which management believes are covered by insurance 
the company  its insurers and legal counsel analyze each claim for potential exposure and estimate the ultimate liability of each claim 
accounting principles not yet adopted in january  fasb interpretation fin no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  was issued which requires companies that control another entity through interests other than voting interests to consolidate the controlled entity 
fin no 
applies immediately to variable interest entities created after january   and applies in the first interim period beginning after march  to variable interest entities created before february  the related disclosure requirements are effective immediately 
the company currently believes that it has no involvement with any variable interest entity covered by the scope of fin no 
other matters the fasb s emerging issues task force eitf currently is deliberating on eitf no 
o  whether mineral rights are tangible or intangible assets  and eitf no 
s  application of fasb statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  to oil and gas companies 
these proposed statements will determine whether contract based oil and gas mineral rights are classified as tangible or intangible assets based on the eitf s interpretation of sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
historically  the company has classified all of its contract based mineral rights within property  plant and equipment and has generally not identified these amounts separately 
if the eitf determines that these mineral rights should be presented as intangible assets  the company would have to reclassify its contract based oil and gas mineral rights acquired after june  to intangible assets and make additional disclosures in accordance with sfas no 
if the company adopted this change  approximately million and million of the property  plant and equipment balance net of accumulated depreciation  depletion and amortization related to proved properties would be reclassified to intangible assets at december  and  respectively 
the company has been amortizing these amounts under the unit of production method and would continue to amortize the mineral rights under this method 
based on its understanding of the scope of the eitf deliberations  the company believes the adoption of this potential decision would have no material effect on its results of operations 
results of operations we derive our revenues  earnings and cash flows from two primary business segments marine contracting and oil and gas production 
within marine contracting  we operate primarily in the gulf of mexico gulf  and recently in the north sea and asia pacific  with services that cover the lifecycle of an offshore oil or gas field 
our current diversified fleet of vessels and remotely operated vehicles rovs and trencher systems perform services that support drilling  well completion  intervention  construction and decommissioning projects involving pipelines  production platforms  risers and subsea production systems 
we also have a significant investment in offshore oil and gas production as well as production facilities 
operations in the production facilities segment should begin in as marco polo comes online 
our customers include major and independent oil and gas producers  pipeline transmission companies and offshore engineering and construction firms 
comparison of years ended and revenues 
during the year ended december   revenues increased million  or  to million compared to million for the year ended december  the marine contracting segment contributed million of the increase  primarily as a result of the acquisition of the seawell during the third quarter of in addition  the q  intrepid and eclipse worked a full year in as compared to nine months in the prior year  as these vessels were placed in service in the second quarter of oil and gas production revenue for the year ended december  increased million  or  to million from million during the prior year 
the increase was due to a increase in our average realized commodity prices to per mcfe  net of hedges in place per mcfe of natural gas and per barrel of oil in from per mcfe per mcfe of natural gas and per barrel of oil in production increased to bcfe during from bcfe during the prior year as a result of the property acquisitions during the third quarter of and gunnison coming on line in december gross profit 
gross profit of million for was million  or  greater than the million gross profit recorded in the prior year due entirely to the revenue increase in oil and gas production mentioned above 
oil and gas production gross profit increased million from million in to million for  due to the increases in average realized commodity prices and production described above 
gross margins improved to for the year ended december  compared to during due primarily to the aforementioned increases in average realized commodity prices 
marine contracting margins decreased from for to during due mainly to the depressed markets for offshore construction in the gom and the north sea  increased competition in the ocs market and increased offshore insurance costs offset by the impact of charges recorded in the fourth quarter of related to a contract dispute 
selling administrative expenses 
selling and administrative expenses were million in  which is more than the million incurred in  primarily due to the addition of business units acquired and higher ert incentive accruals 
selling and administrative expenses were of revenues for  which was two points better than the for due primarily to the eex settlement charges in the fourth quarter of other income expense 
the company reported other expense of million for the year ended december  in contrast to million for included in other expense for is a million gain on our foreign currency derivative associated with the acquisition of well ops uk limited recorded in other income in june net interest expense of million for is higher than the million in the prior year as a result of our higher debt levels and the reduction of capitalized interest expense as the q and intrepid were in service for only the last nine month s of income taxes 
income taxes increased to million for  compared to million in the prior year period due to increased profitability 
the effective rate increased to in compared to in due primarily to provisions for foreign taxes 
the internal revenue service irs is in the process of examining our income tax return for years and  and the pre acquisition income tax return for canyon offshore inc we believe the ultimate resolution of these audits will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  liquidity or results of operations 
net income 
net income of million for was million  or  greater than  as a result of the factors described above 
comparison of years ended and revenues 
during the year ended december   the company s revenues increased million  or  to million compared to million for the year ended december  with the marine contracting segment contributing all of the increase 
marine contracting revenues increased to million for the year ended december  as compared to million in the prior year 
our acquisitions of canyon offshore and well ops uk ltd 
added million and million  respectively 
the remainder of the increase was due to the addition of three deepwater construction vessels the q  the intrepid and the eclipse 
oil and gas production revenue for the year ended december  decreased less than to million from million during the prior year 
an increase in production  lead by the significant shell and hess acquisitions made late in the third quarter of  was offset by lower average realized commodity prices 
oil and gas production increased to bcfe in from bcfe during  while our average realized commodity price declined to per mcfe per mcf of natural gas and per barrel of oil in as compared to per mcfe per mcf of natural gas and per barrel of oil in the prior year 
oil and condensate represented of ert revenue in compared to in gross profit 
gross profit of million for the year ended december  was million  or  below the million gross profit recorded in the prior year with both segments contributing to the decline 
marine contracting gross profit decreased million  or  to million during the year ended december  compared to million during our dp vessels generated million of gross profit  only of the million generated in the prior year  due in part to the charges recorded in the fourth quarter related to a contract dispute 
margins for this segment decreased to for the year ended december  compared to in while our shallow water diving division margins held strong at due to a large amount of shelf repair work following hurricane lili  the dp fleet only contributed margins in compared to in the prior year 
oil and gas production gross profit decreased million from million in the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  due mainly to the aforementioned decrease in average realized commodity prices 
margins declined to during from during due to platform repairs and the time necessary for pipelines to return to full production following hurricane lili 
selling and administrative expenses 
selling and administrative expenses of million in were million  or  higher than the million incurred during the increase is primarily due to the acquisitions of canyon and well ops uk ltd 
and a charge taken for the settlement of litigation in the fourth quarter of other income expense 
the company reported net interest expense and other of million for the year ended december  in contrast to million for the prior year 
this increase is due to the increase in debt from our capital program  which resulted in an additional million in interest expense  offset by a million gain on our foreign currency hedge related to the well ops uk ltd 
acquisition included in other income in the third quarter of income taxes 
income taxes decreased to million for the year ended december   compared to million in the prior year due to decreased profitability 
federal income taxes were provided at the statutory rate of in however  our deduction of q construction costs as research and development expenditures for federal tax purposes resulted in cdi paying no federal income taxes in and since the deduction of q construction costs affects financial and taxable income in different years  the entire and provisions for federal taxes were reflected as deferred income taxes 
net income 
net income of million for the year ended december  was million  or  less than the million earned in as a result of factors described above 
item liquidity and capital resources liquidity and capital resources in august  we closed the long term marad financing for construction of the q this us government guaranteed financing is pursuant to title xi of the merchant marine act of which is administered by the maritime administration 
we refer to this debt as marad debt 
in january  the maritime administration agreed to expand the facility to million to include the modifications to the vessel which had been approved during we drew million on this facility 
in january  we acquired canyon offshore  inc  in july  we acquired the well operations business unit of technip coflexip and  in august  ert made two significant property acquisitions see further discussion below 
these acquisitions significantly increased our debt to total book capitalization ratio from at december  to at december  in order to reduce this leverage  on january   cdi completed the private placement of million of a newly designated class of cumulative convertible preferred stock series a cumulative convertible preferred stock  par value per share which is convertible into  shares of cal dive common stock at per share 
as of december  our debt to total book capitalization declined to and working capital increased to million from million at december  operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities was million during  as compared to million during due primarily to an increase in profitability and a million increase in depreciation and amortization resulting from the aforementioned increase in production levels as well as depreciation on additional dp vessels placed in service 
this increase was partially offset by funding from accounts receivable collections decreasing million as receivables have grown primarily as a result of increased ert production levels 
horizon offshore  inc provided of the company s revenues during further  receivables included million at december  related to horizon 
net cash provided by operating activities was million during the year ended december   as compared to million during this decrease was due mainly to decreased profitability and the collection of a million tax refund during from the irs relating to the deduction of q construction costs as research and development expenditures for federal tax purposes 
depreciation and amortization also increased million to million due to the depreciation of new vessels placed in service during and to increased depletion related to increased production levels from ert 
this was offset by an increase in funding required for accounts receivable collections during compared to investing activities 
capital expenditures have consisted principally of strategic asset acquisitions related to the purchase or construction of dp vessels  acquisition of select businesses  improvements to existing vessels  acquisition of oil and gas properties and construction of deepwater production facilities 
we incurred million of capital investments during  million during and million in we incurred million of capital expenditures during the year ended december  compared to million during the prior year 
included in the capital expenditures during was million for the purchase of rov units to support the canyon msa agreement with technip coflexip to provide robotic and trenching services  million related to gunnison development costs  including the spar  as well as million relating to ert s well exploitation program 
included in capital expenditures in was million for the construction of the q and million relating to the intrepid dp conversion and eclipse upgrade 
also included in was over million in ert offshore property acquisitions see discussion below as well as approximately million related to gunnison development costs  including the spar 
included in the million of capital expenditures in was million for the construction of the q  million for the conversion of the intrepid  million relating to the purchase of two dp vessels the foot by foot mystic viking and the foot by foot eclipse  and expenditures of million for initial gunnison development costs and the ert well enhancement program 
in addition  in march  cdi acquired substantially all of the assets of professional divers of new orleans in exchange for million 
the assets purchased included the foot four point moored dsv the mr 
sonny  three utility vessels and associated diving equipment including two saturation diving systems 
this acquisition was accounted for as a purchase with the acquisition price of million being allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their estimated fair values with the balance of the purchase price million being recorded as goodwill 
in march  ert acquired additional interests  ranging from to  in four fields acquired last year  enabling ert to take over as operator of one field 
ert paid  in cash and assumed exxon mobil s pro rata share of the abandonment obligation for the acquired interests 
on august   ert acquired the working interest of shell exploration production company in the south marsh island smi field 
ert paid million in cash and assumed shell s pro rata share of the related decommissioning liability 
ert also completed the purchase of interests in seven gulf of mexico fields from amerada hess including its ownership position in smi for million in cash and assumption of amerada hess pro rata share of the related decommissioning liability 
as a result  ert is the operator with an effective working interest in that field 
in july  cdi purchased the subsea well operations business unit of cso ltd  a wholly owned subsidiary of technip coflexip  for approximately million million cash and million deferred tax liability assumption 
in june  ert acquired a package of offshore properties from williams exploration and production 
ert paid million and assumed the pro rata share of the abandonment obligation for the acquired interests 
the blocks purchased represent an average net working interest in gulf of mexico leases 
in april  ert acquired a interest in east cameron block  including existing wells  equipment and improvements 
the property  located in feet of water  was jointly owned by murphy exploration production company and callon petroleum operating company 
terms included a cash payment of approximately million to reimburse the owners for the inception to date cost of the subsea wellhead and umbilical and an overriding royalty interest in future production 
cal dive completed the temporarily abandoned number one well and performed a subsea tie back to host platform 
the cost of completion and tie back was approximately million with first production occurring in august in january  cdi purchased canyon  a supplier of remotely operated vehicles rovs and robotics to the offshore construction and telecommunications industries 
cdi purchased canyon for cash of million  the assumption of million of canyon debt offset by million of cash acquired   shares of our common stock  shares of which we purchased as treasury shares during the fourth quarter of and a commitment to purchase the redeemable stock in canyon at a price to be determined by canyon s performance during the years through from continuing employees at a minimum purchase price of per share 
in june  cdi  along with gulfterra energy partners lp gulfterra  formed deepwater gateway  llc a venture to design  construct  install  own and operate a tension leg platform tlp production hub primarily for anadarko petroleum corporation s marco polo field discovery in the deepwater gulf of mexico 
our share of the construction costs is estimated to be approximately million approximately million of which had been incurred as of december  
in august  the company along with gulfterra  completed a non recourse project financing for this venture  terms of which include a minimum equity investment for cdi of million  all of which had been paid as of december   and is recorded as investment in production facilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
terms of the financing also require cdi to guarantee a balloon payment at the end of the financing term in estimated to be million 
the company has not recorded any liability for this guarantee as management believes that it is unlikely the company will be required to pay the balloon payment 
in april  ert acquired a working interest in gunnison  a deepwater gulf of mexico prospect of kerr mcgee oil gas corp 
consistent with cdi s philosophy of avoiding exploratory risk  financing for the exploratory costs of approximately million was provided by an investment partnership okcd investments  ltd 
or okcd  the investors of which include current and former cdi senior management  in exchange for a revenue interest that is an overriding royalty interest of of cdi s working interest 
cdi provided no guarantees to the investment partnership 
the board of directors established three criteria to determine a commercial discovery and the commitment of cal dive funds million barrels gross of reserves  estimated development costs of million consistent with mboe  and a cdi estimated shareholder return of no less than
