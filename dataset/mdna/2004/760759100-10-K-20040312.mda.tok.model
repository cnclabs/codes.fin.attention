item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and their notes contained in this annual report on form k 
overview of our business we are a leading provider of non hazardous solid waste collection and disposal services in the united states 
we provide solid waste collection services for commercial  industrial  municipal and residential customers through collection companies in states 
we also own or operate transfer stations  solid waste landfills and recycling facilities 
we generate revenue primarily from our solid waste collection operations  and our remaining revenue is from landfill disposal services and other services  including recycling and compost  mulch and soil operations 
the following table reflects our total revenue by source for the years ended december   and in millions collection residential commercial industrial other total collection transfer and disposal less intercompany transfer and disposal  net other total revenue our revenue from collection operations consists of fees we receive from commercial  industrial  municipal and residential customers 
our residential and commercial collection operations in some markets are based on long term contracts with municipalities 
we generally provide industrial and commercial collection operations to individual customers under contracts with terms up to three years 
our revenue from landfill operations is from disposal or tipping fees charged to third parties 
in general  we integrate our recycling operations with our collection operations and obtain revenue from the sale of recyclable materials 
no one customer has individually accounted for more than of our consolidated revenue or of our reportable segment revenue in any of the last three years 
the cost of our collection operations is primarily variable and includes disposal  labor  self insurance  fuel and equipment maintenance costs 
we try to be more efficient by controlling the movement of waste streams from the point of collection through disposal 
during the three months ended december   approximately of the total volume of waste we collected was disposed of at landfills we own or operate 
our landfill costs include daily operating expenses  costs of capital for cell development  costs for final capping  closure and post closure  and the legal and administrative costs of ongoing environmental compliance 
we expense all indirect landfill development costs as they are incurred 
we use life cycle accounting and the units of consumption method to recognize certain direct landfill costs 
in life cycle accounting  certain direct costs are capitalized  and charged to expense based upon the consumption of cubic yards of available airspace 
these costs include all costs to acquire and construct a site 
obligations associated with final capping  closure and post closure are capitalized  and amortized on a units of consumption basis as airspace is consumed 

table of contents cost and airspace estimates are developed annually by engineers 
these estimates are used by our operating and accounting personnel to annually adjust our rates used to expense capitalized costs 
changes in these estimates primarily relate to changes in available airspace  inflation and applicable regulations 
changes in available airspace include changes in design and changes due to the addition of airspace lying in expansion areas that we believe has a probable likelihood of being permitted 
our operations are managed and reviewed through five regions which we designate as our reportable segments 
from to  operating income increased in our central  southwestern and western regions due to an overall increase in revenue resulting from the successful execution of our growth strategy 
in the eastern and southern regions  increased revenue was offset by negative local economic conditions and an increase in costs associated with the long haul transport of waste by third party vendors 
financial objectives in january  we publicly announced our objectives for the year 
these objectives included the following generating free cash flow equal to of net income 
growing revenue by to  with to from price increases and to from volume growth 
generating earnings per share before cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles of to 
using free cash flow to enhance shareholder value by completing strategic acquisitions and repurchasing up to million of our stock 
business performance despite a weak economy and a significant increase in insurance expense  we were able to exceed our free cash flow  internal growth and share repurchase objectives during the economic slowdown which began in continued to negatively impact the portion of our business servicing the manufacturing sector and non residential construction activity during despite the weakness we experienced in the aspects of our business noted above  our internal growth from core operations for was with from price increases and from volume growth 
during  we continued to benefit from several long term franchise and municipal contracts that were secured during in addition  our geographic mix of business  which is concentrated in high growth markets  positively impacted our operating results 
as a result  during we were able to exceed the internal growth objectives we established at the beginning of the year 
during our operating margins were negatively impacted by increased costs for self insurance expense 
this increase in self insurance expense relates to existing claims and is attributable to the expansion of our operations and various changes in estimates as a result of continued negative trends through our current policy year  based on recent actuarial claims experience  expected claims development and medical cost inflation 
in addition to the economic slowdown and increased costs for self insurance  during our operating margins were also negatively impacted by increased fuel costs  increased depreciation expense primarily associated with capital additions  increased state landfill taxes and increased revenue from municipal contracts and transfer stations which have lower margins than our other lines of business 
this decrease in operating margins was partially offset by a decrease in costs associated with the termination of our operating lease facility and a decrease in selling  general and administrative expense as a percent of revenue 
during  we began a number of initiatives designed to increase efficiencies and reduce costs including the implementation of a number of management information systems such as route optimization  customer relationship tracking and equipment maintenance software 
we continued to realize benefits from these initiatives in 
table of contents notwithstanding the impact of the economic slowdown and the increase in self insurance and other expenses  our earnings per share before cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles for the year ended december  was 
however we were able to generate free cash flow of million consisting of cash provided by operating activities of million  less purchases of property and equipment of million  plus proceeds from the sale of property and equipment of million which substantially exceeded our objective 
during october  our board of directors increased our previously authorized share repurchase program from million to million and also authorized an additional million share repurchase program 
we used our free cash flow during to repurchase million shares of our common stock for million 
also during july  our board of directors initiated a quarterly dividend of 
per share 
financial objectives our financial objectives for assume no deterioration or improvement in the overall economy from that experienced during the fourth quarter specific guidance is as follows we expect to generate free cash flow of approximately million 
we anticipate using our free cash flow to repurchase shares of our common stock under our million share repurchase program approved by our board of directors in october and to continue to pay quarterly cash dividends 
we anticipate earnings per share of to per share 
we expect internal growth from core operations to be  with approximately attributable to price increases and attributable to volume growth 
business initiatives our business initiatives for are generally a continuation of those initiated in the prior two years and are dependent on standardizing our business processes and improving our systems 
ensuring that our people understand our initiatives and processes and are trained on our new systems is essential to the overall success of our initiatives 
our business initiatives for are as follows pricing initiatives 
during the fourth quarter of  we implemented a broad based pricing initiative across all lines of our business 
the purpose of this initiative is to recover increasing costs 
we began to realize the benefit of this initiative during the fourth quarter of and our anticipated internal revenue growth in includes the benefit we expect to realize from this initiative during the next year 
improve the quality of our revenue 
the first step in this process was completed in and included installing a standardized billing and operating system 
this system enables us to  among other things  stratify our customers to determine how our rates compare to current market pricing 
during  we implemented the second generation of this software which we call rsi rsi  our company s core business system  provides a variety of functionalities including customer service  dispatch  billing  sales analysis  account retention and route productivity analysis 
we currently monitor our return on investment by market place and are in the process of instituting a return on investment pricing model 
this model will eventually allow us to track our return on investment by customer 
during  we also implemented a customer relationship management system 
this system improves the productivity of our sales force by helping to establish marketing priorities and track sales leads 
it also tracks renewal periods for potential commercial  industrial and franchise contracts 
our focus during will be to continue to ensure our sales force is properly trained on this system and using it as intended 

table of contents improve the productivity of our operations 
we use a grid productivity program that enables us to benchmark the performance of our drivers 
in addition  in our larger markets  we use a route optimization program to minimize drive times and improve operational density 
during  we will continue to update our disposal optimization reviews 
these reviews determine which local disposal option maximizes our return on invested capital and cash flow 
improve fleet management and procurement 
in february  we selected dossier as our fleet management and parts procurement system 
during  we implemented dossier at all of our significant hauling and landfill operations 
among other features  this system tracks parts inventories  generates automatic quantity order points and logs all maintenance work 
it allows us to capture and review information to ensure our preventive maintenance programs comply with manufacturers warranties and governmental regulations 
in addition  the purchase order module within this system allows us to cross reference purchasing information with our inventory 
enhance operational and financial reporting systems 
we have several initiatives aimed at improving our operational and financial reporting systems 
the overall goal of these initiatives is to provide us with detailed information  prepared in a consistent manner  that will allow us to quickly analyze and act upon trends in our business 
the most significant of these systems is our enterprise wide general ledger package 
we successfully converted all of our locations to lawson general ledger software in and in successfully converted all of our locations to lawson fixed asset software 
all of the system initiatives mentioned above will provide us with more consistent and detailed information  thus allowing us to make quicker and more informed business decisions 
in addition  during  all of our significant software applications were standardized and centralized at our data center in fort lauderdale  florida 
this standardization and centralization provides us with consolidated information concerning our operations across a variety of operational and financial disciplines 
it also significantly enhances our ability to execute our disaster recovery plan  if necessary 
expand our safety training programs 
as part of our ongoing emphasis on safe work practices and in light of increasing insurance costs  we expanded our safety training programs in we have signed a multi year agreement with dupont safety resources to assist in successfully completing this initiative 
critical accounting policies and disclosures our consolidated financial statements have been prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and necessarily include certain estimates and judgments made by management 
the following is a list of accounting policies that we believe are the most critical in understanding our 
table of contents company s financial condition  results of operations and cash flows  and may require management to make subjective or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain 
subjective or disclosure policy description complex judgments reference landfill accounting life cycle accounting we use life cycle accounting and the units of consumption method to recognize certain landfill costs over the life of the site 
in life cycle accounting  all costs to acquire and construct a site are capitalized  and charged to expense based upon the consumption of cubic yards of available airspace 
obligations associated with final capping  closure and post closure are capitalized  and amortized on a units of consumption basis as airspace is consumed 
cost and airspace estimates are developed annually by engineers 
changes in these estimates could significantly affect our amortization  depletion  and accretion expense 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations landfill and environmental matters 
note  accrued landfill  environmental and legal costs in the consolidated financial statements 
probable expansion airspace we include in our calculation of total available airspace expansion areas that we believe have a probable likelihood that the expansion area will ultimately be permitted 
we have developed six criteria that must be met before an expansion area is designated as probable expansion airspace 
we believe that satisfying each of these criteria demonstrates a high likelihood that expansion airspace that is incorporated in our landfill costing will be permitted 
however  because some of these criteria are judgmental  they may exclude expansion airspace that will eventually be permitted or include expansion airspace that will not be permitted 
in either of these scenarios  our amortization  depletion  final capping  closure and post closure expense could change significantly 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations landfill and environmental matters 
note  accrued landfill  environmental and legal costs in the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents subjective or disclosure policy description complex judgments reference final capping  closure and post closure prior to january   costs for final closure of our landfills and costs for providing required post closure monitoring and maintenance were charged to cost of operations based upon consumed airspace using the units of consumption method 
these costs were not inflated or discounted to the present value of total estimated costs 
on january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
under sfas  obligations associated with final capping activities that occur during the operating life of the landfill are recognized on a units of consumption basis as airspace is consumed within each discrete capping event 
obligations related to closure and post closure activities that occur after the landfill has ceased operations are recognized on a units of consumption basis as airspace is consumed throughout the entire landfill life 
landfill retirement obligations are capitalized as the related liabilities are recognized and amortized using the units of consumption method over the airspace consumed within the capping event or the airspace consumed throughout the entire landfill  depending upon the nature of the obligation 
all obligations are initially measured at estimated fair value 
fair value is calculated on a present value basis using an inflation rate and the company s credit adjusted  risk free rate 
total future costs for capping  closure and post closure are developed annually by engineers 
changes in these estimates could affect our expenses relating to final capping  closure and post closure

note  accrued landfill  environmental and legal costs in the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents subjective or disclosure policy description complex judgments reference self insurance our insurance programs for worker s compensation  general liability  vehicle liability and employee related health care benefits are effectively self insured 
self insurance accruals are based on claims reported and actuarial estimates of claims incurred but not reported 
estimates of claims development and claims incurred but not reported are developed actuarially 
if actual claims experience or development is significantly different than our estimates  our self insurance expense would change 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations selected balance sheet accounts 
note  commitments and contingencies in the consolidated financial statements 
property and equipment expenditures for improvements  repairs and maintenance expenditures for major additions and improvements to facilities are capitalized 
all expenditures for maintenance and repairs are expensed when incurred 
whether certain expenditures improve an asset or lengthen its useful life is subject to our judgment 
accordingly  the actual useful lives of our assets could differ from our estimates 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations property and equipment 
note  summary of significant accounting policies in the consolidated financial statements 
useful lives property and equipment are recorded at cost 
depreciation and amortization expense is provided over the estimated useful lives of the applicable assets using the straight line method 
the estimated useful lives are seven to forty years for buildings and improvements  five to twelve years for vehicles  seven to ten years for most landfill equipment  three to fifteen years for all other equipment  and five to twelve years for furniture and fixtures 
our estimates regarding the useful lives of our depreciable assets are based on our judgment 
accordingly  actual useful lives could differ from our estimates

table of contents subjective or disclosure policy description complex judgments reference capitalized interest we capitalize interest on landfill cell construction and other construction projects in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 capitalization of interest cost 
capitalizing too little or too much interest expense could lead to a misstatement of interest expense in the statement of income 
in order to minimize this risk  construction projects must meet the following criteria before interest is capitalized total construction costs are  or greater  the construction phase is one month or longer  and the assets have a useful life of one year or longer

note  summary of significant accounting policies in the consolidated financial statements 
revenue and accounts receivable revenue consists primarily of collection fees from various customer types and transfer and landfill disposal fees charged to third parties 
advance billings are recorded as deferred revenue 
revenue is recognized over the period in which services are provided 
no one customer has individually accounted for more than of our consolidated revenue or of our reportable segment revenue in any of the past three years 
reserves for accounts receivable are provided when a receivable is believed to be uncollectible or generally when a receivable is in excess of days old 
establishing reserves against specific accounts receivable and the overall adequacy of our accounts receivable reserve is a matter of judgment 
if our judgment and estimates concerning the adequacy of our reserve for accounts receivable is incorrect  bad debt expense would change

table of contents subjective or disclosure policy description complex judgments reference derivatives from time to time  we use derivatives to limit our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and diesel fuel prices 
these derivatives have been accounted for in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the hedging relationships we have entered into are expected to be either effective or highly effective and have been determined to meet the criteria for hedge accounting 
if  in the future  these relationships are no longer expected to be or highly effective  or if they no longer meet the criteria for hedge accounting  our results of operations could change

note  debt and note  fuel hedge in the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents subjective or disclosure policy description complex judgments reference long lived asset impairments long lived assets consist primarily of property  equipment  goodwill and other intangible assets 
we periodically evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred as further described in note of the consolidated financial statements that may warrant revision of the estimated useful life of long lived assets or whether the remaining balance of these assets should be evaluated for possible impairment 
we use an estimate of the undiscounted cash flow over the remaining life of the assets in assessing their recoverability 
in addition  goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if indicators of impairment arise 
in testing for impairment  we estimate the fair value of each operating segment of our business and compare the fair values with the carrying values 
if the fair value of an operating segment is greater than its carrying value  then no impairment results 
we measure impairment loss as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or operating segment exceeds its fair value 
our estimates of future cash flows and fair values are based on our judgment 
accordingly  we could designate certain assets as impaired that are not and fail to identify certain impaired assets

note  summary of significant accounting policies and note  business combinations in the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents business combinations we make decisions to acquire or invest in businesses based on financial and strategic considerations 
businesses acquired are accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and are included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition 
we acquired various solid waste businesses during the years ended december   and the aggregate purchase prices we paid for these transactions was million  million and million  respectively 
the aggregate purchase price paid for businesses acquired during  less cash and restricted cash acquired plus debt assumed  was million 
cost in excess of fair value of net assets acquired for acquisitions totaled approximately million 
as of december  we had intangible assets  net of accumulated amortization  of  million  which consist primarily of the cost in excess of fair value of net assets acquired 
during  million of the total purchase price paid for acquisitions and contingent payments to former owners was allocated to landfill airspace 
as of december   we had million of landfill development costs net of accumulated depletion and amortization which includes purchase price allocated to landfill airspace as well as other capitalized landfill costs 
when a landfill is acquired as part of a group of assets  purchase price is allocated to airspace based upon the discounted expected future cash flows of the landfill relative to the other assets within the acquired group and is adjusted for other non depletable landfill assets and liabilities acquired primarily final capping  closure and post closure liabilities 
landfill purchase price is amortized using the units of consumption method over total available airspace which includes probable expansion airspace where appropriate 
cost in excess of fair value of net assets acquired for acquisitions totaled approximately million 
as of december  we had intangible assets  net of accumulated amortization  of  million  which consist primarily of the cost in excess of fair value of net assets acquired 
cost in excess of fair value of net assets acquired for acquisitions totaled approximately million 
as of december   we had intangible assets  net of accumulated amortization  of  million  which consist primarily of the cost in excess of fair value of net assets acquired 
in addition  during  million of the total purchase price for acquisitions and contingent payments to former owners was allocated to landfill airspace 
consolidated results of operations years ended december   and our income before cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles was million for the year ended december   as compared to million in and million in net income for the year ended december  includes an after tax expense of million net of an income tax benefit of million  or 
per share  as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle resulting from the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  and a change in accounting principle for our methane gas collection systems

our operating results for the years ended december  and include other charges income described below 

table of contents the following table summarizes our costs and expenses in millions of dollars and as a percentage of our revenue for through revenue cost of operations depreciation  amortization and depletion of property and equipment amortization of intangible assets accretion selling  general and administrative expenses other charges income operating income revenue 
revenue was  million   million and  million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
revenue increased by million  or  from to revenue increased by million  or  from to the following table reflects the components of our revenue growth for the years ended december   and core price fuel surcharges recycling commodities total price core volume non core volume total volume total internal growth acquisitions taxes a total revenue growth a represents new taxes levied on landfill volumes in certain states that are passed on to customers 
we experienced moderate growth in revenue due to core pricing during the first three quarters of during the fourth quarter of our revenue growth from core pricing increased due to our broad based pricing initiative 
we anticipate that we will continue to realize the benefit from this pricing initiative during during  the economic slowdown which began during continued to negatively impact our business 
however  during  our revenue growth from core volume continued to be positively impacted by long term franchise and municipal contracts that were secured during as we entered into fewer new franchise and municipal contracts during versus  we anticipate that we will experience less revenue growth from core volume in the economic slowdown which began in continued to negatively impact the portion of our business servicing the manufacturing sector and non residential construction industry during volumes attributable to manufacturing and construction activity continued to weaken during the weakness in our business attributable to the economic slowdown was partially offset by an increase in recycling commodity prices in the early part of 
table of contents despite the weakness we experienced in the aspects of our business noted above  our internal growth from core operations for was 
during  we secured several long term franchise and municipal contracts 
we also benefited from the geographic mix of our business which favors high growth markets 
during the first and second quarters of  our revenue was negatively impacted by weakness in recycling commodity prices 
in addition  during the second quarter of  we began to see a slowdown in revenue from the manufacturing sector  particularly in the midwestern and mid atlantic states 
during the third quarter of  the economic slowdown began to impact our industrial business servicing the non residential construction industry 
landfill volumes attributable to manufacturing and construction activity began to weaken 
in addition  the slowdown we began to experience in the second quarter in the manufacturing sector became more acute as we experienced significant shift reductions and plant closings in the southeastern united states  particularly in the textile and home furnishing industries in the carolinas 
these conditions were reflected in our internal growth numbers  which were approximately half of what we experienced in prior quarters 
during the fourth quarter of  we continued to see a weakening in waste volumes from the manufacturing sector 
we also continued to see a slowdown in commercial construction and special waste activity which resulted in both volume reductions and price sensitivity for these services 
furthermore  we began to see a softening in residential construction activity 
outlook we anticipate internal growth from core operations to be during assuming no deterioration or improvement in the overall economy from that experienced during the fourth quarter of however  our price and volume growth may remain flat or may decline in depending upon economic conditions and our success in implementing our pricing initiative 
cost of operations 
cost of operations was  million   million and  million  or  as a percentage of revenue   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in aggregate dollars in all periods presented is primarily a result of the expansion of our operations through acquisitions and internal growth 
the increase in cost of operations as a percentage of revenue from to is primarily attributable to self insurance expense 
this increase in self insurance expense relates to existing claims and is attributable to the expansion of our operations and various changes in estimates as a result of continued negative trends through our current policy year  based on recent actuarial claims experience  expected claims development and medical cost inflation 
the increase in cost of operations as a percentage of revenue is also due to increased fuel prices  an increase in waste taxes levied on landfill volumes in certain states  an increase in revenue generated by lines of business that produce lower operating margins and an increase in the long haul transport of waste by third party vendors 
these increases in costs were partially offset by the elimination of closure and post closure expense as a component of cost of operations in accordance with sfas and the termination of our operating lease facility 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded a charge of million on an after tax basis  or million on a pre tax basis 
of this pre tax amount  million was recorded to cost of operations which relates primarily to the downsizing of our compost  mulch and soil business and related inventory adjustments and an increase in self insurance reserves 
excluding the impact of this charge  cost of operations for was  million  or as a percent of revenue 
the increase in adjusted cost of operations as a percentage of revenue from to is primarily the result of the economic slowdown  higher costs for self insurance  and increased revenue from municipal contracts and transfer stations which have higher operating costs 
these increases in cost of operations were partially offset by improved operating efficiencies  higher recycling commodity prices  lower fuel costs and the termination of our operating lease facility 

table of contents to date in  we have experienced a significant increase in fuel prices 
we believe that cost of operations as a percentage of revenue may continue to remain high depending upon the cost of fuel  health insurance  risk insurance and other key components of our cost structure and the severity and duration of the economic slowdown 
depreciation  amortization and depletion of property and equipment 
depreciation  amortization and depletion expenses for property and equipment were million  million and million  or  as a percentage of revenue   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in aggregate dollars and as a percentage of revenue from to is primarily due to an increase in landfill amortization associated with the adoption of sfas the remaining increase from to and the increase in aggregate dollars and as a percentage of revenue from to is due to increased depreciation expense resulting from capital expenditures  acquisitions and the purchase of equipment originally placed into service pursuant to an operating lease 
amortization of intangible assets 
intangible assets consist primarily of cost in excess of fair value of net assets acquired  but also includes values assigned to long term contracts  covenants not to compete and customer relationships 
expenses for amortization of intangible assets were million  million and million  or  as a percentage of revenue   
and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the decrease in aggregate dollars and as a percent of revenue from to is due to the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  effective january  under which most of our intangible assets are no longer subject to amortization 
accretion expense 
accretion expense was million or  as a percentage of revenue   for the year ended december  versus for and accretion expense resulted from the adoption of sfas as of january  selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million  million and million  or  as a percentage of revenue   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increases in aggregate dollars are primarily a result of the expansion of our operations through acquisitions and internal growth 
the decrease as a percentage of revenue from to is primarily due to leveraging our existing overhead structure over an expanding revenue base 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded a charge of million on an after tax basis  or million on a pre tax basis 
of this pre tax amount  million was recorded to selling  general and administrative expenses 
excluding the impact of this charge  selling  general and administrative expenses for were million  or as a percent of revenue  which is consistent with we believe that selling  general and administrative expenses in the range of of revenue are appropriate for given our business platform 
other charges 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded a million gain on the sale of certain assets for amounts exceeding estimates originally made during the fourth quarter of during the fourth quarter of  we recorded a charge of million on an after tax basis  or million on a pre tax basis 
of this pre tax amount  million was recorded to other charges which relates primarily to completed and planned divestitures and closings of certain core and non core businesses and asset impairments 
operating income 
operating income was million  million and million  or  as a percentage of revenue   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
excluding the impact of the other charges income we recorded in the fourth quarters of and  our operating income was million  or  and million  or  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
interest expense 
we incurred interest expense on our revolving credit facility  unsecured notes and tax exempt bonds 
interest expense was million  million and million for the years ended 
table of contents december   and  respectively 
the increase in interest expense from to is due to higher debt balances resulting from additional tax exempt financings partially offset by lower interest rates 
the decrease in interest expense from to is due to a general market decrease in interest rates and an increase in tax exempt financings  which generally bear interest at lower rates than our unsecured notes 
the decrease in interest expense is also due to interest rate swap agreements that we entered into during and capitalized interest was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
interest and other income expense  net 
interest and other income  net of other expense  was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the variances during the periods are primarily due to fluctuations in cash and restricted cash balances and net gains on the disposition of assets during and income taxes 
our provision for income taxes was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
our effective income tax rate was  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
our effective tax rate for included certain non tax deductible items related to the charge we recorded during the fourth quarter of excluding the impact of this charge  our effective tax rate for was cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles 
during the first quarter of  we adopted sfas sfas required us to change the methodology we used to record final capping  closure and post closure costs related to our landfills 
as of january   we recorded an after tax expense of million  or million on a pre tax basis  as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle resulting from the adoption of sfas in addition  we also recorded an after tax expense of million  or million on a pre tax basis  as a cumulative effect of a change in account principle for our methane gas collection systems 
this change in accounting for methane gas collection systems was prompted by a thorough evaluation of our landfill accounting policy in connection with the adoption of sfas and is consistent with the methodology used by other participants in the waste industry 
landfill and environmental matters among our most significant investments and most valuable assets are our landfills 
the additional disclosures included in this section provide the users of our financial statements with a clearer understanding of our investment in our landfills and various accounting principles that are unique to landfill operations

changes in design typically include significant modifications to a landfill s footprint or vertical slopes 
during  total available airspace increased by million cubic yards primarily due to new expansions undertaken and changes in design partially offset by consumption and divestitures 
during  total available airspace increased by million cubic yards primarily due to the opening of a greenfield site in south carolina  changes in engineering estimates and changes in design partially offset by consumption 
during  total available airspace increased by million cubic yards due to new expansions undertaken  two landfills that were acquired during the year and changes in design partially offset by airspace consumption and changes in engineering estimates 
as of december   we owned or operated solid waste landfills with total available disposal capacity estimated to be billion in place cubic yards 
total available disposal capacity represents the sum of estimated permitted airspace plus an estimate of probable expansion airspace 
these estimates are developed annually by engineers utilizing information provided by annual aerial surveys 
as of december   total available disposal capacity is estimated to be billion in place cubic yards of permitted airspace plus 
billion in place cubic yards of probable expansion airspace 
before airspace included in an expansion area is determined to be probable expansion airspace and  therefore  included in our calculation of total available disposal capacity  it must meet our expansion criteria 
see note  accrued landfill  environmental and legal costs of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for further information 
as of december   fifteen of our landfills meet the criteria for including probable expansion airspace in their total available disposal capacity 
at projected annual volumes  these fifteen landfills have an estimated remaining average site life of years  including probable expansion airspace 
the average estimated remaining life of all of our landfills is years 
as of december   four of our landfills that meet the criteria for including expansion airspace had obtained approval from local authorities and are proceeding into the state permitting process 
also  as of december   six of our fifteen landfills that meet the criteria for including expansion airspace had submitted permit applications to state authorities 
the remaining five landfills that meet the criteria for 
table of contents including expansion airspace are in the process of obtaining approval from local authorities and have not identified any fatal flaws or impediments associated with the expansions at either the local or state level 
final capping  closure and post closure costs as of january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
this statement required us to change the methodology we used to record final capping  closure and post closure costs 
see note  accrued landfill  environmental and legal costs  of the notes to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for further information 
as of december   accrued final capping  closure and post closure costs were million

under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended  the options qualified for and were designated as effective hedges of changes in the prices of forecasted diesel fuel purchases

expected maturity date fair value asset liability december  thereafter total variable rate debt amount outstanding in millions average interest rates interest rate swaps amount outstanding in millions average interest rates the fair value of variable rate debt approximates the carrying value since interest rates are variable and  thus  approximate current market rates 
free cash flow we define free cash flow  which is not a measure determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting standards  as cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment plus proceeds from the sale of property and equipment as presented in our consolidated statement of cash flows 
our free cash flow for the years ended december   and is calculated as follows in millions cash provided by operating activities purchases of property and equipment proceeds from the sale of property and equipment free cash flow we believe that the presentation of free cash flow  which is a non gaap financial measure  provides useful information regarding our recurring cash provided by operating activities after expenditures for property and equipment  net of proceeds from the sale of equipment 
it also demonstrates our ability to execute our financial strategy which includes reinvesting in existing capital assets to ensure a high level of customer service  investing in capital assets to facilitate growth in our customer base and services provided  pursuing strategic acquisitions that augment our existing business platform  repurchasing shares of common stock at prices that provide value to our shareholders  paying cash dividends  maintaining our investment grade rating and minimizing debt 
in addition  free cash flow is a key metric used to determine compensation 
free cash flow does not represent our cash flow available for discretionary expenditures because it excludes certain expenditures that are required or that we have committed to such as debt service requirements and dividend payments 
our definition of free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies 
seasonality our operations can be adversely affected by periods of inclement weather which could delay the collection and disposal of waste  reduce the volume of waste generated or delay the construction or expansion of our landfill sites and other facilities
