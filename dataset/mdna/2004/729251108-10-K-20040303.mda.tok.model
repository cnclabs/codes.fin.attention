forward looking statements speak only as of the date made  and neither plum creek nor its management undertakes any obligation to update or revise any forward looking statements 
overview operating performance operating income decreased by million  or  to million in this decrease of million was due primarily to lower operating income from our real estate  southern resources and manufactured products segments 
despite real estate revenues increasing by million to million  operating income from our real estate segment decreased by million  or  to million 
this decrease was due primarily to higher cost basis as a result of a million impairment charge and a million reduction in the sale of conservation easements 
operating income from our southern resources segment decreased by million  or  to million due primarily to the harvesting of smaller logs in during  our manufactured products segment reported an operating loss of million compared to operating income of million during this decrease of million was due primarily to low lumber prices resulting from an industry wide excess supply of lumber 
despite the million decline in operating income  net cash provided by operating activity increased by million to million in this difference was due primarily to a million increase in timberland sales and a million impairment charge related to real estate held for sale 
real estate basis and impairment charges are non cash expenses  which reduce operating income but do not impact net cash provided by operating activity 
key economic factors impacting our business our operating performance is impacted primarily by the supply and demand for logs in the united states 
the short term supply of logs is impacted primarily by weather 
in general  there were favorable harvesting conditions during most of  and as a result  there was an ample supply of logs 
the demand for logs in the united states is impacted by housing starts  repair and remodeling activities and the amount of imported lumber  primarily from canada 
housing starts are impacted primarily by interest rates 
mortgage interest rates continued at historically low levels during averaging for the year based on a year fixed rate conventional loan  which contributed to us housing starts of approximately million units during  their highest level in the past years 
despite these record housing starts  us lumber prices during the first half of were weak due in part to excess north american lumber production 
imports of lumber and other wood products into the united states are impacted by currency exchange rates  tariffs and quotas  and the relative cost of manufacturing wood products 
canadian imports into the us capture a significant share between and of the us lumber market 
a us industry coalition believes the canadian government  which owns most of the timberlands in canada  provides unfair subsidies by selling timber at below market prices 
prior to  a trade agreement with canada limited imports of lumber into the united states 
since may  the us has imposed duties on canadian imports 
at the same time  the us and canada have been trying to reach a negotiated settlement  but to date no settlement has been reached 
furthermore  reports indicate that the us imposed duties have had the unintended consequences of causing some canadian lumber manufacturers to increase their lumber production to lower their average production costs 
for the past several years  the us dollar has been strong compared to other major currencies in the world 
the strong us dollar has given canada and other exporting lumber countries a cost advantage over us lumber manufacturers 
the us dollar declined  however  during against the canadian dollar which appreciated by approximately during and several other major currencies 
during the second half of  us lumber prices improved in response to the stronger canadian dollar 
core timberlands during  we completed an evaluation of our timberlands 
we concluded that approximately million acres of our timberlands are highly productive and strategically located near key customers and markets 
we also identified approximately million acres of our timberlands as having values well in excess of timberland values higher and better use timberlands 
these properties are better suited for recreational  conservation or development purposes 
finally  we identified approximately million acres of our timberlands as being non strategic 
we expect to sell our higher and better use timberlands over the next years 
approximately half of the non strategic timberlands are made up of large parcels that are expected to be sold over the next two years 
the other half of the non strategic timberlands  which are generally in smaller tracts  is expected to be sold over the next five to ten years 
in the meantime  these timberlands continue to be used productively in our business of growing and selling timber 
the capital generated from the sale of timberlands will be used to increase the value of the company 
uses may include strategic acquisitions of additional core timberlands  investments in our business  payments of dividends  repayments of debt and or repurchases of our stock 
harvest levels our operating performance is also impacted by the volume of trees we harvest each year and the percentage of sawlogs and pulpwood included in our annual harvest 
during  we harvested a total of million tons compared to a total of million tons during we expect to harvest approximately million tons during future harvest levels may vary from historic levels to take advantage of favorable prices or due to factors outside of our control such as weather and fires 
future harvest levels may also be impacted by our sale of timberlands and the extent to which proceeds are reinvested in core timberlands 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect our most significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition prior to the timber company merger  the timber company recognized revenue from timber sales under three different methods  depending upon the terms of the sale 
the methods were delivered log sales  pay as cut contracts and timber deeds delivered log sales 
under a delivered log sale agreement  the seller cuts the tree and delivers it to the buyer 
risk of loss and title transfer to the buyer when the log is delivered 
revenue is recognized when the log is delivered to the customer 
with delivered log sales  the seller incurs the cost of logging and hauling 
for the last few days of an accounting period  there are typically delivered logs for which we have not received documentation and we have not created an invoice 
in that case  an accrual for these deliveries is made along with an accrual for the costs of logging and hauling 
pay as cut contracts 
pay as cut contracts are agreements pursuant to which the buyer agrees to harvest all of the trees on a tract of land for an agreed upon price for each of the different types of trees over the term of the contract usually to months 
in some cases an advance is received in connection with pay as cut contracts  and in other cases the buyer agrees to cut only certain trees on a tract of land 
under pay as cut contracts  the buyer is responsible for all logging and hauling costs 
title and risk of loss transfer to the buyer as the trees are cut 
the buyer furnishes us with supporting information for the amount of wood that has been removed along with their payment 
revenue is recognized when the trees are cut 
total revenue recognized under a pay as cut contract is a function of the total volume of wood actually removed multiplied by the agreed upon per unit price for each of the various types of trees on a tract of land 
there is typically a lag between the time the tree is harvested and the time the buyer pays for the tree 
at the end of each accounting period  we make an accrual for the trees that have been cut but for which we have not received payment 
timber deeds 
timber deeds are agreements pursuant to which the buyer agrees to harvest all of the trees on a tract of land over the term of the contract usually to months 
however  unlike a pay as cut contract  risk of loss and title to the trees transfer to the buyer when the contract is signed 
the buyer also pays the full purchase price when the contract is signed 
under a timber deed  the buyer is responsible for all logging and hauling costs 
revenue from a timber deed sale is recognized when the contract is signed 
timber deeds are generally marketed and sold to the highest bidder 
bids are typically based on a timber cruise an estimate of the total volume of timber on a tract of land broken down by the various types of trees such as softwood sawlogs  hardwood pulpwood  etc total revenue recognized under a timber deed is the amount of the highest bid and is not dependent upon the volume or types of trees actually harvested 
subsequent to the timber company merger  to comply with certain reit requirements we replaced timber deed agreements with lump sum sale agreements 
under a lump sum sale  the parties agree to a lump sum price for all the timber available for harvest on a tract of land 
generally the lump sum price is paid when the contract is signed 
however  unlike timber deeds  title to the timber and risk of loss transfers to the buyer as the timber is cut 
therefore  revenue is recognized each month based on the amount of timber actually harvested  compared to total timber available to be harvested on a tract of land over the term of the contract usually to months 
under a lump sum sale  the buyer is responsible for all logging and hauling costs 
lump sum sales are generally marketed and sold to the highest bidder 
bids are typically based on timber cruise information 
total revenue recognized under a lump sum sale contract is the amount of the highest bid  and is not dependent upon the volume or type of trees actually harvested 
since revenue is recognized under a lump sum sale agreement as the trees are cut  an estimate of how much revenue to recognize each month is made based on how much volume has been removed compared to the total volume available for harvest on a tract of land according to the timber cruise 
we generally receive weekly information from the buyer regarding how much volume has been removed 
additionally  we gather information by observing the tract to estimate the percentage of original timber harvested 
in most cases  the total volume harvested from a tract of land is different than the volume estimated in the timber cruise 
if the total volume removed is greater than the cruise estimated volume  we will stop recognizing revenue once the total revenue recognized is equal to total lump sum contract price 
no revenue will be recognized for volumes harvested in excess of the cruise estimated volume 
if the total volume removed is less than the cruise estimated volume  an adjustment will be recorded in the month in which we learn of the difference 
the adjustment is an increase in revenue equal to the difference between the total revenue recognized to date and the total lump sum contract price 
finally  for our larger lump sum contracts  which cover multiple tracts  we adjust revenues at the end of each accounting period for any known trends  which have materialized in the tracts that have been completely harvested 
for lump sum contracts completed during the past eight quarters  our largest quarterly adjustment to record the difference between estimated lump sum revenues and actual revenues has been million 
while the timing of revenue recognition under a timber deed and a lump sum contract is materially different  this change is not expected to have a material impact on the year to year comparison of our results of operations 
the following tables summarize amounts recognized under each method from sales to external customers in the company s financial statements for the years ended december in millions revenues from delivered log sales pay as cut sales lump sum sales december  december  accrued revenues for delivered and pay as cut log sales deferred revenues for lump sum contracts we attempt to estimate accrued revenues at the end of each accounting period based on the best information available 
we do not believe that there is a material difference between estimated accrued revenues and actual revenues 
substantially all of our timber sales in the northern resources segment are under delivered log sale agreements 
in our southern resources segment  a substantial portion of our timber sales consists of either pay as cut contracts or lump sum sales 
under both pay as cut contracts and lump sum sales  the buyer is responsible for the logging and hauling costs 
therefore  operating profit percentages are significantly higher in our southern resources segment 
real estate sales we estimate that included in the company s million acres of timberlands are million acres of higher and better use timberlands and million acres of non strategic timberlands 
the higher and better use timberlands are expected to be sold over the next years for conservation  residential or recreational purposes 
approximately half of the non strategic timberlands are expected to be sold in large blocks over the next two years 
the other half of the non strategic timberlands  which are generally in smaller tracts  is expected to be sold over the next five to ten years 
in the meantime  these timberlands continue to be used productively in our business of growing and selling timber 
the timing of real estate sales  however  is a function of many factors  including the availability of government and not for profit funding  the general state of the economy  the plans of adjacent landowners  our expectation of future price appreciation and the timing of harvesting activities 
as a result  the timing of our real estate sales may materially impact our reported operating income and net income 
during  the real estate segment reported an operating profit percentage of approximately 
historically  our real estate segment has reported significant operating profit percentages ranging from to of revenues 
however  operating profit percentages vary significantly and depend upon the mix of real estate sales 
the operating profit percentage depends on the nature of the interest sold and how much the market value of the property has risen over its book value 
for example  the sale of conservation easements will have an operating profit percentage of close to because no book basis is allocated to this type of revenue 
sales of recently acquired properties will generally have relatively lower operating profit percentages while sales of properties held for a long time will tend to have relatively higher operating profit percentages 
sales of timberlands owned by plum creek prior to the timber company merger  which  for accounting purposes  were deemed acquired as of the merger date  will thus have low operating profit percentages since these properties were recorded at appraised value as of october in connection with major timberland acquisitions we are generally not able to identify our future real estate sales  as was the case in the timber company merger 
since the merger was accounted for as a reverse acquisition  the timberlands of plum creek were recorded at their fair value 
however  while our purchase price allocation and related appraisals reflected greater values for real estate which may be sold in the future for uses which have a higher value than timber production  we were generally not able to identify specific properties 
therefore  within each region  we allocated this higher value proportionately among all the acres acquired  except for certain specifically identified properties 
in general  however  timberlands are acquired primarily for long term use in our timber operations and specific properties cannot be identified in advance because their value is dependent upon numerous factors  most of which are not known at the acquisition date  including current and future zoning restrictions  current and future environmental restrictions  future changes in demographics  future changes in the economy  current and future plans of adjacent landowners  and current and future funding of government and not for profit conservation and recreation programs 
we believe that current and future results of operations could be materially different under different purchase price allocation assumptions  and generally  when we acquire properties  we do not have the ability  with any level of precision  to estimate which of the acquired properties will someday sell for more than their underlying timber production value 
impairment of long lived assets in general  the company evaluates its ability to recover its net investment in long lived assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
requires recognition of an impairment loss in connection with long lived assets used in a business when the carrying value net book value of such assets exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows attributable to such assets over their expected useful life 
impairment losses are measured by the extent to which the carrying value of a group of assets exceeds the fair value of such assets at a given point in time 
when the fair values of the assets are not available  the company estimates the fair values by using the discounted expected future cash flows attributable to the assets 
the cash flows are discounted at a rate commensurate with the risks associated with the recovery of the assets carrying value 
furthermore  sfas no 
requires recognition of an impairment loss in connection with long lived assets held for sale when the carrying value of such assets exceeds an amount equal to their fair value less selling costs 
the company has grown substantially through acquisitions in recent years 
a large portion of the carrying value of the company s timber and timberlands  and property  plant and equipment represents amounts of the purchase price of recent acquisitions allocated to those assets 
the allocation of the purchase price in a business combination is highly subjective 
management is required to estimate the fair values of acquired assets and liabilities as of the acquisition date 
subsequent to the original allocation  these assets are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable through future operations 
sfas no 
requires that long lived assets be grouped and evaluated for impairment at the lowest level for which there are independent cash flows 
the company tracks cash flows for its million acres of timberlands by grouping them into geographic areas in the northern resources segment and geographic areas in the southern resources segment 
additionally  the company tracks cash flows for each of its manufacturing facilities 
timber and timberlands used in our business 
sfas no 
provides that for assets used in a business  an impairment loss is recorded only when the carrying value of such assets is not recoverable through future operations 
the recoverability test is based on undiscounted future cash flows over the expected life of the assets 
the company uses one harvest cycle which ranges between and years for evaluating the recoverability of its timber and timberlands 
as a result of the inherently long life of timber and timberlands  we do not expect to incur an impairment loss in the future for the timber and timberlands used in its business 
timber and timberlands held for sale 
sfas no 
provides that an impairment loss is recognized for long lived assets held for sale when the carrying value of such asset exceeds an amount equal to its fair value less selling costs 
an asset is generally considered to be held for sale when we have committed to a plan to sell the asset  the asset is available for immediate sale in its present condition  we have initiated an active program to locate a buyer  and the sale is expected to close within one year 
each of the foregoing occurred during the first quarter of in connection with  acres of non strategic timberlands that were sold during the second quarter of as a result  we recorded an impairment loss of million during the first quarter of additionally  during the fourth quarter of we recognized an impairment loss of million related to non strategic timberlands that are expected to be sold during we expect to continue to sell or exchange non strategic timberlands to other forest products companies or non industrial investors  and it is possible that we will recognize  in accordance with sfas no 
 additional impairment losses in the future in connection with sales of non strategic timberlands 
property  plant and equipment 
the carrying value of property  plant and equipment represents primarily the net book value of our ten manufacturing facilities 
each manufacturing facility is tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable through future operations 
the estimated future cash flows over the remaining useful live of a manufacturing facility is highly subjective and is dependent upon estimates for future product pricing  raw material costs  volumes of product sold  and residual value of the facility 
we currently estimate that the carrying value for each of its manufacturing facilities is recoverable through future operations and that our estimate of future cash flows is reasonable 
however  wood product prices were at depressed levels during the first half of if product prices were to remain depressed for an extended period of time  or if other key cash flow assumptions are revised in the future  the company may be required to record an impairment loss for one or more of its manufacturing facilities in a future period 
depletion depletion  or costs attributed to timber harvested  is recorded as trees are harvested 
depletion rates for each region are adjusted annually 
depletion rates are computed by dividing a the sum of the original cost of the timber less previously recorded depletion plus estimated future silviculture costs  including the impact of inflation  that are expected to be incurred over the next harvest cycle  by b the total timber volume that is estimated to be harvested over the harvest cycle 
the harvest cycle can be as short as years in the south and as long as years in the north 
the estimate of future silviculture costs is limited to the expenditures that are expected to impact growth rates over the harvest cycle 
the depletion rate calculations do not include an estimate for either future reforestation costs associated with a stand s final harvest or future volume in connection with the replanting of a stand subsequent to its final harvest 
the following table summarizes depletion expense recognized in the company s financial statements  key assumptions and sensitivities to changes in assumptions for the years ended december dollars in millions  except per ton amounts depletion expense northern resources segment southern resources segment total depletion expense average depletion rates per ton northern resources segment a southern resources segment assumptions used to determine the average depletion rates estimated future silviculture costs  including the impact of inflation northern resources segment b southern resources segment estimated future volume in million tons northern resources segment southern resources segment sensitivity of results to changes in key assumptions increase in depletion expense for every increase in estimated future silviculture costs c northern resources segment southern resources segment decrease in estimated future volume d northern resources segment southern resources segment a average depletion rate decreased primarily due to harvesting a higher percentage of trees during from regions with low depletion rates 
b during  we reevaluated the economic benefits associated with silviculture expenditures in montana and decided to significantly reduce the number of acres and the number of years in which silviculture expenditures are applied 
c assumes future timber volumes do not change 
d assumes future silviculture costs do not change 
significant estimates and judgments are required to determine both future silviculture costs and the volume of timber available for harvest over the harvest cycle 
some of the factors impacting the estimates are changes in weather patterns  inflation rates  the cost of fertilizers and chemicals  the cost of capital  the actual and estimated increase in growth rates from fertilizer applications  the relative price of sawlogs and pulpwood  the actual and expected real price appreciation of timber  the scientific advancement in seedling and growing technology  and changes in harvest cycles 
the company has invested in technology that enables it to predict its current standing inventory of trees  future growth rates  and the benefits of scientific advancements in connection with seedlings  planting techniques and fertilizer applications 
therefore  while estimates with respect to depletion computations will be revised annually  we do not expect the depletion rates will change materially from year to year 
deferred income taxes plum creek has elected to be taxed as a reit under sections of the united states internal revenue code commencing july  a reit is generally not subject to corporate level tax if it satisfies certain requirements 
on october   the timber company  consisting of a group of corporate entities  merged with and into plum creek 
as a consequence of the merger of a taxable entity into a nontaxable entity  the deferred tax liabilities of the timber company were eliminated except for any expected transactions that would be subject to built in gains tax 
plum creek will generally be subject to corporate level tax built in gains tax only if it makes a taxable disposition of certain property acquired in the timber company merger within the ten year period following the merger date 
the built in gains tax only applies to gains from such asset sales to the extent the fair value of the property exceeds its tax basis at the merger date 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes  the company recorded a tax benefit of million in the fourth quarter of as a result of the timber company merger 
the benefit of million represents the elimination of the deferred tax liability associated with temporary differences related primarily to timberlands that are not expected to be disposed of in a transaction subject to built in gains tax during a ten year period following the merger 
we estimate that approximately of the timber company s timberlands will be sold in one or more taxable transactions over the ten year period ending october  as a result  million of deferred taxes related to timberlands were not eliminated during the fourth quarter of timberland sales subject to the built in gains tax through december  reduced our deferred tax liability by million 
this amount was lower than originally estimated because a significant portion of the proceeds from our timberland sales that would otherwise be subject to the built in gains tax were reinvested in like kind property 
the built in gains tax can generally be avoided to the extent proceeds are reinvested in like kind property within the statutory time period 
it is not possible to predict whether we will be able to identify suitable replacement properties in the future in order to avoid the built in gains tax 
it is likely that actual timberland sales over the ten year built in gain period will be greater than  or less than  
an adjustment to earnings will be required in the period in which it is determined that timberland sales subject to the built in gains tax will be greater than  or less than  
long term incentive plans plum creek has a stock incentive plan that provides for the award of non qualified stock options  restricted stock  dividend equivalents and value management awards 
see note of the notes to financial statements 
during  the company recognized million of compensation expense associated with its long term incentive plans  of which million related to value management awards 
value management awards  which have been granted every other year since  provide incentive compensation to participants that is contingent upon the company s performance measured against the performance of a peer group of companies over a three year period 
value management awards are earned in whole or in part based on a sliding scale 
no value management award is earned if the company s total stockholder return is below the th percentile of the peer group 
the full value management award is earned if the company s total stockholder return is above the th percentile 
plum creek recognizes compensation expense for value management awards based on the expected value of the award upon vesting and accrues the related expense over the vesting period 
the actual expense cannot be determined until the end of the three year performance period 
furthermore  since the amount of the award  if any  is based on plum creek s relative performance compared to that of its peer group  it is possible to have significant changes to the estimated award value during the performance period 
compensation expense related to the value management awards is adjusted in the quarter in which there has been a material change in the expected vested value of the awards 
therefore  it is possible that an adjustment to the value management award expense may be material to the result of operations for the quarter and the year in which the estimated vested benefit is revised 
the performance period for the value management awards ended on december  due to the company s strong relative performance  the full value for the awards was achieved 
a total expense of million was recorded over the vesting period in connection with the value management award grants  of which million was recorded during an expense of million was recorded during and in connection with the value management award grants based on expected relative performance 
the expense in connection with the value management award grants would have been million during both and if we had assumed maximum performance would have been achieved for these awards 
pensions plum creek provides pension benefits under defined benefit pension plans that cover substantially all of our employees 
see note of the notes to financial statements 
participants benefits vest after five years of service 
subsequent to the timber company merger  the cash balance of benefits of salaried employees is determined based primarily on certain percentages of compensation  age  years of service and interest accrued based on the year treasury bond rate 
furthermore  employees of the company on september  earn benefits based on the greater of the cash balance formula or the amount of a monthly pension benefit that is principally based on highest monthly average earnings during any consecutive sixty month period and the number of years of service credit 
the benefits of hourly employees are generally based on a fixed amount per year of service 
plum creek s contributions to the plan vary from year to year  but the company has made at least the minimum contributions required by law in each year and we intend to fund annually such that the fair value of plan assets equals or exceeds the actuarially computed accumulated benefit obligation abo  the approximate actuarially computed current pension obligation if the plans were discontinued 
the computation of the company s benefit obligation  pension cost and accrued pension liability under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make certain assumptions involving primarily the following weighted average rates assumptions used to determine the benefit obligation at december discount rate a rate of compensation increase c assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost discount rate a expected long term return on plan assets b rate of compensation increase c a the assumed discount rates are based on moody s long term aa corporate bond yield  which is considered to represent the rate of return on high quality fixed income investments that  if invested at the measurement date  would provide the necessary future cash flows to pay the benefits when due 
b the expected long term rate of return on plan assets assumption is based on the current level of expected returns on risk free investments primarily government bonds  the historical level of the risk premium associated with the other asset classes in which the portfolio is invested and the expectations for future returns on each asset class 
the expected return for each asset class is weighted based on the target asset allocation to develop the expected long term rate of return on plan assets assumption for the portfolio 
c the assumed rate of increase of future compensation levels represents our long term estimate of such increases on the basis of the composition of plan participants  past results and market expectations 
other key assumptions used in the estimate include primarily those underlying the mortality table  and expected long term rates for inflation  retirement and withdrawals  all of which are based on plan experience and standard actuarial methods but which are nevertheless subject to uncertainty 
it is likely that the actual return on plan assets and the outcome of other uncertain variables will differ from those used in estimating our pension costs and pension obligation reflected in our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
furthermore  the company may  from time to time  adjust the asset allocation  which may have an impact on the long term rate of return on plan assets 
the following table summarizes key financial measures and sensitivities to changes in assumption for the years ended december in millions key financial measures pension expense

sensitivity to changes in key assumptions increase in pension expense for every percentage point decrease in long term rate of return on plan assets 
decrease in weighted average discount rate 
increase in rate of increase in compensation levels 
increase in pension funding for every percentage point decrease in weighted average discount rate 
assuming an average long term rate of return on plan assets of  a weighted average discount rate of and a rate of increase in compensation levels  we project that our annual pension expense for will be approximately million  a million  or  increase compared to  and will rise to approximately million annually by over the same time period  the annual cash funding required under our present funding policy is expected to be approximately million during increasing to approximately million in off balance sheet arrangements  contractual obligations  contingent liabilities and commitments the consolidated financial statements of the company reflect all of the operations and assets and liabilities of the company 
the company has no relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities 
consequently  the company has no off balance sheet debt 
furthermore  except for certain interest rate hedging transactions in  discussed more fully in note of the notes to financial statements  and a financing in connection with certain installment notes receivable  which were transferred to georgia pacific prior to the timber company merger  the company is not a party to any derivative transactions 
finally  the company does not have any transactions with related parties or affiliates other than those described in note of the notes to financial statements 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december  in millions payment due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt a   operating lease obligations timber obligations long term incentive plans purchase obligations b other long term liabilities c total contractual obligations   a excludes unamortized premiums of million at december  b purchase obligations are comprised primarily of million for raw materials for our mdf facilities  million for third party logs for our plywood and sawmill facilities  million for reforestation and silviculture  and million for real estate development and other activities 
c we have not included any amounts for our other long term liabilities as we cannot estimate when we will be obligated to satisfy the liabilities 
our other long term liabilities include workers compensation million and pension million 
during each of the past two years we have funded approximately million for workers compensation payments and expected the same in the near future 
we have made contributions to our pension plan such that the fair value of the pension plan assets at december  exceeds the actuarially computed accumulated benefit obligation 
as a result of this funding level  there is no pension funding obligation at december  events and trends affecting operating results harvest plans we determine our annual roundwood sawlogs and pulpwood  including stumpage sales harvesting plans based on a number of factors 
at the stand level  ranging in size from to acres  we consider the age  size  density  health and economic maturity of the timber 
a stand is a contiguous block of trees of a similar age  species mix and silvicultural regime 
at the forest level  ranging in size from  to  acres  we consider the long term sustainability and environmental impact of certain levels of harvesting  certain external conditions such as supply agreements  and the level of demand for wood within the region 
a forest is a broad administrative unit  made up of a large number of stands 
harvest scheduling is the technical approach using computer modeling that considers all of the above factors along with forest growth rates and financial assumptions to project harvest plans for a number of years 
actual harvest levels may vary from planned levels due to log demand  sales prices  the availability of timber from other sources  the level of timberland sales and acquisitions  the availability of legal access  abnormal weather conditions  fires and other factors that may be outside of our control 
we believe that our harvest plans are sufficiently flexible to permit modification in response to short term fluctuations in the markets for logs 
furthermore  future harvest levels may be impacted by both our planned sales of non strategic and higher and better use timberlands 
the impact will depend on the level and extent we are able to reinvest proceeds in productive timberlands and the stocking levels and age class distribution of any newly acquired timberlands 
harvest levels in the northern resources segment were million tons during and million tons during harvest levels in the northern resources segment in are expected to decrease by approximately 
harvest levels in the southern resources segment were million tons during and million tons during harvest levels in the southern resources segment in are expected to increase by approximately us canada softwood lumber agreement historically  canada has been a significant source of lumber for the us market  particularly in the new home construction market 
this source of lumber was constrained in april when a five year lumber trade agreement between the us and canada went into effect 
the trade agreement was intended to limit the volume of canadian lumber exported into the us through the assessment of an export tariff on annual lumber exports to the us in excess of certain levels from the four major producing canadian provinces 
the trade agreement expired in march  and soon thereafter a us industry coalition  of which plum creek is a member  submitted anti dumping and countervailing duty petitions to the international trade commission and the us department of commerce 
in march  the department of commerce rendered a final determination in favor of the us industry coalition and set a countervailing duty on canadian lumber imports and an anti dumping duty on all non investigated canadian exporters averaging representing the weighted average of the anti dumping rates imposed on the investigated canadian exporters 
the department of commerce decreased these duties in april to and  respectively 
in may  the international trade commission rendered a final determination that the us industry was threatened with material injury by canadian lumber imports 
following this determination  the department of commerce put into effect the countervailing and anti dumping duties in may reports indicate  however  that the final duties have not had the effect of decreasing canadian lumber imports into the us the future of the us imposed import duties on canadian lumber remains uncertain 
canada appealed both the anti dumping duty and the countervailing duty to the wto and nafta appeal boards 
both the wto and nafta recently issued rulings that affirmed the us position that canadian stumpage practices are  in fact  providing a subsidy to the canadian industry  and upheld the validity of antidumping duties imposed on most canadian producers 
however  both the wto and nafta rulings included provisions for re examining the calculation and level of the countervailing and the anti dumping duties 
these rulings required the us to lower the countervailing duty  and another decision by nafta on this matter is expected in march of  which could lead to further adjustment of either the anti dumping or countervailing duties  or both 
to avoid protracted litigation  the us and representatives of the canadian government negotiated a tentative settlement agreement in december however  the canadian federal government has not yet ratified the settlement agreement  and negotiations between the us and canada are continuing 
there can be no assurance that an agreement will be reached  or that the terms of any such final agreement would be favorable to the us lumber industry s interests 
therefore  other factors remaining unchanged  downward pressure on domestic lumber and log prices caused by canadian imports could continue or increase 
comparability of financial statement periods acquisitions and divestitures 
we have pursued and expect to continue to pursue both the acquisition and divestiture of timberlands to increase the value of our assets 
during the third and fourth quarter of  we acquired  acres of timberlands located primarily in south carolina  arkansas and new hampshire 
during the fourth quarter of  we purchased  acres of timberlands located primarily in wisconsin  and on october   we completed our merger with the timber company 
as a result of these acquisitions  our ownership increased to million acres at december   million acres at december  and million acres at december  from million acres at december  we may sell timberlands and facilities  from time to time  if attractive opportunities arise 
accordingly  the comparability of periods covered by the company s financial statements is  and in the future may be  affected by the impact of acquisitions and divestitures 
merger with the timber company 
on october   the six entities that comprised the timber company  formerly a separate operating group of georgia pacific corporation georgia pacific  merged with and into plum creek  with plum creek as the surviving company 
the merger was accounted for as a reverse acquisition  with the timber company treated as the acquirer for accounting and financial reporting purposes 
as a result  the historical financial statements of the timber company became the financial statements of plum creek effective as of the date of the merger 
consequently  the statement of income for the year ended december  reflects the performance of the timber company until the date of the merger  and that of the merged companies for the remainder of see note of the notes to financial statements 
results of operations the following table compares operating income loss by segment for the years ended december in millions northern resources southern resources real estate manufactured products other total segment operating income other cost eliminations operating income as a consequence of the timber company merger and the related reverse acquisition accounting treatment  the financial results for and are not comparable with compared to northern resources segment 
revenues decreased by million  or  to million in this decrease was due primarily to a decrease in softwood sawlog sales volume in montana as a result of one of the worst fire season in decades  offset in part by harvesting from timberlands in wisconsin that were acquired during december sales volume from timberlands in wisconsin that were acquired in december increased revenues by million 
northern resources segment operating income was of its revenues for and for costs and expenses decreased by million  or  to million in due primarily to fire related harvesting curtailments and lower depletion rates  offset in part by harvesting of timberlands in wisconsin that were acquired during december and a million fire loss 
costs associated with the timberland operations in wisconsin that were acquired in december were million 
we recorded a million fire loss as a result of forest fires during the third quarter of on approximately  acres in montana 
the million loss represents the book basis of the timber volume destroyed by fire 
southern resources segment 
revenues increased by million  or  to million in this increase of million was due primarily to a higher percentage of delivered log sales million and a more valuable mix of logs million  offset in part by lower softwood sawlog prices million and lower harvest volumes million 
revenues increased by million due to the company s increased percentage of delivered log sales 
the company increased its percentage of delivered log sales by decreasing its percentage of sales of standing timber 
under a delivered log sale agreement  the seller is responsible for log and haul costs 
when standing timber is sold the buyer incurs the log and haul costs 
while revenues are higher when the seller is responsible for the logging and hauling of timber  costs of sales generally increase by a similar amount 
as a result  the company realizes lower margins as a percent of revenues  although operating income is not generally affected 
revenues increased by million due to a greater percentage of high value logs in the sales mix than in the prior year 
during the weather was extremely dry which allowed us to increase our harvest of low value pulpwood 
softwood sawlog prices decreased by due primarily to harvesting of smaller diameter logs and mill curtailments 
the diameter of sawlogs temporarily increased during and due to the increased conversion of slow growing natural stands to faster growing plantation stands 
mills curtailed production during the first half of due to weak lumber prices 
sales volume decreased by due to a planned reduction in harvest levels 
southern resources segment operating income was of its revenues for and for this decrease was due primarily to lower softwood sawlog prices and the increased percentage of delivered log sales 
southern resources segment costs and expenses increased by million  or  to million 
this increase was due primarily to an increase in log and haul costs as a result of a higher percentage of delivered log sales compared to sales of standing timber 
real estate segment 
revenues increased by million  or  to million in this increase of million was due primarily to the sale of non strategic timberlands and a higher number of acres sold  offset in part by lower conservation easement sales 
during the second quarter of we sold  acres of non strategic timberlands for million 
additionally  we sold  acres of higher and better use timberlands during compared to sales of  acres during revenues from conservation easements decreased by million compared to the prior year 
real estate segment operating income was of its revenues for and for this decrease was due primarily to sales of non strategic timberlands  fewer conservation easement sales and the recording of a million impairment loss 
real estate segment costs and expenses increased by million  or  to million in this increase of million is due primarily to the sale of non strategic timberlands  fewer sales of conservation easements and a million impairment charge 
during the second quarter of   acres of non strategic timberlands were sold for million  which had a book basis of million million of the million was recorded as an impairment charge during the first quarter of 
we sold more acres but fewer conservation easements during no book basis is charged to cost of goods sold for sales of conservation easements 
during the fourth quarter of  we concluded that it was probable that  acres of non strategic timberlands would be sold during in which the book basis exceeds the fair value by million 
as a result  an impairment charge of million was recorded 
manufactured products segment 
revenues increased by million  or  to million in this increase of million was due primarily to higher mdf sales volume million and higher plywood prices million  offset in part by lower lumber prices million 
mdf sales volume increase by million square feet to million square feet due primarily to our new thin board mill  which began operations during the fourth quarter of and was in a start up phase during most of plywood prices temporarily skyrocketed during the second half of due to wholesalers and distributors maintaining low structural panel inventories and housing starts continuing at unanticipated record levels 
lumber prices decreased by due primarily to an industry wide excess supply of boards as a result of log salvage operations from forest fires and excess production capacity for studs and dimension lumber throughout north america 
manufactured products segment operating loss was million during compared to million of operating income during this decrease in operating performance was due primarily to lower lumber prices and higher mdf operating costs 
manufactured products segment costs and expenses increased by million  or  to million in this increase of million was due primarily to higher mdf production volume and higher mdf resin and maintenance costs 
other costs and eliminations 
other costs and eliminations which consists of corporate overhead and intercompany profit elimination decreased operating income by million in  compared to a decrease of million in this change of million was due primarily to higher corporate expenses 
interest expense 
net interest expense increased by million  or  to million for this increase was due primarily to a higher debt level as the result of the acquisition of  acres of timberlands located in wisconsin during december  the acquisition of  acres in three states during the third and fourth quarters of  and the purchase of million shares of treasury stock during the first quarter of for million 
provision for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes was million benefit for compared to million expense for this change of million was due primarily to the million decline in operating performance for the manufactured products segment and lower sales of higher and better use timberlands through our taxable reit subsidiaries during as a reit  plum creek is generally not subject to corporate income tax except for certain transactions that are subject to built in gains tax and certain non reit activities that are conducted through taxable reit subsidiaries

revenues increased by million  or  to million in excluding revenues for the period january  to october  associated with the timber company merger  annual revenues increased by million  or  to million in this increase of million was due primarily to higher softwood sawlog sales volume as a result of the age class distribution of our oregon timberlands  which has an increasing percentage of mature timber 
excluding the impact of the timber company merger for the period january  to october   northern resources segment annual operating income was of its revenues for and for this increase was due primarily to higher softwood sawlog volume 
northern resources segment costs and expenses increased by million  or  to million in excluding costs and expenses for the period january  to october  associated with the timber company merger  annual costs and expenses increased by million  or  to million 
this increase of million was due primarily to higher log and haul costs as a result of higher sales volume 
southern resources segment 
revenues increased by million  or  to million in excluding revenues for the period january  to october  associated with the timber company merger  annual revenues increased by million  or  to million in this increase of million was due primarily to a higher percentage of delivered log sales million and higher log sales volume million  offset in part by selling stumpage under lump sum contracts as compared to timber deeds million 
revenues increased by million due to the company s increased percentage of delivered log sales 
the company increased its percentage of delivered log sales by decreasing its percentage of sales of standing timber 
under a delivered log sale agreement  the seller is responsible for log and haul costs 
when standing timber is sold the buyer incurs the log and haul costs 
while revenues are higher when the seller is responsible for the logging and hauling of timber  costs of sales generally increase by a similar amount 
as a result  the company realizes lower margins as a percent of revenues  although operating income is not generally affected 
revenues increased by million due to higher sales volume 
the increased log sales volume was due primarily to a temporary to months increase in harvest levels 
this temporary increase resulted from accelerating the conversion of slower growing natural stands to faster growing plantations 
excluding the impact of the timber company merger for the period january  to october   southern resources segment annual operating income was of its revenues for and for southern resources segment costs and expenses increased by million  or  to million 
excluding costs and expenses for the period january  to october  associated with the timber company merger  costs and expenses increased by million  or  to million in this increase was due primarily to an increase in log and haul costs as a result of a higher percentage of delivered log sales compared to sales of standing timber and higher sales volume 
real estate segment 
revenues increased by million  or  to million in excluding revenues for the period january  to october  associated with the timber company merger  revenues decreased by million  or  to million 
this decrease of million was due primarily to the timing of real estate sales 
the timing of real estate sales is a function of many factors  including the availability of government and not for profit funding  the general state of the economy  the plans of adjacent landowners  the company s expectation of future price appreciation and the timing of harvesting activities 
excluding the impact of the timber company merger for the period january  to october   real estate segment operating income was of its revenues for and for this increase was due primarily to a higher percentage of conservation easements during there is no book basis allocated to the sale of conservation easements

manufactured products segment 
revenues increased by million  or  to million in excluding revenues for the period january  to october  associated with the timber company merger  revenues increased by million  or  to million 
this increase of million was due primarily to our new thin board mdf facility  which began operations in the fourth quarter of we sold million square feet of thin board mdf during the fourth quarter of compared to million square feet during the fourth quarter of excluding the impact of the timber company merger for the period january  to october   manufactured products segment operating loss was million during compared to million of operating income during this decrease in operating performance was due primarily to lower lumber prices as a result of excess supply caused by over production by us and canadian mills and higher mdf operating costs 
manufactured products segment costs and expenses increased by million  or  to million in excluding costs and expenses for the period january  to october  associated with the timber company merger  costs and expenses increased by million  or  to million 
this increase of million was due primarily to higher mdf production volume and higher mdf operating costs 
other costs and eliminations 
other costs and eliminations which consists of corporate overhead and intercompany profit elimination decreased operating income by million in  compared to a decrease of million in this change of million was due primarily to million of higher corporate expenses due to the increase in the size of the company  offset by a reduction of million for intercompany profit elimination and million for severance costs 
during the fourth quarter of  we incurred million of merger related severance costs 
profit on intercompany log sales is deferred until the lumber and plywood manufacturing facilities convert existing log inventories into finished products and sell them to third parties 
prior to the timber company merger  the timber company did not have any deferred profit on log sales 
from the date of the merger to december   the company deferred profit of million on intercompany log sales 
the company released intercompany profit of million during at december  the deferred profit on intercompany sales was million 
interest expense 
net interest expense increased by million  or  to million for this increase was due primarily to the million of plum creek s debt that was acquired in connection with the timber company merger 
provision for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes was million for compared to a net benefit of million for during the fourth quarter of  we recognized a tax benefit of million in connection with the timber company merger 
for the period january  to october   the timber company recognized a tax expense of approximately million 
as a reit  plum creek is generally not subject to corporate income tax except for certain transactions that are subject to built in gains tax and certain non reit activities that are conducted through taxable reit subsidiaries 
see note of the notes to financial statements 
financial condition and liquidity net cash provided by operating activity increased by million  to million for compared to million in even though the cash provided by operating activity was stable  the real estate segment s contribution was higher in and the resources and manufactured products segments contributions were lower 
we expect this trend of more cash provided by the real estate segment s operating activities to continue in net cash provided by operating activity was million for compared to million for  an increase of million  or 
the increase of million was due primarily to the timber company merger 
as a result  non cash operating expenses depreciation  depletion  amortization and basis of real estate sold increased by million and cash taxes decreased by million 
at december   we had a million revolving line of credit maturing on september  the rate for the revolving line of credit was libor plus  which included facility fees 
interest rates vary and are based on a series of borrowings with maturities that can range from one week to six months 
the interest rate for the million credit facility at december  was including facility fees 
borrowings on the line of credit fluctuate daily based on cash needs 
subject to customary covenants  the line of credit allows for borrowings from time to time up to million  including up to million of standby letters of credit 
as of december   less than million remained available for borrowing under the line of credit and there were outstanding standby letters of credit of million 
on january   million of the borrowings under the line of credit was repaid 
on january   the company refinanced its revolving line of credit 
the new million facility has a maturity of five years 
the interest rate for the new facility is based on libor plus  which includes facility fees 
the company believes it has adequate liquidity based on its cash balance of million at december   the replacement of its million line of credit with a new million line of credit on january  and expected proceeds from non strategic timberland sales during our borrowing agreements contain various restrictive covenants  including limitations on harvest levels  sales of assets  the incurrence of indebtedness and making restricted payments such as payments of cash dividends or stock repurchases 
see note of the notes to financial statements 
our borrowing agreements limit our ability to make restricted payments based on available cash  which is generally our net income after adjusting for non cash charges such as depreciation and depletion  changes in various reserves less capital expenditures and principal payments on indebtedness that are not financed 
in addition  our line of credit requires that we maintain an interest coverage ratio and maximum leverage ratio 
we were in compliance with all of our borrowing agreement covenants as of december  the company s leverage strategy is to maintain a balance sheet that provides the financial flexibility to pursue our strategic objectives 
in order to maintain this financial flexibility  the company strives to maintain an investment grade credit profile 
this is reflected in our moderate use of debt  good access to credit markets and no material covenant restrictions in our debt agreements that would prevent us from prudently using debt capital 
cash required to meet our financial needs will be significant 
we believe  however  that cash on hand and cash flows from continuing operations will be sufficient to fund planned capital expenditures  and interest and principal payments on our indebtedness for the next year 
in and  the company has significant long term debt principal payment requirements 
the company intends to refinance these principal payments at the time of maturity 
the company  however  may not refinance the entire amount and may use cash generated from operations for a portion of the principal payments 
on february   our board of directors declared a dividend of per share for the fourth quarter of total dividends for the fourth quarter approximated million and were paid on february  to stockholders of record on february  future dividends will be determined by our board of directors  in its sole discretion  based on consideration of a number of factors including  but not limited to  our results of operations  cash flow and capital requirements  economic conditions  tax considerations  debt covenant restrictions that may impose limitations on the company s ability to make cash payments  borrowing capacity  changes in the prices of and demand for plum creek s products  and changes in our ability to sell timberlands at attractive prices 
other factors that our board of directors considers include the appropriate timing of timber harvests  acquisition and divestiture opportunities  stock repurchases  debt repayment and other means by which the company could deliver value to its stockholders 
in october  our board of directors authorized the company to buy up to million of the company s outstanding common stock 
during the first quarter of  the company purchased two million shares of common stock for a total cost of million at an average price of per share 
capital expenditures  excluding the acquisition of timberlands  for were million  million for and million for during  we acquired  acres of timberlands for million 
the purchases were financed primarily using borrowings from our line of credit and million of funds from tax deferred exchange transactions 
in  we invested million for timberlands of which the largest acquisition was for approximately million for  acres located primarily in wisconsin 
the million purchase price was financed primarily using existing lines of credit 
planned capital expenditures for  excluding the acquisition of timberlands  are expected to be approximately million and include approximately million for our timberlands  and million for our manufacturing facilities 
the timberland expenditures are primarily for reforestation and other expenditures associated with the planting and growing of trees 
of the million of planned capital expenditures in  are considered to be discretionary and are considered maintenance expenditures 
maintenance expenditures consist primarily of reforestation and projects at our manufacturing facilities to sustain operating activities or improve safety

risk factors business and operating risks the cyclical nature of our business could adversely affect our results of operations our results of operations are affected by the cyclical nature of the forest products industry 
historical prices for logs and manufactured wood products have been volatile  and we  like other participants in the forest products industry  have limited direct influence over the time and extent of price changes for logs and wood products 
the demand for logs and wood products is affected primarily by the level of new residential construction activity and  to a lesser extent  repair and remodeling activity and other industrial uses 
the demand for logs is also affected by the demand for wood chips in the pulp and paper markets 
these activities are  in turn  subject to fluctuations due to  among other factors changes in domestic and international economic conditions  interest rates  population growth and changing demographics  and seasonal weather cycles eg  dry summers  wet winters 
decreases in the level of residential construction activity generally reduce demand for logs and wood products 
this results in lower revenues  profits and cash flows 
in addition  industry wide increases in the supply of logs and wood products during favorable price environments can also lead to downward pressure on prices 
timber owners generally increase production volumes for logs and wood products during favorable price environments 
such increased production  however  when coupled with even modest declines in demand for these products in general  could lead to oversupply and lower prices 
our results of operations may also be subject to global economic changes as global supplies of wood fiber shift in response to changing economic conditions 
changes in global economic conditions that could affect our results of operations include  but are not limited to  new timber supply sources and changes in currency exchange rates  foreign and domestic interest rates and foreign and domestic trade policies 
in addition  changes in our ability to sell or exchange non strategic timberlands and timberland properties that have higher and better uses at attractive prices could have a significant effect on our results of operations 
the following factors  among others  may adversely affect the timing and amount of income generated by our land sales activities general economic conditions  availability of funding for governmental agencies  developers  conservation organizations  individuals and others to purchase our lands for conservation  recreation  residential or other purposes  local real estate market conditions  such as oversupply of  or reduced demand for  properties sharing the same or similar characteristics as those in our portfolio  relative illiquidity of real estate investments  impact of federal  state and local land use and environmental protection laws  or changes in tax  real estate and zoning laws 
the forest products industry is highly competitive the forest products industry is highly competitive in terms of price and quality 
wood products are subject to increasing competition from a variety of substitute products  including non wood and engineered wood products 
for example  plywood markets are subject to competition from oriented strand board  and us lumber and log markets are subject to competition from other worldwide suppliers 
historically  canada has been a significant source of lumber for the us market  particularly in the new home construction market 
this source of lumber was constrained in april when a five year lumber trade agreement between the us and canada went into effect 
the trade agreement was intended to limit the volume of canadian lumber exported into the us through the assessment of an export tariff on annual lumber exports to the us in excess of certain levels from the four major producing canadian provinces 
the trade agreement expired in march  and soon thereafter a us industry coalition  of which plum creek is a member  submitted anti dumping and countervailing duty petitions to the international trade commission and the us department of commerce 
in march  the department of commerce rendered a final determination in favor of the us industry coalition and set a countervailing duty on canadian lumber imports and an anti dumping duty on all non investigated canadian exporters averaging representing the weighted average of the anti dumping rates imposed on the investigated canadian exporters 
the department of commerce decreased these duties in april to and  respectively 
in may  the international trade commission rendered a final determination that the us industry was threatened with material injury by canadian lumber imports 
following this determination  the department of commerce put into effect the countervailing and anti dumping duties in may reports indicate  however  that the final duties have not had the effect of decreasing canadian lumber imports into the us the future of the us imposed import duties on canadian lumber remains uncertain 
canada appealed both the anti dumping duty and the countervailing duty to the wto and nafta appeal boards 
both the wto and nafta recently issued rulings that affirmed the us position that canadian stumpage practices are  in fact  providing a subsidy to the canadian industry  and upheld the validity of antidumping duties imposed on most canadian producers 
however  both the wto and nafta rulings included provisions for re examining the calculation and level of the countervailing and the anti dumping duties 
these rulings required the us to lower the countervailing duty  and another decision by nafta on this matter is expected in march of  which could lead to further adjustment of either the anti dumping or countervailing duties  or both 
to avoid protracted litigation  the us and representatives of the canadian government negotiated a tentative settlement agreement in december however  the canadian federal government has not yet ratified the settlement agreement  and negotiations between the us and canada are continuing 
there can be no assurance that an agreement will be reached  or that the terms of any such final agreement would be favorable to the us lumber industry s interests 
therefore  other factors remaining unchanged  downward pressure on domestic lumber and log prices caused by canadian imports could continue or increase 
our cash dividends are not guaranteed and may fluctuate in july  we converted from a master limited partnership to a real estate investment trust  or reit 
reits are required to distribute of their net taxable ordinary income 
however  unlike ordinary income such as rent  the internal revenue code of  as amended  does not require reits to distribute capital gain income 
accordingly  we do not believe that the internal revenue code will require us to distribute any material amounts of cash given that the majority of our income comes from timber sales  which generally are treated as capital gains 
our board of directors  in its sole discretion  determines the amount of the quarterly dividends to be provided to our stockholders based on consideration of a number of factors including  but not limited to  our results of operations  cash flow and capital requirements  economic conditions  tax considerations  borrowing capacity and other factors  including debt covenant restrictions that may impose limitations on cash payments  future acquisitions and divestitures  harvest levels  changes in the price and demand for our products and general market demand for timberlands including those timberland properties that have higher and better uses 
consequently  our dividend levels may fluctuate 
we may be unsuccessful in carrying out our acquisition strategy we intend to pursue acquisitions of strategic timberland properties 
as with any investment  our future acquisitions  if any  may not perform in accordance with our expectations 
in addition  we anticipate financing such acquisitions through cash from operations  borrowings under our unsecured credit facilities  proceeds from equity or debt offerings including offerings of limited partnership units by our operating partnership or proceeds from asset dispositions  or any combination thereof 
our inability to finance future acquisitions on favorable terms or the failure of any acquisitions to conform to our expectations  could adversely affect our results of operations 
we depend on external sources of capital for future growth our ability to finance growth is dependent to a significant degree on external sources of capital 
our ability to access such capital on favorable terms could be hampered by a number of factors  many of which are outside of our control  including  without limitation  a decline in general market conditions  increases in interest rates  an unfavorable market perception of our growth potential  a decrease in our current or estimated future earnings or a decrease in the market price of our common stock 
in addition  our ability to access additional capital may also be limited by the terms of our existing indebtedness  which  among other things  restricts our incurrence of debt and the payment of dividends 
any of these factors  individually or in combination  could prevent us from being able to obtain the capital we require on terms that are acceptable to us  and the failure to obtain necessary capital could materially adversely affect our future growth 
our ability to harvest timber may be subject to limitations which could adversely affect our operations weather conditions  timber growth cycles  access limitations and regulatory requirements associated with the protection of wildlife and water resources may restrict harvesting of timberlands as may other factors  including damage by fire  insect infestation  disease  prolonged drought and other natural disasters 
although damage from such natural causes usually is localized and affects only a limited percentage of the timber  there can be no assurance that any damage affecting our timberlands will in fact be so limited 
as is common in the forest products industry  we do not maintain insurance coverage with respect to damage to our timberlands 
our revenues  net income and cash flow from our operations are dependent to a significant extent on the pricing of our products and our continued ability to harvest timber at adequate levels 
in addition  the terms of our long term debt agreements and lines of credit limit our ability to fund dividends to stockholders by accelerating the harvest of significant amounts of timber 
our timberlands and manufacturing facilities are subject to federal and state environmental regulations we are subject to regulation under  among other laws  the clean air act  the clean water act  the resource conservation and recovery act  the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of  the national environmental policy act  and the endangered species act  as well as comparable state laws and regulations 
violations of various statutory and regulatory programs that apply to our operations could result in civil penalties  remediation expenses  potential injunctions  cease and desist orders and criminal penalties 
we engage in the following activities that are subject to regulation forestry activities  including harvesting  planting and road building  use and maintenance  the generation of air emissions  the discharge of industrial wastewater and storm water  and the generation and disposal of both hazardous and non hazardous wastes 
laws and regulations protecting the environment have generally become more stringent in recent years and could become more stringent in the future 
some environmental statutes impose strict liability  rendering a person liable for environmental damage without regard to the person s negligence or fault 
these laws or future legislation or administrative or judicial action with respect to protection of the environment may adversely affect our business 
the endangered species act and comparable state laws protect species threatened with possible extinction 
a number of species on our timberlands have been and in the future may be protected under these laws  including the northern spotted owl  marbled murrelet  gray wolf  grizzly bear  bald eagle  karner blue butterfly  red cockaded woodpecker  bull trout  and various other trout and salmon species 
protection of threatened and endangered species may include restrictions on timber harvesting  road building and other forest practices on private  federal and state land containing the affected species 
stock ownership provisions in our certificate of incorporation and delaware law may prevent a change in control some provisions of our certificate of incorporation may discourage a third party from seeking to gain control of us 
for example  the ownership limitations described in our certificate of incorporation could have the effect of delaying  deferring  or limiting a change of control in which holders of our common stock might receive a premium for their shares over the then prevailing market price 
the following is a summary of provisions of our certificate of incorporation that may have this effect 
ownership limit 
in order for us to maintain our qualification as a reit  not more than of the value of our outstanding shares of capital stock may be owned  directly or indirectly  by five or fewer individuals  as defined in the internal revenue code 
for the purpose of preserving our reit qualification  our certificate of incorporation prohibits ownership  either directly or under the applicable attribution rules of the internal revenue code  of more than of the lesser of the total number of shares of our common stock outstanding or the value of the outstanding shares of our common stock by any stockholder other than by some designated persons agreed to by us or as set forth in our certificate of incorporation the ownership limit 
the ownership limit may have the effect of discouraging an acquisition of control of us without the approval of our board of directors 
the ownership limit in our certificate of incorporation also restricts the transfer of our common stock 
for example  any transfer of our equity is null and void if the transfer would result in any person owning  directly or indirectly  equity in excess of the ownership limit  result in our equity being owned  directly or indirectly  by fewer than persons  result in us being closely held as defined in the internal revenue code  result in us failing to qualify as a domestically controlled reit as defined in the internal revenue code  or otherwise cause us to fail to qualify as a reit 
preferred stock 
our certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to issue up to million shares of preferred stock 
upon issuance  our board of directors will establish the preferences and rights for this preferred stock 
these preferences and rights may include the right to elect additional directors 
the issuance of preferred stock could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of us even if a change in control were in our stockholders best interests 
section of the delaware general corporation law 
section of the delaware general corporation law generally prohibits us from engaging in business transactions with a person or entity that owns or more of our voting stock for a period of three years following the time such person or entity became an interested stockholder unless  prior to such time  our board of directors approved either the business combination or the transaction which resulted in such person or entity becoming an interested stockholder 
a business transaction may include mergers  asset sales and other transactions resulting in financial benefit to the person or entity that owns or more of our voting stock 
tax risks if we fail to qualify as a reit  we would be subject to tax at corporate rates and would not be able to deduct dividends to stockholders when computing our taxable income if in any taxable year we fail to qualify as a reit we would be subject to federal and state income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates of approximately  we would not be allowed to deduct dividends to stockholders in computing our taxable income  and unless we were entitled to relief under the internal revenue code  we would also be disqualified from treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which we lost qualification 
if we fail to qualify as a reit  we might need to borrow funds or liquidate some investments in order to pay the additional tax liability 
accordingly  funds available for investment or dividends to our stockholders would be reduced for each of the years involved 
qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the internal revenue code to our operations and the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control 
there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations of these provisions 
although we operate in a manner consistent with the reit qualification rules  we cannot assure you that we are or will remain so qualified 
in addition  the rules dealing with federal income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the internal revenue service and the united states department of the treasury 
changes to the tax law could adversely affect our stockholders 
we cannot predict with certainty whether  when  in what forms  or with what effective dates  the tax laws applicable to us or our stockholders may be changed 
if we failed to distribute the earnings and profits of the timber company  we would be subject to adverse tax consequences in connection with the timber company s october  merger with plum creek  we were required by january  to distribute the earnings and profits acquired from the six entities that comprised the timber company 
we believe that the accelerated payment of our fourth quarter dividend for  which we paid on december   was sufficient to distribute these earnings and profits 
if we failed to distribute an amount equal to these earnings and profits  we might be subject to adverse tax consequences 
we expect that  even if the earnings and profits were subsequently adjusted upward by the internal revenue service  the amount we distributed exceeded such earnings and profits 
nevertheless  such an adjustment may give rise to the imposition of the excise tax on the excess income required to be distributed over the amounts treated as distributed after application of the earnings and profits rule 
certain of our business activities are potentially subject to prohibited transactions tax or corporate level income tax 
reits are generally intended to be passive entities and can thus only engage in those activities permitted by the internal revenue code code  which for plum creek generally include owning and managing a timberland portfolio  growing timber  and the sale of standing timber 
accordingly  the manufacture and sale by us of wood products  certain types of timberlands sales  sales of logs  and lump sum sales of timber are conducted through one or more of our taxable reit subsidiaries trss because such activities could generate non qualifying reit income and could constitute prohibited transactions 
prohibited transactions are defined by the code to be sales or other dispositions of property to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business 
by conducting our business in this manner we satisfy the reit requirements of the code and avoid the tax that could be imposed if a reit were to conduct a prohibited transaction 
we may not always be successful  however  in limiting such activities to our trss 
therefore  we could be subject to the prohibited transactions tax if such instances were to occur 
the net income of our trss is subject to corporate level income tax
