item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations company overview the company provides temporary staffing services to industrial  service and technology businesses  professional organizations and governmental agencies 
during the twelve fiscal months ended october   the company placed approximately  temporary workers and provided approximately million hours of staffing services to over  clients

executive summary the staffing industry is a highly competitive industry  which has contributed to significant price competition and lower margins as major staffing companies have attempted to maintain or gain market share 
during the last twelve months  global economic conditions have continued to improve which appears to signal a sustainable job creating recovery 
the demand for temporary staffing has also continued to grow as demonstrated by recent reports from the bureau of labor statistics the bls stating that staffing industry companies employed more workers in september than in the same period of resulting in the sixteenth consecutive month of year over year improvements 
management continues to be encouraged by the recent economic data  as well as the steady job growth in the staffing industry 
historic trends in employment growth following a recession have been slowed  due in part to productivity gains and modest new job growth 
the increases in workers compensation costs and state unemployment insurance costs the company experienced in fiscal and have been significant 
however  the company does not expect the increases in state unemployment costs to continue at such a significant rate throughout fiscal and expects workers compensation costs to continue to stabilize throughout fiscal as seen in the last six months of fiscal during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company recorded a million charge to operating income as a result of an october court of appeal s decision see further discussion under item legal proceedings 
with long term positive prospects  the staffing industry has always been inherently difficult to forecast due to its dependence on economic factors and the strength of the labor market 
however  the company has developed a forecasting tool jointly with the a 
gary anderson center for economic research at chapman university 
the quarterly labor forecast report  which is based upon bls and other economic factors  helps to predict total demand for temporary labor 
the company has been utilizing this tool for several years and has recently begun to publish the results on a quarterly basis

critical accounting policies the discussions and analyses of the company s consolidated financial condition and results of operations were based on the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of any contingent assets and liabilities at the financial statement date  and reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  the company s management reviews and evaluates these estimates and assumptions  including those that relate to revenue recognition  accounts receivable  workers compensation costs  goodwill  intangible and other long lived assets  income taxes including the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets  contingencies and litigation 
these estimates are based on historical experience and a variety of other assumptions believed reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies are those most significantly affected by the judgment  estimates and or assumptions used in the preparation of remedy s consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition the company generates revenue from the sale of temporary staffing and permanent placement services by its company owned and licensed franchise operations and from royalties on sales of such services by its traditional franchise operations 
temporary staffing revenues and the related labor costs and payroll taxes are recorded in the period in which the services are performed 
permanent placement revenues are recognized when the permanent placement candidate begins full time employment 
sales allowances are established to estimate losses due to placed candidates not remaining employed for the 
table of contents company s permanent placement guarantee period  typically days and have historically been insignificant to the company s overall results of operations 
the company accounts for the revenues and the related direct costs in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent 
the company is required to assess whether it acts as a principal in its transactions or as an agent acting on the behalf of others 
where the company is the principal in a transaction and has the risks and rewards of ownership  the transaction is recorded gross in the income statement  and where the company acts merely as an agent  only the net fees earned are recorded in the income statement 
under the company s traditional franchised agreement  the franchisee has the direct contractual relationship with clients  holds title to the related customer receivables and is the legal employer of the temporary employees 
accordingly  the company does not include the revenues and direct expenses from these transactions in its income statement and only records the royalty fee earned 
alternatively  under the company s licensed franchise agreements the company has the direct contractual relationship with clients  holds title to the related customer receivables and is the legal employer of the temporary employees 
as the company retains the risks and rewards of ownership such as the liability for the cost of temporary personnel and the risk of loss for collection  the revenues and direct expenses of its licensed franchise operations are included in the company s results of operations 
the company remits to each licensed franchisee a portion of the gross margin generated by its office s 
accounts receivable remedy provides an allowance for doubtful accounts on its accounts receivable for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its clients to make required payments 
this allowance is based upon management s analysis of historical write off levels  current economic trends  routine assessment of its clients financial strength and any other known factors impacting collectibility 
if the financial condition of its clients were to deteriorate  which may result in the impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
remedy s estimates are influenced by the following considerations the large number of clients and their dispersion across wide geographic areas  the fact that no single customer accounts for or more of its total revenues and its continuing credit evaluation of its clients financial conditions 
workers compensation costs the company maintains reserves for its workers compensation obligations using actuarial methods to estimate the remaining undiscounted liability for the deductible portion of all claims  including those incurred but not reported 
this process includes establishing loss development factors  based on the historical claims experience of the company and the industry  and applying those factors to current claims information to derive an estimate of the company s ultimate claims liability 
the calculated ultimate liability is then reduced by cumulative claims payments to determine the required reserve 
management evaluates the reserve  and the underlying assumptions  regularly throughout the year and makes adjustments as needed 
while management believes that the recorded amounts are adequate  there can be no assurance that changes to management s estimates will not occur due to limitations inherent in the estimation process 
goodwill and other intangible assets effective the first quarter of fiscal  the company adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
applies to goodwill and intangible assets that are not amortized 
sfas no 
requires goodwill to no longer be amortized but instead be subject to an impairment test at least annually or if events or circumstances change that may reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its book value 
reporting units are determined based on geographic groupings of company owned offices 
intangible assets with finite lives continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives 
in connection with the initial impairment test upon adoption  the company obtained valuations of its individual reporting units from an independent third party valuation firm 
the valuation methodologies considered included analyses of discounted cash flows at the reporting unit level  guidelines for publicly traded company multiples and comparable transactions 
as a result of these impairment tests  the company recorded a non cash charge of million  net of income taxes of million  to reduce the carrying value of the goodwill to its implied fair value 
this charge is reflected as a cumulative effect of adoption of a new accounting standard in the 
table of contents company s consolidated statements of operations for the fiscal year ended september  the company performs its annual impairment test at the end of each fiscal year 
other long lived assets effective the first quarter of fiscal  the company adopted sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
in accordance with sfas no 
 the company assesses the fair value and recoverability of its long lived assets including intangibles subject to amortization  whenever events and circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable from estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition 
in doing so  the company makes assumptions and estimates regarding future cash flows and other factors 
the fair value of the long lived assets is dependent upon the forecasted performance of the company s business and the overall economic environment 
when it determines that the carrying value of the long lived assets may not be recoverable  it measures impairment based upon a forecasted discounted cash flow method 
if these forecasts are not met  the company may have to record additional impairment charges not previously recognized 
the company recorded million  of asset impairment charges related to capitalized software for fiscal  of which million is included in depreciation expense and million is included in selling and administrative expense see note to notes to consolidated financial statements 
there were no asset impairment charges in fiscal years and income taxes in preparing the company s consolidated financial statements  management estimates the company s income taxes in each of the taxing jurisdictions in which it operates 
this includes estimating the company s actual current tax expense together with any temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of certain items  such as the timing for recognizing revenues and expenses  for tax and accounting purposes

deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between income and expenses reported for financial reporting and tax reporting 
the company is required to record a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that it believes is more likely than not to be realized

the company had been profitable through the first fiscal quarter of  however  continued market softness and significant increases in workers compensation costs resulted in significant losses in fiscal the company experienced losses throughout fiscal as a result of the company s recent cumulative losses  management concluded that a full valuation allowance of million and million against the deferred tax assets was appropriate as of the end of fiscal and  respectively 
while the company expects to be profitable in fiscal and beyond  in view of the recent losses  there is no assurance that there will be sufficient future taxable income to realize the benefit of the deferred tax asset 
if  after future assessments of the realizability of the deferred tax assets  the company determines that a lesser allowance is required  it would record a reduction to income tax expense and the valuation allowance in the period of such determination 
contingencies and litigation there are various claims  lawsuits and pending actions against the company incident to its operations 
if a loss arising from these actions is probable and can be reasonably estimated  the company must record the amount of the estimated liability 
based on current available information  management believes that the ultimate resolution of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
as additional information becomes available  management will continue assessing any potential liability related to these actions and may need to revise its estimates
