item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
business strategies our principal strategy is to apply our core competencies in direct marketing of medical products and efficient call center operation  and the brand recognition of our liberty name  to expand our liberty diabetes segment  add complementary businesses and products to our operation and position liberty pharmacy to participate in the medicare prescription drug benefit program commencing in calendar continue growth in our liberty diabetes segment by expanding our customer base 
since the august acquisition of liberty  we have invested in an ongoing program of direct response television advertising to reach a larger portion of the medicare eligible patient market 
this campaign has resulted in a significant increase in sales and we have expanded our active medicare eligible diabetes customers from approximately  at the time of liberty s acquisition to approximately  customers as of march  we will continue to engage in a high level of television advertising in fiscal  which combined with our proactive approach and high level of service that retains existing customers  has resulted in solid revenue growth  but we will be increasing our commitment to less expensive methods of attracting new customers  such as physician and customer referrals  print advertising  direct mail and the internet 
we continue to seek opportunities to deliver new products to a broader customer base by leveraging our mail order distribution system and software for billing and customer monitoring 
to manage our growth effectively  we are continually improving our operations  information systems  and regulatory compliance activities 
use our pharmaceuticals segment to help position us for the prescription drug benefit under the medicare modernization act 
liberty pharmacy  a direct to consumer non medicare initiative that commenced operations in fiscal and is part of our pharmaceuticals segment  offers direct to consumer prescription medications not covered by medicare 
beginning in calendar year  medicare coverage of prescription drugs will be available under the medicare modernization act through both prescription drug plans and medicare advantage prescription plans 
we expect to continue to expand our pharmacy business in order to develop the economies of scale that will allow us to compete successfully in and beyond 
continue adding complementary products and businesses 
in order to diversify and take advantage of economies of scale in operations and marketing  we continue to evaluate opportunities for the acquisition of businesses and products to expand and complement our existing product lines and new business initiatives 
in selecting and evaluating acquisition candidates  we examine the market potential for products that can be distributed through our existing marketing infrastructure and which utilize our strengths in marketing and distribution 
we also continue to consider adding businesses  manufacturing capabilities and new products that capitalize upon our established brand franchise 

table of contents government regulation medicare medicare is a federally funded program that provides health insurance coverage for qualified persons age or older and for some disabled persons 
the majority of the products that we provide are reimbursable by medicare  and are therefore subject to extensive regulation 
medicare payments are sometimes lower than the payments of other third party payers  such as traditional indemnity insurance companies 
current medicare reimbursement guidelines stipulate  among other things  that quarterly orders of diabetes supplies to existing customers be verified with the customers before shipment and that all doctors orders for supplies be re validated every twelve months through the receipt of new doctors orders 
we accept assignment of medicare claims  as well as claims with respect to other third party payers  on behalf of our customers 
we process claims  accept payments and assume the risks of delay or nonpayment 
we also employ the administrative personnel necessary to transmit claims for product reimbursement directly to medicare and private health insurance carriers 
medicare reimburses at of the government determined fee schedule amounts for reimbursable supplies  and we bill the remaining balance to either third party payers or directly to customers

item legal proceedings us attorney s office beginning in august  the us attorney s office for the southern district of florida  with the assistance of the fbi and oig  has been investigating allegations of healthcare fraud  improper revenue recognition and obstruction of justice by liberty and liberty home pharmacy 
both civil and criminal investigations are being conducted 
we are cooperating with the investigations 
as part of the internal review that we conducted in parallel with the investigation  we identified a category of medicare claims where the documentation for the claim supported a portion  but not the full quantity  of the products shipped and billed 
we engaged an outside consulting firm to perform a statistical analysis of all medicare claims filed by polymedica over a six year period in order to develop an estimate of overpayments by medicare related to this category of claims 
in the fiscal year ended march   we received the preliminary results of that analysis  which indicated an aggregate overpayment of approximately million  of which million was previously accrued and million was recorded as a reduction of net revenues and an increase to the accrual in the fiscal year ended march  the statistical analysis conducted by the outside consulting firm also identified certain other claims that largely occurred during and where polymedica s documentation was consistent with the full quantity shipped and billed  but was not strictly in accordance with medicare rules 
we are contending the adequacy of our documentation for these claims to the government investigators 
we believe that our documentation for these claims is adequate 
accordingly  we have not recorded any reserves for this category of claims  as to which the analysis indicates that the amount potentially at issue is approximately million  and anticipate that the issue will be addressed in the context of the overall resolution of the investigation 
we anticipate that the final results of the consulting firm s analysis which we don t expect to differ materially from the preliminary analysis  will be received in the summer of while the government s investigation could identify other issues  we are not aware of any information that would result in payments to the government by polymedica which in the aggregate would substantially impair our ability to carry out our current business plan

overview business polymedica corporation was organized in and has been in the business of acquiring and growing medical product and pharmaceutical businesses for over years 
today  through our primary segment  liberty diabetes  we are a leading provider of direct to consumer diabetes testing supplies  primarily to medicare eligible seniors  and provide a simple and reliable way for our customers to obtain their supplies and medications 
through our liberty respiratory segment  we provide direct to consumer respiratory medications  primarily to medicare eligible seniors and through our pharmaceuticals segment  we sell to distributors prescription medications directly to our liberty diabetes and liberty respiratory customers and also manufacture and sell to distributors prescription and over the counter urology products 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make significant estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes 
these items are regularly monitored and analyzed by management for changes in facts and circumstances  and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future 
changes in estimates are recorded in the period in which they become known 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from our estimates 
polymedica s significant accounting policies are presented within note a to our consolidated financial statements  and the following summaries should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in this annual report on form k 
while all of our accounting policies impact the consolidated financial statements  certain policies may be viewed to be critical 
critical accounting policies are those that are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require management s most subjective or complex judgments and estimates 
management believes the policies that fall within this category are the policies on revenue recognition and accounts receivable  advertising  goodwill  and amounts reserved for overpayments by medicare and others 
revenue recognition and accounts receivable in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  we recognize revenues at the amounts expected to be collected from medicare  other third party payers  and directly from customers 
we analyze various factors in determining revenue recognition  including a review of specific transactions  current medicare regulations and reimbursement rates  historical experience  and the credit worthiness of customers 
a significant portion of our revenues is billed to third party reimbursement sources 
in addition  the collectibility of our accounts receivable varies based on payer mix  general economic conditions and other factors 
a provision for doubtful accounts is made for accounts receivable estimated to be uncollectible and is adjusted periodically based primarily upon our evaluation of historical collection and write off experience  current industry conditions  industry reimbursement trends  credit policy  and on our analysis of accounts receivable by aging category 
the evaluation is performed 
table of contents at the end of each reporting period for each operating unit with an overall assessment at the consolidated level 
in addition  sales allowances are recorded for estimated product returns as well as estimated claim denials as a reduction of revenue 
we analyze sales allowances using historical data adjusted for significant changes in volume  customer demographics  and business conditions 
these allowances are adjusted to reflect actual returns and claim denials 
changes in these factors could affect the timing and amount of revenue and costs recognized 
advertising in accordance with sop we capitalize and amortize direct response advertising and related costs when we can demonstrate  among other things  that customers have directly responded to our advertisements 
we assess the realizability of the amounts of direct response advertising costs reported as assets at the end of each reporting period by comparing the carrying amounts of such assets to the probable remaining future net cash flows expected to result directly from such advertising 
management s judgments include determining the period over which such net cash flows are estimated to be realized 
a business change  including a change in reimbursement rates  that reduces expected net cash flows or that shortens the period over which such net cash flows are estimated to be realized could result in accelerated charges against our earnings 
for further discussion regarding the application of sop  please see note a to the consolidated financial statements 
goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
 we perform impairment tests at each reporting period and whenever events or changes in circumstance suggest that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
in performing such tests  we are required to make certain estimates and assumptions relating to the allocation of certain assets and liabilities to our reporting units  the fair values of our reporting units  and the related fair value of certain of their assets and liabilities 
changes in the estimates and assumptions used could affect the determination of whether an impairment exists as well as the quantification of the impairment value  should one exist 
for further discussion  please see note d to the consolidated financial statements 
amounts reserved for overpayments by medicare and others the government s medicare regulations are complex and sometimes subjective and therefore may require management s interpretation 
overpayments by medicare and others occur in the normal course of business and reserves are recorded when  based upon our assessment of the facts and circumstance  we believe that the amounts due to medicare and others are probable and estimable 
as part of the internal review that we conducted in parallel with the investigation  we identified a category of medicare claims where the documentation for the claim supported a portion  but not the full quantity  of the products shipped and billed 
we engaged an outside consulting firm to perform a statistical analysis of all medicare claims filed by polymedica over a six year period in order to develop an estimate of overpayments by medicare related to this category of claims 
in the fiscal year ended march   we received the preliminary results of that analysis  which indicated an aggregate overpayment of approximately million  of which million was previously accrued and million was recorded as a reduction of net revenues and an increase to the accrual in the fiscal year ended march  the statistical analysis conducted by the outside consulting firm also identified certain other claims that largely occurred during and where polymedica s documentation was consistent with the full quantity shipped and billed  but was not strictly in accordance with medicare rules 
we are contending the adequacy of our documentation for these claims to the government investigators 
we believe that our documentation for these claims is adequate 
accordingly  we have not recorded any reserves for this category of claims  as to which the analysis indicates that the amount potentially at issue is approximately million  and anticipate that the issue will be addressed in the context of the overall resolution of the investigation 
we anticipate that the final results of the consulting firm s analysis which we don t expect to differ materially from the preliminary analysis  will be received in the summer of while the government s investigation could identify other issues  we are not aware of any information that would result in payments to the government by polymedica which in the aggregate would substantially impair our ability to carry out our current business plan 

table of contents recent developments medicare modernization act on december   the medicare modernization act was signed into law 
the medicare modernization act contains provisions affecting the coverage and reimbursement levels of products provided through our liberty diabetes  liberty respiratory and pharmaceuticals segments 
liberty diabetes segment in accordance with the medicare modernization act  reimbursement rates for diabetes testing supplies will be frozen for the calendar year at the rates in effect for the calendar year 
commencing january   reimbursement rates for diabetes test strips and lancets will be reduced by the percentage difference between the median amounts paid by the federal employees health benefit program in the calendar year and the amount reimbursed by the medicare program in the calendar year 
the maximum adjustment for test strips and lancets for calendar year appears to be for diabetes test strips and for lancets  but the actual percentage decrease in payment amounts for any particular provider will depend on the geographic distribution of its customers 
no further adjustments for test strips and lancets are expected for calendar year based on a preliminary interpretation of the medicare modernization act  we currently expect an overall reduction in reimbursement rates for test strips and lancets of approximately in calendar year a bill has been introduced in the house of representatives  hr  to repeal the reduction in medicare reimbursement for diabetes test strips and lancets described above 
we do not know whether this bill will be enacted 
the medicare modernization act also contains provisions that may have a positive influence on our liberty diabetes segment 
beginning january   medicare coverage will be provided for an initial physical examination and for regular diabetes screening tests 
this coverage may increase the incidence of diagnosis of diabetes and potentially expand the medicare market for testing supplies and other diabetes products 
the medicare modernization act also provides up to million over the next three years for chronic care improvement programs to improve clinical quality while potentially reducing the long term cost of chronic diseases such as diabetes 
liberty respiratory segment the medicare modernization act reduces reimbursement rates for inhalation drugs  which we provide through our liberty respiratory segment 
beginning january   reimbursement for these drugs was reduced from of the average wholesale price awp to of awp 
beginning january   the law currently in effect would reduce reimbursement for inhalation drugs to of the average price of sales to suppliers asp  a new benchmark that will be determined by sales data submitted by the drug manufacturers 
the medicare modernization act also directs the general accounting office to assess the adequacy of current reimbursement rates for inhalation drugs under the medicare program and report its findings to congress no later than december  if the secretary of health and human services determines that the asp methodology does not reflect the widely available market price or is inherently unreasonable  the secretary has the authority to adjust payments to providers either up or down  although the degree of any potential adjustment is unknown at this time 
if respiratory providers are ultimately reimbursed at of asp  without a significant dispensing or other fee  we believe that most companies  including us  will exit this business  because it will not be possible to operate without significant losses 
liberty respiratory segment revenues accounted for of our consolidated net revenues reported in fiscal we are working along with industry leaders to educate members of congress and the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms of the ramifications of the reimbursement cuts under the law currently in effect 
due to the reduction in reimbursement rates for inhalation drugs contemplated by the medicare modernization act  we expect that our liberty respiratory segment will generate less revenue  earnings and cash flow than it has historically 
as a result  we suspended all liberty respiratory direct response advertising in december and recorded an impairment charge of million of liberty respiratory s direct response advertising asset  to adjust the asset s carrying value down to its net realizable value 
we expect that the revenues in our liberty respiratory segment will account for less than of our consolidated net revenues beginning in the calendar year 
while we have discontinued advertising specifically targeted to liberty respiratory customers  we have expanded our efforts to acquire seniors with respiratory disease through internal cross referrals and expanded marketing efforts to doctors offices through an internal healthcare professional calling force 

table of contents pharmaceuticals segment the medicare modernization act establishes a voluntary prescription drug benefit under the medicare program 
beginning in calendar year  coverage will be available through both prescription drug plans and medicare advantage prescription plans 
this new benefit will include coverage for insulin and syringes  as well as other prescription drugs 
liberty pharmacy was one of only applicants to be approved as an issuer of a national medicare approved card 
this medicare approved prescription drug discount card program went into effect in june this benefit may be voluntarily elected by certain medicare beneficiaries who do not have an existing outpatient prescription drug benefit 
sponsors of these cards will offer medicare beneficiaries access to outpatient prescription drugs at discounted prices 
liberty pharmacy began distributing its own medicare approved drug discount card to customers and their spouses in may federal employee program reimbursement changes in december  the service benefit administrator of the federal employee program fep notified liberty pharmacy and other durable medical equipment suppliers that as of february  certain supplies and medications would only be reimbursable through fep s pharmacy benefit administrator 
the service benefit administrator subsequently notified us that this reimbursement change would be effective as of january  processing these supplies and medications as a pharmacy benefit will result in increased costs to some of our fep customers as well as lower reimbursement rates to us 
we are currently evaluating the impact of this change  but anticipate some level of decrease to that portion of liberty pharmacy s net revenues that is derived from the fep program 
the fep program currently comprises a substantial portion of liberty pharmacy s net revenues 
other advertising rates may fluctuate during the year  which may affect our acquisition of new customers 
we may purchase less advertising when rates are higher  which generally occurs in november and december 
as a result  our acquisition of new customers during this period is generally reduced and our net revenues may fluctuate accordingly 
we operate from manufacturing and distribution facilities located in massachusetts and florida  respectively 
virtually all of our product sales are denominated in us dollars 
expense items include cost of sales and selling  general and administrative expenses  each as more fully described below cost of sales consists primarily of purchased finished goods for sale in our markets and  to a lesser extent  materials  direct labor  and overhead costs for products that we manufacture in our massachusetts facility and shipping and handling fees 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of expenditures for personnel and benefits  as well as amortization of capitalized direct response advertising costs  legal and related expenses  allowances for bad debts  depreciation of facilities  and other amortization and depreciation

the increase in liberty respiratory net revenues was due primarily to the growth in our customer base  which grew to approximately  active customers as of march   from approximately  as of march   as a result of our national television advertising 
net revenue growth in our liberty respiratory segment has slowed during fiscal year as a result of several factors  including our suspension of direct response advertising to respiratory patients in december in response to new medicare legislation  lower than expected response rate to the advertisements that we ran in the period and increased competition 
net revenues for this segment declined in the fourth quarter of fiscal  as compared with the fiscal fourth quarter  as a result of the cut in medicare reimbursement rates effective january  the new medicare legislation is discussed in further detail in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations medicare modernization act

other factors that contributed to the change in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues included approximately million more of consolidated legal and related expenses  million for charges related to the termination of certain executive officers  and million more of direct response advertising amortization in the fiscal year ended march   as compared with the fiscal year ended march  these increases were offset by million of goodwill amortization recorded in the fiscal year ended march   that was not recorded in the fiscal year ended march  investment income the following table presents investment income expressed as a percentage of total net revenues for the year ended march  in thousands change investment income average cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities the decrease in investment income is due to a lower average cash  cash equivalents  restricted cash and marketable securities balance and lower interest rates

table of contents liquidity and capital resources the following table summarizes our sources and uses of cash during the fiscal years ended march  in thousands net cash provided by operating activities net cash used for investing activities net cash provided by used for financing activities net change in cash and cash equivalents our cash and cash equivalents balance increased million to million as of march   due primarily to increased sales and increased accounts receivable collections  increased proceeds from common stock issuances related to the exercise of employee stock options  and progress in our efforts to identify opportunities to streamline our business  thereby reducing operating expenses 
the growth of our business is funded primarily through cash flow from operations 
the increase in cash flow from operations was driven primarily by increased sales and improved cash collections of accounts receivable as evidenced by the decrease in the annualized fourth quarter days sales outstanding from days in the fiscal year ended march  to days in the fiscal year ended march   offset by an million increase in direct response advertising spending in the fiscal year ended march   as compared with the fiscal year ended march  we will continue to engage in a high level of television advertising in fiscal  which combined with our proactive approach and high level of service that retains existing customers  has resulted in solid revenue growth 
the  decrease in total cash used for investing activities in the fiscal year ended march   as compared with the fiscal year ended march   was primarily due to a million decrease in capital expenditures  offset by a million increase in marketable securities purchases 
capital expenditures in the fiscal years ended march  and totaled million and million  respectively 
we expect capital expenditures to substantially decrease in fiscal  as compared with fiscal the million increase in total cash provided by financing activities in the fiscal year ended march   as compared with the fiscal year ended march   was primarily due to a million increase in proceeds raised from employee stock option exercises 
in the fiscal year ended march   we did not repurchase any shares of our common stock compared with million used to repurchase  shares of our common stock at an average repurchase price of per share during fiscal the increase in financing activities was also offset by an increase of million in cash dividend payments to shareholders in the fiscal year ended march   as compared with the prior year 
our current intention is to pay a cash dividend to polymedica common shareholders on a quarterly basis for the foreseeable future 
we expect the cash dividend payment to average approximately million per quarter 
other financing activities included the payment of capital lease and note payable obligations and amounts set aside for executive deferred compensation plans

during the year ended march   we fully paid off the note payable of million reported as of march  and have not entered into any new note commitments 
contingencies we are subject to government investigations and related litigation  which  if decided against us  could materially affect our liquidity 
please see item of part i  legal proceedings for a more complete description of these matters 
on a regular basis we conduct internal investigations to determine compliance with billing rules applicable to medicare and third party reimbursement 
as part of the internal review that we conducted in parallel with the investigation  we identified a category of medicare claims where the documentation for the claim supported a portion  but not the full quantity  of the products shipped and billed 
we engaged an outside consulting firm to perform a statistical analysis of all medicare claims filed by polymedica over a six year period in order to develop an estimate of overpayments by medicare related to this category of claims 
in the fiscal year ended march   we received the preliminary results of that analysis  which indicated an aggregate overpayment of approximately million  of which million was previously accrued and million was recorded as a reduction of net revenues and an increase to the accrual in the fiscal year ended march  the statistical analysis conducted by the outside consulting firm also identified certain other claims that largely occurred during and where polymedica s documentation was consistent with the full quantity shipped and billed  but was not strictly in accordance with medicare rules 
we are contending the adequacy of our documentation for these claims to the government investigators 
we believe that our documentation for these claims is adequate 
accordingly  we have not recorded any reserves for this category of claims  as to which the analysis indicates that the amount potentially at issue is approximately million  and anticipate that the issue will be addressed in the context of the overall resolution of the investigation 
we anticipate that the final results of the consulting firm s analysis which we don t expect to differ materially from the preliminary analysis  will be received in the summer of while the government s investigation could identify other issues  we are not aware of any information that would result in payments to the government by polymedica which in the aggregate would substantially impair our ability to carry out our current business plan 
we believe that our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities balance as of march  of million  and cash flows generated from operations  will be sufficient to meet working capital  capital expenditure and financing needs  including the payment of dividends to shareholders  for future business operations for the foreseeable future 
in the event that we undertake to make acquisitions of complementary businesses  products or technologies  we may require substantial additional funding beyond currently available working capital and funds generated from operations 
other factors which could negatively affect our liquidity include  among other things  a reduction in the demand for our products  an unfavorable outcome of pending litigation and investigations  or a reduction in medicare reimbursement for our products 
sales of a significant portion of our liberty diabetes and liberty respiratory 
table of contents segments depend on the continued availability of medicare reimbursement 
effective january   the medicare modernization act reduces reimbursement rates for inhalation drugs  which we sell through our liberty respiratory segment  and reduces reimbursement rates for diabetes test strips and lancets by approximately  which we sell through our liberty diabetes segment 
for a further discussion of these reimbursement rate reductions  including their financial impact on our business  please see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations medicare modernization act 
accounting pronouncements and exposure drafts in march  the financial accounting standards board the fasb issued an exposure draft  stock based payment ed 
if the ed is adopted by the fasb  we will be required to report stock based compensation expense at the grant date fair value of the related stock based awards 
we currently account for our stock based compensation in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and related interpretations apb and have adopted the disclosure only provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure sfas no 
 an amendment of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  sfas no 

the adoption of this ed by the fasb and subsequently polymedica could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 
in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation number fin consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb  and in december  issued a revision to that interpretation 
fin r replaces fin and addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities that possess certain characteristics 
a variable interest entity vie is defined as a an ownership  contractual or monetary interest in an entity where the ability to influence financial decisions is not proportional to the investment interest  or b an entity lacking the invested capital sufficient to fund future activities without the support of a third party 
fin r establishes standards for determining under what circumstances vies should be consolidated with their primary beneficiary  including those to which the usual condition for consolidation does not apply 
we adopted both fin and fin r in the year ended march  for non special purpose entities created prior to february  the adoption of fin and fin r did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
factors affecting future operating results our future operating results remain difficult to predict 
we continue to face many risks and uncertainties which could affect our operating results  including without limitation  those described below 
we could experience significantly reduced revenues and profits if medicare or other government programs change  delay or deny reimbursement sales of a significant portion of our liberty diabetes  liberty respiratory and pharmaceuticals segments depend on the continued availability of reimbursement of our customers by government and private insurance plans 
any reduction in medicare or other government program or private plan reimbursements currently available for our products would reduce our revenues 
without a corresponding reduction in the cost of such products  the result would be a reduction in our overall profit margin 
similarly  any increase in the cost of such products would reduce our overall profit margin unless there was a corresponding increase in medicare or other government program reimbursement 
our profits could also be affected by the imposition of more stringent regulatory requirements for medicare or other government program reimbursement or adjustments to previously reimbursed amounts 
litigation may materially adversely affect us polymedica and three former officers of polymedica are defendants in a lawsuit alleging violations of certain sections and rules of the securities exchange act of the exchange act  which was initiated in us district court for the district of massachusetts in november polymedica believes it has meritorious defenses to the claims made against it in this action in which it is a defendant and intends to contest the claims vigorously 
we cannot accurately predict the outcome of this proceeding at this time  and have therefore not recorded any charges relating to this proceeding 
an unfavorable outcome could have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations 
please see item of part i  legal proceedings of this annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended march   for a more complete description of this claim 

table of contents we could experience significantly reduced revenues and profits as the result of an unfavorable outcome to current governmental investigations the regulations that govern medicare reimbursement are complex  and our compliance with those regulations may be reviewed by federal agencies  including the oig  the doj  and the fda 
our interpretation of medicare regulations may also differ from the interpretation of federal agencies 
the us attorney s office for the southern district of florida  with the assistance of the fbi and oig  is investigating allegations of healthcare fraud  improper revenue recognition and obstruction of justice by liberty and liberty home pharmacy 
we conducted our own internal review in parallel with the investigations 
both civil and criminal investigations are being conducted 
we are cooperating with the investigations 
we cannot accurately predict the outcome of these investigations and proceedings at this time  and have therefore not recorded any charges relating to these proceedings 
if any of these investigations results in a determination that we have failed to comply with the regulations governing medicare reimbursement or financial reporting or have otherwise committed healthcare fraud or securities law violations  we could be subject to delays or loss of reimbursement  substantial fines or penalties  and other sanctions 
an adverse determination could have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations 
at this time  we cannot accurately predict the outcome of these proceedings  and have therefore not recorded any charges relating to these proceedings 
accelerated amortization of our direct response advertising costs could adversely affect our operating results any change in existing accounting rules or a business change that impacts expected net cash flows or that shortens the period over which such net cash flows are estimated to be realized  currently four years for our diabetes products  could result in accelerated charges against our earnings 
in addition  new or different marketing initiatives that may not qualify for direct response advertising could result in accelerated charges against our earnings 
our stock price could be volatile the trading price of our common stock has been volatile and is likely to continue to be volatile 
the stock market in general  and the market for healthcare related companies in particular  has experienced extreme volatility 
this volatility has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
investors may not be able to sell their common stock at or above the price at which they purchased the stock 
prices for the common stock will be determined in the marketplace and may be influenced by many factors  including variations in our financial results  changes in earnings estimates by industry research analysts  investors perceptions of us and general economic  industry and market conditions 
we plan to continue our rapid expansion  if we do not manage our growth successfully  our growth and profitability may slow or stop we have expanded our operations rapidly and plan to continue to expand 
this expansion has created significant demand on our administrative  operational and financial personnel and other resources 
additional expansion in existing or new markets could strain these resources and increase our need for capital 
our personnel  systems  procedures  controls and existing space may not be adequate to support further expansion 
the loss of senior management or other key personnel  or our inability to attract and retain additional senior management or other key personnel  could affect our ability to execute our business plan 
if we are unable to retain our senior managers or other key personnel necessary to operate our business  our ability to execute our business plan may be impaired 
our success in the future may also depend on our ability to attract and retain additional qualified senior management and other key personnel 
geopolitical events may reduce our ability to obtain favorable advertising rates for our direct response advertising efforts  which may adversely affect our operating results 
the effectiveness of our direct response advertising is subject to the risks arising from geopolitical events 
for example  around the clock news coverage on the war in iraq and the war on terrorism affected our ability to obtain favorable rates for our product advertisements and thus affected our ability to obtain new customers 
such geopolitical events may in the foreseeable future have a negative impact on our results of operations 

table of contents the profitability of our liberty diabetes and liberty respiratory segments will decrease if we do not receive recurring orders from customers the profitability of our liberty diabetes and liberty respiratory segments depends in large part on recurring and sustained reorders 
reorder rates are inherently uncertain due to several factors  many of which are outside our control  including changing customer preferences  competitive price pressures  customer transition to extended care facilities  customer mortality and general economic conditions 
we generally incur losses and negative cash flow with respect to the first order from a new customer  due primarily to the marketing and regulatory compliance costs associated with initial customer qualification 
we could experience significantly reduced profits from our liberty diabetes segment if improved technologies that reduce or eliminate the need for consumable testing supplies are developed for glucose monitoring the majority of our liberty diabetes net revenues are from consumable testing supplies  used to draw and test small quantities of blood for the purpose of measuring and monitoring glucose levels 
numerous research efforts are underway to develop more convenient and less intrusive glucose measurement techniques 
the commercialization and widespread acceptance of new technologies that eliminate or reduce the need for consumable testing supplies could negatively affect our liberty diabetes segment 
we could experience a charge to earnings as a result of an impairment of our goodwill we are required to perform impairment tests under sfas no 
annually and whenever events or changes in circumstance suggest that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
the valuation of our goodwill is based upon the results of these impairment tests 
changes in assumptions used and forecasted results of operations of the reporting unit carrying goodwill  could affect the quantification of an impairment value  should one exist 
we could be liable for harm caused by products that we sell the sale of medical products entails the risk that users will make product liability claims 
a product liability claim could be expensive 
while management believes that our insurance provides adequate coverage  no assurance can be made that adequate coverage will exist for these claims 
we could lose customers and revenues to new or existing competitors competition from other sellers of products offered through our liberty diabetes  liberty respiratory and pharmaceuticals segments  manufacturers of healthcare products  pharmaceutical companies and other competitors is intense and expected to increase 
many of our competitors and potential competitors are large companies with well known names and substantial resources 
these companies may develop products and services that are more effective or less expensive than any that we are developing or selling 
they may also promote and market these products more successfully than we promote and market our products 
loss of use of manufacturing or data storage facilities could significantly reduce revenues and profits from our businesses we manufacture substantially all of our prescription urology and suppository products and many of our azo brand name products at our facility in woburn  massachusetts 
in addition  we process and store most of our customer data in our facility in port st 
lucie  florida 
if we cannot use any of these facilities as a result of the fda  occupational safety and health administration or other regulatory action  fire  natural disaster or other event  our revenues and profits would decrease significantly 
we might also incur significant expense in remedying the problem or securing alternative manufacturing or data storage sources 
if we or our suppliers do not comply with applicable government regulations  we may be prohibited from selling our products the majority of the products that we sell are regulated by the fda and other regulatory agencies 
if any of these agencies mandate a suspension of production or sales of our products or mandate a recall  we may lose sales and incur expenses until we are in compliance with the regulations or change to another acceptable supplier 
we could have difficulty selling our pharmaceuticals products if we cannot maintain and expand our sales to distributors we rely on third party distributors to market and sell our over the counter female urinary discomfort products and prescription urology and suppository products 
future sales of these products depend in part on our maintaining and expanding marketing and 
table of contents distribution relationships with pharmaceutical  medical device  personal care and other distributors and on the success of those distributors in marketing and selling our products 
our quarterly revenues or operating results could vary  which may cause the market price of our securities to decline we have experienced fluctuations in our quarterly operating results and anticipate that such fluctuations could continue 
results may vary significantly depending on a number of factors  including changes in reimbursement guidelines and amounts  changes in regulations affecting the healthcare industry  the timing of customer orders  the timing and cost of our advertising campaigns  the timing of the introduction or acceptance of new products offered by us or our competitors  and changes in the mix and costs of our products  product mix and costs are significantly influenced by the product brand chosen by the customers of our mail order diabetes supply business 
we provide a wide range of product brand choices to our customers  purchased at varying costs from suppliers 
our ability to sustain current gross margin levels is dependent both on our ability to continue securing favorable pricing from suppliers and on the brand choices of our customers 
a reduction in working capital or a change in our business could prevent us from paying dividends to shareholders a significant decline in our cash balances or a change in our business could cause us to reduce or eliminate the payment of dividends to shareholders 
we may make acquisitions that will strain our financial and operational resources we regularly review potential acquisitions of businesses products and assets 
acquisitions involve a number of risks that might adversely affect our financial and operational resources  including diversion of the attention of senior management from important business matters  amortization of substantial intangible assets  difficulty in retaining key personnel of an acquired business  failure to assimilate operations of an acquired business  possible operating losses and expenses of an acquired business  exposure to legal claims for activities of an acquired business prior to acquisition  and incurrence of debt and related interest expense 
we may issue preferred stock with rights senior to the common stock our articles of organization authorize the issuance of up to  shares of preferred stock without shareholder approval 
the shares may have dividend  voting  liquidation and other rights and preferences that are senior to the rights of the common stock 
the rights and preferences of any such class or series of preferred stock would be established by our board in its sole discretion
