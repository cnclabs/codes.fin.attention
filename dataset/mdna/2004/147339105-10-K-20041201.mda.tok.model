item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following is management s assessment of the company s financial condition and a discussion of the principal factors that affect consolidated results of operations and cash flows for the fiscal years ended september    and references herein to   and refer to these fiscal years 
overview the company is a local distribution company ldc serving approximately  customers in the states of washington and oregon 
its service area consists primarily of relatively small cities and rural communities rather than larger urban areas 
the company s primary source of revenue and operating margin is the distribution of natural gas to end use residential  commercial  industrial  and institutional customers 
revenues are also derived from providing gas management and other services to some of its large industrial and commercial customers 
the company s rates and practices are regulated by the wutc and the opuc 
key elements of the company s strategy include remain focused on the natural gas distribution business 
achieve earnings growth through expansion of its customer base and operating efficiencies  minimizing the need to seek rate increases to recover increased costs 
opportunities and challenges the company operates in a diverse service territory over a wide geographic area relative to the company s overall size and number of customers 
the economies of various parts of the service area are supported by a variety of industries  and are affected by the conditions that impact those industries 
management believes there are growth opportunities in the company s service area 
factors contributing to these opportunities include low market penetration in many of the towns served  and general population growth in the service area  including some areas of rapid growth 
rates charged by the company for its utility services are regulated by the wutc and the opuc 
the company s basic business strategy is to minimize reliance on rate increases for earnings growth 
however  realization of risks affecting earnings could require the company to seek approval of higher rates 
the results of such rate requests are subject to uncertainties associated with the regulatory process 
the company earns more than one third of its operating margin from industrial and electric generation customers 
loss of major industrial customers  or unfavorable conditions affecting an industry segment  could have a detrimental impact on the company s earnings 
many external factors over which the company has no control can significantly impact the amount of gas consumed by industrial and electric generation customers  and consequently the margins earned by the company 
revenues and margins from the company s residential and small commercial customers are highly weather sensitive 
in a cold year  the company s earnings are boosted by the effects of the weather  and conversely in a warm year  the company s earnings suffer 
the company continues to explore alternatives such as weather normalization mechanisms that utility regulators in many jurisdictions have approved  to reduce weather related volatility in earnings and in customers bills 
overall revenues and margins are also negatively impacted by customers taking measures to reduce energy usage 
the increasing cost of energy in recent years  including the wholesale cost of natural gas  continues to encourage such measures 
prospects for continuing strong residential and commercial customer growth are excellent 
the pace of new home and commercial construction remains steady in our communities 
good potential also exists for converting homes and businesses located on or near our current lines to gas from other fuels  as well as for expanding our system into adjacent areas 
results of operations versus the company reported net income for of  or per basic and diluted share  compared to  or per basic and diluted share for primary factors and the resulting increase decrease in earnings per share affecting this comparison include improved margins from residential and commercial customers related to increased per customer consumption and growth in the number of customers per share 
reduction in employee benefit expenses resulting from the successful implementation of plan changes designed to reduce costs per share 
recognition in of retirement plan curtailment losses in connection with above mentioned plan changes per share 
favorable mark to market valuations in and negative valuations in per share 
contract termination charge in per share 
increase in depreciation and amortization per share 
decreased margin from electric generation customers per share 
decreased margin from gas management services per share 
versus net income for was  compared to  for basic and diluted earnings per share for were  a decrease from the per share earnings for operating margin operating margins revenue minus gas cost and revenue taxes by customer category for the fiscal years ended september   and are set forth in the tables below residential and commercial operating margin months ended september in thousands degree days    average number of customers residential    commercial    average therm usage per customer residential commercial    operating margin residential    commercial    industrial and other operating margin months ended september and therms in thousands average number of customers electric generation industrial therms delivered electric generation    industrial    operating margin electric generation    industrial    gas management services   other  versus the increase of  in total operating margin was primarily driven by improvements in residential and commercial margins  partially offset by reductions in margins from electric generation customers 
residential and commercial 
margins from residential and commercial customers increased  of this increase  approximately  resulted from the increase of  in the average number of customers billed 
the remaining increase stems primarily from increased gas usage per customer  related to somewhat cooler weather 
industrial 
for the year  gas distribution margins from industrial customers were the same as in the first half of the year  industrial distribution margin showed promising signs of recovery from the stagnation that followed the energy crisis and a prolonged recession 
however  the upward trend stalled in the third quarter  when industrial distribution margins were essentially flat to last year  and in the fourth quarter margins declined 
we believe that the primary reason for the reversal of the positive trend in industrial consumption was the surprisingly high wholesale cost of gas that prevailed through most of the period from may through july 
contrary to traditional expectations for softer prices during the warm spring and summer months  the daily spot prices at sumas were significantly higher than prices during the preceding heating months of february and march 
while many of our service communities continue to suffer effects from the long economic downturn  we are seeing signs of increased industrial activity 
new plants ranging from food processors to a manufacturer of small planes have been announced  and expansion projects for a number of existing plants are underway 
other facilities that ceased operations during the recession are reopening 
nevertheless  gas utilization by industrial customers remains somewhat uncertain for the near term due to volatile wholesale gas prices 
in order to help our industrial customers cope with price volatility  in september we obtained and offered gas supplies with prices fixed at the more reasonable levels that prevailed at the time 
many took advantage of the offering  but others remain exposed to fluctuating market prices 
usage by such customers may be affected if prices remain high for an extended period 
electric generation 
margins from electric generation customers were down  compared to much of the decline was due to an abundance of cheap hydroelectricity and moderate regional demands for power during the first part of the year 
drought conditions during the spring significantly reduced hydro resources  improving prospects for gas fired generation requirements going into the summer 
however  the high wholesale gas costs that were depressing general industrial usage also affected demand by generators  and fourth quarter margins from the sector fell short of the quarter last year 
looking ahead  gas usage by generation customers will continue to depend on the same variables regional demand for power  availability of hydro resources  and the relationship between the market price of electricity and the cost of gas 
gas management 
though margins from providing gas management services increased  over  this comparison is impacted by three factors 
margins in were negatively impacted by an  contract termination charge  and negative mark to market energy derivative valuations of  margins in were boosted  by positive mark to market energy derivative valuations 
absent these factors  gas management margin decreased by  the re emergence of energy marketers  an industry segment that all but disappeared in the wake of the enron failure  has resulted in stiff competition for gas supply sales to larger gas customers 
cascade has lost some customers to such marketers  and margins that are available for any sales are smaller than in the past 
we will continue to provide gas supply services to customers to facilitate their use of gas  but expect revenues from the activity to be limited 
versus total operating margin of  was only slightly greater than prior year margin of  declines in margins from residential and commercial customers were substantially offset by improvements in margins from industrial and other customers 
residential and commercial 
margins from residential and commercial customers declined  weather  warmer in compared to  contributed to declines in per customer gas consumption 
the resulting impact on margin was a reduction of approximately  partially offsetting this decline was a positive impact from the addition of new customers  which contributed approximately  margin 
industrial and other 
margins from delivery of gas to electric generation customers declined  lower margins from electric generation customers in reflect continued sluggish economic conditions and adequate supplies of lower cost hydropower displacing electricity from gas generation facilities 
margins from delivering gas to industrial customers increased slightly  substantially offsetting the decline from electric generation customers 
margins from gas management services to customers were negatively affected in both years by termination charges in settlement of two cancelled gas supply contracts 
the contracts were entered into to provide supplies to a group of industrial customers who had contracted for gas management services 
in an initial charge of  was recorded reflecting management s estimate at that time of the estimated liability under the claims 
an additional charge of  was recorded in reflecting full settlement of all claims related to these contracts 
cost of operations versus compared to  overall cost of operations was  lower for the year 
within cost of operations  notable changes in operating expenses included the reduction in employee benefits expenses of  the comparison is affected by retirement plan curtailment charges of  in the remaining decrease is primarily attributed to changes in benefit plans initiated in  designed to reduce costs 
benefits expense in was also favorably impacted by recognition of  for the medicare prescription drug subsidy  reflected as a reduction in retiree medical expense 
additional information on the medicare prescription drug subsidy and the related accounting is included in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements under the caption fsp fas nos 
and 
in addition  expenses included a  severance cost 
the  increase in depreciation and amortization is primarily related to increases in depreciable gas distribution system assets 
versus operating expenses increased  over  including an increase in employee benefits expenses of  included in benefits expense was recognition of a  curtailment loss in connection with changes in the company s retirement plans for salaried employees and executives 
the revisions to the defined benefit plans constitute plan curtailments under fas no 
 employers accounting for settlements and curtailments of defined benefit pension plans and for termination benefit  resulting in the above mentioned curtailment loss associated with unrecognized prior service cost and transition obligation 
further information on benefits plan changes is included below under employee benefits plan changes 
also contributing to the increase in operating expenses is a  charge for accrual of severance costs  and a  increase in purchased services  stemming primarily from consulting charges related to two projects  the company s review of its benefit plans  and a project to prepare the company for the compliance requirements of the sarbanes oxley act 
depreciation and amortization increased   over primarily as a result of increases in depreciable gas distribution system assets 
income taxes the changes in the provision for income taxes from to  and from to are attributable to the changes in pre tax earnings 
other comprehensive income loss in  the value of pension plan assets continued a modest recovery from the declines experienced in and as a result of this recovery  the company has reduced its accrual related to its unfunded accumulated benefit obligation by  for the year before taxes 
liquidity and capital resources the seasonal nature of the company s business creates short term cash requirements to finance customer accounts receivable and construction expenditures 
to provide working capital for these requirements  the company has a  bank revolving credit commitment 
this agreement has a variable commitment fee  and a term that expires in october as of september   there was  outstanding debt under these credit lines 
in fiscal  million in long term medium term notes will mature and will be repaid using funds available from the short term credit line 
to provide longer term financing the company filed an omnibus registration statement in  under the securities act of  which provided the ability to issue up to  of new debt and equity securities 
of that amount  the company has  remaining available for issuance subject to market conditions and other factors 
because of the availability of short term credit and the ability to issue long term debt and additional equity  management believes it has adequate financial flexibility to meet its anticipated cash needs  including cash requirements for investing and financing activities described in the following paragraphs 
operating activities though net income improved in compared to  net cash provided by operating activities declined by  a significant factor is reflected in deferrals of gas cost changes  resulting from higher wholesale gas costs paid this year relative to the amount built in to customer rates 
cash provided by operating activities in fiscal continues to benefit from amortization of gas cost changes  contributing  for the year 
this results from a temporary component of customer rates designed to collect un recovered gas costs incurred primarily during the winter of when wholesale gas prices reached unprecedented high levels  and the company did not immediately increase customer rates to recover the full amount of higher costs 
this temporary rate component expired in october as a result of higher gas costs experienced in fiscal  the company implemented a new temporary rate component  effective november  at approximately the same level as the one expired 
there is no impact on operating margin or net income from amortization of gas cost changes 
significant factors affecting non cash components of net income are prepaid income taxes and deferred income taxes 
in the fourth quarter of  the company received internal revenue service approval of an application to change the method of accounting for deferred gas costs for purposes of calculating current federal income taxes 
as a result the company will be able to deduct on its federal tax returns amounts included in deferred gas cost charges 
this change is effective retroactive to the tax return for fiscal year  and the company is preparing amended tax returns for its fiscal years and accordingly the company has accrued an estimated refund of federal and state income taxes for those years of million 
these refunds represent temporary differences between book and taxable income  and deferred income taxes have been accrued  so that there is no impact on net income resulting from this change 
as deferred gas cost charges are amortized in future years  the company s income tax liability and cash payments for income taxes will increase accordingly 
the table below shows the company s future commitments under contractual obligations as of september  amounts due by fiscal year contract category beyond total dollars in thousands short term debt   long term debt     interest on debt       operating leases  gas supply       interstate pipeline transportation       gas storage and peaking services        other  total       investing activities net capital expenditures for were approximately greater than last year 
the increase is primarily attributable to  expended on a project to install electronic devices on all the company s customer meters to allow for automated meter reading amr the amr project was begun in  and is essentially complete as of the end of fiscal  with total expenditures on the project of approximately  financing activities other than the payment of dividends  the company s primary financing activity during fiscal was the repayment of  in long term debt and increasing its borrowing under its bank credit line by  the company also received  in proceeds from issuance of common stock 
in the second quarter of fiscal  the company began issuing new stock through its dividend reinvestment plan  k plan  and on exercise of stock options 
the prior practice was to purchase shares of stock on the open market 
in the fourth quarter of  the company renewed its credit line with its bank  increasing the committed credit line from  to  the renewed credit line expires in october in fiscal  the company will repay  in current maturities of long term debt  beginning with  in october the company expects to fund these repayments primarily through use of its bank credit lines  cash from operating activities  and long term capital sources 
environmental matters in  the company received a claim from a property owner in eugene  oregon requesting that the company assume responsibility for investigation and possible clean up of alleged contamination on property previously owned by a predecessor of cascade 
the predecessor company conducted a manufactured gas business on the property from approximately to manufactured gas operations apparently were conducted on the site by several operators beginning about the site was used for other purposes beginning in the present owner has retained an environmental consultant  who is investigating possible contamination on the property 
to date the consultant has reported that it believes contamination is present 
the contamination is consistent with that which might originate from a manufactured gas operation 
there have been no estimates as to possible clean up costs 
the consultant s initial report has been furnished to the oregon department of environmental quality deq 
the owner has reached an intergovernmental agreement with the deq with respect to further investigation and possible remediation of contamination on the property under the voluntary cleanup program 
another northwest utility  which purchased the property from cascade in  has declined to participate in the site investigation  although it may  as a one time owner of the property  bear some share of the responsibility as well 
the company has notified its insurance carriers of the claim and is keeping them advised as to the investigation 
on one occasion in the past when hazardous materials on property formerly owned by a predecessor of the company required clean up  the opuc allowed the clean up costs to be passed on to customers 
in the event the company is responsible for clean up costs not covered by insurance  management anticipates asking for reimbursement through rates for such costs 
in  a property owner in washington notified the company that there is contamination on his property  and that he believes it comes from a former manufactured gas site  owned at one time by a predecessor company  which was merged with cascade in the state of washington department of ecology has categorized this site as a listed site ranked in its most hazardous category 
as a former owner of the site  the company may be strictly liable to the state of washington for investigation and remediation of the contamination of the site  but may share that cost or allocate all the cost to others who actually caused or contributed to the contamination 
the company retained an environmental consultant who conducted a preliminary investigation of possible contamination at the site 
there is evidence of contamination at the site  and there is also evidence of an oil line across the site property owned and operated by others  which may be a contributor to the contamination 
there have been no estimates as to possible clean up costs 
the company has investigated title and other government records to identify other potentially liable parties 
the company has notified the other identified parties of the contamination claims  and has requested cooperation and financial contribution 
in the event the company is responsible for clean up costs not covered by insurance  management anticipates asking the wutc for reimbursement for such costs  through rates charged to customers 
efficiency initiatives automated meter reading the amr project is discussed above under investing activities 
objectives of the project include the reduction of labor cost associated with reading of customer meters and improved accuracy of meter reading 
the amr project  started in the third quarter of last year  was completed ahead of schedule 
the project enabled the company to reduce the number of meter readers from thirty two full time employees to three 
many of these experienced employees were redeployed to expand service and construction capabilities  displacing the use of outside contractors 
the amr project will also allow for more efficient use of service and construction personnel who acted as back up meter readers  and will eliminate the need to add new meter readers to keep up with customer growth 
call center the company is in the process of implementing a customer service call center at its present bellingham  washington district office location 
this will consolidate in one location the customer service function  which is now spread through fifteen local offices 
the new call center is expected to reduce expenses through the elimination of sixteen full time equivalent positions  and to allow for more specialization  increased efficiency  and improved service quality 
the company expects the center to be fully operational in the spring of critical accounting policies the company s financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
in following gaap  management exercises judgment in selection and application of accounting principles 
management considers critical accounting policies to be those where different assumptions regarding application could result in material differences in financial statements 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities  at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the company has used estimates in measuring certain deferred charges and deferred credits related to items subject to approval of the wutc and the opuc 
estimates are also used in the development of discount rates and trend rates related to the measurement of retirement benefit obligations and accrual amounts  allowances for doubtful accounts  unbilled revenue  valuation of derivative instruments  and in the determination of depreciable lives of utility plant 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates the estimates used  based on historical experience  current conditions and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition the company recognizes operating revenues based on deliveries of gas and other services to customers 
this includes estimated revenues for gas delivered but not billed to residential and commercial customers from the latest meter reading date to the end of the accounting period 
regulatory accounting the company s accounting policies and practices are generally the same as used by unregulated companies for financial reporting under gaap 
however  statement of financial accounting standards fas no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation  requires regulated companies to apply accounting treatment intended to reflect the financial impact of regulation 
for example  in establishing the rates to be charged to the company s retail customers  the wutc and the opuc may not allow the company to charge its customers for recovery of certain expenses in the same period they are incurred 
instead  rates are expected to be established to recover costs that were incurred in a prior period 
in this situation  following fas no 
requires the company to defer these costs and include them as regulatory assets on the balance sheet 
in the subsequent period when these costs are recovered from customers  the company then amortizes these costs as expense in the income statement  in an amount equivalent to the amounts recovered 
similarly  certain revenue items  or cost reductions may be deferred as regulatory liabilities  which are later amortized to the income statement as customer rates are reduced 
in order to apply the provisions of fas no 
 the following conditions must apply an independent regulator approves the company s customer rates 
the rates are designed to recover the company s costs of providing the regulated services or products 
there is sufficient demand for the regulated service to reasonably assure that rates can be set at a level to recover the costs 
the company periodically assesses whether conditions merit the continued applicability of fas no 
in the event the company should determine in the future that all or a portion of its regulatory assets and liabilities no longer meet the above criteria  it would be required to write off the related balances of its regulatory assets and liabilities  and reflect the write off in its income statement 
pension plans the company has a defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all employees over years of age with one year of service 
the company also provides executive officers with supplemental retirement  death and disability benefits 
these plans were amended in fiscal  so that subsequent to september   benefits under these plans no longer accrue to non bargaining unit employees and officers 
the pension plan remains substantially unchanged for bargaining unit employees at this time 
the company s pension costs for these plans are affected by the amount of cash contributions to the plans  the return on plan assets  and by employee demographics  including age  compensation  and length of service 
actuarial formulas are used in the determination of pension costs and are affected by actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience 
key actuarial assumptions include the expected return on plan assets  the discount rate used in determining the projected benefit obligation and pension costs  and the assumed rate of increase in employee compensation 
changes in these assumptions may significantly affect pension costs 
changes to the provisions of the plans may also impact current and future pension costs 
changes in pension plan obligations resulting from these factors may not be immediately recognized as pension costs  but generally are recognized in future years over the remaining average service period of pension plan participants 
the company s funding policy is to contribute amounts equal to or greater than the minimum amounts required to be funded under the employee retirement income security act  and not more than the maximum amounts currently deductible for income tax purposes 
the company contributed  in and  in to the pension and supplemental executive retirement plans  and expects to contribute  in the discount rate the company selects is based on the average of the year and above aa debt rates published by moody s 
these are rates considered to be consistent with the expected term of pension benefits 
in the company reduced the discount rate from to in connection with remeasurement of the pension obligation at may   with a further reduction to at september  at the september   the company used a discount rate of 
a reduction in the discount rate results in increases in projected benefit obligation  pension liability  and pension costs 
in selecting an assumed long term rate of return on plan assets  the company considers past performance and economic forecasts for the types of investments held by the plan 
in and the company s assumed rate of return on plan assets was 
a reduction in the assumed rate of return would result in increases in pension liability and pension costs 
derivatives the company accounts for derivative transactions according to the provisions of fas no 
 as amended by fas no 
and by fas no 
these standards require that the fair value of all derivative financial instruments be recognized as either assets or liabilities on the company s balance sheet and the recognition of unrealized gains and losses 
most of the company s contracts for purchase and sale of natural gas qualify for the normal purchase and normal sales exception under fas no 
and are not required to be recorded as derivative assets and liabilities 
accordingly  the company recognizes revenues and expenses on an accrual basis  based on physical delivery of natural gas 
the company applies mark to market accounting to financial derivative contracts 
periodic changes in fair market value of derivatives associated with supplies for non core customers are recognized in earnings 
the differences in accounting for purchases and sales contracts versus financial contracts do not change the underlying economics of the transactions  but could result in increased quarterly earnings volatility 
the company applies fas no 
to periodic changes in fair market value of derivatives associated with supplies for core customers and records an offset in regulatory asset and regulatory liability accounts 
medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of on december   president bush signed into law the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of the act 
the act introduces a prescription drug benefit under medicare medicare part d as well as a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to medicare part d 
the company has elected to recognize the impact of this subsidy retroactive to the beginning of the second quarter of fiscal please refer to the information contained under the caption fsp fas no 
and  under new accounting standards in the note to the consolidated financial statements  contained in this report 
new accounting standards information on new accounting standards is included in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  contained in this report 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk cascade has evaluated its risk related to financial instruments whose values are subject to market sensitivity 
the company has fixed rate debt obligations  but does not have derivative financial instruments subject to interest rate risk 
cascade makes interest and principal payments on these obligations in the normal course of its business  and does not plan to redeem these obligations prior to normal maturities 
the company s natural gas purchase commodity prices are subject to fluctuations resulting from weather  congestion on interstate pipelines  and other unpredictable factors 
the company s pga mechanisms assure the recovery of prudently incurred wholesale cost of gas purchased for the core market 
the company utilizes fixed price contracts and financial derivatives to manage risk associated with wholesale costs of gas purchased for customers 
with respect to derivative arrangements covering gas supplies for core customers  periodic changes in fair market value are recorded in regulatory asset or regulatory liability accounts  pursuant to authority granted by the wutc and opuc recognizing that settlements of these arrangements will be recovered through the purchased gas cost adjustment pga mechanism 
for derivative arrangements related to supplies for non core customers  which are not covered by a pga mechanism  periodic changes in fair market value are recognized in earnings 
forward looking statements statements contained in this report that are not historical in nature are forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of forward looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual future results to differ materially 
such risks and uncertainties with respect to the company include  among others  its ability to successfully implement internal performance goals  competition from alternative forms of energy and other sellers of energy  consolidation in the energy industry  performance issues with key natural gas suppliers  the capital intensive nature of the company s business  regulatory issues  including the need for adequate and timely rate relief to recover capital and operating costs and to sustain dividend levels  the weather  increasing competition brought on by deregulation initiatives at the federal and state regulatory levels  the potential loss of large volume industrial customers due to bypass or the shift by such customers to special competitive contracts at lower per unit margins  exposure to environmental cleanup requirements  and economic conditions  particularly in the company s service area
