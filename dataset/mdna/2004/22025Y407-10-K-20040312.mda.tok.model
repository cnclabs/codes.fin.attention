table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including  but not limited to  those described under risk factors and included in other portions of this report 
overview the company as of december   we owned correctional  detention and juvenile facilities  three of which we lease to other operators  and one additional facility which is not yet in operation 
as of december   we operated facilities  with a total design capacity of approximately  beds in states and the district of columbia 
during january  we also began operating six additional correctional facilities and ceased operating one  all owned by the state of texas  increasing the total number of facilities under our operation to  with a total design capacity of approximately  beds 
we are the nation s largest owner and operator of privatized correctional and detention facilities and one of the largest prison operators in the united states behind only the federal government and four states 
our size and experience provide us with significant credibility with our current and prospective customers  and enables us to generate economies of scale in purchasing power for food services  health care and other supplies and services we offer to our customers 
we are compensated for operating and managing prisons and correctional facilities at an inmate per diem rate based upon actual or minimum guaranteed occupancy levels 
the significant expansion of the prison population in the united states has led to overcrowding in the state and federal prison systems  providing us with opportunities for growth 
however  recent economic developments have caused federal  state  and local governments to experience unusual budgetary constraints  putting pressure on governments to control correctional budgets  including per diem rates our customers pay to us 
nonetheless  while these constraints have and are expected to continue to put pressure on our operating margins  we believe the outsourcing of prison management services to private operators allows governments to manage increasing inmate populations while simultaneously controlling correctional costs and improving correctional services 
we believe our customers discover that partnering with private operators to provide residential services to their inmates introduces competition to their prison system  resulting in improvements to the quality and cost of corrections services throughout their correctional system 
further  the use of facilities owned and managed by private operators allows governments to expand prison capacity without incurring large capital commitments required to increase correctional capacity 
we also believe that having beds immediately available to our customers provides us with a distinct competitive advantage when bidding on new contracts 
while we have been successful in winning contract awards to provide management services for facilities we do not own  and will continue to pursue such management contracts  we believe the most significant opportunities for growth are in providing our government partners with available beds within facilities we currently own or develop 
we also believe that owning the facilities in which we provide management services enables us to more rapidly replace business lost compared with managed only facilities  since we can offer the same beds to new and existing customers and  with customer consent  may have more flexibility in moving our existing inmate populations to facilities with available capacity 
all of our management contracts generally provide our customers with the right to terminate our management contracts at any time without cause 

table of contents we currently have three correctional facilities  our northeast ohio correctional center  our north fork correctional facility  and our tallahatchie county correctional facility  which are substantially vacant and provide us with approximately  available beds 
we also have an additional facility under construction in georgia which will create approximately  additional available beds that is expected to be completed during the third quarter of during  we also announced the expansion of four of our facilities that are expected to result in the development of approximately  beds through the first quarter of as of december   we also had a total of five facilities that had or more beds available at each facility  providing further potential for increased revenue and cash flow 
as a result of the completion of our recapitalization and refinancing transactions during and  we have significantly reduced our exposure to variable rate debt  lowered our after tax interest and dividend obligations associated with our outstanding debt and preferred stock  and now have no debt maturities on outstanding indebtedness until also as a result of the completion of these capital transactions  covenants under our senior secured credit facility were amended to provide greater flexibility for  among other matters  incurring unsecured indebtedness  capital expenditures  and permitted acquisitions  providing us with the financial flexibility to afford the capital investments to create additional beds without unduly straining our capital structure 
we are utilizing our financial flexibility and liquidity to make investments in technology 
while we have been successful in reducing our variable expenses mostly in medical and food services primarily by taking advantage of our purchasing power  we believe the largest opportunity for further reducing our operating expenses depends on our ability to modernize our facility operations through investments in technology 
we believe investments in technology can enable us to operate safe and secure facilities with more efficient  highly skilled and better trained staff  and to reduce turnover 
approximately of our operating expenses consist of salaries and benefits 
containing these costs will continue to be challenging 
further  the turnover rate for correctional officers for our company  and for the corrections industry in general  remains high  and medical benefits for our employees continue to increase primarily due to continued rising healthcare costs throughout the country 
unlike the savings reaped in our variable operating expenses  reducing these staffing costs requires a long term strategy to control such costs through the deployment of newly developed technologies  many of which are unique and new to the corrections industry 
through the combination of our business development initiatives to increase our revenues and our strategies to generate savings and to contain our operating expenses  we believe we will be able to maintain our competitive advantage and continue to improve the quality services we provide to our customers at an economical price  thereby producing value to our stockholders 
critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
as such  we are required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon the information available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
a summary of our significant accounting policies is described in note to our audited financial statements 
the significant accounting policies and estimates which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following asset impairments 
as of december   we had billion in long lived assets 
we evaluate the recoverability of the carrying values of our long lived assets  other than goodwill  when events 
table of contents suggest that an impairment may have occurred 
in these circumstances  we utilize estimates of undiscounted cash flows to determine if an impairment exists 
if an impairment exists  it is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset 
goodwill impairments 
effective january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  or sfas  which established new accounting and reporting requirements for goodwill and other intangible assets 
under sfas  all goodwill amortization ceased effective january  and goodwill attributable to each of our reporting units was tested for impairment by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value 
fair value was determined using a collaboration of various common valuation techniques  including market multiples  discounted cash flows  and replacement cost methods 
these impairment tests are required to be performed at adoption of sfas and at least annually thereafter 
we perform our impairment tests during the fourth quarter  in connection with our annual budgeting process  and whenever circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable 
based on our initial impairment tests  we recognized an impairment of million to write off the carrying value of goodwill associated with our locations included in the owned and managed reporting segment during the first quarter of this goodwill was established in connection with the acquisition of a company during the remaining goodwill  which is associated with the facilities we manage but do not own  was deemed to be not impaired 
this remaining goodwill was established in connection with the acquisitions of two service companies during  both of which were privately held service companies  that managed certain government owned adult and juvenile prison and jail facilities 
the implied fair value of goodwill of the locations included in the owned and managed reporting segment did not support the carrying value of any goodwill  primarily due to the highly leveraged capital structure 
no impairment of goodwill allocated to the locations included in the managed only reporting segment was deemed necessary  primarily because of the relatively minimal capital expenditure requirements  and therefore indebtedness  in connection with obtaining such management contracts 
under sfas  the impairment recognized at adoption of the new rules was reflected as a cumulative effect of accounting change in our statement of operations for the first quarter of impairment adjustments recognized after adoption  if any  are required to be recognized as operating expenses 
income taxes 
income taxes are accounted for under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas 
sfas generally requires us to record deferred income taxes for the tax effect of differences between book and tax bases of its assets and liabilities 
deferred income taxes reflect the available net operating losses and the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes 
realization of the future tax benefits related to deferred tax assets is dependent on many factors  including our past earnings history  expected future earnings  the character and jurisdiction of such earnings  unsettled circumstances that  if unfavorably resolved  would adversely affect utilization of our deferred tax assets  carryback and carryforward periods  and tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of realization of a deferred tax asset 
during the three years ended december   we provided a valuation allowance to substantially reserve our deferred tax assets in accordance with sfas however  at december   we concluded that it was more likely than not that substantially all of our deferred tax assets would be realized 
as a result  in accordance with sfas  the valuation allowance applied to such deferred tax assets was reversed 

table of contents removal of the valuation allowance resulted in a significant non cash reduction in income tax expense 
in addition  because a portion of the previously recorded valuation allowance was established to reserve certain deferred tax assets upon the acquisitions of two service companies during  in accordance with sfas  removal of the valuation allowance resulted in a reduction to the remaining goodwill recorded in connection with such acquisitions to the extent the reversal related to the valuation allowance applied to deferred tax assets existing at the date the service companies were acquired 
in addition  removal of the valuation allowance resulted in an increase in our additional paid in capital related to the tax benefits of exercises of employee stock options and of grants of restricted stock 
the reduction to goodwill amounted to million  while additional paid in capital increased million 
future financial statements will reflect a provision for income taxes at the applicable federal and state tax rates on income before taxes 
self funded insurance reserves 
as of december  and  we had million and million  respectively  in accrued liabilities for employee health  workers compensation  and automobile insurance claims 
we are significantly self insured for employee health  worker s compensation  and automobile liability insurance claims 
as such  our insurance expense is largely dependent on claims experience and our ability to control our claims 
we have consistently accrued the estimated liability for employee health insurance claims based on our history of claims experience and the time lag between the incident date and the date the cost is paid by us 
we have accrued the estimated liability for workers compensation and automobile insurance claims based on a third party actuarial valuation of the outstanding liabilities 
these estimates could change in the future 
it is possible that future cash flows and results of operations could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions  new developments  or by the effectiveness of our strategies 
legal reserves 
as of december  and  we had million and million  respectively  in accrued liabilities related to certain legal proceedings in which we are involved 
we have accrued our estimate of the probable costs for the resolution of these claims based on a range of potential outcomes 
in addition  we are subject to current and potential future legal proceedings for which little or no accrual has been reflected because our current assessment of the potential exposure is nominal 
these estimates have been developed in consultation with our general counsel s office and  as appropriate  outside counsel handling these matters  and are based upon an analysis of potential results  assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
it is possible that future cash flows and results of operations could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions  new developments  or by the effectiveness of our strategies 
results of operations the following table sets forth for the years ended december    and  the number of facilities we owned and managed  the number of facilities we managed but did not own  the number of facilities we leased to other operators  and the facilities we owned that were not yet in operation 

table of contents owned and managed managed only leased incomplete total facilities as of december  termination of the management contract for the southwest indiana regional youth village termination expiration of the management contracts for facilities in puerto rico management contract award by the federal bureau of prisons for the mcrae correctional facility sale of interest in a juvenile facility expiration of the management contract for the delta correctional facility facilities as of december  purchase of crowley county correctional facility expiration of the management contract for the okeechobee juvenile offender correctional center expiration of the management contract for the lawrenceville correctional facility facilities as of december  year ended december  compared to the year ended december  during the year ended december   we generated net income available to common stockholders of million  or per diluted share  compared with a net loss available to common stockholders of million  or per diluted share  for the previous year 
contributing to the net income for compared to the previous year was an increase in operating income of million  from million during to million during the increase was due to the commencement of operations at our mcrae correctional facility in december and the acquisition of the crowley county correctional facility in january  as well as increased occupancy levels and improved margins 
net income available to common stockholders during was favorably impacted by an income tax benefit of million primarily due to the reversal of the valuation allowance previously established for our deferred tax assets 
weighted average common shares outstanding for includes the effect of our issuance of million shares in connection with the recapitalization in may contributing to the net loss for was a non cash charge for the cumulative effect of an accounting change for goodwill of million  or per diluted share  related to the adoption of sfas  in addition to expenses associated with debt refinancing transactions of million  or per diluted share  during the second quarter of the debt refinancing completed during also contributed to the reduction in net interest expense  from million during to million during the cumulative effect of accounting change and the costs of refinancing were partially offset by an aggregate income tax benefit of million  which included a cash income tax benefit of million recognized during the first quarter of related to a change in tax law that became effective in march  which enabled us to utilize certain of our net operating losses to offset taxable income generated in and in addition  million of the income tax benefit in was due to the reduction of the tax valuation allowance applied to certain deferred tax assets arising primarily as a result of tax deductions based on a cumulative effect of accounting change for tax depreciation reported on our federal income tax return 

table of contents facility operations a key performance indicator we use to measure the revenue and expenses associated with the operation of the facilities we own or manage is expressed in terms of a compensated man day  and represents the revenue we generate and expenses we incur for one inmate for one calendar day 
revenue and expenses per compensated man day are computed by dividing facility revenue and expenses by the total number of compensated man days during the period 
a compensated man day represents a calendar day for which we are paid for the occupancy of an inmate 
we believe the measurement is useful because we are compensated for operating and managing facilities at an inmate per diem rate based upon actual or minimum guaranteed occupancy levels 
we also measure our ability to contain costs on a per compensated man day basis  which is largely dependent upon the number of inmates we accommodate 
further  per man day measurements are also used to estimate our potential profitability based on certain occupancy levels relative to design capacity 
revenue and expenses per compensated man day for all of the facilities we owned or managed  exclusive of those discontinued see further discussion below regarding discontinued operations  were as follows for the years ended december  and for the years ended december  revenue per compensated man day operating expenses per compensated man day fixed expense variable expense total operating margin per compensated man day operating margin average compensated occupancy management and other revenue consists of revenue earned from the operation and management of adult and juvenile correctional and detention facilities we own or manage and from our inmate transportation subsidiary  which  for the years ended december  and  totaled billion and million  respectively 
business from our federal customers  including the bureau of prisons  or the bop  the united states marshals service  or the usms  and the united states bureau of immigration and customs enforcement  or ice  remains strong  while many of our state customers are currently experiencing budget difficulties 
our federal customers generated and  respectively  of our total revenue for the years ended december  and while the budget difficulties experienced by our state customers present challenges with respect to our per diem rates resulting in pressure on our management revenue in future quarters  these governmental entities are also constrained with respect to funds available for prison construction 
as a result  because we believe inmate populations will continue to rise  we currently expect the lack of new bed supply to lead to higher occupancies in the long term 
additionally  we may experience a slight reduction in our operating margins during compared with as a result of recent contract awards for facilities we manage but do not own  or future contract awards  which may provide operating margins at lower levels than we generated during we entered  or may enter  into these contracts knowing our operating margins may decrease slightly in the future  however  the opportunity to both expand our level of service with existing customers and provide services to new customers outweighs the effects of possible short term operating margin reductions 

table of contents operating expenses totaled million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
operating expenses consist of those expenses incurred in the operation and management of adult and juvenile correctional and detention facilities  and for our inmate transportation subsidiary 
salaries and benefits represent the most significant component of fixed operating expenses 
during  salaries and benefits expense increased million from the increase in salaries and benefits expense was primarily due to the arrival of inmates at the mcrae correctional facility beginning in december and the purchase of the crowley county correctional facility in january salaries and benefits per compensated man day increased per compensated man day during from the turnover rate for correctional officers for our company  and for the corrections industry in general  also remains high 
we continue to develop strategies to reduce our turnover rate  and have experienced moderate success  but we can provide no assurance that these strategies will continue to be successful 
in addition  eleven of our facilities currently have contracts with the federal government requiring that our wage and benefit rates comply with wage determination rates set forth  and as adjusted from time to time  under the service contract act of the us department of labor 
our contracts generally provide for reimbursement of a portion of the increased costs resulting from wage determinations in the form of increased per diems  thereby mitigating the effect of increased salaries and benefits expenses at those facilities 
we may also be subject to adverse claims  or government audits  relating to alleged violations of wage and hour laws applicable to us  which may result in adjustments to amounts previously paid as wages and  potentially  interest and or monetary penalties 
we also experienced a trend of increasing insurance expense during compared with because we are significantly self insured for employee health  workers compensation  and automobile liability insurance  our insurance expense is dependent on claims experience and our ability to control our claims 
our insurance policies contain various deductibles and stop loss amounts intended to limit our exposure for individually significant occurrences 
however  the nature of our self insurance provides little protection for a deterioration in claims experience or increasing employee medical costs in general 
we continue to incur increasing insurance expense due to adverse claims experience primarily resulting from rising healthcare costs throughout the country 
we continue to develop new strategies to improve the management of our future loss claims  but can provide no assurance that these strategies will be successful 
additionally  general liability insurance costs have risen substantially since the terrorist attacks on september   and other types of insurance  such as directors and officers liability insurance  have increased due to several high profile business failures and concerns about corporate governance and accounting in the marketplace 
unanticipated additional insurance expenses resulting from adverse claims experience or a continued increasing cost environment for general liability and other types of insurance could result in increasing expense in the future 
the reduction in variable operating expenses per compensated man day to per compensated man day during from per compensated man day during was primarily due to the renegotiation of our contract for food services 
we decided to outsource food services at almost all of the facilities we operate 
outsourcing our food services to one vendor for substantially all of the facilities we manage generated opportunities to produce economies of scale 
we also achieved reductions in inmate medical expenses primarily due to the renegotiation of our management contract for the correctional treatment facility located in the district of columbia  as well as through the negotiation of a national contract with our pharmaceutical provider and reduced reliance on outsourced nursing 

table of contents the operation of the facilities we own carries a higher degree of risk associated with a management contract than the operation of the facilities we manage but do not own because we incur significant capital expenditures to construct or acquire facilities we own 
additionally  correctional and detention facilities have a limited or no alternative use 
therefore  if a management contract is terminated at a facility we own  we continue to incur certain operating expenses  such as real estate taxes  utilities  and insurance  that we would not incur if a management contract was terminated for a managed only facility 
as a result  revenue per compensated man day is typically higher for facilities we own and manage than for managed only facilities 
because we incur higher expenses  such as repairs and maintenance  real estate taxes  and insurance  on the facilities we own and manage  our cost structure for facilities we own and manage is also higher than the cost structure for the managed only facilities 
the following tables display the revenue and expenses per compensated man day for the facilities we own and manage and for the facilities we manage but do not own for the years ended december  owned and managed facilities revenue per compensated man day operating expenses per compensated man day fixed expense variable expense total operating margin per compensated man day operating margin average compensated occupancy managed only facilities revenue per compensated man day operating expenses per compensated man day fixed expense variable expense total operating margin per compensated man day operating margin average compensated occupancy the following discussions under owned and managed facilities and managed only facilities address significant events that impacted our results of operations for the respective periods  and events that will affect our results of operations in the future 
owned and managed facilities on may   we were awarded a contract by the bop to house  federal detainees at our mcrae correctional facility located in mcrae  georgia 
the three year contract  awarded as part of the criminal alien requirement phase ii solicitation  or car ii  also provides for seven one year renewals 
the contract with the bop guarantees at least occupancy on a take or pay basis  and commenced full operations in december total management and other revenue at this facility was million during the year ended december  this facility did not reach an average physical occupancy of until october as a result  during much of  we benefited from a relatively low level of operating expense resulting from lower physical occupancies while 
table of contents generating revenue at the guaranteed occupancy rate 
as of december   the physical occupancy was 
while only million of management and other revenue was generated by this facility during  we incurred million of operating expenses during the year ended december  results for were also favorably impacted by the acquisition  on january   of the crowley county correctional facility  a  bed medium security adult male prison facility located in olney springs  crowley county  colorado 
the facility currently houses inmates from the states of colorado and wyoming 
as part of the transaction  we also assumed a management contract with the state of colorado and entered into a new management contract with the state of wyoming  and took over management of the facility effective january  during the third quarter of  we transferred all of the wisconsin inmates currently housed at our  bed medium security north fork correctional facility located in sayre  oklahoma to our  bed medium security diamondback correctional facility located in watonga  oklahoma in order to satisfy a contractual provision mandated by the state of wisconsin 
as a result of the transfer  north fork correctional facility will remain closed for an indefinite period of time 
we are currently pursuing new management contracts and other opportunities to take advantage of the beds that became available at the north fork correctional facility  but can provide no assurance that we will be successful in doing so 
the operational consolidations did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
however  long term  the consolidation will result in certain operational efficiencies 
additionally  during the second quarter of  the state of wisconsin approved legislation to open various prison facilities owned by the state 
the opening of these facilities is currently expected to lead to a reduction in the number of inmates we house from the state of wisconsin at our diamondback correctional facility and our prairie correctional facility  totaling approximately  inmates at december  however  given the uncertainty regarding the exact timing of the openings  and the extent of wisconsin inmate population growth between now and the time of such openings  it is difficult to estimate the impact on our financial statements 
during march  we entered into an agreement with the state of arizona to manage  arizona inmates 
the contractual agreement represents the first time the state has partnered with us to provide residential services for its inmates 
the contractual terms provide for the out of state management of male  medium security arizona inmates at our diamondback correctional facility 
the contract includes an initial term ending june  to correspond with the arizona fiscal year  and may be renewed by mutual agreement for three consecutive terms of one year each  effective july  through june   subject to availability of appropriated funds 
the arizona department of corrections has informed lawmakers that the first inmates would be transferred to diamondback in mid march  and that the remainder would follow over the next several months 
during october  we entered into a new agreement with hardeman county  tennessee  with respect to the management of up to  medium security inmates from the state of tennessee in the whiteville correctional facility 
total management revenue increased during the year ended december  from the comparable period in by million at this facility 
due to a combination of rate increases and or an increase in population at seven of our facilities  including our  bed central arizona detention center   bed florence correctional center   bed prairie correctional facility   bed san diego correctional facility  bed torrance county detention facility  bed leavenworth detention center  and bed webb county detention center  primarily from the bop  the usms  the ice  and the state of wisconsin in the 
table of contents case of prairie correctional facility  total management and other revenue increased during from by million at these facilities 
during june  we announced our first inmate management contract with the state of alabama to house up to  medium security inmates in our tallahatchie county correctional facility  located in tutwiler  mississippi  under a temporary emergency agreement to provide the state of alabama immediate relief of its overcrowded prison system 
the facility began receiving inmates in july prior to receiving inmates from the state of alabama  this facility was substantially idle 
during january  we received notice from the alabama department of corrections that it would withdraw its inmates housed at the facility 
the alabama department of corrections took custody of all of the inmates previously housed at the facility during the first quarter of based on the terms of the short term contract  alabama compensated us at a guaranteed rate of occupancy of the facility through march  we are currently pursuing new management contracts to utilize the available beds at the tallahatchie county correctional facility  but can provide no assurance that we will be successful 
fixed expenses per compensated man day for our owned and managed facilities decreased from during to during the aforementioned increase in fixed operating expense for salaries and benefits and insurance across the portfolio of facilities we manage  was partially offset by decreases in property tax expenses of million for  compared with  or a decrease of per compensated man day 
the decrease in property tax expense was primarily as the result of a successful settlement during the third quarter of of a property tax dispute at our northeast ohio correctional center 
further  as our occupancy levels increase  we are able to provide the same quality of services without proportionately increasing our staffing levels  resulting in reductions to our fixed expenses per compensation man day 
variable expenses per compensated man day for our owned and managed facilities decreased from during to for the aforementioned decrease in variable expenses for reduced food and medical expenses across the portfolio of facilities we manage was net of an increase in variable expenses for an increase in litigation expenses during compared with of million  or per compensated man day  at certain of our owned facilities for legal proceedings in which we are involved 
the amount of the increase was also due to the settlement during the first quarter of of a number of outstanding legal matters for amounts less than reserves previously established for such matters  which resulted in a reversal of litigation expenses during the first quarter of of million 
during january  we entered into an agreement with the state of vermont to manage up to inmates 
the contractual agreement represents the first time the state of vermont has partnered with the private corrections sector to provide residential services for its inmates 
the contractual terms provide for the out of state management of male  medium security vermont inmates primarily in two of our owned and operated prisons in kentucky  including lee adjustment center in beattyville  and marion adjustment center in st 
mary 
we began receiving inmates from the state of vermont during the first quarter of  and expect this contract to contribute to increased revenue and operating income in managed only facilities during the fourth quarter of  we committed to a plan to terminate a management contract at the southwest indiana regional youth village  a bed juvenile facility located in vincennes  indiana 
during the first quarter of  we entered into a mutual agreement with children and family services corporation  or cfsc  to terminate our management contract at the facility  effective april   prior to the contract s expiration date in in connection with the mutual agreement to 
table of contents terminate the management contract  cfsc also paid in full an outstanding note receivable totaling million  which was previously considered uncollectible and was fully reserved 
on june   we received notice from the mississippi department of corrections terminating our contract to manage the  bed delta correctional facility located in greenwood  mississippi  due to the non appropriation of funds 
we ceased operations of the facility during october however  the state of mississippi agreed to expand our management contract at the wilkinson county correctional facility located in woodville  mississippi to accommodate an additional inmates 
as a result  the results of operations of the delta correctional facility are not reported in discontinued operations 
total management and other revenue at delta correctional facility was million during the year ended december   while we incurred million in operating expenses during the same period 
during july  we renewed our contract with tulsa county  oklahoma for the management of inmates at the david l 
moss criminal justice center 
the contract renewal included an increase in the per diem rate  and also shifted to tulsa county the burden of certain utility expenses  resulting in a modest improvement in profitability for the management of this facility during the year ended december   compared with in november  we announced that the texas department of criminal justice  or tdcj  awarded us new contracts to manage a total of  beds in six state correctional facilities  as part of a procurement re bid process 
the management contracts  all of which became effective january   consist of four jails and two correctional facilities 
based on the tdcj recommendation  we also retained our contract to manage the bed bartlett state jail  but were not awarded the contract to continue managing the  bed sanders estes unit located in venus  texas  which expired january  total management and other revenue at sanders estes unit was million and million  respectively  during the years ended december  and  while we incurred million and million  respectively  in operating expenses during the same period 
while we expect the management of an incremental  beds at these facilities to contribute to additional revenues and operating income during  because the pricing of our bid for the management of these facilities took into consideration the volume of potential business to be generated from such a bid  we currently expect the operating margins on these facilities to be lower than the existing margins from our managed only business 
additionally  we currently house approximately  adult male inmates for the state of florida  correctional privatization commission  or the cpc  at two of our managed only facilities in florida 
our contracts with the cpc expire in june rather than renew the contracts pursuant to their renewal provisions  in september the cpc issued an invitation to negotiate  or itn  that covered substantially all inmates housed in three privately operated prisons located in the state of florida  including one facility managed by another private prison operator 
the cpc recently cancelled the itn 
accordingly  we expect to continue to operate the two florida facilities pursuant to our contracts with the cpc 
however  the cpc is in discussions with the authorities in the state of florida to initiate a new competitive procurement process 
in the event the procurement is initiated  we would be competing with other prison operators who respond to the solicitation  including other private prison operators and  potentially  government operators 
thus  no assurance can be given that we would be awarded any contracts by the cpc to house the inmates subject to our existing contracts or any additional inmates  or that any contracts we obtained would be on terms comparable to our existing contracts 
the failure to obtain contracts from the cpc on terms comparable to our existing contracts could significantly reduce our revenues and operating income and  accordingly  could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows 

table of contents on february   we provided notice to the nevada department of corrections that we do not intend to renew our contract to manage the southern nevada women s correctional center located in las vegas  nevada  upon the expiration of the contract in october total management and other revenue at the this facility was million and million  respectively  during the years ended december  and  while we incurred million and million  respectively  in operating expenses during the same period 
general and administrative expense for the years ended december  and  general and administrative expenses totaled million and million  respectively 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of corporate management salaries and benefits  professional fees and other administrative expenses  and increased from primarily due to an increase in salaries and benefits  combined with an increase in professional services  during compared with these increases were net of a decrease of million incurred in in connection with the implementation of tax strategies to maximize opportunities created by a settlement with the irs with respect to our predecessor s federal income tax return combined with a change in tax law in march we have expanded our infrastructure over the past year to implement and support numerous technology initiatives  to maintain closer relationships with existing and potentially new customers in order to identify their needs  to focus on reducing facility operating expenses  and to comply with increasing corporate governance requirements 
while this is expected to result in an annual increase in general and administrative expense in  we believe our expanded infrastructure and investments in technology will provide long term benefits enabling us to provide enhanced quality service to our customers while creating scalable operating efficiencies 
interest expense  net interest expense was reported net of interest income for the years ended december  and gross interest expense was million and million  respectively  for the years ended december  and gross interest expense is based on outstanding indebtedness  net settlements on certain derivative instruments  and amortization of loan costs and unused credit facility fees 
the decrease in gross interest expense from the prior year was primarily attributable to the refinancing of our senior indebtedness completed on may   which resulted in a decrease in the interest rate spread on our senior bank credit facility and the redemption of a substantial portion of our senior notes 
further  the recapitalization and refinancing transactions completed during the second and third quarters of resulted in the elimination of the regular and contingent interest associated with million of convertible subordinated notes  a further reduction in the interest rate spread on the term portion of our senior bank credit facility  a reduction in the interest rate on our million convertible subordinated notes  and the repayment of the remaining balance of our senior notes  partially offset by additional borrowings used to repurchase and redeem a substantial portion of our preferred stock 
interest expense also decreased due to the termination of an interest rate swap agreement  lower amortization of loan costs  and a lower interest rate environment 
gross interest income was million and million  respectively  for the years ended december  and gross interest income is earned on cash collateral requirements  a direct financing lease  notes receivable and investments of cash and cash equivalents 

table of contents expenses associated with debt refinancing and recapitalization transactions for the years ended december  and  expenses associated with debt refinancing and recapitalization transactions were million and million  respectively 
charges during the third quarter of primarily resulted from the write off of existing deferred loan costs associated with the repayment of the term loan portion of our senior bank credit facility made with proceeds from the issuance of the million senior notes  premiums paid to defease the remaining outstanding senior notes  and certain fees paid to amend the term portion of our senior bank credit facility 
charges during the second quarter of included expenses associated with the tender offer for our series b preferred stock  the redemption of our series a preferred stock  and the write off of existing deferred loan costs associated with the repayment of the term loan portions of our senior bank credit facility made with proceeds from the common stock and note offerings  a tender premium paid to the holders of the senior notes who tendered their notes to us at a price of of par  and fees associated with the modifications to the terms of the million of convertible subordinated notes 
as a result of the early extinguishment of our old senior bank credit facility and the redemption of substantially all of the senior notes in may  we recorded charges of million during the second quarter of  which included the write off of existing deferred loan costs  certain bank fees paid  premiums paid to redeem the senior notes  and certain other costs associated with the refinancing 
change in fair value of derivative instruments on may   million shares of common stock were issued  along with a million subordinated promissory note  in connection with the final settlement of the state court portion of our stockholder litigation settlement 
under the terms of the promissory note  the note and accrued interest were extinguished in june once the average closing price of our common stock exceeded a termination price equal to per share for fifteen consecutive trading days following the note s issuance 
the terms of the note  which allowed the principal balance to fluctuate dependent on the trading price of our common stock  created a derivative instrument that was valued and accounted for under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  or sfas  as amended 
since we had previously reflected the maximum obligation of the contingency associated with the state portion of the stockholder litigation on the balance sheet  the extinguishment of the note in june resulted in a million non cash gain during the second quarter of income tax benefit during the years ended december  and  our financial statements reflected income tax benefits of million and million  respectively 
the income tax benefit during the year ended december  was primarily the result of our reversal of substantially all of the valuation allowance previously established for our deferred tax assets 
deferred income taxes reflect the available net operating losses and the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes 
realization of the future tax benefits related to deferred tax assets is dependent on many factors  including our past earnings history  expected future earnings  the character and jurisdiction of such earnings  unsettled circumstances that  if unfavorably resolved  would adversely affect utilization of our deferred tax assets  carryback and carryforward periods  and tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of realization of a deferred tax asset 
during the three years ended december   we provided a valuation allowance to 
table of contents substantially reserve our deferred tax assets in accordance with sfas as a result  our financial statements did not reflect a provision for income taxes 
however  at december   we concluded that it was more likely than not that substantially all of our deferred tax assets would be realized 
as a result  in accordance with sfas  the valuation allowance applied to such deferred tax assets was reversed 
the removal of the valuation allowance resulted in a significant non cash reduction in income tax expense during the fourth quarter of to the extent no valuation allowance is established for our deferred tax assets  beginning with the first quarter of  our financial statements will reflect a provision for income taxes at the applicable federal and state tax rates on income before taxes  currently estimated to be approximately 
the income tax benefit during the year ended december   primarily resulted from the job creation and worker assistance act of  which was signed into law on march  among other changes  the tax law extended the net operating loss carryback period to five years from two years for net operating losses arising in tax years ending in and  and allows use of net operating loss carrybacks and carryforwards to offset of the alternative minimum tax 
we experienced net operating losses during resulting primarily from the sale of assets at prices below the tax basis of such assets 
under terms of the new law  we utilized certain of these net operating losses to offset taxable income generated in and as a result of this tax law change in  we reported an income tax benefit and claimed a refund of million during the first quarter of  which was received in april on october   we entered into a definitive settlement with the irs in connection with the irs s audit of our predecessor s federal income tax return 
under the terms of the settlement  in consideration for the irs s final determinations with respect to the tax year  in december we paid million in cash to satisfy federal and state taxes and interest 
due to the change in tax law in march  the settlement created an opportunity to utilize any tax losses to claim a refund of a portion of the taxes paid 
we experienced tax losses during primarily resulting from a cumulative effect of accounting change in depreciable lives of property and equipment for tax purposes 
under terms of the new law  we utilized our net operating losses to offset taxable income generated in  which was increased substantially in connection with the settlement with the irs 
as a result of the tax law change in  combined with the adoption of an accounting change in the depreciable lives of certain tax assets  as of december  we claimed an income tax refund of million  which was received during the second quarter of the cumulative effect of accounting change in tax depreciation resulted in the establishment of a significant deferred tax liability for the tax effect of the book over tax basis of certain assets in the creation of such a deferred tax liability  and the significant improvement in our tax position since the original valuation allowance was established to reserve our deferred tax assets  resulted in the reduction of the valuation allowance  generating an income tax benefit of million during the fourth quarter of  as we determined that substantially all of these deferred tax liabilities would be utilized to offset the reversal of deferred tax assets during the net operating loss carryforward periods

our federal customers generated of our total revenue during  compared with during operating expenses totaled million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
salaries and benefits represent the most significant component of fixed operating expenses and was the primary cause of the increase in fixed expenses per compensated man day 
during and  we incurred wage increases due to tight labor markets for correctional officers and benefit increases due to surging healthcare costs 
the increase in salaries and benefits contributed per compensated man day to the increase in fixed expenses per compensated man day from during to during we also experienced a trend of increasing insurance expense during compared with because we are significantly self insured for employee health  workers compensation  and automobile liability insurance  our insurance expense is dependent on claims experience and our ability to control our claims 
our insurance policies contain various deductibles and stop loss amounts intended to limit our exposure for individually significant occurrences 
however  the nature of our self insurance provides little protection for a deterioration in claims experience or increasing employee medical costs in general 
during the first quarter of  we hired a general counsel to manage our existing legal matters and to develop procedures to minimize the incidence of litigation in the future 
we have been able to settle numerous cases on terms we believe are favorable 
however  variable operating expenses included million during  compared with million during  for an overall increase in potential exposure for certain legal proceedings  none of which was individually significant 
this increase of million contributed per compensated man day to the increase in variable expenses per compensated man day from during to during the following tables display the revenue and expenses per compensated man day for the facilities we own and manage and for the facilities we manage but do not own

however  start up expenses were incurred prior to the commencement of the contract  including but not limited to  salaries  utilities  medical and food supplies and clothing  which resulted in additional operating expenses before any revenue was generated  resulting in a reduction in net income during the third and fourth quarters of during  we provided correctional services for the state of wisconsin at four of our facilities

therefore  no further rental revenue was received for these facilities during the year ended december  for the year ended december   rental revenue for these facilities totaled million 
general and administrative expense for the years ended december  and  general and administrative expenses totaled million and million  respectively 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of corporate management salaries and benefits  professional fees and other administrative expenses  and increased from primarily due to an increase in professional fees incurred in connection with the implementation of tax strategies to maximize opportunities created by a change in tax law in march and the aforementioned settlement with the irs with respect to our predecessor s federal income tax return

the decrease in gross interest expense from the prior year is primarily attributable to lower average outstanding indebtedness  the comprehensive refinancing completed on may   which decreased the interest rate spread on the new senior bank credit facility  the termination of the interest rate swap agreement  lower amortization of loan costs  and a lower interest rate environment 
during  we paid down million in total debt through a combination of million in cash generated from asset sales and internally generated cash 
gross interest income was million and million  respectively  for the years ended december  and gross interest income is earned on cash collateral requirements  direct financing 
table of contents leases  notes receivable and investments of cash and cash equivalents

therefore  no interest income was received on this lease during for the year ended december   interest income for this lease totaled million 
expenses associated with debt refinancings as a result of the early extinguishment of the old senior bank credit facility and the redemption of substantially all of our senior notes  we recorded expenses associated with debt refinancings of million for the year ended december   which included the write off of existing deferred loan costs  certain bank fees paid  premiums paid to redeem the senior notes  and certain other costs associated with the refinancing 
change in fair value of derivative instruments in accordance with sfas we have reflected in earnings the change in the estimated fair value of our interest rate swap agreement during the years ended december  and we estimated the fair value of the interest rate swap agreement using option pricing models that value the potential for the interest rate swap agreement to become in the money through changes in interest rates during the remaining term of the agreement 
a negative fair value represented the estimated amount we would have to pay to cancel the contract or transfer it to other parties 
our swap agreement fixed libor at prior to the applicable spread on outstanding balances of at least million through its expiration on december  in accordance with sfas  we recorded a million non cash gain and an million non cash charge  respectively  for the change in fair value of the swap agreement for the years ended december  and these amounts included million for amortization of the transition adjustment  or the cumulative reduction in the fair value of the swap from its inception to the date we adopted sfas on january   during each year 
we were no longer required to maintain the existing interest rate swap agreement due to the early extinguishment of the old senior bank credit facility 
during may  we terminated the swap agreement prior to its expiration at a price of million 
in accordance with sfas  we continued to amortize the unamortized portion of the transition adjustment as a non cash expense through december  the new senior bank credit facility required us to hedge at least million of the term loan portions of the facility within days following the closing of the loan 
in may  we entered into an interest rate cap agreement to fulfill this requirement  capping libor at prior to the applicable spread on outstanding balances of million through the expiration of the cap agreement on may  we paid a premium of million to enter into the interest rate cap agreement 
we expect to amortize this premium as the estimated fair values assigned to each of the hedged interest payments expire throughout the term of the cap agreement  amounting to million in and million in we have met the hedge accounting criteria under sfas and related interpretations in accounting for the interest rate cap agreement 
as a result  the estimated fair value of the interest rate cap agreement of  as of december  was included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheet  and the change in the fair value of the interest rate cap agreement of  during the year ended december  was reported through other comprehensive income in the statement of stockholders equity 
on december   we issued million shares of common stock  along with a million subordinated promissory note  in conjunction with the final settlement of the federal court portion of our stockholder litigation settlement 
under the terms of the promissory note  the note and accrued interest became extinguished in january once the average closing price of the common stock 
table of contents exceeded a termination price equal to per share for fifteen consecutive trading days following the issuance of such note 
the terms of the note  which allowed the principal balance to fluctuate dependent on the trading price of our common stock  created a derivative instrument that was valued and accounted for under the provisions of sfas as a result of the extinguishment  we estimated the fair value of this derivative to approximate the face amount of the note  resulting in an asset being recorded during the fourth quarter of since the estimated fair value of the derivative asset was equal to the face amount of the note as of december   the extinguishment had no financial statement impact in income tax benefit we generated income tax benefits of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in the income tax benefit during the year ended december   primarily resulted from the job creation and worker assistance act of which was signed into law on march  among other changes  the tax law extended the net operating loss carryback period to five years from two years for net operating losses arising in tax years ending in and  and allows use of net operating loss carrybacks and carryforwards to offset of the alternative minimum tax 
we experienced net operating losses during resulting primarily from the sale of assets at prices below the tax basis of such assets

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary market risk exposures are to changes in us interest rates and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates between the us dollar and the british pound 
we are exposed to market risk related to our senior bank credit facility 
the interest on our senior bank credit facility is subject to fluctuations in the market 
we were also exposed to market risk related to our old senior bank credit facility prior to its refinancing in may if the interest rate for our outstanding indebtedness under the old senior bank credit facility and the new senior bank credit facility was basis points higher or lower during the years ended december    and  our interest expense  net of amounts capitalized  would have been increased or decreased by approximately million  million and million  respectively

these instruments generally consist of highly liquid investments with original maturities at the date of purchase of three months or less 
while these investments are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if market interest rates increase  a hypothetical basis point increase or decrease in market interest rates would not materially affect the value of these instruments 
our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk relates to our construction  development and leasing of our agecroft facility located in salford  england  which was sold in april we extended a working capital loan to the operator of this facility  of which we own through a wholly owned subsidiary 
such payments to us are denominated in british pounds rather than the us dollar 
as a result  we bear the risk of fluctuations in the relative exchange rate between the british pound and the us dollar 
at december   the receivables due us and denominated in british pounds totaled million british pounds 
a hypothetical increase in the relative exchange rate would have resulted in an increase of million in the value of these receivables and a corresponding unrealized foreign currency transaction gain  and a hypothetical decrease in the
