critical accounting policies and items affecting comparability quality financial reporting relies on consistent application of company accounting policies that are based on accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the policies discussed below are considered by management to be critical to understanding our financial statements and often require management judgment and estimates regarding matters that are inherently uncertain 
when such judgments and estimates are required  all material developments and resolutions are discussed with our audit committee 
revenue recognition and work in process monster 
our monster division primarily earns revenue from the placement of job postings on the websites within the monster network  access to the monster network s online resume database and other ancillary services 
we recognize revenue at the time that job postings are displayed on the monster network websites 
revenue earned from subscriptions to the monster network s resume database is recognized over the length of the underlying subscriptions  typically one to twelve months 
revenue associated with multiple element contracts is allocated based on the relative fair value of the services included in the contract 
unearned revenues are reported on the balance sheet as deferred revenue 
advertising communications 
our advertising communications division derives revenue for job advertisements placed in newspapers  internet career job boards such as monster and other media  plus associated fees for related services 
revenue is recorded net of media placement costs  which are passed on to the customer 
revenue is generally recognized upon placement date for newspapers and other print and offline media 
online media revenue is recognized when services are purchased 
directional marketing 
our directional marketing division derives revenue from the placement of advertisements in telephone directories yellow pages advertising 
revenue for yellow pages advertisements are recognized on the publications closing dates and are recorded net of publisher advertising costs  which are passed on to the customer 
direct operating costs incurred that relate to future revenue for yellow pages advertisements  are deferred recorded as work in process in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and subsequently charged to expense when the directories are closed for publication and the related commission is recognized as income 
in addition  we earn revenue from mortgage companies  real estate firms and other companies that place advertisements on our online relocation portal  monstermoving 
revenue derived from such advertisements is recognized over the stated terms of fixed contracts  or upon referral to advertisers on our website for performance based contracts 
goodwill and intangibles goodwill represents acquisition costs in excess of the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets of businesses purchased and intangibles consist primarily of the value of client lists  non compete agreements  trademarks and goodwill 
with the exception of goodwill these costs are being amortized over periods ranging from two to thirty years 
in conjunction with our adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  we evaluate our goodwill annually for impairment  or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist 
the determination of whether or not goodwill has become impaired involves a significant level of judgment in the assumptions underlying the approach used to determine the value of the reporting units 
changes in our strategy and or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments and require adjustments to recorded amounts of intangible assets 
in addition  sfas eliminates the amortization of indefinite lived intangible assets 
in connection with our implementation of sfas  we recorded a non cash charge of million  net of tax  at january   which has been reflected in our consolidated statement of operations as a cumulative effect of accounting change for the year ended december  we have adopted a policy to review each reporting unit for impairment using a discounted cash flow approach that uses forward looking information regarding market share  revenues and costs for each reporting unit as well as appropriate discount rates 
as a result  changes in these assumptions and current working capital could materially change the outcome of each reporting unit s fair value determinations in future periods  which could require a further permanent write down of goodwill 
for example  increasing the discount rate that we used in our assessment by would have decreased the fair value of our advertising communications reporting unit below its book value by approximately million  causing us to further evaluate the reporting unit for impairment by determining the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill using further steps provided for under sfas  including the identification of potentially unrecognized intangible assets 
we would then compare such value to the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill 
increasing the discount rate used by would not have indicated impairment in our other reporting units 
a decrease in the discount rate used would have had no effect on our financial statements 
we will continue to evaluate its goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or sooner if indicators of potential impairment exist 
the estimates that we have used are consistent with the plans and estimates that we are using to manage the underlying business 
if we fail to achieve our estimates of market share or if labor markets fail to improve  we may incur further charges for impairment of goodwill 
merger  integration  restructuring and business reorganization and spin off plans we have recorded significant charges and accruals in connection with our merger  integration  restructuring and business reorganization and spin off plans 
these accruals include estimates pertaining to future lease obligations  employee separation costs and the settlements of contractual obligations resulting from our actions 
although we do not anticipate significant changes  the actual costs may differ from these estimates 
contingencies we are subject to legal proceedings  lawsuits and other claims related to labor  service and other matters 
we are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of reserves required  if any  for these contingencies are made after careful analysis of each individual issue 
the required reserves may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach  such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters 
accounts receivable we are required to estimate the collectibility of our trade receivables and notes receivable 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the ultimate realization of these receivables  including the current credit worthiness of our customers 
changes in required reserves may occur due to changing circumstances  including changes in the current market environment or in the particular circumstances of individual customers 
the company assesses the recoverability of accounts receivable by performing a specific account review of significant customer accounts and applying general reserve percentages based on historical collection experience to the remaining population of customer accounts 
the allowance for doubtful accounts approximates of our accounts receivable portfolio as of december  a change in the calculation of bad debt reserves for the year ended december   would have impacted the allowance for doubtful accounts by approximately million 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain statement of operations data and cash flow information in thousands year ended december  statement of operations data revenue monster    advertising communications    directional marketing    total revenue    total operating expenses operating income loss    income loss from continuing operations before accounting change  net income loss    cash flow information cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations  cash used for investing activities of continuing operations  cash provided by used for financing activities of continuing operations cash used for discontinued operations    effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents  constant currencies we define the term constant currency to be a comparison of financial information from period to period that excludes the effect of translating foreign currencies to us dollars at differing exchange rates 
changes in our revenues and core operating expenses  which we identify as salaries and related  office and general and marketing and promotion expenses  include the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates because they are translated at average exchange rates for each period  as required by generally accepted accounting principles 
the company believes that these calculations are a useful measure  providing additional detail about the change in operations from period to period 
earnings from subsidiaries are rarely repatriated to the united states and there are no significant gains or losses on foreign currency transactions between subsidiaries 
therefore  changes in foreign currency exchange rates generally impact only reported earnings and not the company s economic condition

in addition  we introduced new revenue generating services that are vertically compatible with monster 
com and were targeted toward the stronger sectors of the economy  such as the hourly and skilled workforce  government  healthcare and diversity 
in july  we acquired washington dc based quickhire  inc quickhire  which further strengthened our position in the government sector  particularly within the larger agencies of the federal government 
quickhire generated million of revenue for the monster division during the second half of increases in the division s revenue were offset by lower revenue in our european operations  partially due to office closings in scandinavia in the first quarter of also included in the monster division s revenue is million and million for and  respectively  of revenue earned from cross selling with our former staffing division  now the staffing division of hh group 
the monster division s core operating expenses were a lower percentage of revenue in as a result of our reorganization plans and decreased spending on marketing and promotion 
partially offsetting our cost cuts were increased costs to further develop vertical markets  such as government and healthcare  and an increase in our sales staff in the latter part of the year 
in addition  operating margins improved as a result of lower merger  integration  business reorganization and spin off costs 
advertising communications the operating results of our advertising communications division for the years ended december  and are as follows year ended december  increase decrease in thousands revenue    salaries and related  office and general  marketing and promotion amortization of intangibles merger  integration  business reorganization  spin off costs and other special charges    total operating expenses    operating loss    the decrease in advertising communications revenue is primarily related to the global decline in newspaper job placement advertising reflecting the effects of weak economies as well as continuous migration away from traditional recruitment advertising and toward online career solutions 
we saw signs of stability in the division s revenue base near the end of and continue to focus our efforts on selling monster services to clients of our advertising communications division  however we do not anticipate that the print recruitment advertising market will return to its previous levels as we continue to see a migration away from help wanted advertising in newspapers toward online career solutions 
core operating expenses decreased significantly on a constant currency basis in when compared to the prior year period  as we reduced the number of employees in the division and consolidated offices in an effort to bring our cost structure in line with the declining revenue base 
because of the level of uncertainty surrounding a significant rebound in the newspaper help wanted advertising market  we are carefully monitoring the cost structure of our advertising communications division and have focused our attention on additional revenue generating initiatives 
directional marketing the operating results of our directional marketing division for the years ended december  and are as follows year ended december  increase decrease in thousands revenue    salaries and related  office and general  marketing and promotion amortization of intangibles merger  integration  business reorganization  spin off costs and other special charges    total operating expenses    operating income loss directional marketing revenue decreased in  as a result of lower demand for advertising on our monstermoving 
com website  while the yellow pages advertising business was relatively flat compared to the prior year 
although we continued to see pricing pressure on yellow pages advertising commissions by both publishers and our clients  we experienced some relief at the end of the division s operating margins decreased due to higher core operating expense levels related to our yellow pages services as we undertook measures to re engineer the cost and management structure of the division 
in addition to reducing the number of employees in the division and consolidating certain offices  we incurred incremental costs to automate our customer response management system  which is intended to streamline our sales process and order entry system

although our core operating expenses were higher by million in  it was mainly as a result of rising foreign currency exchange rates  particularly the british pound and the euro 
when compared to the prior year  currency translation rates increased our core operating expenses by million 
we devoted significant resources toward bringing our expense levels lower in  as evidenced by the decrease in core operating expenses on a constant currency basis 
the constant currency decrease in core operating expenses was partially offset by higher salaries at the monster division due to additional sales force  the acquisition of quickhire  and higher sales commissions due to stronger sales in the second half of the year 
in addition  re engineering the structure of our directional marketing division had a temporary incremental effect on salaries in the fourth quarter of the increase in office and general expenses in includes a million increase as a result of a weaker us dollar in  investments in new monster services  such as networking and government services  and technology spending in directional marketing  which are all offset by company wide cost cutting efforts 
marketing and promotion in the year ended december  decreased primarily due to the timing of our marketing spending in our monster division 
merger and integration expenses reflect costs incurred as a result of pooling of interests transactions and the planned integration of such companies 
this expense includes office integration costs  the write off of fixed assets that will not be used in the future  separation pay  professional fees  and employee stay bonuses to certain key personnel of the merged companies 
the decrease is a result of the finalization of our exit strategies related to our pooled businesses 
business reorganization and other special charges is comprised of severance and related costs of million  future lease obligations on exited properties of million and million relating to fixed asset write offs for property and equipment  primarily leasehold improvements  computer equipment and software 
in addition  we recorded million for professional fees primarily relating to legal costs in connection with our workforce reduction  and accounting and investment banking fees in connection with the spin off transaction

core operating expenses decreased considerably over the prior year  primarily as a result of the business reorganization that we announced in second and fourth quarters of  offset by the effects of higher currency exchange rates in the period 
as a result of the downturn in our revenue in  we lowered monster s core operating expenses in through reorganization initiatives  which were mainly comprised of workforce reduction and office closings

we have seen the us newspaper help wanted market decline annually since as online alternatives  such as monster  gain an increasing share of the recruitment advertising market 
according to industry statistics  online recruitment has risen from approximately of the total recruitment advertising market in to in as a result of this trend  which we expect to continue  we have diversified our product offerings to include creative services  such as employee communications and retention programs  and other consulting services to corporate human resources departments 
in addition we continually look to leverage our advertising communications sales force as a means of driving business to our monster division  where operating margins are typically higher 
core operating expenses decreased over the prior year  primarily as a result of the business reorganization that we announced in second and fourth quarters of merger and integration costs declined considerably in the period as the majority of our prior year acquisitions exit plans were finalized 
as a result of the downturn in our revenue in  we rationalized our core operating expenses in through reorganization initiatives  which were mainly comprised of workforce reduction and office consolidations

business reorganization and other special charges consisted primarily of a million severance related charge to reduce our workforce  million of costs to close and consolidate offices and million of incremental professional fees related to the reorganization 
also as part of the reorganization plans  we wrote off million of investments in  and loans to businesses that we were no longer pursuing as part of our strategy

our working capital requirements are generally higher in the quarters ending march and september  during which periods the payments to the major yellow page directory publishers are at their highest levels 
in addition  because of our reorganization initiatives  the spin off of hh group  and the integration of prior business acquisitions  we have substantial cash commitments over the next several years 
as of december   we had million of accrued integration and restructuring expenses and business reorganization  spin off and other special charges  of which we estimate that million will be paid over the next twelve months 
historically  we have met our liquidity needs by a funds provided by operating activities  b equity offerings  c short and long term borrowings  d capital equipment leases and e seller financed notes 
we invest our excess cash predominantly in money market funds  overnight deposits  and commercial paper that are highly liquid  of high quality investment grade  and have maturities of less than three months with the intent to make such funds readily available for operating and strategic long term equity investment purposes 
in april  we entered into a new financing arrangement with a syndicate of banks to provide for a million three year secured revolving credit facility 
the secured revolving credit facility replaces our previous financing arrangement and is available for ongoing working capital requirements and other corporate purposes 
under the new credit facility  loans will bear interest based on a variable interest rate related to our choice of the higher of a the prime rate or b the federal funds rate plus of  plus a margin of until the company reports its financials for the quarter ending march  and thereafter the margin will be determined by the ratio of our debt to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda as defined in the revolving credit agreement or the london interbank offered rate libor plus a margin of until the company reports its financials for the quarter ending march  and thereafter the margin will be determined by the ratio of our debt to ebitda as defined in the revolving credit agreement 
on january   we completed the sale of million shares of common stock 
net proceeds from the offering were approximately million  which will be used for general corporate purposes  including working capital  and to acquire or invest in complimentary businesses 
our share repurchase program  which allowed us to purchase up to million shares of common stock on the open market  expired on march  in the third quarter of  we repurchased thousand shares at an average price of per share 
following the spin off  we agreed to pay million per quarter  or a total of million  to reimburse hh group for cash payments related to their accrued integration  restructuring  business reorganization and spin off obligations 
these quarterly payments began in july in addition  we agreed to reimburse hh group for re branding costs  bank fees and other miscellaneous costs  the majority of which were paid in the third quarter of  relating to commitments that existed prior to the spin off 
as of december   our liability to hh group is million  which we anticipate will be fully paid in as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million  compared to million as of december  cash balances as of december   and exclude the effect of million  million  and million  respectively  of outstanding checks in excess of cash balances  which are classified as current liabilities on our balance sheets 
these outstanding checks typically represent publisher payments  payroll and other contractual obligations disbursed on or near the last day of a reporting period 
such payments are disbursed from a financial institution separate from that of our depository accounts 
our net use of cash of million in the year ended december   primarily relates to the operating activities of our discontinued operations  the investing activities of our continuing operations and the financing activities of our continuing operations  which includes million of cash that we funded to hh group in the first quarter of cash used for operating activities in thousands year ended december  cash provided by operating activities  less cash used for operating activities of discontinued operations cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations  cash provided by the operating activities of continuing operations was a result of income from continuing operations  adjusted for million of non cash related items 
in addition  increases in accounts receivable and decreases in accounts payable and accrued expenses were only partially offset by decreases in work in process  prepaid expenses and other 
prepaid expenses were primarily reduced by million of net income tax refunds and the timing of our marketing campaigns in  while deferred revenue and accounts receivable both increased as a result of a stronger us economic environment and a significant increase in the number of sales orders placed with our monster division near the end of the year 
conversely  accounts payable and accrued expenses decreased as we lowered our overall spending 
in addition  we made cash payments of million related to our merger  integration  business reorganization and spin off costs 
accrued expenses contain million relating to our scheduled commitments to hh group as of december  cash used for investing activities in thousands year ended december  cash used for investing activities  less cash used for investing activities of discontinued operations cash used for investing activities of continuing operations  cash used for investing activities includes million of payments for capital expenditures as we continued to invest in technology  but at a significantly lower rate than in the prior year 
the decreased level of capital investment in is largely due to our business reorganization and spin off initiatives  which reduced the need for both workforce related resources and capital investments in real estate 
we made payments of million for purchase acquisitions in  which included amounts paid for the restructuring of previously acquired businesses  our purchase of quickhire  inc  the remaining portion of our joint venture in the asia pacific region india  singapore and hong kong and a regional recruitment advertising firm in the united states 
cash used for financing activities in thousands year ended december  cash used for financing activities  less cash used for financing activities of discontinued operations cash used for financing activities of continuing operations  cash used for financing activities resulted primarily from million of cash that was funded to hh group in connection with our spin off transaction in march of in addition  we made net payments on debt of million 
cash used for financing activities was offset by million of cash received from the exercise of employee stock options 
we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents  revolving credit facility  the net cash proceeds from our january stock offering  and cash we anticipate to generate from operating activities will provide us with sufficient liquidity to satisfy our working capital needs  capital expenditures  investment requirements and commitments through at least the next twelve months 
our cash generated from operating activities is subject to fluctuations in the global economy  unemployment rates and the demand for yellow pages advertising 
we have entered into various commitments that will affect our cash generation capabilities going forward 
these commitments  relating to our continuing operations  as of december  are as follows amounts in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years payable to hudson highland group  inc   borrowings under financing arrangement and other notes payable capital lease obligations operating lease obligations     acquisition notes payable   equity compensation and other long term liabilities   total      net of contractual sublease income
