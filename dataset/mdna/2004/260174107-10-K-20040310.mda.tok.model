impairment in accordance with the provisions of financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we are required to test our goodwill for impairment at least annually 
as a result of our november annual assessment  it was determined that goodwill associated with our acquisition of the grand prix association of long beach  inc grand prix was impaired 
therefore  an impairment charge of  was recorded in the fourth quarter and full year results to adjust goodwill to its fair value 
after recording this charge  the amount of goodwill remaining is  which represents of total assets and of stockholders equity at december  
table of contents the company s investment in cart sanctioned street venues relating to its grand prix events was  as of december  in accordance with the provisions of fasb statement no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  long lived assets other than goodwill are assessed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
to analyze recoverability for assets to be held and used  the company projects undiscounted net future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset over the remaining life of such assets 
if these projected cash flows are less than the carrying value  an impairment loss would be recognized equal to the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the assets 
as a result of this assessment  it was concluded that assets related to the st 
petersburg and denver events were impaired 
therefore  a non cash charge of  was recorded in the fourth quarter to reflect the diminution in value of these assets 
the uncertainty concerning the future of cart and cart s bankruptcy filing on december  contributed substantially to the loss of value 
in addition  the company also recorded an impairment charge of  in the fourth quarter related to equipment that will no longer be used in the normal course of business and is being disposed of 
impact of cart for the year ended december   revenue was  compared with  in the following table displays revenue from cart sanctioned events and all other company events for the last two years change cart events all other events total revenues two of the three cart events in were held early in the year prior to the start of the iraqi war 
we believe that the uncertainty caused by this geopolitical turmoil  together with lower consumer spending and confidence from the effects of the slow economy and the much publicized worsening financial situation at cart  caused a decline in admissions revenue at the long beach event and lower than expected admissions at the inaugural st 
petersburg event 
the continuing uncertainty as to the ongoing viability of cart during also contributed to a significant decline in revenue at our denver event in august the impact of lower revenue at the two existing cart events together with the substantial operating loss at the inaugural st 
petersburg event decreased the operating profit of the company by  from the previous year 
further  the company s  increase in depreciation in was almost exclusively the result of its investments in cart sanctioned events 
the decline in operating results  plus additional depreciation related to our cart sanctioned events  represented  of the company s decrease in earnings in the company is not running events in st 
petersburg or denver in  which had revenue of  and  respectively  in refer to note impairment charges of the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k for additional discussion related to our cart sanctioned events 
all other operations the company s other events recorded a increase in revenues in  which resulted from higher broadcasting fees  partially offset by lower admissions and other revenue 
due to the significant lead time in the industry for sponsors commitments and fans desire to purchase tickets in advance  the sluggish economy in and early negatively affected our sponsorship and admissions revenue 
poor weather on or near the dates of one half of our major events in also impacted admissions  concessions and merchandise sales 
operating and marketing expenses increased by to  in  but actually increased by less than when excluding  of costs associated with the st 
petersburg event which will not occur in 
table of contents sanction fees and purses increased by  in over and was the company s largest cost increase in absolute and relative terms 
nascar s current tv broadcast rights contracts have been reported to contain approximately annual increases in revenue through a portion of the purses related to the events broadcast under this contract also contain similar percentage increases and represented million of the company s year over year change in sanction fees and purses 
sales  marketing and promotion expenses increased by  primarily due to the inaugural st 
petersburg event 
other operating expenses increased by  due to the st 
petersburg event  offset by savings at other major events 
other operating expenses at the st 
petersburg event were  lower labor  hospitality  taxes and other operating expenses at several other major events produced approximately  of savings compared with the prior year 
general and administrative expenses in were lower than in the previous year  principally due to lower wages  utilities  legal claims and other expenses 
wages reflected fewer people than a year earlier and lower commissions 
also  there were no management incentive compensation payments in a decrease in utilities cost reflected internal efficiencies and tighter scrutiny of demand and usage 
legal claims in were generally at a normal level considering the risks and business issues of the company  whereas the prior year s legal costs were above historical levels 
legal costs were approximately  lower in than in offsetting administrative savings in were two areas of expense increases 
a full year of overhead costs at denver and st 
petersburg increased administrative expenses by  and fringe benefits  particularly from our medical program  also increased administrative expenses by  in depreciation and amortization expense increased by  primarily due to an increase in depreciation related to assets acquired for the inaugural grand prix of denver event that occurred in september and the grand prix of st 
petersburg event that occurred in february net interest expense increased by  in due to higher amortization and write off of credit facility fees of  partially offset by less interest expense due to lower outstanding balances under the company s bank credit facility 
although overall short term interest rates declined during the year  the company s effective cost did not decrease at the same rate  as pricing under the former bank facility was increased during the year as a result of amendments to the facility 
interest expense related to the swida bonds was essentially the same in and at  and  respectively 
these bonds contain a fixed rate of interest and the amount outstanding decreased by during the year 
the effective income tax rate was in compared with in the rate was affected principally by the non deductibility of the impairment of goodwill and also by the establishment of a valuation allowance recorded against certain state net operating loss carryforwards 
the rate was also affected by other permanent book vs 
tax differences and the fact that the company paid state income taxes to delaware because of the profitability at dover international speedway 
year ended december  vs 
year ended december  revenues increased by  or  to  primarily the result of increased admissions  broadcast revenue and other event related revenue at dover international speedway s spring and fall nascar weekends  the inaugural grand prix of denver event and the addition of a second busch series event at nashville superspeedway 
the increases in revenues were partially offset by a decline in admissions and other event related revenue at the company s grand prix of long beach event  at the irl and nascar craftsman truck and april busch series events at nashville superspeedway and at the nascar busch series events at gateway and memphis 
operating and marketing expenses increased by  or  in compared with  primarily due to increased purse and sanction fee expenses related to dover international speedway s spring and fall nascar weekends  as well as at the company s other facilities  the nashville superspeedway being operational for all of compared with only nine months for the comparable period of  the addition of a second busch series event at nashville superspeedway in and the inaugural grand prix of denver event in september

the land was subsequently conveyed to gateway in swida filed a petition for writ of certiorari with the united states supreme court  but the writ was denied on october  since all appeal rights were exhausted  capitalized costs of  associated with acquiring the land were charged to expense in the owner of the condemned land indicated that he intended to make a claim for attorney s fees alleged to approximate  in  the company expensed and accrued  for resolution of this matter and for the settlement of another unrelated claim 
the company settled the latter claim in january  and the former claim in june net interest expense increased by  primarily the result of the company capitalizing  of interest related to the construction of major facilities in and the amortization of origination fees related to the company s credit facility entered into in february no interest was capitalized in capitalization of interest on nashville superspeedway ceased when the facility opened in april additionally  the pre spin off capital structure did not include as much indebtedness 
the company s effective income tax rates for and were and  respectively 
the decrease in resulted primarily from net operating losses for state income tax purposes and the adoption of fasb statement no 
which requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized 
in  the company amortized  of goodwill for financial reporting purposes that was not deductible for income tax purposes resulting in a permanent difference that increased the effective tax rate 
these decreases in the effective tax rate were partially offset by the recording of a valuation allowance of  net of federal tax benefit  relating to state net operating loss carry forwards that may expire prior to being realized 
earnings from continuing operations before cumulative effect of accounting change decreased by  primarily the result of the lower revenues at the company s grand prix of long beach event  at the irl and nascar craftsman truck and april busch series events at nashville superspeedway and the nascar busch series events at gateway and memphis  the increased general and administrative expenses and increased interest expense discussed above 
earnings from continuing operations were also negatively impacted by the  write off of deferred costs and an  accrual related to the resolution of the swida matter discussed above and the settlement of another unrelated claim 
the decreases in earnings from continuing operations were offset by an increase in profitability at dover international speedway s spring and fall nascar weekends  the addition of a second busch series event at nashville superspeedway and a decrease in amortization expense of  due to the adoption of fasb statement no 
earnings from discontinued operation net of income taxes were  in compared to  in the company s tax free spin off of its gaming business became effective march  and as a result  earnings from discontinued operation were no longer recognized by the company subsequent to that date

which requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized  but instead be tested at least annually for impairment 
goodwill associated with grand prix  which was acquired through a tax free merger  is not deductible for income tax purposes and represents a permanent difference for which no current or deferred income tax liabilities are recorded 
as such  no income tax benefit was recognized from the impairment write off 
liquidity and capital resources cash flow from continuing operations was positive in despite significant losses because a large proportion of s expenses were non cash  as shown below total operating expenses less non cash expenses impairment charges depreciation amortization and write off of credit facility fees cash operating expenses after reflecting all other changes in working capital and deferred taxes  net cash provided by continuing operations was  in compared with  in the prior year

the terms of the facility contain certain covenants beginning june  that are similar to the former facility  but with different strike points 
the company expects to be in compliance with all covenants through the end of material adverse changes in the company s results of operation would impact its ability to maintain financial ratios necessary to satisfy these requirements

principal payments range from  in september to  in and are payable solely from sales taxes and incremental property taxes generated from the facility 
these bonds are direct obligations of the sports authority and are therefore not recorded on our consolidated balance sheet 
if the sales taxes and incremental property taxes are insufficient for the payment of principal and interest on the bonds  payments would become the responsibility of the company 
in the event the company was unable to make the payments  they would be made pursuant to a  irrevocable direct pay letter of credit issued as part of our bank facility 
the company believes that the sales taxes and incremental property taxes generated from the facility will satisfy the necessary debt service requirements of the bonds

during   was paid by the company into the sales and incremental property tax fund and  was deducted from the fund for debt and interest service 
if the debt service is not satisfied from the sales and incremental property taxes generated from the facility  the bonds would become a liability of the company 
if we fail to maintain the letter of credit that secures the bonds or we allow an uncured event of default to exist under our reimbursement agreement relative to the letter of credit  the bonds would be immediately redeemable

related party transactions during the years ended december   and  gaming allocated corporate costs of   and  respectively  to dvd for certain administrative and operations services  including dvd s use of office space 
the allocation was based on both an allocation to the business that directly incurred the costs and an analysis of each company s share of the costs 
in connection with the company s nascar event weekends  gaming provided certain catering services for which the company was invoiced  the company invoiced gaming  for tickets purchased to the events and other event related items 
as of december  and  dvd s consolidated balance sheet includes a  receivable from and a  payable to gaming for these costs and for other payments made by gaming on dvd s behalf 
the company received payment for the  receivable in the first quarter of the net costs incurred by each company for these services are not necessarily indicative of the costs that would have been incurred if the companies had been separate  independent entities and or had otherwise independently managed these functions  however  management believes that these allocations are reasonable 
during the year ended december   the company purchased certain paving  site work and construction services involving total payments of  from a company wholly owned by melvin joseph  a director 
for the year ended december   the company reported a net operating loss for federal income tax purposes 
the loss was carried back to  a period prior to the spin off  which generated an alternative minimum tax credit carryforward  a portion of which is required to be paid by gaming under the tax sharing agreement see below  therefore  during the fourth quarter of the company recorded a  receivable from gaming for its portion of the carryforward 
we received payment of the amount in the first quarter of during the third quarter of  under the tax sharing agreement  gaming paid the company  for its portion of the consolidated federal income tax liability

the company also leases its principal executive office space from gaming 
various easements and agreements relative to access  utilities and parking have also been entered into between the company and gaming relative to their respective dover  delaware facilities 
in conjunction with the spin off of gaming by the company  the two companies entered into various agreements that addressed the allocation of assets and liabilities between the companies and that define the companies relationship after the separation

in august  certain existing shareholders of the company  including two directors  acquired from the company  shares of its common stock for net proceeds of  the shares of common stock were sold in an unregistered private offering to accredited investors at fair value based on the closing market price of the company s common stock on the day preceding the sale which was per share 
at the date of the acquisition of grand prix   was due to grand prix from certain shareholders officers for outstanding loans made for the purpose of purchasing grand prix common stock 
as of december    was outstanding from a director of the company 
this remaining balance was repaid in full in january critical accounting policies the accounting policies described below are those the company considers critical in preparing its consolidated financial statements 
these policies include significant estimates made by management using information available at the time the estimates are made 
however  as described below  these estimates could change materially if different information or assumptions were used 
the descriptions below are summarized and have been simplified for clarity 
goodwill the company has made acquisitions in the past that included goodwill 
under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america in effect through december   these assets were amortized over their estimated useful lives  and were tested periodically to determine if they were recoverable from operating earnings on an undiscounted basis over their useful lives 
effective january   goodwill is no longer amortized but is subject to an annual or under certain circumstances more frequent impairment test based on its estimated fair value 
estimated fair value is typically less than values based on undiscounted operating earnings because fair value estimates include a discount factor in valuing future cash flows 
we completed our analysis of impairment of our goodwill during the second quarter of  as a result of adopting the transitional provisions of statement no 
 and recorded a non cash charge of  which was recognized as a cumulative effect of an accounting change in the first quarter of the company completed its annual assessment of goodwill in november which resulted in the impairment of  of additional goodwill 
additional impairment losses could be recorded in the future 
there are many assumptions and estimates underlying the determination of this impairment loss 
another estimate using different  but still reasonable  assumptions could produce a significantly different result 
at december   the remaining balance of goodwill is  since the majority of our goodwill is associated with grand prix  which promotes cart sanctioned events  any material adverse events impacting cart could cause additional impairment losses to be recorded in the future 

table of contents income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating losses 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period that includes the enactment date 
the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
currently  the company maintains a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets related to certain state net operating loss carry forwards which increased  in the company has considered ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
in the event the company were to determine that it would be able to realize all or a portion of these deferred tax assets  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase earnings in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should the company determine that it would not be able to realize all or a portion of its remaining deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to earnings in the period such determination was made 
accrued pension cost the benefits provided by the company s defined benefit pension plans are based on years of service and employee s remuneration over their employment with the company 
the company establishes accrued pension costs in accordance with the provisions of fasb statement no 
 employers accounting for pensions 
accrued pension costs are developed using actuarial principles and assumptions which consider a number of factors  including estimates for the discount rate  assumed rate of compensation increase  and expected long term rate of return on assets 
changes in these estimates would impact the amounts that the company records in its consolidated financial statements 
accounts receivable reserves the company provides for losses on accounts receivable based upon their current status  historical experience and management s evaluation of existing economic conditions 
significant changes in customer profitability or general economic conditions may have a significant effect on the company s allowance for doubtful accounts 
property and equipment property and equipment are recorded at cost 
depreciation is provided for financial reporting purposes using the straight line method over estimated useful lives ranging from to years for furniture  fixtures and equipment and up to years for facilities 
these estimates require assumptions that are believed to be reasonable 
long lived assets are evaluated for impairment annually and when an event occurs that indicates an impairment may exist

the private securities litigation reform act of provides a safe harbor for forward looking statements 
to comply with the terms of the safe harbor  we note that a variety of factors could cause our actual results and experience to differ substantially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in our forward looking statements 
when words and expressions such as believes  expects  anticipates  estimates  plans  intends  objectives  goals  aims  projects  forecasts  possible  seeks  may  could  should  might  likely  enable or similar words or expressions are used in this document  as well as statements containing phrases such as in our view  there can be no assurance  although no assurance can be given or there is no way to anticipate with certainty  forward looking statements are being made 
various risks and uncertainties may affect the operation  performance  development and results of our business and could cause future outcomes to differ materially from those set forth in our forward looking statements  including the following factors stability and viability of sanctioning bodies  success of or changes in our growth strategies  development and potential acquisition of new facilities  anticipated trends in the motorsports industry  patron demographics  ability to enter into additional contracts with sponsors  broadcast media and race event sanctioning bodies  relationships with sponsors  general market and economic conditions  including consumer and corporate spending sentiment  ability to finance future business requirements  the availability of adequate levels of insurance  ability to successfully integrate acquired companies and businesses  management retention and development  changes in federal  state and local laws and regulations  including environmental regulations  the effect of weather conditions on outdoor event attendance  military or other government actions  availability of air travel  and national or local catastrophic events 

table of contents we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements as a result of future developments  events or conditions 
new risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for us to predict all such risk factors  nor can we assess the impact of all such risk factors on our business or the extent to which any factor  or combination of factors  may cause actual results to differ significantly from those forecast in any forward looking statements 
given these risks and uncertainties  stockholders should not overly rely or attach undue weight to our forward looking statements as an indication of our actual future results 
our relationships with and the success of various sanctioning bodies is vital to our success in motorsports our continued success in motorsports is dependent upon the success of various governing bodies of motorsports that sanction national racing events and our ability to maintain a good working relationship with these sanctioning bodies  including nascar  cart  irl and nhra 
sanctioning bodies regularly issue and award sanctioned events and their issuance depends  in large part  on maintaining good working relationships with the sanctioning bodies 
many events are sanctioned on an annual basis with no obligation to renew  including our agreements with nascar 
by awarding a sanctioned event or a series of sanctioned events  the sanctioning bodies do not warrant  nor are they responsible for  the financial success of any sanctioned event 
our inability to obtain additional sanctioned events in the future and to maintain sanction agreements at current levels would likely result in lower than anticipated revenues from admissions  sponsorships  hospitality  concessions and merchandise  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  the success of a particular sanctioning body in attracting drivers and teams  signing series sponsors and negotiating favorable television and or radio broadcast rights is largely outside of our control 
as our success depends on the success of each event or series that we are promoting  a material adverse effect on a sanctioning body  such as the loss or defection of top drivers  the loss of significant series sponsors  or the failure to obtain broadcast coverage or to properly advertise the event or series could result in a reduction in our revenues from admissions  sponsorships  hospitality  concessions and merchandise  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
during  the company s operating results and cash flows were negatively impacted by the uncertainties surrounding cart 
cart filed for bankruptcy in and in early  various assets of cart were transferred to owrs  including our sanction agreement with cart relative to the grand prix of long beach event 
owrs is a newly formed private entity and its ability to successfully continue the champ car series cannot be predicted at this time 
we rely on sponsorship contracts to generate revenues we receive a substantial portion of our annual revenues from sponsorship agreements  including the sponsorship of our various events and our permanent venues  such as title  official product and promotional partner sponsorships  billboards  signage and skyboxes 
loss of our title sponsors or other major sponsorship agreements or failure to secure such sponsorship agreements in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our motorsports events face intense competition for attendance  television viewership and sponsorship we compete with other auto speedways for the patronage of motor racing spectators as well as for promotions and sponsorships 
moreover  racing events sanctioned by different organizations are often held on the same dates at different tracks 
the quality of the competition  type of racing event  caliber of the event  sight lines  ticket pricing  location and customer conveniences  among other things  distinguish the motorsports facilities 
in addition  all of our events compete with other sports and recreational events scheduled on the same dates 
as a result  our revenues and operations are affected not only by our ability to compete in the motorsports promotion market  but also by the availability of alternative spectator sports events  forms of entertainment and changing consumer preferences 

table of contents our long beach event depends on city permits and good relationships with city officials in order to conduct the grand prix of long beach  we must obtain an annual permit from the city of long beach to hold the race on city streets 
although grand prix has operated a racing event on the streets of long beach for twenty nine years  there can be no assurance that this event will continue to be held or be successful 
our ability to conduct the grand prix of long beach requires that we maintain excellent relationships with the host city and its officials 
grand prix s ability to meet payment obligations under a loan agreement with an illinois government agency depends on revenues from gateway in order to finance the redevelopment of gateway international raceway  grand prix entered into a loan agreement with the southwest illinois development authority  which agreed to fund a loan to grand prix by issuing municipal bonds in the aggregate principal amount of  the bonds are unconditionally guaranteed by grand prix 
grand prix issued a year  promissory note to swida which bears interest at an effective rate of approximately per annum 
payments on the swida loan are intended to be made primarily from the revenues from the operations of gateway 
although grand prix is current on its obligation and expects to meet its future debt payment obligations out of the revenues from gateway  and although grand prix will receive certain assistance from the city of madison  illinois in the form of a tax increment finance fund which should assist it in meeting its debt burdens  there can be no assurance that earnings from the future operations of gateway will be sufficient to meet grand prix s debt service obligations 
a default under the swida loan could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the sales tax and property tax revenues to service the revenue bonds for infrastructure improvements at nashville may be inadequate in september  the sports authority of the county of wilson tennessee issued  in revenue bonds  of which  was outstanding on december   to build local infrastructure improvements which benefit the operation of nashville superspeedway 
debt service on the bonds is payable solely from sales taxes and incremental property taxes generated from the facility 
as of december  and   and  respectively  was available in the sales and incremental property tax fund maintained by wilson county to pay the remaining principal and interest due under the bonds 
during   was paid by the company into the sales and incremental property tax fund and  was deducted from the fund for debt and interest service 
these bonds are direct obligations of the sports authority and are therefore not recorded on our consolidated balance sheet 
in the event the sales taxes and incremental property taxes are insufficient to cover the payment of principal and interest on the bonds  payments would become the responsibility of the company 
in the event the company was unable to make the payments  they would be made under a  irrevocable direct pay letter of credit issued by several banks pursuant to a reimbursement and security agreement under which we have agreed to reimburse the banks for drawings made under the letter of credit 
such an event could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the seasonality of our motorsports events increases the variability of quarterly earnings our business has been  and is expected to remain  seasonal given that it depends on our outdoor events for a substantial portion of revenues 
we derive a substantial portion of our motorsports revenues from admissions and event related revenue attributable to six nascar sanctioned events at dover  delaware which are currently held in june and september 
this has been offset to some degree by our other motorsports events  but quarterly earnings will vary 

table of contents our insurance may not be adequate to cover catastrophic incidents we maintain insurance policies that provide coverage within limits that are sufficient  in the opinion of management  to protect us from material financial loss incurred in the ordinary course of business 
we also purchase special event insurance for motorsports events to protect against race related liability 
however  there can be no assurance that this insurance will be adequate at all times and in all circumstances 
if we are held liable for damages beyond the scope of our insurance coverage  including punitive damages  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
bad weather can have an adverse financial impact on our motorsports events we sponsor and promote outdoor motorsports events 
weather conditions affect sales of tickets  concessions and souvenirs  among other things at these events 
although we sell many tickets well in advance of the outdoor events and these tickets are issued on a non refundable basis  poor weather conditions may adversely affect additional ticket sales and concessions and souvenir sales  which could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we do not currently maintain weather related insurance for major events 
due to the importance of clear visibility and safe driving conditions to motorsports racing events  outdoor racing events may be significantly affected by weather patterns and seasonal weather changes 
any unanticipated weather changes could impact our ability to stage events 
this could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
postponement and or cancellation of major motorsports events could adversely affect us if one of our events is postponed because of weather or other reasons such as  for example  the general postponement of all major sporting events in this country following the september   terrorism attacks  we could incur increased expenses associated with conducting the rescheduled event  as well as possible decreased revenues from tickets  food  drinks and merchandise at the rescheduled event 
if such an event is cancelled  we could incur the expenses associated with preparing to conduct the event as well as losing the revenues  including live broadcast revenues associated with the event 
if a cancelled event is part of the nascar nextel cup series or nascar busch series  we could experience a reduction in the amount of money received from television revenues for all of our nascar sanctioned events in the series that experienced the cancellation 
this would occur if  as a result of the cancellation  and without regard to whether the cancelled event was scheduled for one of our facilities  nascar experienced a reduction in television revenues greater than the amount scheduled to be paid to the promoter of the cancelled event 
our goodwill may become further impaired in the future and require a write down to comply with accounting standards in june  the fasb issued statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
statement no 
requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized  but instead be tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of statement no 
we adopted the provisions of statement no 
effective january  and as a result recorded a non cash charge of  associated with the goodwill of grand prix as a cumulative effect of accounting change in additionally  the company completed its annual assessment of goodwill in november which resulted in the impairment of  of additional goodwill 
even after these charges   or  of our total assets as of december   consists of goodwill 
if in the future the application of the test for impairment of goodwill results in a reduction in the carrying value of the goodwill  we will be required to record the amount of the reduction in goodwill as a non cash charge against operating earnings which would also reduce our stockholders equity
