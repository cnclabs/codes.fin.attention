item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a participant in the electronics manufacturing services ems industry 
we provide product realization services to original equipment manufacturers  or oems  and other technology companies in the networking datacommunications telecom  medical  industrial commercial  computer and transportation other industries 
we provide advanced electronics design  manufacturing and testing services to our customers with a focus on complex  high technology and high reliability products 
we offer our customers the ability to outsource all stages of product realization  including development and design  materials procurement and management  prototyping and new product introduction  testing  manufacturing  product configuration  logistics and test repair 
the following information should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included herein and the risk factors section beginning on page our customers include both industry leading original equipment manufacturers and technology companies 
due to our focus on serving manufacturers in advanced electronics technology  our business is influenced by major technological trends such as the level and rate of development of telecommunications infrastructure  the expansion of network and internet use  the federal food and drug administration s approval of new medical devices  and the expansion of outsourcing by oem s and technology companies 
we provide most of our contract manufacturing services on a turnkey basis  which means that we procure some or all of the materials required for product assembly 
we provide some services on a consignment basis  which means that the customer supplies materials necessary for product assembly 
turnkey services include material procurement and warehousing  in addition to manufacturing  and involve greater resource investment than consignment services 
other than certain test equipment used for internal manufacturing  we do not design or manufacture our own proprietary products 
executive summary our primary objective at the outset of fiscal was to return the company to profitability 
the restructuring actions of the preceding years had lowered our cost structure and improved capacity utilization 
we also strengthened and reorganized our sales  marketing and business development function to drive sales growth and strengthen our customer portfolio 
as a result of this focus and improved industry demand  especially within the networking datacommunication industry  we achieved fiscal sales growth of percent  without making acquisitions 
we believe this to be the highest organic growth rate within the ems industry 
this growth rate was well above the approximately percent annual growth rate expected by various industry surveys for the broad ems industry  so we believe we have consequently gained market share 
the rapid sales growth in fiscal placed additional strains on the organization  and consequently  gross margins and overall profitability were adversely affected by higher  new program related transition and training expenses  as well as the need to gain experience manufacturing new programs 
year over year  we added and trained approximately  new production related employees at sites located around the world  principally in asia and mexico  in order to support our sales growth 
in addition  we purchased and substantially outfitted a second manufacturing and engineering facility in penang  malaysia penang 
this expansion was driven by additional demand from our customers for more production in this relatively low cost country 
as we look to fiscal  our primary objective is to continue to improve profitability 
we expect to achieve this goal with improvements in capacity utilization and operating efficiencies through a combination of moderate sales expansion and lean manufacturing and inventory management initiatives 
we also recently announced restructuring plans to close our bothell  washington bothell manufacturing and engineering facility in mid fiscal  which we expect will improve overall capacity utilization once the facility is closed 
additionally  we will remain intensely focused on working capital utilization and return on capital employed 
based on customer indications of expected demand and management estimates of new program wins  our internal projections currently anticipate full fiscal sales growth of approximately percent to percent 
we currently expect first quarter of fiscal sales to be in the range of million to million  however  our results will ultimately depend on actual customer order levels 
we anticipate that the initial stages of production in the new facility in penang will impair our overall profitability through at least the first half of fiscal additionally  incremental costs associated with transitioning programs from our recently announced closure of our bothell facility and continued near term weakness at a couple of our sites will also impair our overall profitability in the first half of fiscal facility closures acquisitions in fiscal  we closed our pcb design operations in hillsboro  oregon hillsboro and announced plans to close our bothell facility by the second quarter of fiscal in addition  we sold a small pcb design operations in tel aviv  israel to a group of former employees  however  this transaction did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in fiscal  we closed our manufacturing facilities in san diego  california san diego and richmond  kentucky richmond  and ceased production in our oldest facility in neenah  wisconsin neenah 
in addition  we sold our pcb design operations in nashua  new hampshire to a group of former employees  however  this transaction did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in january  we acquired certain assets of mcms  inc mcms  an electronics manufacturing services provider  for approximately million in cash 
the assets purchased from mcms include manufacturing operations in penang  malaysia  xiamen  china  and nampa  idaho 
the consideration for this acquisition did not include the assumption of any interest bearing debt  but included the assumption of total liabilities of approximately million 
the results from mcms s operations are reflected in our financial statements from the date of acquisition 
no goodwill resulted from this acquisition 
we incurred approximately million of acquisition costs in the second quarter of fiscal associated with the acquisition of mcms 
results of operations net sales 
net sales for the indicated periods were as follows dollars in millions fiscal years ended september  net sales  net sales for the fiscal year ended september  increased percent from the year ended september  the increase reflects strengthened end market demand  particularly in the networking datacommunications  medical and industrial sectors  as well as new program wins from both new and existing customers 
net sales in the computer industry declined to percent of consolidated net sales in fiscal from percent of consolidated net sales in fiscal due primarily to weakened end market demand from two customers 
net sales for the year ended september  decreased percent from the year ended september  our reduced sales reflected the continued slowdown in the technology markets served by plexus  primarily in the network datacommunications telecom  industrial commercial and computer industries 
net sales in fiscal compared to net sales in fiscal were also adversely affected by the loss of the primary customer in our former san diego facility 
the slowdown in the technology markets in fiscal was offset  in part  by increased sales to the medical industry 
the percentages of net sales to customers representing percent or more of sales and net sales to our ten largest customers for the indicated periods were as follows fiscal years ended september  juniper networks siemens top customers represents less than percent of net sales sales to all of our largest customers may vary from time to time depending on the size and timing of program commencement  termination  delays  modifications and transitions 
we remain dependent on continued sales to our significant customers  and we generally do not obtain firm  long term purchase commitments from our customers 
customers forecasts can and do change as a result of their fluctuating end market demand and other factors 
any material change in orders from these major accounts  or other customers  could materially affect our results of operations 
in addition  as our percentage of sales to customers in a specific industry becomes larger relative to other industries as we are currently experiencing significant increases in the networking datacommunications telecom industry  we will become increasingly dependent upon economic and business conditions affecting that industry 
our net sales by industry for the indicated periods were as follows fiscal years ended september  networking datacommunications telecom medical industrial commercial computer transportation other gross profit 
gross profit and gross margins for the indicated periods were as follows dollars in millions fiscal years ended september  gross profit gross margin gross profit for the fiscal year ended september  increased million from the fiscal year ended september   while gross margins increased to percent from percent over this same period 
the improvement in gross profit and gross margin was primarily due to higher net sales and prior year restructuring actions that resulted in enhanced manufacturing capacity utilization and better absorption of fixed manufacturing expenses 
the primary prior year restructuring actions benefiting fiscal gross margins include the san diego and richmond facility closures 
the gross profit and gross margin improvements were somewhat offset  however  by manufacturing inefficiencies related to the start of new programs  higher compensation and benefits costs  including variable incentive compensation  and increased amortization of capitalized costs associated with an enterprise resource planning erp platform 
gross profit for the fiscal year ended september  decreased million from the fiscal year ended september   while gross margins decreased to percent from percent over this same period 
the decline in gross profit and gross margin in fiscal from was due primarily to a slowdown in end market demand  particularly in the networking datacommunications telecom and industrial commercial industries  which resulted in reduced utilization of manufacturing capacity 
gross margins were also impacted by lower product pricing and higher costs incurred to transfer customer programs to other plexus operating sites as a result of closing our san diego and richmond facilities 
gross margins reflect a number of factors that can vary from period to period  including product and service mix  the level of new facility start up costs  inefficiencies attendant the transition of new programs  product life cycles  sales volumes  price erosion within the electronics industry  overall capacity utilization  labor costs and efficiencies  the management of inventories  component pricing and shortages  the mix of turnkey and consignment business  fluctuations and timing of customer orders  changing demand for our customers products and competition within the electronics industry 
additionally  turnkey manufacturing involves the risk of inventory management  and a change in component costs can directly impact average selling prices  gross margins and net sales 
although we focus on expanding gross margins  there can be no assurance that gross margins will not decrease in future periods 
most of the research and development we conduct is paid for by our customers and is therefore included in both sales and cost of sales 
we conduct our own research and development  but that research and development is not specifically identified  and we believe such expenses are less than one percent of our sales 
operating expenses 
selling and administrative s a expenses for the indicated periods were as follows dollars in millions fiscal years ended september  selling and administrative expense percent of sales s a expenses for the fiscal year ended september  increased million from the fiscal year ended september  primarily due to variable incentive compensation expense and additional expenses for information technology systems support related to the implementation of the new erp platform  offset  in part  by million of recoveries of accounts receivable that were either written off or reserved for in prior periods 
in addition  we are currently undergoing a comprehensive effort to comply with section of the sarbanes oxley act of section 
during fiscal  we devoted substantial internal resources in accounting  information technology and legal  supplemented by the use of external consultants  to the section compliance effort 
we anticipate that we will continue to address our section compliance efforts in fiscal primarily through the use of internal resources 
the significant decrease in s a as a percent of net sales was due primarily to the high level of net sales over the prior year 
s a expenses for the fiscal year ended september  decreased million from the fiscal year ended september  primarily due to fiscal restructuring actions and reductions in corporate spending 
these reductions were offset  in part  by approximately million of additional expenses for information technology systems support related to the implementation of the new erp platform 
our erp platform is intended to augment our management information systems and includes various software systems to enhance and standardize our ability to globally translate information from production facilities into operational and financial information and create a consistent set of core business applications at our worldwide facilities 
during fiscal  one additional manufacturing facility was converted to the new erp platform  which in addition to the two manufacturing facilities converted in  results in approximately percent of our net sales being managed on the new platform 
we anticipate converting at least one more facility to the new erp platform in fiscal training and implementation costs are expected to continue over the next few quarters as we make system enhancements and convert an additional facility to the new erp platform 
the conversion timetable and project scope remain subject to change based upon our evolving needs and sales levels 
in addition to s a expenses associated with the new erp system  we continue to incur capital expenditures for hardware  software and certain other costs for testing and installation 
as of september   net property  plant and equipment includes million related to the new erp platform  including million capitalized in fiscal we anticipate incurring at least an additional million of capital expenditures for the erp platform through fiscal fiscal restructuring and impairment actions during fiscal  we recorded pre tax restructuring and impairment costs of million 
the restructuring and impairment costs were primarily associated with recognizing additional lease obligations for two previously abandoned facilities near seattle  washington the seattle facilities  the planned closure of our bothell engineering and manufacturing facility  the write down of certain software components of our erp platform and the consolidation of a satellite pcb design office in hillsboro  oregon into another plexus design office 
the estimated cost for the closure of the seattle facilities was included in our fiscal restructuring actions 
the lease related restructuring costs recorded in fiscal were based on future lease payments subsequent to abandonment  less estimated sublease income 
as of september   the seattle facilities had not been subleased 
based on the remaining term available to lease these facilities and the weaker than expected conditions in the local real estate market  we determined that we would most likely not be able to sublease the seattle facilities 
accordingly  we recorded additional lease related restructuring costs of million in fiscal we also recorded million of lease related restructuring costs on a facility in neenah  which had also been included in restructuring actions in fiscal as part of our efforts to align our service offering with the evolving preferences of our customers  we are in the process of replicating the capabilities of our bothell facility at other plexus design and manufacturing locations that have higher productivity 
we currently anticipate transferring key customer programs from the bothell engineering and manufacturing facility to other plexus locations primarily in the united states 
this restructuring will reduce our manufacturing capacity by  square feet and affect approximately employees 
we currently expect the consolidation efforts will be completed by mid fiscal  subject to customer timelines 
in fiscal  we incurred restructuring and impairment costs related to the bothell closure of million  which consisted of million associated with employee terminations and million associated with fixed asset impairments 
in fiscal  we anticipate the bothell closure will result in additional restructuring costs of approximately million  which will consist of million associated with employee terminations and million associated with the facility lease 
our fiscal restructuring actions  combined with other factors  also led to the establishment of a million valuation allowance on our deferred income tax assets in fiscal see discussion below 
we recorded a million impairment of certain software components of our erp platform  which primarily resulted from a change in our deployment strategy for a shop floor data collection system 
some elements of the shop floor data collection system will not be deployed because the originally anticipated business benefits could not be realized 
the remaining elements of the shop floor data collection system are still under evaluation 
as of september   the capitalized costs of the remaining elements of the shop floor data system totaled approximately million 
a change in the scope of this project could result in impairment of the remaining elements of the shop floor data collection system 
finally  we incurred approximately million of other restructuring and impairment costs in fiscal primarily related to the consolidation of the hillsboro satellite pcb design office into another plexus design office 
the hillsboro related restructuring costs were primarily for employee termination costs and contract termination costs associated with leased facilities and software service providers 
in fiscal  we anticipate incurring an additional million of restructuring costs related to employee relocations 
approximately employees were affected by this restructuring 
fiscal restructuring and impairment actions during fiscal  we recorded pre tax restructuring and impairment costs of million 
these costs resulted from actions taken in response to reductions in our end market demand 
these actions included closing san diego and richmond  the consolidation of several leased facilities  re focusing the pcb design group  a write off of remaining goodwill associated with the acquisition of the san diego facility  the write down of underutilized assets to fair value at several locations  and the costs associated with reductions in work force in several manufacturing  engineering and corporate groups 
these measures were intended to align our capabilities and resources with lower industry demand 
the richmond facility was phased out of operation and sold in september production was shifted to other plexus operating sites in the united states and mexico 
the closure of richmond resulted in a write down of the building  a write down of underutilized assets to fair value  and costs relating to the elimination of the facility s work force 
building impairment charges related to richmond totaled million 
san diego was closed in may the closure of san diego resulted in a write off of remaining goodwill  the write down of underutilized assets to fair value  and costs relating to the elimination of the facility s work force 
building impairment charges totaled million 
during fiscal  goodwill impairment for san diego totaled approximately million  of which million was impaired as a result of a transitional impairment evaluation under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
see discussion below under cumulative effect of a change in accounting for goodwill and million was impaired as a result of our decision to close the facility 
other fiscal year restructuring and impairment actions included the consolidation of several leased facilities  the write down of underutilized assets to fair value and work force reductions  which primarily affected operating sites in juarez  mexico juarez  seattle  neenah  and the united kingdom uk 
restructuring actions also impacted our engineering and corporate organizations 
employee termination and severance costs for fiscal related to the termination of approximately  employees 
fiscal restructuring and impairment actions during fiscal  we recorded pre tax restructuring and impairment costs of million 
these charges resulted from actions taken in response to reductions in sales levels and capacity utilization and included the reduction of our work force and the write off of certain underutilized assets to fair value at several locations 
the employee termination and severance costs for fiscal affected approximately employees 
the operating site closures included two owned facilities one located in neenah the oldest of our four facilities in neenah and the other located in minneapolis  minnesota 
these facilities were no longer adequate to service the needs of our customers and would have required significant investment to upgrade 
the neenah facility was phased out of operation in february and is currently used for warehousing and administrative purposes 
the minneapolis facility was phased out of operation in july and sold in october there was no building impairment charge associated with the closure of these two facilities 
the lease termination costs were primarily related to our facilities in seattle and san diego 
the following table summarizes our restructuring and impairment costs for fiscal  and dollars in thousands fiscal years ended september  non cash impairment costs fixed asset impairment    write off of goodwill  cash restructuring costs severance costs    lease termination costs    total restructuring and impairment costs    as of september   we have a remaining restructuring liability of approximately million  of which million is expected to be paid in fiscal the remaining million of accrued liabilities is expected to be paid through june we currently expect that our fiscal restructuring actions will result  when fully implemented  in annualized cost savings of approximately million million 
however  we currently expect that our operating performance will be impacted in our fiscal first and second quarters as we affect transfers from the bothell facility to other locations 
these savings will primarily benefit cost of sales through lower facilities and employee expenses 
fiscal merger and acquisition activity for the year ended september   we also incurred approximately million of acquisition costs related to the mcms acquisition 
cumulative effect of a change in accounting for goodwill 
we adopted sfas no 
for the accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets as of october  under the transitional provisions of sfas no 
 we identified locations with goodwill  performed impairment tests on the net goodwill and other intangible assets associated with each location using a valuation date as of october   and determined that a pre tax transitional impairment charge of million was required related to the san diego and juarez locations 
the impairment charge was recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting for goodwill in our consolidated statements of operations 
income taxes 
income taxes for the indicated periods were as follows fiscal years ended september  income tax expense benefit effective annual tax rate the increase in income tax expense in fiscal was due primarily to establishing a million valuation allowance on all of our us federal and state deferred income tax assets 
sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  requires that a valuation allowance be provided when it is more likely than not that the related income tax assets will not be utilized 
under sfas no 
 unless specific exceptions apply  historical operating results are a strong indicator of a company s ability to generate future taxable income 
in both fiscal and  we had a net loss 
in fiscal  although we achieved substantial sales growth and gross profit improvement  our fiscal restructuring actions resulted in only nominal operating income  a net loss in the us for income tax purposes and anticipated additional restructuring charges that will be recorded in fiscal consequently  we established a full valuation allowance on our us deferred income tax assets in fiscal although this valuation allowance reduces the carrying value of the net deferred income tax assets on the balance sheet  we may be able to utilize these deferred income tax assets in future profitable periods to reduce future tax obligations 
as a result of the continued availability of these deferred income tax assets  together with tax holidays in asia  and if we are able to achieve our current profitability estimates  our effective tax rate for fiscal would be approximately percent to percent 
the effective income tax rate increased to percent in fiscal compared to percent in fiscal primarily due to the valuation allowance 
the effective income tax rate increased to percent in fiscal compared to percent in fiscal the increase in the effective tax rate was due primarily to the absence in fiscal of non deductible goodwill amortization expenses that were present in fiscal as of september  and  we had recorded net deferred income tax assets of million and million  respectively 
the net deferred income tax assets have arisen from available income tax losses and future income tax deductions 
our ability to use these income tax losses and future income tax deductions is dependent upon our future operations in the tax jurisdictions in which such losses or deductions arose 
the decrease in deferred income tax assets in fiscal is due primarily to our recording of a million valuation allowance as described above and the receipt of tax refunds 
the deferred income tax assets that remain as of september  represent foreign deferred income tax assets for which realization is considered more likely than not 
in october  the working families tax relief act of and the american jobs creation act of became law in the us this legislation provides for a number of changes in us tax laws 
in accordance with sfas no 
 effects of this new legislation will be reflected in our financial statements beginning in the period of the law s enactment in october we are presently reviewing this new legislation to determine the impacts on plexus and our operations 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows used in operating activities were million for the year ended september   compared to cash flows used in operating activities of and cash flows provided by operating activities of million for the years ended september  and  respectively 
during fiscal  cash used in operating activities was primarily driven by increased accounts receivable and inventory in support of higher sales  which were offset in part by higher earnings  after adjusting for the non cash effect of depreciation and amortization  and the decrease in the deferred income tax assets  which primarily represented the establishment of a valuation allowance  and the receipt of tax refunds 
our actual days sales outstanding in accounts receivable for the fiscal year ended september  increased to days in comparison to days for the prior year  primarily as a result of a higher percentage of fourth quarter net sales being recognized in the final month of fiscal as compared to the final month of fiscal during fiscal  the allowance for losses on accounts receivable decreased million  primarily as a result of a combination of collections and write offs of accounts receivable that were reserved for in prior periods 
our inventory turns decreased to turns for the year ended september  from turns for the year ended september  inventories increased million from september   primarily for the purchase of raw materials to support increased sales and the build up of finished goods to support certain vendor managed inventory programs  all of which had a negative impact on inventory turns 
cash flows used in investing activities totaled million for the year ended september  the primary uses were purchases of property  plant and equipment  offset by sales and maturities of short term investments 
we utilized available cash  a revolving credit facility and operating leases to fund our operating requirements during fiscal our capital expenditures for fiscal were approximately million 
our level of capital expenditures for fiscal will be dependent on anticipated sales levels  but we expect them to be in the range of million to million 
cash flows provided by financing activities  totaling million for the year ended september   primarily represent proceeds from stock issuances under our employee stock purchase plan and the exercise of stock options  offset by payments on capital lease obligations 
our secured revolving credit facility  as amended the amended secured credit facility  allows us to borrow up to million from a group of banks 
borrowing under the amended secured credit facility may be either through revolving or swing loans or letters of credit 
the amended secured credit facility is secured by substantially all of our domestic working capital assets and a pledge of percent of the stock of each of our foreign subsidiaries 
interest on borrowings varies with our total leverage ratio  as defined in our credit agreement  and begins at the prime rate as defined or libor plus percent 
we also are required to pay an annual commitment fee of percent of the unused credit commitment 
the amended secured credit facility matures on october  and includes certain financial covenants customary in agreements of this type 
these covenants include a minimum adjusted ebitda  a maximum total leverage ratio not to exceed times adjusted ebitda and a minimum tangible net worth  all as defined in the agreement 
we believe that our amended secured credit facility  leasing capabilities and cash and short term investments should be sufficient to meet our working capital and fixed capital requirements  as noted above  through fiscal however  the growth anticipated for fiscal may increase our working capital needs 
as those needs increase  we may need to arrange additional debt or equity financing 
we therefore evaluate and consider from time to time various financing alternatives to supplement our capital resources 
however  we cannot be sure that we will be able to make any such arrangements on acceptable terms 
we have not paid cash dividends in the past and do not anticipate paying them in the foreseeable future 
we anticipate using any earnings to support our business 
contractual obligations  commitments and off balance sheet obligations our disclosures regarding contractual obligations and commercial commitments are located in various parts of our regulatory filings 
information in the following table provides a summary of our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of september  in thousands payments due by fiscal period and contractual obligations total thereafter long term debt obligations capital lease obligations      operating lease obligations      purchase obligations   other long term liabilities on the balance sheet      other long term liabilities not on the balance sheet  total contractual cash obligations      as of september   operating lease obligations include future payments totaling million related to lease exit costs that are included in other long term liabilities on the balance sheet 
the lease exit costs were accrued as a restructuring cost 
as of september   purchase obligations consist of purchases of inventory and equipment in the ordinary course of business 
as of september   other long term obligations on the balance sheet include deferred compensation obligations to certain of our former executives  executive officers and other key employees and restructuring obligations for both employee terminations and lease exit costs 
as of september   other long term obligations not on the balance sheet consist of a salary commitment to an officer of the company under an employment agreement 
we did not have  and were not subject to  any lines of credit  standby letters of credit  guarantees  standby repurchase obligations  or other commercial commitments 
disclosure about critical accounting policies our accounting policies are disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
during the year ended september   there were no material changes to these policies 
our more critical accounting policies are as follows impairment of long lived assets we review property  plant and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of property  plant and equipment is measured by comparing its carrying value to the projected cash flows that the property  plant and equipment are expected to generate 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying value of the property exceeds its fair market value 
the impairment analysis is based on significant assumptions of future results made by management  including sales and cash flow projections 
circumstances that may lead to impairment of property  plant and equipment include reductions in anticipated future performance of the asset  or industry demand  and the restructuring of our operations 
intangible assets we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets effective october  under sfas no 
 beginning october   we no longer amortize goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives  but  instead  test those assets for impairment at least annually with any related losses recognized in earnings when incurred 
we perform goodwill impairment tests annually during the third quarter of each fiscal year and more frequently if an event or circumstance indicates that an impairment loss has occurred 
we measure the recoverability of goodwill under the annual impairment test by comparing a reporting unit s carrying amount  including goodwill  to the estimated fair market value of the reporting unit based on projected discounted future cash flows 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  goodwill is considered impaired and a second test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
revenue net sales from manufacturing services is generally recognized upon shipment of the manufactured product to our customers  under contractual terms  which are generally fob shipping point 
upon shipment  title transfers and the customer assumes risks and rewards of ownership of the product 
generally  there are no formal customer acceptance requirements or further obligations related to manufacturing services  if such requirements or obligations exist  then a sale is recognized at the time when such requirements are completed and such obligations fulfilled 
nets sales from engineering design and development services  which are generally performed under contracts of twelve months or less in duration  are recognized as costs are incurred utilizing the percentage of completion method  any losses are recognized when anticipated 
net sales from engineering design and development services were less than ten percent of total sales for each of fiscal year  and sales are recorded net of estimated returns of manufactured product based on management s analysis of historical returns  current economic trends and changes in customer demand 
net sales also include amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling 
the corresponding shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales 
restructuring costs from fiscal through fiscal  we recorded restructuring costs in response to reductions in sales and reduced capacity utilization 
these restructuring costs included employee severance and benefit costs  and costs related to plant closings  including leased facilities that will be abandoned and subleased  as applicable 
prior to january   severance and benefit costs were recorded in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf and for leased facilities that were abandoned and subleased  the estimated lease loss was accrued for future remaining lease payments subsequent to abandonment  less any estimated sublease income 
as of september   the significant facilities which we plan to sublease had not yet been subleased  and  accordingly  certain of our estimates of expected sublease income were changed to reflect factors that affect our ability to sublease those facilities such as general economic conditions and the local real estate markets 
changes in certain of our estimates of sublease income resulted in additional restructuring costs in fiscal further changes in certain other estimates of sublease income could result in additional restructuring costs 
subsequent to december   costs associated with a restructuring activity are recorded in compliance with sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
the timing and related recognition of recording severance and benefit costs that are not presumed to be an ongoing benefit as defined in sfas no 
 depends on whether employees are required to render service until they are terminated in order to receive the termination benefits and  if so  whether employees will be retained to render service beyond a minimum retention period 
during fiscal  we concluded that we had a substantive severance plan based upon our past severance practices  therefore  we recorded certain severance and benefit costs in accordance with sfas no 
 employer s accounting for postemployment benefits  which resulted in the recognition of a liability as the severance and benefit costs arose from an existing condition or situation and the payment was both probable and reasonably estimated 
for leased facilities being abandoned and subleased  a liability is recognized and measured at fair value for the future remaining lease payments subsequent to abandonment  less any estimated sublease income that could be reasonably obtained for the property 
for contract termination costs  including costs that will continue to be incurred under a contract for its remaining term without economic benefit to the entity  a liability for future remaining payments under the contract is recognized and measured at its fair value 
see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the recognition of restructuring costs requires that we make certain judgments and estimates regarding the nature  timing and amount of costs associated with the planned exit activity 
if our actual results in exiting these facilities differ from our estimates and assumptions  we may be required to revise the estimates of future liabilities  requiring the recording of additional restructuring costs or the reduction of liabilities already recorded 
at the end of each reporting period  we evaluate the remaining accrued balances to ensure that no excess accruals are retained  no additional accruals are required and the utilization of the provisions are for their intended purpose in accordance with developed exit plans 
income taxes deferred income taxes are provided for differences between the bases of assets and liabilities for financial and income tax reporting purposes 
the company records a valuation allowance against deferred income tax assets when management believes it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized 
realization of deferred income tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income 
during fiscal  we recorded a million valuation allowance against all us deferred income tax assets 
see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
new accounting pronouncements in november  the eitf reached a consensus regarding eitf issue  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
the consensus addresses not only when and how an arrangement involving multiple deliverables should be divided into separate units of accounting but also how the arrangement s consideration should be allocated among separate units 
the pronouncement was effective for us commencing with our first quarter of fiscal  but did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of arb no 
 which provides guidance on the identification of and reporting for variable interest entities 
in december  the fasb issued a revised interpretation no 
 which expands the criteria for consideration in determining whether a variable interest entity should be consolidated 
interpretation no 
became effective for us in the second quarter of fiscal our adoption of interpretation no 
did not have an impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity  which establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
financial instruments that are within the scope of the statement  which previously were often classified as equity  must now be classified as liabilities 
in november  fasb staff position no 
sfas deferred indefinitely the effective date of sfas no 
for applying the provisions of the statement for certain mandatorily redeemable non controlling interests 
however  expanded disclosures are required during the deferral period 
the company does not have financial instruments with mandatorily redeemable non controlling interests 
in december  the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition  which supercedes sab  revenue recognition in financial statements 
sab s primary purpose is to rescind accounting guidance contained in sab related to multiple element revenue arrangements  superceded as a result of the issuance eitf  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
additionally  sab rescinds the sec s revenue recognition in financial statements frequently asked questions and answers document issued with sab that had been codified in sec topic  revenue recognition 
the adoption of this bulletin did not have an impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position 
risk factors our customer requirements and operating results vary significantly from quarter to quarter  which could negatively impact the price of our common stock 
our quarterly and annual results and share price may vary significantly depending on various factors  many of which are beyond our control 
these factors include the volume of customer orders relative to our capacity the level and timing of customer orders  particularly in light of the fact that some of our customers release a significant percentage of their orders during the last few weeks of a quarter the typical short life cycle of our customers products market acceptance of and demand for our customers products customer announcements of operating results and business conditions changes in our sales mix to our customers business conditions in our customers industries the timing of our expenditures in anticipation of future orders our effectiveness in managing manufacturing processes changes in cost and availability of labor and components local events that may affect our production volume  such as local holidays credit ratings and securities analysts reports and changes in economic conditions and world events 
the ems industry is impacted by the state of the us and global economies and world events 
a slowdown or flat performance in the us or global economies  or in particular in the industries served by us  may result in our customers reducing their forecasts 
the demand for our services could weaken or decrease  which in turn would impact our sales  capacity utilization  margins and results 
our sales were adversely affected in fiscal and by the slowdown in the networking datacommunications telecom and industrial commercial markets  as a result of reduced end market demand and reduced availability of venture capital to fund existing and emerging technologies 
these factors substantially influenced our net sales and margins 
the percentage of our sales to customers in the networking datacommunications telecom industry has increased significantly in recent quarters both in dollars and as a percentage of our net sales 
when an increasing percentage of our net sales is made to customers in a particular industry  we become more dependent upon the performance of that industry and the economic and business conditions that affect it 
our quarterly and annual results are affected by the level and timing of customer orders  fluctuations in material costs and availabilities  and the degree of capacity utilization in the manufacturing process 
the majority of our sales come from a relatively small number of customers and if we lose any of these customers  our sales and operating results could decline significantly 
sales to our largest customer represented percent of our net sales in fiscal a different customer represented percent of our net sales in fiscal we had no customers that represented percent or more in fiscal sales to our ten largest customers have represented a majority  or near majority  of our net sales in recent periods 
our ten largest customers accounted for approximately percent  percent and percent of our net sales for the years ended september   and  respectively 
our principal customers have varied from year to year  and our principal customers may not continue to purchase services from us at current levels  if at all 
significant reductions in sales to any of these customers  or the loss of major customers  could seriously harm our business 
if we are not able to replace expired  canceled or reduced contracts with new business on a timely basis  our sales will decrease 
our customers may cancel their orders  change production quantities or delay production 
electronics manufacturing service providers must provide rapid product turnaround for their customers 
we generally do not obtain firm  long term purchase commitments from our customers  and we continue to experience reduced lead times in customer orders 
customers may cancel their orders  change production quantities or delay production for a number of reasons that are beyond our control 
the success of our customers products in the market and the strength of the markets themselves affect our business 
cancellations  reductions or delays by a significant customer or by a group of customers could seriously harm our operating results 
such cancellations  reductions or delays have occurred and may continue to occur 
in addition  we make significant decisions  including determining the levels of business that we will seek and accept  production schedules  component procurement commitments  facility requirements  personnel needs and other resource requirements  based on our estimates of customer requirements 
the short term nature of our customers commitments and the possibility of rapid changes in demand for their products reduce our ability to accurately estimate the future requirements of those customers 
because many of our costs and operating expenses are relatively fixed  a reduction in customer demand can harm our gross margins and operating results 
customers may require rapid increases in production  which can stress our resources and reduce operating margins 
although we have had a net increase in our manufacturing capacity over the past few fiscal years  we have significantly reduced our capacity from its peak  and we may not have sufficient capacity at any given time to meet all of our customers demands or to meet the requirements of a specific program 
failure to manage contraction and growth  if any  may seriously harm our business 
periods of contraction or reduced sales  such as the periods that occurred from fiscal through  create tensions and challenges 
we must determine whether all facilities remain productive  determine whether staffing levels need to be reduced  and determine how to respond to changing levels of customer demand 
while maintaining multiple facilities or higher levels of employment increases short term costs  reductions in employment could impair our ability to respond to later market improvements or to maintain customer relationships 
our decisions to reduce costs and capacity  such as the recent announcement to close the bothell facility in fiscal and the fiscal year closures of our san diego and richmond facilities and the reduction in the number of employees  can affect our expenses  and therefore our short term and long term results 
we have announced our intention to close our bothell  washington facility in fiscal the exact timing of that closure will depend upon the arrangements for transitioning customer programs 
although we work to minimize the potential effects of any such transition  there are inherent risks that such a transition can result in the disruption of programs and customer relationships 
we are involved in a multi year project to install a common erp platform and associated information systems 
our erp platform is intended to augment our management information systems and includes various software systems to enhance and standardize our ability to globally translate information from production facilities into operational and financial information and create a consistent set of core business applications at our worldwide facilities 
as of september   facilities generating approximately percent of our net sales are being managed on the new platform 
we anticipate converting at least one more facility to the new erp platform in fiscal the conversion timetable and project scope remain subject to change based upon our evolving needs and sales levels 
during fiscal  we recorded a million impairment of certain components of our erp platform  which primarily resulted from a change in our deployment strategy for a shop floor data collection system 
some elements of the shop floor data collection system will not be deployed because the originally anticipated business benefits could not be realized 
the remaining elements of the shop floor data collection system are still under evaluation 
as of september   the capitalized costs of the remaining elements of the shop floor data system total approximately million 
a change in the scope of this project could result in impairment of the remaining elements of the shop floor data collection system  as of september   overall erp implementation costs included in net property  plant and equipment totaled million and we anticipate incurring at least an additional million in capital expenditures for the erp platform through fiscal  changes in the scope of the erp platform could result in impairment of these capitalized costs 
due to recent rapid sales growth in fiscal  we have experienced a significant need for additional employees and facilities 
we have added many employees around the world  and we are expanding our operations in penang  malaysia 
our response to these changes in business conditions in fiscal  compared to the two previous fiscal years  has resulted in additional costs to support our growth 
if we are unable to manage this growth and any future growth effectively  our operating results could be harmed 
operating in foreign countries exposes us to increased risks 
we have operations in china  malaysia  mexico and the united kingdom 
as noted above  we have expanded our operations in malaysia  and we may in the future expand in these and or into other international regions 
we have limited experience in managing geographically dispersed operations in these countries 
we also purchase a significant number of components manufactured in foreign countries 
because of these international aspects of our operations  we are subject to the following risks that could materially impact our operating results economic or political instability transportation delays or interruptions and other effects of less developed infrastructure in many countries foreign exchange rate fluctuations utilization of different systems and equipment difficulties in staffing and managing foreign personnel and diverse cultures and the effects of international political developments 
in addition  changes in policies by the us or foreign governments could negatively affect our operating results due to changes in duties  tariffs  taxes or limitations on currency or fund transfers 
for example  our mexican based operation utilizes the maquiladora program  which provides reduced tariffs and eases import regulations  and we could be adversely affected by changes in that program 
also  the malaysian and chinese subsidiaries currently receive favorable tax treatments from these governments for approximately years and years  respectively  which may or may not be renewed 
we may not be able to maintain our engineering  technological and manufacturing process expertise 
the markets for our manufacturing and engineering services are characterized by rapidly changing technology and evolving process development 
the continued success of our business will depend upon our ability to retain our qualified engineering and technical personnel maintain and enhance our technological capabilities develop and market manufacturing services which meet changing customer needs successfully anticipate or respond to technological changes in manufacturing processes on a cost effective and timely basis 
although we believe that our operations utilize the assembly and testing technologies  equipment and processes that are currently required by our customers  we cannot be certain that we will develop the capabilities required by our customers in the future 
the emergence of new technology industry standards or customer requirements may render our equipment  inventory or processes obsolete or noncompetitive 
in addition  we may have to acquire new assembly and testing technologies and equipment to remain competitive 
the acquisition and implementation of new technologies and equipment may require significant expense or capital investment that could reduce our operating margins and our operating results 
our failure to anticipate and adapt to our customers changing technological needs and requirements could have an adverse effect on our business 
our manufacturing services involve inventory risk 
most of our contract manufacturing services are provided on a turnkey basis  where we purchase some or all of the required materials 
these services involve greater resource investment and inventory risk than consignment services  where the customer provides these materials 
accordingly  various component price increases and inventory obsolescence could adversely affect our selling price  gross margins and operating results 
in our turnkey operations  we need to order parts and supplies based on customer forecasts  which may be for a larger quantity of product than is included in the firm orders ultimately received from those customers 
for example  fiscal saw a significant increase in inventories to support increased sales and expected growth in customer programs 
customers cancellation or reduction of orders can result in additional expense to us 
while most of our customer agreements include provisions that require customers to reimburse us for excess inventory specifically ordered to meet their forecasts  we may not actually be reimbursed or be able to collect on these obligations 
in that case  we could have excess inventory and or cancellation or return charges from our suppliers 
in addition  we provide a managed inventory program under which we hold and manage finished goods inventory for some of our key customers 
the managed inventory program may result in higher finished goods inventory levels  further reduce our inventory turns and increase our financial risk with such customers  although our customers will have contractual obligations to purchase the inventory from us 
we may not be able to obtain raw materials or components for our assemblies on a timely basis or at all 
we rely on a limited number of suppliers for many components used in the assembly process 
we do not have any long term supply agreements 
at various times  there have been shortages of some of the electronic components that we use  and suppliers of some components have lacked sufficient capacity to meet the demand for these components 
at times  component shortages have been prevalent in our industry  and in certain areas recur from time to time 
in some cases  supply shortages and delays in deliveries of particular components have resulted in curtailed production  or delays in production  of assemblies using that component  which contributed to an increase in our inventory levels 
we expect that shortages and delays in deliveries of some components will continue from time to time  especially as demand for those components increases 
an increase in economic activity could result in shortages  if manufacturers of components do not adequately anticipate the increased orders and or have previously excessively cut back their production capability in view of reduced activity in recent years 
world events  such as terrorism  armed conflict and epidemics  also could affect supply chains 
if we are unable to obtain sufficient components on a timely basis  we may experience manufacturing and shipping delays  which could harm our relationships with customers and reduce our sales 
a significant portion of our sales is derived from turnkey manufacturing in which we provide materials procurement 
while most of our customer contracts permit quarterly or other periodic adjustments to pricing based on decreases and increases in component prices and other factors  we typically bear the risk of component price increases that occur between any such repricings or  if such repricing is not permitted  during the balance of the term of the particular customer contract 
accordingly  component price increases could adversely affect our operating results 
start up costs and inefficiencies related to new or transferred programs can adversely affect our operating results 
start up costs  the management of labor and equipment resources in connection with the establishment of new programs and new customer relationships  and the need to estimate required resources in advance can adversely affect our gross margins and operating results 
these factors are particularly evident in the early stages of the life cycle of new products and new programs or program transfers 
the effects of these start up costs and inefficiencies can also occur when we open new facilities  such as our additional facility in penang  malaysia  which began production in the first quarter of fiscal these factors also affect our ability to efficiently use labor and equipment 
due to the improved economy and our increased marketing efforts  we are currently managing a number of new programs 
consequently  our exposure to these factors has increased 
in addition  if any of these new programs or new customer relationships were terminated  our operating results could be harmed  particularly in the short term 
we are subject to extensive government regulations 
we are also subject to environmental regulations relating to the use  storage  discharge  recycling and disposal of hazardous chemicals used in our manufacturing process 
if we fail to comply with present and future regulations  we could be subject to future liabilities or the suspension of business 
these regulations could restrict our ability to expand our facilities or require us to acquire costly equipment or incur significant expense 
while we are not currently aware of any material violations  we may have to spend funds to comply with present and future regulations or be required to perform site remediation 
in addition  our medical device business  which represented approximately percent of our net sales in fiscal  is subject to substantial government regulation  primarily from the federal fda and similar regulatory bodies in other countries 
we must comply with statutes and regulations covering the design  development  testing  manufacturing and labeling of medical devices and the reporting of certain information regarding their safety 
failure to comply with these rules can result in  among other things  our and our customers being subject to fines  injunctions  civil penalties  criminal prosecution  recall or seizure of devices  or total or partial suspension of production 
the fda also has the authority to require repair or replacement of equipment  or refund of the cost of a device manufactured or distributed by our customers 
violations may lead to penalties or shutdowns of a program or a facility 
in addition  failure or noncompliance could have an adverse effect on our reputation 
in recent periods  our sales related to the defense industry  including homeland security  have begun to increase 
companies that design and manufacture for this industry face governmental and other requirements that could materially affect their financial condition and results of operations 
products we manufacture may contain design or manufacturing defects that could result in reduced demand for our services and liability claims against us 
we manufacture products to our customers specifications that are highly complex and may at times contain design or manufacturing defects 
defects have been discovered in products we manufactured in the past and  despite our quality control and quality assurance efforts  defects may occur in the future 
defects in the products we manufacture  whether caused by a design  manufacturing or component defects  may result in delayed shipments to customers or reduced or cancelled customer orders 
if these defects occur in large quantities or too frequently  our business reputation may also be tarnished 
in addition  these defects may result in liability claims against us 
even if customers are responsible for the defects  they may or may not be able to assume responsibility for any costs or payments 
our products are for the electronics industry  which produces technologically advanced products with short life cycles 
factors affecting the electronics industry  in particular the short life cycle of products  could seriously harm our customers and  as a result  us 
these factors include the inability of our customers to adapt to rapidly changing technology and evolving industry standards that result in short product life cycles the inability of our customers to develop and market their products  some of which are new and untested the potential that our customers products may become obsolete or the failure of our customers products to gain widespread commercial acceptance 
our business in the networking datacommunication telecom industry could be slowed by further government regulation of the communications industry 
the end markets for most of our customers in the networking datacommunication telecom industry are subject to regulation by the federal communications commission  as well as by various state agencies 
the policies of these agencies can directly affect both the near term and long term profitability of the industry and therefore directly impact the demand for products that we manufacture 
increased competition may result in decreased demand or prices for our services 
the electronics manufacturing services industry is highly competitive and has become more so as a result of excess capacity in the industry 
we compete against numerous us and foreign electronics manufacturing services providers with global operations  as well as those who operate on a local or regional basis 
in addition  current and prospective customers continually evaluate the merits of manufacturing products internally 
consolidations and other changes in the electronics manufacturing services industry result in a continually changing competitive landscape 
the consolidation trend in the industry also results in larger and more geographically diverse competitors that may have significantly greater resources with which to compete against us 
some of our competitors have substantially greater managerial  manufacturing  engineering  technical  financial  systems  sales and marketing resources than we do 
these competitors may respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies have greater name recognition  critical mass and geographic and market presence be better able to take advantage of acquisition opportunities adapt more quickly to changes in customer requirements devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of their services be better positioned to compete on price for their services 
we may be operating at a cost disadvantage compared to manufacturers who have greater direct buying power from component suppliers  distributors and raw material suppliers or who have lower cost structures 
as a result  competitors may have a competitive advantage and obtain business from our customers 
our manufacturing processes are generally not subject to significant proprietary protection  and companies with greater resources or a greater market presence may enter our market or increase their competition with us 
increased competition could result in price reductions  reduced sales and margins or loss of market share 
we depend on certain key personnel  and the loss of key personnel may harm our business 
our success depends in large part on the continued service of our key technical and management personnel  and on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees  particularly those highly skilled design  process and test engineers involved in the development of new products and processes and the manufacture of existing products 
the competition for these individuals is significant  and the loss of key employees could harm our business 
we may fail to successfully complete future acquisitions and may not successfully integrate acquired businesses  which could adversely affect our operating results 
although we have previously grown through acquisitions  our current focus is on pursuing organic growth opportunities 
if we were to pursue future growth through acquisitions  however  this would involve significant risks that could have a material adverse effect on us 
these risks include operating risks  such as the inability to integrate successfully our acquired operations businesses and personnel inability to realize anticipated synergies  economies of scale or other value difficulties in scaling up production and coordinating management of operations at new sites strain placed on our personnel  systems and resources possible modification or termination of an acquired business s customer programs  including cancellation of current or anticipated programs and loss of key employees of acquired businesses 
financial risks  such as the use of cash resources  or incurrence of additional debt and related interest expenses dilutive effect of the issuance of additional equity securities inability to achieve expected operating margins to offset the increased fixed costs associated with acquisitions  and or inability to increase margins at acquired entities to plexus desired levels incurrence of large write offs or write downs impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets unforeseen liabilities of the acquired businesses 
expansion of our business and operations may negatively impact our business 
we have expanded our presence in malaysia and may further expand our operations by establishing or acquiring other facilities or by expanding capacity in our current facilities 
we may expand both in geographical areas in which we currently operate and in new geographical areas within the united states and internationally 
we may not be able to find suitable facilities on a timely basis or on terms satisfactory to us 
expansion of our business and operations involves numerous business risks  including the inability to successfully integrate additional facilities or capacity and to realize anticipated synergies  economies of scale or other value additional fixed costs which may not be fully absorbed by the new business difficulties in the timing of expansions  including delays in the implementation of construction and manufacturing plans creation of excess capacity  and the need to reduce capacity elsewhere if anticipated sales or opportunities do not materialize diversion of management s attention from other business areas during the planning and implementation of expansions strain placed on our operational  financial  management  technical and information systems and resources disruption in manufacturing operations incurrence of significant costs and expenses inability to locate sufficient customers or employees to support the expansion 
we may fail to secure necessary financing 
we maintain an amended secured credit facility with a group of banks  which allows us to borrow up to million 
however  we cannot be sure that the amended secured credit facility will provide all of the financing capacity that we will need in the future 
our future success may depend on our ability to obtain additional financing and capital to support increased sales and our possible future growth 
we may seek to raise capital by issuing additional common stock or other equity securities issuing debt securities modifying existing credit facilities or obtaining new credit facilities a combination of these methods 
we may not be able to obtain capital when we want or need it  and capital may not be available on satisfactory terms 
if we issue additional equity securities or convertible debt to raise capital  it may be dilutive to shareholders ownership interests 
furthermore  any additional financing may have terms and conditions that adversely affect our business  such as restrictive financial or operating covenants  and our ability to meet any financing covenants will largely depend on our financial performance  which in turn will be subject to general economic conditions and financial  business and other factors 
recently enacted changes in the securities laws and regulations are likely to increase costs 
the sarbanes oxley act of the sarbanes oxley act that became law in july has required changes in some of our corporate governance  securities disclosure and compliance practices 
in response to the requirements of the sarbanes oxley act  the sec and the nasdaq stock market have promulgated new rules in a variety of subjects 
compliance with these new rules has increased our legal and accounting costs  and we expect these increased costs to continue indefinitely 
these developments may also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors or qualified executive officers 
if we receive other than an unqualified opinion on the adequacy of our internal control over financial reporting as of september  and future year ends as required by the section of the sarbanes oxley act  investors could lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements  which could result in a decrease in the value of the our common stock 
as required by section of the sarbanes oxley act  the sec adopted rules requiring public companies to include a report of management on the company s internal control over financial reporting in their annual reports on form k that contains an assessment by management of the effectiveness of the company s internal control over financial reporting 
in addition  the public accounting firm auditing a company s financial statements must attest to and report on both management s assessment as to whether the company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting and on the effectiveness of the company s internal control over financial reporting 
we are currently undergoing a comprehensive effort to comply with section of the sarbanes oxley act 
if we are unable to complete our assessment in a timely manner or if our independent auditors issue other than an unqualified opinion on the design  operating effectiveness or management s assessment of internal control over financial reporting  this could result in an adverse reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of confidence in the reliability of our financial statements  which could cause the market price of our shares to decline 
a weakness in plexus stock price could mean that investors will not be able to sell their shares at or above the prices that they paid 
a weakness in stock price could also impair plexus ability in the future to offer common stock or convertible securities as a source of additional capital and or as consideration in the acquisition of other businesses 
the price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile 
our stock price has fluctuated significantly in recent periods 
the price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of events and factors relating to us  our competitors and the market for our services  many of which are beyond our control 
in addition  the stock market in general  and especially the nasdaq stock market  along with share prices for technology companies in particular  have experienced extreme volatility  including weakness  that sometimes has been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies 
these broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock  regardless of our operating results 
our stock price and the stock price of many other technology companies remain below their peaks 
among other things  volatility and weakness in plexus stock price could mean that investors will not be able to sell their shares at or above the prices that they paid 
volatility and weakness could also impair plexus ability in the future to offer common stock or convertible securities as a source of additional capital and or as consideration in the acquisition of other businesses 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign exchange and interest rates 
to reduce such risks  we selectively use financial instruments 
foreign currency risk we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
our policy is to selectively hedge our foreign currency denominated transactions in a manner that substantially offsets the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
presently  we use foreign currency contracts to hedge only those currency exposures associated with certain assets and liabilities denominated in non functional currencies 
corresponding gains and losses on the underlying transaction generally offset the gains and losses on these foreign currency hedges 
our international operations create potential foreign exchange risk 
as of september   we had no foreign currency contracts outstanding 
our percentages of transactions denominated in currencies other than the us dollar for the indicated periods were as follows fiscal year net sales total costs interest rate risk we have financial instruments  including cash equivalents and short term investments  which are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
we consider the use of interest rate swaps based on existing market conditions 
we currently do not use any interest rate swaps or other types of derivative financial instruments to hedge interest rate risk 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal  while maximizing yields without significantly increasing market risk 
to achieve this  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of highly rated securities  money market funds and certificates of deposit and limit the amount of principal exposure to any one issuer 
our only material interest rate risk is associated with our secured credit facility 
a percent change in our weighted average interest rate on our average long term borrowings would have had only a nominal impact on net interest expense in fiscal  and
