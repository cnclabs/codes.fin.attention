item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations basis of presentation the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the preceding selected financial data and our financial statements and the notes thereto and the other financial data included elsewhere in this annual report 
the financial information provided below has been rounded in order to simplify its presentation 
however  the ratios and percentages provided below are calculated using the detailed financial information contained in the financial statements  the notes thereto and the other financial data included elsewhere in this annual report 
general we serve as a bank holding company for capitalbank 
we formed capitalbank on january  during a restructuring that consolidated our operations into a single subsidiary 
capitalbank operates thirteen branches throughout south carolina 
capitalbank offers a full range of banking services  including a wealth management group featuring a wide array of financial services  with personalized attention  local decision making  and strong emphasis on the needs of individuals and small to medium sized businesses 
we were formed in to serve as a holding company for greenwood national bank  which later changed its name to greenwood bank trust 
in we made the decision to expand beyond greenwood county by creating an organization of independent banks in four additional markets 
in june  we opened clemson bank and trust in clemson  south carolina 
in and  we opened community bank and trust  the bank  and mid state bank 
we formed a separate trust organization in known as community trust company 
during and  we also acquired several carolina first branches 
in may  we sold community trust company 
in july of  we acquired a carolina first branch and an anchor bank branch 
as discussed  on january   we merged the five subsidiary banks into one bank charter known as capitalbank 
we made the decision to restructure the organization into one bank in order to improve operational efficiencies  provide new opportunities for employees  and improve service to customers 
customers are able to receive the benefit of being able to transact business at any of capitalbank s branches  through the atm network and through the internet banking products 
additionally  we believe that the new centralized credit function provides additional controlled decisions while streamlining the credit process 
centralized deposit pricing supports management s strategy from market to market 
we also believe that the name recognition has enhanced our business 
on january   capitalbank announced that it had signed a definitive agreement with enterprise bank of south carolina to sell capitalbank s five branch offices located in barnwell  blackville  williston  springfield and salley  south carolina 
on may   capitalbank sold the five branches  which had approximately million in deposits 
on august   we signed a letter of interest to acquire abbeville capital corporation  the holding company of the bank of abbeville 
in october  the board of directors of both companies approved a definitive agreement 
the transaction closed in march the bank of abbeville will operate as a branch of capitalbank

average earning assets decreased million  or  and average interest bearing liabilities decreased million  or  due primarily to the sale of the five branches in our tax equivalent net interest spread and tax equivalent net interest margin were and  respectively  in compared to and in the increase in the net interest spread was primarily the result of the decrease in yields on interest bearing liabilities used to fund loans and securities 
yields on interest bearing liabilities decreased from in to in yields on interest earning assets decreased basis points 
however  yields on interest bearing liabilities decreased basis points 
the provision for loan losses was  in compared to million in the significant amount charged to the provision in was primarily the result of management s efforts to fund the allowance for potential problem loans and to protect against a deteriorating economy 
our allowance for loan losses was of total loans outstanding at december  in addition  the provision was funded to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level sufficient to cover known and inherent losses in the loan portfolio

net occupancy expense was  in compared to  in  and furniture and equipment expense was million in compared to million in another significant decrease in noninterest expense was in the amortization of intangible assets

the largest component of our net income is our net interest income  which is the difference between the income earned on assets and interest paid on deposits and borrowings used to support such assets 
net interest income is determined by the yields earned on our interest earning assets and the rates paid on our interest bearing liabilities  the relative amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the degree of mismatch and the maturity and repricing characteristics of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income divided by average interest earning assets represents our net interest margin

fully tax equivalent basis at tax rate for nontaxable securities and loans 
average balances  income and expenses  and rates 
the previous table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain information related to our average balance sheet and our average yields on assets and average costs of liabilities 
such yields are derived by dividing income or expense by the average balance of the corresponding assets or liabilities 
average balances have been derived from the daily balances throughout the periods indicated 
net interest income continued analysis of changes in net interest income 
the following table sets forth the effect that the varying levels of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the applicable rates have had on changes in net interest income from to and to analysis of changes in net interest income compared with compared with variance due to variance due to dollars in thousands volume rate total volume rate total earning assets loans      securities  taxable  securities  nontaxable nonmarketable equity securities federal funds sold and other total interest income    interest bearing liabilities interest bearing deposits interest bearing transaction accounts savings and market rate investments time deposits   total interest bearing deposits   other short term borrowings federal home loan bank advances long term debt obligations under capital leases total interest expense   net interest income   volume rate changes have been allocated to each category based on the percentage of the total change 
interest sensitivity 
we monitor and manage the pricing and maturity of our assets and liabilities in order to diminish the potential adverse impact that changes in interest rates could have on our net interest income 
the principal monitoring technique we employ is the measurement of our interest sensitivity gap  which is the positive or negative dollar difference between assets and liabilities that are subject to interest rate repricing within a given period of time 
interest rate sensitivity can be managed by repricing assets or liabilities  selling securities available for sale  replacing an asset or liability at maturity  or adjusting the interest rate during the life of an asset or liability 
managing the amount of assets and liabilities repricing in the same time interval helps to hedge the risk and minimize the impact on net interest income of rising or falling interest rates 
net interest income continued the following table sets forth our interest rate sensitivity at december  interest sensitivity analysis december  dollars in thousands within one month after one through three months after three through twelve months within one year greater than one year or non sensitive total assets earning assets loans      securities   federal funds sold and other total earning assets     liabilities interest bearing liabilities interest bearing deposits demand deposits   savings deposits    time deposits      total interest bearing deposits    other short term borrowings   federal home loan bank advances    obligations under capital leases total interest bearing liabilities   period gap      cumulative gap     ratio of cumulative gap to total earning assets excludes nonaccrual loans and includes loans held for sale 
the above table reflects the balances of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at the earlier of their repricing or maturity dates 
overnight federal funds are reflected at the earliest pricing interval due to the immediately available nature of the instruments 
debt securities are reflected at each instrument s ultimate maturity date 
scheduled payment amounts of fixed rate amortizing loans are reflected at each scheduled payment date 
scheduled payment amounts of variable rate amortizing loans are reflected at each scheduled payment date until the loan may be repriced contractually  the unamortized balance is reflected at that point 
interest bearing liabilities with no contractual maturity  such as savings deposits and interest bearing transaction accounts  are reflected in the earliest repricing period due to contractual arrangements that give us the opportunity to vary the rates paid on those deposits within a thirty day or shorter period 
fixed rate time deposits  principally certificates of deposit  are reflected at their contractual maturity date 
other short term borrowings consist of federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase 
federal funds purchased are reflected at the earliest pricing interval because funds can be repriced daily 
securities sold under agreements to repurchase are reflected at the maturity date of each repurchase agreement that generally matures within one day 
advances from the federal home loan bank are reflected at their contractual maturity dates 
obligations under capital leases are reflected at each payment date 
net interest income continued we generally would benefit from increasing market rates of interest when we have an asset sensitive gap position and generally would benefit from decreasing market rates of interest when we are liability sensitive 
we are liability sensitive within the one year period 
however  our gap analysis is not a precise indicator of our interest sensitivity position 
the analysis presents only a static view of the timing of maturities and repricing opportunities  without taking into consideration that changes in interest rates do not affect all assets and liabilities equally 
for example  rates paid on a substantial portion of core deposits may change contractually within a relatively short time frame  but those rates are viewed by us as significantly less interest sensitive than market based rates such as those paid on non core deposits 
accordingly  we believe a liability sensitive gap position is not as indicative of our true interest sensitivity as it would be for an organization that depends to a greater extent on purchased funds to support earning assets 
net interest income may be impacted by other significant factors in a given interest rate environment  including changes in the volume and mix of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
provision and allowance for loan losses general 
we have developed policies and procedures for evaluating the overall quality of our credit portfolio and the timely identification of potential problem credits 
on a quarterly basis  the board of directors reviews and approves the appropriate level for capitalbank s allowance for loan losses based upon our recommendations  the results of the internal monitoring and reporting system  analysis of economic conditions in its markets  and a review of historical statistical data for both us and other financial institutions 
additions to the allowance for loan losses  which are expensed as the provision for loan losses on our income statement  are made periodically to maintain the allowance at an appropriate level based on our analysis of the potential risk in the loan portfolio 
loan losses and recoveries are charged or credited directly to the allowance 
the amount of the provision is a function of the level of loans outstanding  the level of nonperforming loans  historical loan loss experience  the amount of loan losses actually charged against the reserve during a given period  and current and anticipated economic conditions 
our allowance for loan losses is based upon judgments and assumptions of risk elements in the portfolio  future economic conditions  and other factors affecting borrowers 
the process includes identification and analysis of loss potential in various portfolio segments utilizing a credit risk grading process and specific reviews and evaluations of significant problem credits 
in addition  we monitor the overall portfolio quality through observable trends in delinquency  charge offs  and general and economic conditions in the service area 
the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses and the effectiveness of our monitoring and analysis system are also reviewed periodically by the banking regulators 
based on present information and an ongoing evaluation  we consider the allowance for loan losses to be adequate to meet presently known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio 
our judgment as to the adequacy of the allowance is based upon a number of assumptions about future events that we believe to be reasonable but that may or may not be valid 
thus  we have no assurance that charge offs in future periods will not exceed the allowance for loan losses or that additional increases in the allowance for loan losses will not be required 
we do not allocate the allowance for loan losses to specific categories of loans but evaluate the adequacy on an overall portfolio basis utilizing a risk grading system 
provision and allowance for loan losses continued the following table sets forth certain information with respect to our allowance for loan losses and the composition of charge offs and recoveries for each of the last five years 
allowance for loan losses year ended december  dollars in thousands total loans outstanding at end of year    average loans outstanding     balance of allowance for loan losses at beginning of period     allowance for loan losses from acquisitions loan losses commercial and industrial real estate mortgage consumer total loan losses  recoveries of previous loan losses commercial and industrial real estate mortgage consumer total recoveries net loan losses provision for loan losses   balance of allowance for loan losses at end of period      allowance for loan losses to period end loans net charge offs to average loans nonperforming assets 
the following table sets forth our nonperforming assets for the dates indicated 
nonperforming assets december  dollars in thousands nonaccrual loans     restructured or impaired loans total nonperforming loans    other real estate owned total nonperforming assets    loans days or more past due and still accruing interest nonperforming assets to period end loans accrual of interest is discontinued on a loan when we believe  after considering economic and business conditions and collection efforts  that the borrower s financial condition is such that the collection of interest is doubtful 
a delinquent loan is generally placed in nonaccrual status when it becomes days or more past due 
when a loan is placed in nonaccrual status  all interest that has been accrued on the loan but remains unpaid is reversed and deducted from current earnings as a reduction of reported interest income 
no additional interest is accrued on the loan balance until the collection of both principal and interest becomes reasonably certain 
when a problem loan is provision and allowance for loan losses continued finally resolved  we may ultimately write down or charge off of the principal balance of the loan that would necessitate additional charges to earnings 
for all periods presented  the additional interest income  which would have been recognized into earnings if our nonaccrual loans had been current in accordance with their original terms  is immaterial 
total nonperforming assets decreased to million at december   from million at december  this amount consists primarily of nonaccrual loans that totaled million at december  nonperforming assets were of total loans at december  the allowance for loan losses to period end nonperforming assets was at december  potential problem loans 
at december   through our internal review mechanisms  we had identified million of criticized loans and million of classified loans 
the results of this internal review process are the primary determining factor in our assessment of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
our criticized loans increased from million at december  to million at december  total classified loans decreased from million at december  to million at december  portfolio quality has improved as a significant percentage of loans has migrated from classified status to the less severe criticized status 
the improvement was due to better borrower performance and or enhanced collateral position 
we are committed to addressing potential problem loans 
noninterest income and expense noninterest income 
noninterest income increased million  or  to million in from million in we realized gains on the sales of nonmarketable equity securities of million in compared to no gains in gains on the sales of securities available for sale were  in compared to  in we also realized a gain on the sale of fixed assets of  during  compared to no gains in service charges on deposit accounts decreased  or to million in residential mortgage origination fees increased  or to million in from  in mortgage originations increased in because of more customers refinancing their mortgages due to low interest rates 
if market rates experience a substantial and prolonged increase  however  such increase could reduce our customers desire to borrow money from us or adversely affect their ability to repay their outstanding loans by increasing their credit costs 
in periods of rising interest rates  demand for mortgage loans typically declines 
our income from our mortgage origination fees would significantly decrease following a decline in demand for mortgage loans 
any of these events could adversely affect our results of operations of financial condition 
income from fiduciary activities increased  or to  in from  in commissions on the sale of mutual funds increased  or to  in compared to  in other operating income increased  or to million in from  in the increase was due partially to income realized on boli bank owned life insurance that was purchased in august  and  resulting from metlife s acquisition of general american life insurance company  a mutual company 
by virtue of our ownership of general american policies  we received a pro rata portion of the purchase price of the mutual company 
noninterest income and expense continued the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the principal components of noninterest income noninterest income year ended december  dollars in thousands service charges on deposit accounts    residential mortgage origination fees  gains on sales of securities available for sale gains on sales of nonmarketable equity securities  commissions from sales of mutual funds income from fiduciary activities gain on sale of branches  gain on sale of premises and equipment income from bank owned life insurance other income total noninterest income    noninterest expense 
noninterest expense increased million  or  to million in from million in the primary reason for the increase was due to the prepayment penalty expense of million associated with the early extinguishment of federal home loan bank debt 
the primary component of noninterest expense was salaries and employee benefits  which increased  or  to million in from million in this increase is due to staff increases from the operating of new branches in greenville  south carolina  which opened in december  and clinton  south carolina  which opened in april net occupancy expense was  in compared to  in  and furniture and equipment expense was million in compared to million in other operating expense increased million  or to million in from million in as noted above  a large portion of the increase was associated with the prepayment penalty on the extinguishment of federal home loan bank advances 
other expenses contributing to the increase were  related to our core processing software conversion  and  related to our merger with abbeville capital corporation 
total amortization of intangible assets was  in and our efficiency ratio was in compared to in the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the primary components of noninterest expense noninterest expense year ended december  dollars in thousands salaries and employee benefits    net occupancy expense furniture and equipment expense    amortization of intangible assets  director and committee fees data processing and supplies mortgage loan department expenses banking assessments professional fees and services postage and freight supplies telephone expenses federal home loan bank prepayment penalties  other    total noninterest expense    efficiency ratio noninterest income and expense continued income taxes

earning assets loans 
loans are the largest category of earning assets and typically provide higher yields than the other types of earning assets 
associated with the higher yields are the inherent credit and liquidity risks that we attempt to control and counterbalance 
loans averaged million in compared to million in  an increase of million  or 
at december   total loans were million compared to million at december  the following table sets forth the composition of the loan portfolio by category at the dates indicated and highlights our general emphasis on mortgage lending

at december   this category totaled million and represented of the total loan portfolio  compared to million  or  at december  in the context of this discussion  a real estate mortgage loan is defined as any loan  other than loans for construction purposes  secured by real estate  regardless of the purpose of the loan 
financial institutions in our market areas typically obtain a security interest in real estate  whenever possible  in addition to any other available collateral 
this collateral is taken to reinforce the likelihood of the ultimate repayment of the loan and tends to increase the magnitude of the real estate loan portfolio component 
real estate construction loans increased million  or  to million at december   from million at december  residential mortgage loans  which are the largest category of our loans  increased million  or  to million at december   from million at december  residential real estate loans consist of first and second mortgages on single or multi family residential dwellings 
nonresidential mortgage loans  which include commercial loans and other loans secured by multi family properties and farmland  increased million or  to million at december  from million at december  the overall increase in real estate lending was attributable to the continued demand for residential and commercial real estate loans in our markets 
capitalbank has been able to compete favorably for residential mortgage loans with other financial institutions by offering fixed rate products having three and five year call provisions 
earning assets continued commercial and industrial loans increased million  or  to million at december   from million at december  consumer and other loans increased million  or  to million at december   from million at december  our loan portfolio reflects the diversity of our markets 
our thirteen branches are located from the northern midlands of south carolina through the upstate 
primary market areas include anderson  belton  clemson  clinton  greenville  greenwood  newberry and saluda 
the economies of these markets are varied and represent different industries including medium and light manufacturing  higher education  regional health care  and distribution facilities 
we expect these areas to remain stable with continual growth 
the diversity of the economy creates opportunities for all types of lending 
we do not engage in foreign lending 
the repayment of loans in the loan portfolio as they mature is also a source of our liquidity 
the following table sets forth our loans maturing within specified intervals at december  loan maturity schedule and sensitivity to changes in interest rates december  dollars in thousands one year or less over one year through five years over five years total commercial and industrial     real estate     consumer and other    loans maturing after one year with fixed interest rates  floating interest rates  the information presented in the above table is based on the contractual maturities of the individual loans  including loans that may be subject to renewal at their contractual maturity 
renewal of such loans is subject to review and credit approval as well as modification of terms upon their maturity 
consequently  we believe this treatment presents fairly the maturity and repricing structure of the loan portfolio shown in the above table 
investment securities 
the investment securities portfolio is a significant component of our total earning assets 
total securities averaged million in  compared to million in and million in at december   the total securities portfolio was million 
securities designated as available for sale totaled million and were recorded at estimated fair value 
securities designated as held to maturity totaled  and were recorded at amortized cost 
the securities portfolio also includes nonmarketable equity securities totaling million that are carried at cost because they are not readily marketable or have no quoted market value 
these include investments in federal reserve bank stock  federal home loan bank stock  the stock of three unrelated financial institutions  and the stock of a financial services company that offers internet banking

short term investments 
short term investments  which consist primarily of federal funds sold and interest bearing deposits with other banks  averaged  in  compared to  in and million in at december   short term investments totaled  these funds are a source of our liquidity 
federal funds are generally invested in an earning capacity on an overnight basis

average total deposits increased million  or  to million during  from million during at december   total deposits were million compared to million a year earlier  an increase of

our core deposits increased million to million at december  during the second quarter of  capitalbank offered a jumbo checking product as part of interest bearing checking 
these accounts were offered for a limited time with checking balances of a minimum of  and paid interest at 
of the million increase in our core deposits  approximately million was attributable to the jumbo checking product 
deposits  and particularly core deposits  have historically been our primary source of funding and have enabled us to meet successfully both our short term and long term liquidity needs 
we anticipate that such deposits will continue to be our primary source of funding in the future 
our loan to deposit ratio was at december   and at the end of the maturity distribution of our time deposits of  or more at december  is set forth in the following table 
maturities of certificates of deposit of  or more dollars in thousands within three months after three through six months after six through twelve months after twelve months total certificates of deposit of  or more   approximately of our time deposits of  or more had scheduled maturities within three months and had maturities within six months 
large certificate of deposit customers tend to be extremely sensitive to interest rate levels  making these deposits less reliable sources of funding for liquidity planning purposes than core deposits 
some financial institutions partially fund their balance sheets using large certificates of deposit obtained through brokers 
these brokered deposits are generally expensive and are unreliable as long term funding sources 
accordingly  we do not solicit brokered deposits 
borrowed funds 
borrowed funds consist of short term borrowings and advances from the federal home loan bank 
short term borrowings are primarily federal funds purchased from correspondent banks and securities sold under agreements to repurchase 
average short term borrowings were million in  an increase of  from federal funds purchased from correspondent banks averaged million in at december   federal funds deposits and other interest bearing liabilities continued purchased totaled million 
securities sold under agreements to repurchase averaged million in at december   securities sold under agreements to repurchase totaled million 
the following table summarizes our short term borrowings for the years ended december  and these borrowings consist of securities sold under agreements to repurchase and advances from the federal home loan bank 
securities sold under agreements to repurchase mature on a one to seven day basis 
these agreements are secured by us government agencies 
advances from federal home loan bank mature at different periods as discussed in the footnotes to the financial statements and are secured by the bank s one to four family residential mortgage loans and the bank s investment in federal home loan bank stock

at december   borrowings from the federal home loan bank were million compared to million a year earlier 
although we expect to continue using short term borrowing and federal home loan bank advances as secondary funding sources  core deposits will continue to be our primary funding source 
of the million advances from the federal home loan bank outstanding at december   million mature in  million in   in  million in  and million in capital the federal reserve board and bank regulatory agencies require bank holding companies and financial institutions to maintain capital at adequate levels based on a percentage of assets and off balance sheet exposures  adjusted for risk weights ranging from to 
under the risk based standard  capital is classified into two tiers 
our tier capital consists of common shareholders equity  excluding the unrealized gain loss on available for sale securities  minus intangible assets 
our tier capital consists of the allowance for loan losses subject to certain limitations 
a bank holding company s qualifying capital base for purposes of its risk based capital ratio consists of the sum of its tier and tier capital 
the regulatory minimum requirements are for tier and for total risk based capital 
we and capitalbank are also required to maintain capital at a minimum level based on average total assets as defined  which is known as the leverage ratio 
only the strongest bank holding companies and banks are allowed to maintain capital at the minimum requirement of 
all others are subject to maintaining ratios to above the minimum 
we and capitalbank exceeded the federal reserve s fully phased in regulatory capital ratios at december    and  as set forth in the following table 
capital continued analysis of capital tier capital    tier capital    total qualifying capital    risk adjusted total assets including off balance sheet exposures   tier risk based capital ratio total risk based capital ratio tier leverage ratio tier risk based total risk based tier leverage capitalbank s capital ratios at december  were liquidity management and capital resources liquidity management involves monitoring our sources and uses of funds in order to meet our day to day cash flow requirements while maximizing profits 
liquidity represents the ability of a company to convert assets into cash or cash equivalents without significant loss and to raise additional funds by increasing liabilities 
without proper liquidity management  we would not be able to perform the primary function of a financial intermediary and would  therefore  not be able to meet the needs of the communities we serve 
liquidity management is made more complex because different balance sheet components are subject to varying degrees of management control 
for example  the timing of maturities of the investment portfolio is very predictable and subject to a high degree of control at the time investment decisions are made 
however  net deposit inflows and outflows are far less predictable and are not subject to nearly the same degree of control 
our loans to assets ratio and loans to funds ratio increased from to the loans to assets ratio at december  was compared to at december   and the loans to funds ratio at december  was compared to at december  the amount of advances from the federal home loan bank was approximately million at december  compared to million at december  we expect to continue using these advances as a source of funding 
additionally  we had approximately million of unused lines of credit for federal funds purchases and million of securities available for sale at december  as sources of liquidity 
we also have the ability to receive an additional million in advances under the term of our agreement with the federal home loan bank 
we depend on dividends from capitalbank as our primary source of liquidity 
the ability of capitalbank to pay dividends is subject to general regulatory restrictions that may  but are not expected to  have a material impact on the liquidity available to us 
we paid stock dividends in september  june  and may and may do so in the future 
we have paid cash dividends on a quarterly basis since september and anticipate continuing to do so 
critical accounting policies we have adopted various accounting policies that govern the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states in the preparation of our financial statements 
our significant accounting policies are described in the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements at december  as filed with this annual report on form k 
certain accounting policies involve significant judgments and assumptions by us that have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities 
we consider these accounting policies to be critical accounting policies 
the judgments and assumptions we use are based on historical experience and other factors  which we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
because of the nature of the judgments and assumptions we make  actual results could differ from these judgments and estimates that could have a material critical accounting policies continued impact on our carrying values of assets and liabilities and our results of operations 
we believe the allowance for loan losses is a critical accounting policy that requires the most significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
refer to the portion of this discussion that addresses our allowance for loan losses for a description of our processes and methodology for determining our allowance for loan losses 
impact of inflation unlike most industrial companies  the assets and liabilities of financial institutions such as our subsidiary and ours are primarily monetary in nature 
therefore  interest rates have a more significant effect on our performance than do the effects of changes in the general rate of inflation and change in prices 
in addition  interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services 
as discussed previously  we seek to manage the relationships between interest sensitive assets and liabilities in order to protect against wide interest rate fluctuations  including those resulting from inflation 
impact of off balance sheet instruments we are a party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of our customers 
these financial instruments consist of commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit 
commitments to extend credit are legally binding agreements to lend to a customer at predetermined interest rates as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
a commitment involves  to varying degrees  elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the balance sheets 
the exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the instrument is represented by the contractual amount of the instrument 
because certain commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
letters of credit are conditional commitments issued to guarantee a customer s performance to a third party and have essentially the same credit risk as other lending facilities 
standby letters of credit often expire without being used 
we use the same credit underwriting procedures for commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit as we do for our on balance sheet instruments 
the credit worthiness of each borrower is evaluated and the amount of collateral  if deemed necessary  is based on the credit evaluation 
collateral held for commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit varies but may include accounts receivable  inventory  property  plant  equipment  and income producing commercial properties 
we are not involved in off balance sheet contractual relationships  other than those disclosed in this report  that could result in liquidity needs or other commitments or that could significantly impact earnings 
through its operations  capitalbank has made contractual commitments to extend credit in the ordinary course of its business activities 
these commitments are legally binding agreements to lend money to capitalbank s customers at predetermined interest rates for a specified period of time 
at december   capitalbank had issued commitments to extend credit of million and standby letters of credit of million through various types of commercial lending arrangements 
approximately million of these commitments to extend credit had variable rates 
our experience has been that a significant portion of these commitments often expires without being used 
the following table sets forth the length of time until maturity for unused commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit at december  impact of off balance sheet instruments continued dollars in thousands within one month after one through three months after three through twelve months within one year greater than one year total unused commitments to extend credit   standby letters of credit   totals      the bank evaluates each customer s credit worthiness on a case by case basis 
the amount of collateral obtained  if deemed necessary by the bank upon extension of credit  is based on its credit evaluation of the borrower 
collateral varies but may include accounts receivable  inventory  property  plants  equipment and commercial and residential real estate 
industry developments as more fully discussed under the heading government supervision and regulation in item of this annual report  in november of  the gramm leach bliley act  previously known as the financial services modernization act of  was enacted 
the act is intended to grant to community banks certain powers as a matter of right that larger institutions have accumulated on an ad hoc basis 
nevertheless  the act may have the result of increasing the amount of competition that we face from larger institutions and other types of companies 
we cannot predict the full effect that the act will have on us 
from time to time  various bills are introduced in the united states congress with respect to the regulation of financial institutions 
certain of these proposals  if adopted  could significantly change the regulation of banks and the financial services industry 
we cannot predict whether any of these proposals will be adopted or  if adopted  how these proposals would affect us 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december dollars in thousands payment due by period contractual obligations total year years years years capital lease operating lease other long term liabilities     risk factors changes in interest rates could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
like most banks  capitalbank s earnings depend substantially on rate differentials  which are the differences between the rates it earns on loans  securities  and other earning assets  and the interest rates it pays on deposits and other borrowings 
these rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control  including general economic conditions and the policies of various governmental and regulatory authorities 
frequently  the maturities of assets and liabilities are not balanced  and an increase or decrease in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our net interest margin  results of operations  and financial condition 
changes in interest rates can have differing effects on our volume of mortgage loans originated 
in periods of declining interest rates  such as have occurred recently  demand for mortgage loans typically increases  particularly for mortgage loans related to refinancing of existing loans 
the refinancing of existing loans currently comprises approximately of our loan volume 
in periods of rising interest rates  demand for mortgage loans typically declines 
our income from our mortgage banking division would significantly decrease following a decline in demand for mortgage loans in south carolina  which is the area in which we originate our mortgage loans 
we could sustain losses if our asset quality declines 
our earnings are significantly affected by our ability to properly originate  underwrite  and service loans 
we could sustain losses if we incorrectly assess the creditworthiness of our borrowers or fail to detect or respond to deterioration in asset quality in a timely manner 
problems with asset quality could cause our interest income and net interest margin to decrease and our provisions for loan losses to increase  which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
the banking industry is highly competitive 
the banking industry in our market area is highly competitive 
we compete with many different financial and financial service institutions  including other commercial and savings banks and savings and loan associations  credit unions  finance companies  mortgage companies  brokerage and investment banking firms  and asset based non bank lenders 
a substantial number of the commercial banks in our market area are branches or subsidiaries of much larger organizations affiliated with statewide  regional  or national banking companies  and as a result may have greater resources and lower cost of funds 
additionally  we face competition from de novo community banks  including those with senior management who were previously with other local banks or those controlled by investor groups with strong local business and community ties 
these competitors aggressively solicit customers within their market area by advertising through direct mail  the electronic media  and other means 
many of these competitors have been in business longer  and are substantially larger  than us 
these competitors may offer services  such as international banking services  that we can offer only through correspondents  if at all 
additionally  larger competitors have greater capital resources and  consequently  higher lending limits 
changes in economic conditions could adversely affect our results of operation and financial condition 
our profitability depends on the profitability of our bank subsidiary  whose operating results and asset quality may be significantly affected by national and local economic conditions 
we make loans primarily to borrowers who are located in south carolina and secure these loans in substantial part with real estate collateral located in the area 
we are subject to adverse changes in general economic conditions in the united states such as inflation  recession  and high levels of unemployment  consumer credit  and bankruptcies 
we are also subject to unfavorable changes in economic conditions affecting our markets that may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
such changes could result from numerous factors beyond our control  including a reduction in real estate values  business closings or layoffs  inclement weather  natural disasters  and adverse trends or events affecting various industry groups such as agriculture  real estate and real estate development  and construction 
while our asset quality ratios have not been significantly impacted by the prevailing economic slowdown in the national and local economies  we have seen an increase in bankruptcy filings  layoff announcements  and business closings in our market area 
considerable uncertainty continues regarding the economy and the potential for adverse effects from the continued threat of terrorism and other geo political events 
therefore  there can be no assurance that a continuation or worsening of this slowdown will not ultimately have an adverse impact on our borrowers or our financial condition and results of operation 
we rely heavily on the services of key personnel 
we depend on the services of william g 
stevens  our president and chief executive officer 
the loss of the services of mr 
stevens could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
we are also dependent on a number of other key officers who have important customer relationships or are instrumental to our operations 
the loss of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
we could be adversely affected by government regulation 
we are subject to extensive government regulation and supervision under various state and federal laws  rules  and regulations  including rules and regulations of the board of governors of the federal reserve  the fdic  and the south carolina state board of financial institutions 
these laws and regulations are designed primarily to protect depositors  borrowers  and the bank insurance fund of the fdic and to further certain social policies 
consequently  they may impose limitations on us that may not be in our shareholders best interests 
we have a class of stock registered with the securities and exchange commission under section b of the securities exchange act of and are therefore subject to extensive regulation by the securities and exchange commission 
recently adopted federal securities laws and regulations have significantly increased the time and expense burdens on companies  like us  that are required to make periodic filings with the securities and exchange commission 
many of the recently adopted rules have not yet gone fully into effect and the time and expense burdens are expected to increase 
such increased burdens could adversely affect our profitability 
we are subject to changes in federal and state laws  regulations  governmental policies  capital requirements  and accounting principles 
the effects of any such potential changes cannot be predicted  but they could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
a lack of acquisition history could cause us to have difficulty in integrating abbeville capital into our operations 
the merger between us and abbeville capital corporation as of march  was the first acquisition of another banking institution by us in our history 
thus  anticipating all of the challenges that will be presented by the integration of another banking institution into our operations may be more difficult 
the successful integration of the management and staff  as well as the technical operations such as reporting systems and data processing  will be important to the future operations of the combined entity that will result from the merger 
substantial difficulties could be encountered  including the following the loss of key employees and customers  the disruption of operations and business  possible inconsistencies in standards  control procedures  and policies  unexpected problems with costs  operations  personnel  technology  and credit  and problems with the assimilation of new operations  sites  and personnel  which could divert resources from regular banking operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates 
our market risk arises principally from interest rate risk inherent in our lending  deposit  and borrowing activities 
management actively monitors and manages our interest rate risk exposure 
in addition to other risks that we manage in the normal course of business  such as credit quality and liquidity  management considers interest rate risk to be a significant market risk that could potentially have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
the information contained in the section captioned management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations net interest income is incorporated herein by reference 
other types of market risks  such as foreign currency risk and commodity price risk  do not arise in the normal course of our business activities
