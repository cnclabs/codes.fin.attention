item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we were incorporated in delaware in april and reincorporated in maryland in september we were formed as a owned subsidiary of senior housing 
effective july   we assumed the operations of healthcare communities from two bankrupt former tenants of senior housing 
pursuant to tax laws applicable to reits  senior housing engaged fsq  inc  an independent operating company formed by our managing directors  to manage these communities 
at the time we assumed operations of these communities  we had not received substantially all of the required licenses for these communities 
as a result  for the period from july  through december   we accounted for the operations of these communities using the equity method of accounting and we only recorded the net income from these operations 
thereafter  we obtained all necessary licenses to operate these communities  and on january   we began to consolidate the results of operations of these communities 
on december   senior housing distributed substantially all of our shares to its shareholders in a spin off transaction and we became a separately traded public company 
on january   in order to acquire the personnel  systems and assets necessary to operate these communities  we acquired fsq  inc by merger 
since we succeeded to substantially all of the business formerly conducted by subsidiaries or units of two former tenants of senior housing  these subsidiaries and units are considered to be our predecessors 
see item selected financial data for a discussion of financial data of our predecessors 
our revenues consist primarily of payments for services provided to residents at our communities 
the payments are either made by the residents  their families or insurers  referred to as private pay revenues  or by the medicare and medicaid programs 
for the year ended december   private pay revenues represented of our total revenues 
our expenses consist primarily of rent  wages and benefits of personnel  food  supplies  insurance and other resident care costs  as well as taxes  and other property related costs 
our historical results of operations as described above  until completion of the spin off  we operated as a subsidiary of senior housing 
our past operations as senior housing s subsidiary prior to differ from our  and current operations as an independent public company 
specifically  in and  we operated only communities for senior housing  which owned the real estate as well as the operations 
effective december   we began to lease these communities now communities from senior housing which continued to own the real estate 
in january  we leased from senior housing an additional communities that are currently managed by sls 
since sunrise acquired sls  the financial results of these communities have declined and this decline has had a material and adverse impact on our financial results 
we are having discussions with sls concerning possible improvements in the financial results of these operations 
in april  we acquired and began to operate five additional senior living communities 
in october  we began to operate additional owned or leased senior living communities 
in may  we began to operate three additional leased senior living communities 
during and  we also disposed of six senior living communities 
our principal source of financing as a subsidiary of senior housing prior to was intercompany advances from senior housing  an entity with financial resources substantially in excess of ours 
because of these differences  we believe that our historical results of operations for periods prior to described below are not comparable to our or operations or our expected future operations

other operating expenses  which include utilities  housekeeping  dietary  maintenance  insurance and community level administrative costs  increased from million to million  or  again primarily due to expenses at the communities we began to operate since october  as well as higher professional and general liability insurance costs 
management fees related to the communities managed for us by sls for and  were million and million  respectively 
this increase is primarily because these arrangements commenced on january   and  therefore  the period includes more days than the period 
rent expense to senior housing increased from million to million  or  primarily due to rents for communities we began to lease since october  and rent increases which accompanied senior housing s purchase of improvements at leased communities  partially offset by a lease modification entered into on october  which changed the ownership of certain ff e reserve escrows 
community level operating expenses related to the communities we operated throughout and  were million and million  respectively  an increase of 
this increase is primarily due to increases in employee health  workers compensation and professional and general liability insurance costs 
our general and administrative expenses for were million  an increase of over of million  primarily due to costs resulting from our increased operations and to legal costs incurred in connection with our litigation with marriott and msls  which was settled in january depreciation expense in was million  an increase of over depreciation expense of million in the increase is attributable to our purchase of seven communities in the second half of as well as capitalized improvements to some of our communities which increased our depreciable assets 
loss from discontinued operations for was  a decrease of million over the loss in this decrease is attributable to our dispositions of these operations as well as the recovery of some accounts receivable that were previously written off

this increase is due primarily to higher per diem charges to residents 
about of our revenues from residents in were received from medicare and medicaid  compared to in this decrease is due largely to the sls communities and other communities we leased or acquired during  all of which are focused on services to residents who pay with private resources 
interest income increased by  in from  compared to  in due to earnings on higher cash balances in the period 
expenses for were million  an increase of over expenses of million for our wages and benefits costs increased from million to million  or  primarily due to expenses at the communities we leased or acquired in other operating expenses  which include utilities  housekeeping  dietary  maintenance  insurance and community level administrative costs  rose from million to million or  again primarily due to expenses at the communities we leased or acquired in during  msls did not manage any communities for us and we were a subsidiary of senior housing that did not lease any communities 
as a result  we did not incur management fees to msls or rent expense in community level operating expenses related to the communities we operated throughout and  were million and million  respectively  an increase of 
this increase is principally attributable to higher insurance premiums  an increase in reserves for the self funded portion of our insurance programs and higher wage and benefit costs  which were partially offset by a decrease in expenses from our reduced use of higher cost  third party staffing 
our general and administrative expenses for were million  a decrease of over  primarily due to operational start up costs incurred during which we did not incur in and which were only partially offset by increased costs in associated with operating as a separate  publicly owned company and the legal and other costs incurred in connection with our litigation with marriott and msls 
depreciation expense in was million  an increase of over depreciation expense of million in the increase is attributable to our purchase of communities in loss from discontinued operations for was million  an increase of million over the loss in this increase was the result of reserves recorded for medicaid receivables due from the state of connecticut related to community closure costs and an asset impairment charge related to a closed community 
as a result of the factors described above  our net loss for was million  compared to a profit of  in our net loss per share in was 
assuming the shares outstanding as of december  were outstanding for all of  our earnings per share would have been for liquidity and capital resources our total current assets at december   were million compared to million at december  at december   we had cash and equivalents of million 
our total current liabilities were million at december  compared to million at december  this increase was due to several factors 
at december   we had million outstanding under our revolving credit facility and there were no such outstanding amounts at december  in march  we prepaid the amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility 
at december   we owed senior housing million primarily related to our lease obligations and there were no such outstanding amounts at december  this amount was paid in january in addition  our accounts payable and accrued expenses and our accrued compensation and benefits increased primarily due to a change in the timing of certain current liabilities at the sls managed communities as well as increases in our insurance reserves 
finally  the increase in amounts due to sls was primarily due to sls s not transferring cash amounts due to them on a timely basis 
as described in note to our financial statements  in  information became available to us which resulted in million of additional paid in capital 
this amount was the result of our having received more working capital assets and having assumed fewer liabilities than we had previously recorded 
currently  we lease communities from senior housing under two leases 
our leases with senior housing require us to pay a total of million of minimum rent annually 
percentage rent on the leases begins in at march   we believe we are in compliance with the terms of these leases 
our primary source of cash to fund operating expenses  including rent  principal and interest payments on our mortgage debt and routine capital expenditures  is our revenues from services to residents at our communities 
at some of our communities  operating revenues for nursing home services are received from the medicare and medicaid programs 
in  of our total revenues were derived from these programs 
medicare and medicaid revenues in were earned primarily by the nursing home communities we lease from senior housing 
since  a medicare prospective payment system has generally lowered medicare rates paid to senior living communities including many of those that we operate 
in october  temporary increases in medicare payment rates expired 
in october  medicare rates increased by approximately 
our medicare revenues totaled million and million during and  respectively 
our medicaid revenues totaled million and million during and  respectively 
some of the states in which we operate have not raised rates or are expected to reduce medicaid funding 
the magnitude of the potential combined medicare and medicaid rate reductions cannot currently be estimated  but it may be material and may affect our future results of operations 
further medicare and medicaid rates declines may have a dramatic negative impact on our revenues and may produce greater losses 
we expect recent increases in the costs of insurance  especially tort liability insurance  workers compensation and employee health insurance  which are affecting the senior living industry  will continue to have a material adverse impact upon our future results of operations 
as discussed in note to our financial statements  a failure by integrated health services  inc  the united states department of health and human services or the state of connecticut to make payments that we believe are due to us would have a material adverse impact upon our future results 
also  we believe marriott s sale of msls to sunrise has had  and may continue to have  an adverse impact on our financial results and increase our working capital requirements 
our revolving credit facility limits our ability to incur debt as more fully described below 
the terms of our leases with senior housing contain provisions whereby our rights under these agreements may be cancelled by senior housing upon the acquisition by any person or group of more than of our voting stock  and upon other change of control events 
these leases also limit our ability to create  incur  assume or guarantee indebtedness 
in august  we sold a community in seabury  connecticut for million  million of which was in the form of a promissory note from the purchaser 
this note is payable in monthly installments of  of principal  plus interest which accrues on the unpaid principal balance at a rate of 
this note matures on august   but we have the right to require prepayment as of august  in december  we sold a set of group homes in maryland for million  million of which was in the form of a promissory note from the purchaser 
this note is payable in monthly installments of  of principal  plus interest which accrues on the unpaid principal balance at a rate of 
this note matures november   but we have the right to require prepayment earlier by giving notice after november  as described in note to our financial statements  we have an agreement to purchase two properties from senior housing 
we have also sold one property to senior housing 
we expect to finance this transaction with proceeds we receive from new united states department of housing and urban development  or hud  insured mortgages  sales proceeds and by borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
despite the commitments  contingencies and limitations described above  we believe that a combination of our efforts to increase revenues and contain costs  our ability to borrow on our revolving credit facility  our ability to sell to senior housing certain capital improvements made to communities leased from senior housing and the possibility of sales or financings of our owned communities will be sufficient to meet our working capital needs  operating expenses  rent payments to senior housing  debt service and capital expenditures for the next months and the foreseeable future 
as of december   our contractual obligations were as follows dollars in thousands payment due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term liabilities reflected on our balance sheet under gaap total this amount represents amounts due under a hud insured mortgage 
this amount was paid in march these amounts represent minimum lease payments due to senior housing under two leases through this amount represents two properties we agreed to purchase from senior housing 
we expect to finance this transaction with proceeds we receive from new hud insured mortgages and by borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
theseamountsinclude liabilities for continuing care contracts which require residents to make advance payments some of which are refundable and continuously carried as liabilities and some of which or not refundable and are carried as liabilities until they are recognized as revenues over the periods during which we expect to provide the service 
these amounts also include insurance reserves related to workers compensation and professional liability insurance as well as deferred gains related to property and fixed asset sales 
debt instruments and covenants in october  we entered into a revolving credit facility 
the interest rate on borrowings on this facility is libor plus a spread 
the maximum amount available under this facility is million  and is subject to limitations based upon qualifying collateral 
the borrower under this facility is a subsidiary that we organized with the intention that it be bankruptcy remote 
certain of our other subsidiaries sell or contribute their accounts receivable to the borrower on a true sale basis and make certain representations and other undertakings in favor of the borrower in connection with each sale 
the seller subsidiaries have granted security interests in their assets to secure their obligations to the borrower 
we guarantee the obligations of the seller subsidiaries obligations to the borrower subsidiary and have pledged the stock or membership interests in each of the seller subsidiaries to the borrower 
the borrower has in turn collaterally assigned these undertakings  guarantees and collateral to the revolving credit facility lenders  and has granted a security interest in the purchased receivables and all of its other assets to secure its obligations under the facility 
the facility is available for acquisitions  working capital and general business purposes 
the facility contains covenants and events of default requiring the maintenance of collateral  minimum net worth and certain other financial ratios  and places limits on our ability to incur or assume debt or create liens with respect to certain of our properties  and other customary provisions 
the accounts receivable collateralizing the facility totaled million  net of allowances of million  as of december  in certain circumstances and subject to available collateral and lender approvals the maximum amounts which we may draw under this credit agreement may be increased to million 
the termination date of the facility is october  as of december   million was outstanding under the facility 
at march   we believe we are in compliance with all applicable covenants under this revolving credit agreement and no amounts were outstanding under the facility 
in connection with our october acquisition of a community  we assumed two hud insured mortgages totaling approximately million 
in december  we prepaid one million mortgage 
in march  the second million mortgage was prepaid 
related party transactions on december   senior housing distributed substantially all of its ownership of our shares to its shareholders of record on december  in order to effect this spin off and to govern relations after the spin off  we entered into agreements with senior housing  pursuant to which it was agreed that so long as senior housing remains a reit  we may not waive the share ownership restrictions in our charter on the ability of any person or group to acquire more than of any class of our equity shares without  among other requirements  the consent of senior housing and our determination that the exception to the ownership limitations would not cause a default under any of our leases  so long as we are a tenant of senior housing  we will neither permit any person or group to acquire more than of any class of our voting stock or permit the occurrence of other change in control events  as defined  nor will we take any action that  in the reasonable judgment of senior housing or hrpt properties trust  or hrpt  might jeopardize the tax status of senior housing or hrpt as a reit  senior housing has the option  upon the acquisition by a person or group of more than of our voting stock and upon other change in control events  as defined  to cancel all of our rights under the leases we have with senior housing  and so long as we maintain our shared services agreement with rmr or are a tenant under a lease with senior housing then we will not acquire or finance any real estate without first giving senior housing  hrpt  hospitality properties trust  or hpt  or any other publicly owned reit or other entity managed by rmr the opportunity to acquire or finance real estate investments of the type in which senior housing  hrpt  hpt or any other publicly owned reit or other entity managed by rmr  respectively  invest 
at the time of our spin off from senior housing  all of the persons serving as our directors were trustees of senior housing 
two of our current directors  messrs 
martin and portnoy  are current trustees of senior housing 
as of march   we lease senior living communities from senior housing for total annual minimum rent of million 
during  we and senior housing were jointly involved in litigation with marriott and msls  the operator of of the senior living communities which we leased from senior housing 
we and senior housing equally shared the costs of this litigation 
this litigation was settled in january since january   we have entered or agreed to enter into several transactions with senior housing  including the following during  pursuant to the terms of our leases with senior housing  senior housing purchased million of improvements to its properties leased by us  and the annual rent payable to senior housing was increased by of the amounts invested  or million 
in march  one of senior housing s private company tenants defaulted on its lease for a nursing home in missouri 
senior housing terminated this lease and engaged us to manage this property for senior housing s account 
currently this property is listed for sale or lease 
we are paid a management fee of of the gross revenues at this nursing home  totaling  through december  in may  senior housing purchased from an unrelated third party three assisted living properties with living units located in virginia for million 
in september  we sold senior housing one independent living property with units in california for million  its appraised value 
these four properties were added to an existing lease with senior housing for nine other independent and assisted living properties 
the minimum rent for the properties included in this lease was increased by million per year 
all other terms of the lease remained unchanged 
in july  we agreed to buy two nursing homes in michigan that we leased from senior housing 
the purchase price is million  the appraised value of the properties 
these two properties are leased on a combined basis with other nursing home properties 
under the terms of our lease with senior housing  upon consummation of the sale  the annual rent payable under the combined lease will be reduced by of the net proceeds that senior housing received from the sale 
we expect this purchase to occur during the first half of however  this sale is contingent upon our obtaining department of housing and urban development insured financing for this purchase  and this sale may not close because of a failure of this condition or for some other reason 
on march   senior housing purchased from us one independent and assisted living community with units located in maryland 
the purchase price was million  the appraised value of the property 
simultaneous with this purchase  our existing leases with senior housing were modified as follows the lease for nursing homes and the lease for independent and assisted living communities were combined into one lease and the property acquired on march  was added to this combined lease  the combined lease maturity date was changed to december  from december  and for the separate leases  our minimum rent for the combined lease of nursing homes and independent living communities was increased by million per year  for all of our leases with senior housing  the amount of additional rent to be paid to senior housing was changed to of the increase in revenues at the leased properties beginning in prior to the lease combination  the percentage and the beginning time period for the nursing home lease and the independent and assisted living community lease was and and and  respectively  and all other lease terms remain substantially unchanged 
we obtained a workers compensation insurance policy for the year beginning june   from a third party insurer 
this third party insurer ceded a portion of the premiums we paid to a bermuda based company  affiliates insurers  limited  or affiliates  which was owned by rmr 
affiliates was organized by rmr to assist us in creating a partial self insurance program on an expedited basis 
on december   we acquired affiliates from rmr for an amount equal to rmr s cost of organizing and capitalizing that company  approximately million 
our chief executive officer and chief financial officer are also officers and employees of rmr 
these officers devote a substantial majority of their business time to our affairs and the remainder to rmr s business which is separate from our business 
we believe the compensation we pay to these officers reasonably reflects their division of business time  however  periodically  these individuals may divide their business time differently than they do currently and their compensation from us may become disproportionate to this division 
rmr provides investment  management and administrative services to us under a shared services agreement which is subject to renewal annually 
rmr is compensated at an annual rate equal to of our total revenues 
aggregate fees earned by rmr for services during were million 
the fact that rmr has responsibilities to other entities  including our landlord  senior housing  could create conflicts  and in the event of such conflicts between senior housing and us  the shared services agreement allows rmr to act on behalf of senior housing rather than on our behalf 
rmr is owned by messrs 
martin and portnoy who are our managing directors 
messrs 
martin and portnoy each have material interests in the transactions between us and rmr described above 
all transactions between us and rmr are approved by our independent directors 
our independent directors have approved the renewal of the shared services agreement for its current term which will end december  messrs 
martin and portnoy own the building in which our headquarters is located 
our lease for space was originally executed by fsq  inc this lease expires in during  we paid rent under this lease of  until march   mr 
portnoy was a partner of sullivan worcester llp  our counsel and counsel to senior housing  rmr and affiliates of each of the foregoing  and he received payments from that firm during in respect of his retirement 
critical accounting policies our critical accounting policies concern revenue recognition  our assessment of the net realizable value of our accounts receivable  the realizable value of long term assets  accounting for long term care contracts  accounting for business combinations and our assessment of reserves related to our self insurance programs 
our revenue recognition policies involve judgments about medicare and medicaid rate calculation methodologies 
these judgments are based principally upon our experience with these programs and our knowledge and familiarity with the current rules and regulations of these programs 
we recognize revenues when services are provided and these amounts are reported at their estimated net realizable amounts 
some medicare and medicaid revenues are subject to audit and retroactive adjustment 
our policies for valuing accounts receivable involve significant judgments based upon our experience  including consideration of the age of the receivable  the terms of the agreements with our residents or their third party payors  the resident or payors stated intent to pay  the resident or payors financial capacity and other factors which may include litigation or appeal proceedings 
we monitor our long term assets to determine whether any impairment of these assets may have occurred 
if the facts and circumstances indicate that an impairment may have occurred  we evaluate the asset s carrying value to determine whether an impairment charge is required 
this process includes a review of historical and projected future financial results realized or to be realized from the affected assets  market conditions affecting the sale of similar assets and the like 
this process requires that estimates be made and errors in our judgments or estimates could have a material effect on our financial statements 
at certain of our facilities  we offer long term care contracts under which residents pay a one time deposit in exchange for reduced charges during their stay 
the one time deposits may be refundable or non refundable  or partially refundable and partially non refundable 
we record such deposits as a long term obligation and amortize the non refundable portion of such deposits into revenue over our estimate of the periods during which future services will be provided 
we base these estimates on our experience and actuarial information 
during and  we began to lease or acquire senior living communities and as of march  we lease or own a total of communities 
we accounted for each of these transactions as a purchase business combination in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
purchase accounting requires that we make certain judgments and estimates based on our experience  including determining the fair value and useful lives of assets acquired and the fair value of liabilities assumed 
some of our judgments and estimates are also based upon published industry statistics 
our critical accounting policies for determining reserves for the self funded part of our insurance programs and for our self insurance programs involve significant judgments based upon our experience  including projected settlements for pending claims  known incidents which we expect may result in claims  estimates of incurred but not yet reported claims and incidents  claims experience  estimated litigation costs and other factors 
we also periodically receive and rely upon recommendations from professional consultants in establishing these reserves 
in the future we may need to revise the judgments  estimates and assessments we use to formulate our critical accounting policies to incorporate information which is not now known 
we cannot predict the effect changes to these premises underlying our critical accounting policies may have on our future results of operations  although such changes could be material and adverse 
inflation and deflation inflation in the past several years in the us has been modest 
future inflation might have both positive or negative impacts on our business 
rising price levels may allow us to increase occupancy charges to residents  but may also cause our operating costs  including our percentage rent  to increase 
also our ability to increase rates paid by medicare and medicaid will be limited despite inflation 
deflation would likely have a negative impact upon us 
a large component of our expenses consist of minimum rental obligations to senior housing 
accordingly we believe that a general decline in price levels which could cause our charges to residents to decline would likely not be fully offset by a decline in our expenses 
seasonality our business is subject to modest effects of seasonality 
during the calendar fourth quarter holiday periods nursing home and assisted living residents are sometimes discharged to join family celebrations and admission decisions are often deferred 
the first quarter of each calendar year usually coincides with increased illness among nursing home and assisted living residents which can result in increased costs or discharges to hospitals 
as a result of these factors  nursing home and assisted living operations sometimes produce greater earnings in the second and third quarters of a calendar year and lesser earnings in the first and fourth quarters 
we do not believe that this seasonality will cause fluctuations in our revenues or operating cash flow to such an extent that we will have difficulty paying our expenses  including rent  which do not fluctuate seasonally 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to risks associated with market changes in interest rates 
we manage our exposure to this market risk through our monitoring of available financing alternatives 
our strategy to manage exposure to changes in interest rates is unchanged since december  other than as described below we do not now anticipate any significant changes in our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates or in how we manage this risk in the future 
changes in market interest rates also affect the fair value of our debt obligations  increases in market interest rates decrease the fair value of our fixed rate debt  while decreases in market interest rates increase the fair value of our fixed rate debt 
for example based upon discounted cash flow analysis  if prevailing interest rates were to decline by and other credit market considerations remained unchanged  the market value of our million mortgage debt outstanding on december   would increase by about  and  similarly  if prevailing interest rates were to increase by  the market value of our million mortgage debt would decline by about  our revolving credit facility bears interest at floating rates and matures in october as of december   we had million outstanding under this revolving credit facility 
we borrow in us dollars and borrowings under our revolving credit facility are subject to interest at libor plus a spread 
accordingly  we are vulnerable to changes in us dollar based short term rates  specifically libor 
a change in interest rates would not affect the value of any outstanding floating rate debt but would affect our operating results 
for example  if the maximum amount of our credit facility of million were drawn and interest rates decrease or increase by per annum  our interest expense would decrease or increase by  per year  or per share  respectively 
if interest rates were to change gradually over time  the impact would be spread over time 
our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates may increase in the future if we incur debt to fund acquisitions or otherwise 
as of march   we have no commercial paper  derivatives  swaps  hedges  joint ventures or partnerships
