our primary customers include large defense prime contractors including raytheon  northrop grumman  lockheed martin and boeing  the us government including the department of defense  nasa and other us government agencies and international customers including the egyptian  german  japanese and south korean militaries and suppliers to international militaries 
we are a leading provider of microwave technologies for use in command and control systems  flight instrumentation  weapons sensors and electronic warfare systems 
we have served the defense industry since by designing and manufacturing microwave devices for use in high technology defense electronics applications 
our products and systems are currently deployed on a wide range of high profile military platforms  including the f falcon  the f a e f super hornet  the rc rivet joint  the e c hawkeye  the aegis class surface combatants  the ea b prowler  the amraam air to air missile  and unmanned aerial vehicles  or uavs  as well as high priority national security programs such as national missile defense and the trident ii d the following table sets forth for the periods indicated certain financial information derived from our consolidated statements of income expressed as a percentage of net sales 
there can be no assurance that trends in sales growth or operating results will continue in the future

this increase also includes revenue from products shipped under new programs as well as increases on legacy products and programs 
net sales in commercial technologies increased by  which includes revenue attributable to the acquisition of cti of  offset by a decrease of  in medical and scientific products due to the decline in demand in the industry for magnetic resonance imaging and nuclear magnetic resonance systems 
as a result  we expect revenues in medical and scientific products to remain relatively flat 
the gross profit margin for the weeks ended august  was as compared to the margin of in fiscal gross profit increased  primarily as a result of increased volume over fiscal and greater absorption of fixed costs 
margins also improved in microwave components due to production efficiencies  including the automation of certain processes 
this improvement was offset by lower margins on revenue relating to engineering programs which are essential for long term technology development and future revenue growth 
in addition  consolidated gross profit margins were negatively impacted by approximately one half percent due to revisions in total cost estimates including the effect of foreign exchange translations on non sterling denominated contracts at our ewst subsidiary in the uk 
selling and administrative expenses for the fifty two weeks ended august  were of net sales as compared to in fiscal there was a net increase in expenses of  which includes expenses of cti of approximately  an increase in incentive compensation under employment contracts and discretionary bonuses of  and additional administrative and business development personnel and related costs of  the company reorganized and expanded its business development group to focus and capitalize on worldwide market opportunities for all of its products 
other increases include amortization of acquired intangibles of  sales representative fees and commissions of  and  in consulting fees primarily in connection with our sarbanes oxley  section preparation which will continue in fiscal litigation costs in fiscal increased  from the level incurred in fiscal these costs are directly related to the robinson labs litigation and include a payment of the jury award to ben robinson of approximately  in july we do not anticipate our litigation costs in connection with this matter to be significant in the future

income from operations for the year was  or of net sales  as compared to  or of net sales in fiscal the decrease in operating income is primarily attributable to the increases in selling and administrative expenses and litigation costs as discussed above 
in addition  our foreign operations contributed  in operating income for the year as compared to  in fiscal revenues from our foreign operations decreased by  as compared to fiscal the drop in revenue and operating income within our foreign operations was due to revisions in total cost estimates including the effect of foreign exchange translations on non sterling denominated contracts at our ewst subsidiary in the uk 
investment income decreased by  in fiscal as a result of a decline in the rate of interest earned on the investment of excess cash reserves during the fiscal year as compared to interest rates in fiscal  and a decrease on average of approximately  in funds invested 
the net foreign exchange loss of  in fiscal is attributable to the weaker us dollar during the fiscal year causing our foreign denominated liabilities to increase in value  and the us dollar denominated contracts in the united kingdom to decrease in value 
in addition  we recorded an unrealized gain on us dollar denominated loans to ewst which are expected to be repaid during fiscal the realized and unrealized exchange gains and losses are as follows gain loss unrealized realized foreign denominated liabilities   us dollar denominated contracts in the united kingdom  other foreign exchange transactions  us dollar denominated loans to ewst  the effective income tax rate for fiscal was as compared to in fiscal the overall effective tax rate is lower than the statutory income tax rate of in fiscal due to various favorable tax benefits including a lower effective tax rate on foreign source income  the tax benefit attributable to extra territorial income  and research and development credits 
fiscal compared to fiscal net sales for the weeks ended august  were approximately  compared to  for fiscal the net sales increase of  is attributable to increased revenue in defense electronics of  including  through the acquisition of ewst  offset by a decrease of  in commercial technologies 
gross profit of for the weeks ended august  is slightly better than the prior year of 
we benefited from increased absorption of fixed overhead costs and production efficiencies  including automation of certain processes 
offsetting these benefits was the increased investment in product development up from approximately million in fiscal to million in fiscal in addition  the margins on the ewst sales were lower than our historical margins 
selling and administrative expenses for the weeks ended august  were of net sales as compared to in fiscal there was a net increase in expenses of  which includes expenses of ewst of  and increases in incentive compensation under employment contracts of  amortization of acquired intangibles of  related to ewst  audit and tax fees of  payroll costs of  and travel expenses of  offset by a decrease in commissions and fees of  various other line item expenses increased during the weeks ended august  by  on a net basis

see item legal proceedings 
plant closing costs in connection with the facilities in nashua  nh and anaheim  ca were accrued in october in the amount of  of which  was paid as of august  other income increased on a net basis approximately  from the prior year primarily due to interest earned on the investment of cash reserves including the proceeds of approximately  received from the sale of common stock to the public at the end of april the effective income tax rate for fiscal was as compared to in fiscal the overall effective tax rate is lower than the statutory income tax rate of due to various favorable tax benefits including a lower effective tax rate on foreign source income and the tax benefit attributable to extra territorial income 
discontinued operations we entered into an agreement effective as of the close of business september   to acquire all of the issued and outstanding common stock of terrasat  inc terrasat  a california corporation for cash in the amount of   of which was paid in december and  of which was paid in december in addition  the agreement provided for additional cash payments in the future up to  based on gross revenues through december  the targeted gross revenues under the agreement were not achieved  therefore no additional cash payments were required 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
sfas no supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  but retains the fundamental provisions of statement for a recognition and measurement of the impairment of long lived assets to be held and used and b measurement of long lived assets to be disposed of by sale 
sfas also supersedes the accounting and reporting provisions of apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions  for segments of a business to be disposed of  but retains the requirement of opinion to report discontinued operations separately from continuing operations  and extends that reporting to a component of an entity that either has been disposed of by sale  by abandonment  or in a distribution to owners or is classified as held for sale 
the provisions of this statement were adopted by us effective on july  in january we decided to discontinue the operations of terrasat and to seek a buyer for the business 
we believed that terrasat would not be able to generate sufficient returns to justify continued investment due to the overcapacity in the telecom industry and deteriorating economic conditions in terrasat s primary markets 
consequently  the accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect terrasat as discontinued operations in accordance with sfas no 
results of operations and cash flows of terrasat have been classified as loss from discontinued operations  and net cash provided by discontinued operations  respectively 
the sale of certain assets and liabilities  and the business of terrasat was consummated on march   effective the close of business january   to certain current employees of terrasat for cash and a note which approximates the carrying value of the net assets held for sale as of january  of change in accounting principle in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets which requires the use of a non amortization approach to account for purchased goodwill and certain intangibles 
under a non amortization approach  goodwill will not be amortized into results of operations  but instead will be reviewed for impairment which will be charged to results of operations in the periods in which the recorded value of goodwill is more than its fair value 
the provisions of this statement were adopted by us on july  the adoption of sfas no 
resulted in our discontinuation of amortization of goodwill as of july  in connection with the adoption of sfas  we were required to assess goodwill for impairment within six months of adoption  and we completed our assessment in the second quarter of fiscal we operate as a single integrated business and as such have one operating segment which is also the reportable segment as defined in sfas within the operating segment in fiscal  we identified two components as reporting units as defined under sfas  defense electronics and commercial technologies 
we determined the carrying value of each reporting unit by assigning assets and liabilities  including the existing goodwill and intangible assets  to those reporting units as of july  in january  we decided to discontinue the operations of terrasat the only business in the commercial technologies reporting unit  and to seek a buyer for the business 
in connection with this decision in fiscal  we determined that an impairment of goodwill in the commercial technologies unit had occurred 
accordingly  a transition adjustment in the amount of  was recorded as of july  as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
there was no tax benefit associated with the adjustment since the impaired goodwill is not deductible for income tax purposes 
an impairment test based on a single reporting unit was performed in the fourth quarter of fiscal using our current market capitalization  which in an active market for our common stock  we consider a reasonable indication of implied fair value 
based on this initial step in the test for impairment  we concluded there was no impairment of goodwill at august  an annual impairment test will be performed in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year  or when an indication of impairment exists  and any future impairment of goodwill will be charged to operations

the gross margin percentage in the fourth quarter of was negatively impacted as compared to due to revisions in total cost estimates on certain long term contracts at our ewst subsidiary  offset by an improvement in margins at one of our other facilities in the us due to costs incurred in last year s fourth quarter in connection with the start up of a new product line at that facility 
in addition  the gross profit margin also varies from quarter to quarter due to changes in product mix 
included in the results of the fourth quarter of is a million pretax payment in connection with the robinson labs litigation

liquidity and capital resources as of august  and august   working capital was  and  respectively  and the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was to and to  respectively 
as is customary in the defense industry  inventory is partially financed by progress payments 
in addition  it is customary for us to receive advanced payments from customers on major contracts at the time a contract is entered into 
the unliquidated balance of these advanced payments was approximately  at august   and  at august  net cash provided by continuing operations was approximately  in fiscal as compared to  in significant items contributing to the sources of funds include the following income from operations  in fiscal as as adjusted for depreciation and compared to  in amortization 
fiscal increase in accounts payable and  due to growth of business 
accrued expenses increase in billings in excess of  due to growth of business and in costs incurred on certain contacts incorporating payments uncompleted contracts in advance of costs incurred 
the following major items offset the sources of funds noted above funds invested in  due to growth of business 
increases in accounts receivable increase in costs incurred  due to growth of business  including exercise of options on and income recognized existing contracts  plus the impact of foreign exchange in excess of billings on translation of costs on certain contacts at ewst to us uncompleted contracts dollars 
funds invested in  due to growth of business  including engineering costs increases in inventory incurred on new contracts with customers such as the icap program and certain high power amplifier contracts  plus the impact of foreign exchange translation of inventory costs at ewst to us dollars 
costs incurred and income recognized in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts are classified in the financial statements as current assets 
we expect to bill and collect substantially all costs incurred and income recognized in excess of billings within one year 
however  we anticipate that it will incur additional costs and recognize income on uncompleted contracts in the future  as new contracts are negotiated 
net cash used in investing activities was approximately  in fiscal as compared to approximately  in fiscal cash used in investing activities in fiscal consists of  for capital expenditures  and  for the acquisition of cti 
in connection with the acquisition of ewst as of september   we issued a note for  pounds sterling  including interest at  payable in annual installments of  pounds sterling beginning october  based on the spot rate of exchange at august  of the us dollar equivalent of the annual installments is approximately  during the fiscal year ended august   we received approximately  from the exercise of common stock options by employees 
on may  we announced an expansion of the stock repurchase program initially announced in october from  to an aggregate of  shares 
as of august   we acquired approximately  shares of common stock under this program at an aggregate cost of approximately  in june  we entered into a new  revolving credit loan agreement with two banks on an unsecured basis which may be used for general corporate purposes  including business acquisitions 
the revolving credit facility requires the payment of interest only on a monthly basis and payment of the outstanding principal balance on january  as amended 
we may elect to borrow up to a maximum of  with interest based on the federal funds target rate plus a margin of to  or up to a maximum of  with interest based on libor plus a margin of to 
the applicable incremental margin is based on the ratio of total liabilities to tangible net worth  as those terms are defined in the agreement 
the federal funds target rate and the libor rate was and  respectively  at august  there is a fee of basis points per annum on the unused portion of the  libor based portion of the credit facility payable quarterly 
there were no borrowings under the line at august  and august  stand by letters of credit were outstanding in the amount of  under the credit facility at august  we believe that presently anticipated future cash requirements will be provided by internally generated funds  our existing unsecured credit facility  and existing cash reserves 
a significant portion of our revenue for fiscal will be generated from our existing backlog of sales orders 
the backlog of orders at august  was approximately million 
all orders included in backlog are covered by signed contracts or purchase orders 
nevertheless  contracts involving government programs may be terminated at the discretion of the government 
in the event of the cancellation of a significant amount of government contracts included in our backlog  we will be required to rely more heavily on cash reserves and our existing credit facility to fund our operations 
we are not aware of any events which are reasonably likely to result in any cancellation of its government contracts 
we have approximately  available under our bank credit facility  net of outstanding stand by letters of credit of approximately  and cash reserves at august  of approximately  contractual obligations and commitments our obligations and commitments to make future payments under contracts  such as purchase orders  and debt and lease agreements  and under contingent commitments  such as stand by letters of credit are as follows we have outstanding an aggregate of approximately  in open purchase orders as of august  these open purchase orders represent executory contracts for the purchase of goods and services which will be substantially fulfilled in the next six months 
future payments required on long term debt are as follows in thousands during industrial fiscal mortgage revenue ewst year total note bonds note other future    minimum annual rentals under noncancellable operating leases are as follows in thousands during fiscal year amount future stand by letters of credit expire as follows in thousands during fiscal year amount in addition  we have employment agreements with certain executives of the company which expire december   subject to extension for additional one year periods annually each january with a final expiration date of december  the agreements provide for aggregate annual salaries as of august  of  and provide for a semi annual cost of living adjustment based on the consumer price index 
the agreements also provide for incentive compensation at in the aggregate of pretax income of the company 
the agreements also provide that  in the event there is a change in control of the company  the executives have the option to terminate the agreements and receive a lump sum payment equal to the sum of the salary payable for the remainder of the employment term  plus the annual bonuses based on the average of the three highest annual bonuses awarded during the ten preceding years for the remainder of the employment term 
as of august   the amount payable in the event of such termination would be approximately  the agreements also provide for consulting periods  one for five and one for ten years  at the end of the employment period at an annual compensation equivalent to one half of the executive s annual salary at the end of the employment period  subject to annual cost of living adjustments 
critical accounting policies and estimates our established policies are outlined in the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements entitled summary of significant accounting policies contained in part ii  item of this form k 
as part of our oversight responsibilities  we continually evaluate the propriety of our accounting methods as new events occur 
we believe that our policies are applied in a manner which is intended to provide the user of our financial statements a current  accurate and complete presentation of information in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
important accounting practices that require the use of assumptions and judgments are outlined below 
we generally recognize revenue when products are shipped and the customer takes ownership and assumes risk of loss  collection of the relevant receivable is probable  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists and the sales price is fixed or determinable 
payments received from customers in advance of products delivered are recorded as customer advance payments until earned 
substantially all of our customer contracts are firm  fixed price contracts  providing for a predetermined fixed price for the products sold  regardless of the costs incurred 
approximately to of revenues over the last three fiscal years were derived from long term  fixed price contracts for which revenues and estimated profits are recognized using the percentage of completion method of accounting based on estimated completion to date the total contract amount multiplied by the percentage of performance  based on total costs incurred in relation to total estimated cost at completion 
contract costs include all direct material and labor costs and those indirect costs related to contract performance 
selling  general and administrative costs are charged to expense as incurred 
risks and uncertainties inherent in the estimation process could affect the amounts reported in our financial statements 
the key assumptions used in the estimate of costs to complete relate to labor costs and indirect costs required to complete the contract 
the estimate of rates and hours as well as the application of overhead costs is reviewed on a regular basis 
if our business conditions were different  or if we used different assumptions in the application of this and other accounting policies  it is likely that materially different amounts would be reported on our financial statements 
prospective losses on long term contracts are based upon the anticipated excess of costs over the selling price of the remaining units to be delivered and are recorded in the period when first determinable 
actual losses could differ from those estimated due to changes in the ultimate costs and contract terms 
inventories are stated at lower of cost principally first in  first out or market 
a valuation allowance for obsolete and slow moving inventory is established based upon an aging of raw material components 
current requirements for raw materials are evaluated based on current backlog of orders for products in which the components are used and anticipated future orders 
under the non amortization approach in accounting for goodwill under sfas no 
 goodwill is not amortized into results of operations but instead is reviewed for impairment and written down and charged to results of operations in the period in which the recorded value of goodwill is more than its fair value 
an annual impairment test is performed in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year  or when an indication of impairment exists  and any impairment of goodwill is charged to operations 
an impairment test based on a single reporting unit was performed in the fourth quarter of fiscal using our current market capitalization  which in an active market for our common stock  we consider a reasonable indication of implied fair value 
based on this initial step in the test for impairment  we concluded there was no impairment of goodwill at august  provisions for federal  foreign  state and local income taxes are calculated on reported financial statement pretax income based on current tax law and also include the cumulative effect of any changes in tax rates from those used previously in determining deferred tax assets and liabilities 
such provisions differ from the amounts currently payable because certain items of income and expense are recognized in different time periods for financial reporting purposes than for income tax purposes 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to market risk associated with foreign currency exchange and changes in interest rates 
we have not entered into any market risk sensitive instruments for trading purposes 
since the acquisitions of general microwave corporation and ewst  we are subject to movements in foreign currency rate changes related to our operations in israel and in england 
the movements in the israeli shekel versus the us dollar have not been significant 
movements in pounds sterling the functional currency at ewst have been more significant 
based on our historical results and expected future results  ewst accounts for approximately to of our total revenues  based in part on the rate at which ewst s sterling denominated financial statements have been or will be converted into us dollars 
since its acquisition in fiscal year  ewst has contributed approximately to our consolidated operating income 
having a portion of our future revenue and income denominated in sterling exposes us to market risk with respect to fluctuations in the us dollar value of future sterling denominated revenue and earnings 
a decline in the average value of sterling in fiscal  for example  would have reduced sales by approximately  and would have decreased our consolidated operating income by approximately  due to the reduction in the us dollar value of ewst s sales and operating income 
we have a foreign denominated liability as of august  of approximately  pounds sterling in connection with the acquisition of ewst that is subject to foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
based on the spot rate of exchange at august  of  the us dollar equivalent of the liability is approximately  we have made inter company advances to ewst in the aggregate amount of approximately million at august  that were previously considered long term advances 
however  since the advances are denominated in us dollars and ewst anticipates reducing the amount of advances during fiscal year  the amount outstanding is subject to foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
in october  we entered into an interest rate swap with a bank pursuant to which it exchanged floating rate interest in connection with the bonds discussed in note h of the financial statements on a notional amount of  for a fixed rate of for a year period ending october  the notional amount reduces each year in tandem with the annual installments due on the bonds 
the fixing of the interest rate for this period offsets our exposure to the uncertainty of floating interest rates on the bonds  and as such has been designated as a cash flow hedge 
the hedge is deemed to be highly effective and any ineffectiveness will be recognized in interest expense in the reporting period 
the fair value of the interest rate swap was a liability of approximately  as of august  there was no material hedge ineffectiveness related to cash flow hedges during the fiscal years presented to be recognized in earnings 
we also have a  revolving credit loan agreement with two banks on an unsecured basis which may be used for general corporate purposes  including business acquisitions 
the revolving credit facility requires the payment of interest only on a monthly basis and payment of the outstanding principal balance on january  we may elect to borrow up to a maximum of  with interest based on the federal funds target rate plus a margin of to  or up to a maximum of  with interest based on libor plus a margin of to 
the applicable incremental margin is based on the ratio of total liabilities to tangible net worth  as those terms are defined in the agreement 
the federal funds target rate and the libor rate was and  respectively  at august  the credit line is reviewed on an annual basis 
there were no borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility as of august  the table below provides information about our debt that is sensitive to changes in interest rates 
future principal payment cash flows by maturity date as required under the industrial revenue bonds  and corresponding fair value is as follows fiscal year ending bonds and later  fair value  we do not anticipate any other material changes in its primary market risk exposures in fiscal
