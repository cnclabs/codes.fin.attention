item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations was a challenging year for the company as the fluid power industry lagged the recovery in the overall domestic economy for most of the year 
this improved  however  with the anticipated rebound in sales in the fourth quarter 
the net loss for included approximately million of expenses and charges related to a production problem at one of our plants that has since been corrected  charges related to inventory  receivables and fixed assets in our international segment  and charges related to the downsizing of our labor force 
we believe our continued investment in new products and product enhancements and our ongoing emphasis on reducing operating costs position the company for improvement during a sustained recovery in our industry 
discussion of results of operations shipments  orders backlog net orders percentage increase decrease net sales shipments percentage increase decrease backlog at december percentage increase decrease although the domestic economy started to recover in  the fluid power industry is lagging in that recovery 
our net orders in decreased by when compared to in our european segment received a large order for approximately  to supply equipment on a new forging press being installed in central france 
this single order distorts the comparisons of orders between the periods being reported 
excluding this individual order from the total  net orders for would have increased by when compared to approximately of the net orders were sold by our european segment and therefore were subject to translation from euros and british pounds which further distorts the year to year comparison as the euro and british pound average exchange rate increased from their average by approximately and  respectively 
when orders in each geographic segment are compared to  the domestic segment increased by approximately  the european segment decreased by approximately and the international segment increased by approximately 
the increase in the domestic segment resulted from an increase in custom engineered orders for integrated hydraulic and electrical products used on extrusion presses and products used on the atlas v rocket program in the aerospace industry 
the large order discussed above was the primary reason for the decrease in european orders in if that order is taken out of the calculation  european segment orders increased by approximately in orders for integrated hydraulic and electrical products used in aluminum extrusion and forging applications were the reason for the increase in orders in the international segment 
net sales increased by when compared to when comparing net sales to by segment  the domestic segment increased by  the european segment increased by and the international segment decreased by 
excluding the effect of favorable foreign exchange rates on sales  net sales for increased by over the economic condition in the fluid power industry was the primary reason net sales  measured in local currencies  remained relatively flat in roughly of the approximately  forging press order entered in was recognized through net sales in the year end backlog was affected by all of the above mentioned factors 
it decreased by  or  from the year end of the large contract received in france was the primary reason for the increase in net orders in compared to without this contract net orders would have decreased by in the continued low level of customer spending for capital goods in in the domestic and international geographic segments was the primary cause for an approximately decrease in net sales from engineered construction contracts 
this low level of spending caused the domestic and international segments net sales to decrease approximately and  respectively  from the weaker dollar against the british pound sterling and the euro helped the european segment s net sales to increase by approximately from gross profit gross profit gross profit margin percentage increase decrease gross profit increased by in when compared to gross profit margin also increased in from to despite the approximately  of added costs incurred from a manufacturing quality problem at our fremont plant 
by the end of  that quality problem was substantially alleviated 
the cost savings from closing plants  outsourcing to low cost vendors  a favorable union contract  the use of lean manufacturing techniques and a more favorable mix of products with higher profit margins have all helped to improve the gross profit margin 
the large decrease in net sales in  together with relatively high aggregate sales of products with lower profit margins  were the primary reasons for the decrease in gross profit margin to in from in to offset the decrease in net sales  the company reduced its labor force by approximately in total in  including an approximately decrease in the domestic segment  reduced pay to salaried workers  kept overtime pay to a minimum  outsourced items made in our factories to lower cost vendors  installed lean manufacturing techniques in our factories  negotiated a more favorable three year union contract  and in late  closed our factory in longview  texas 
these cost decreases were partially offset by cost increases in healthcare benefits  insurance  energy  pension benefits and unfavorable utilization variances created by the lower utilization of our production facilities 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses    less research and development    selling  general and administrative less research and development    percentage increase decrease percentage of net sales selling  general and administrative expenses  less research and development  increased by or  in when the local foreign currency expenses were converted to us dollars using the average exchange rate the expenses were approximately  higher than the expenses would have been if they were converted using the average exchange rate 
this was the primary reason for the increase in another factor that increased these expenses in was the approximately  increase in pension costs allocated to selling  general and administrative expenses 
these increases were partially offset by an approximately  reduction in charges related to various headcount reductions and other exit costs recorded in and selling  general and administrative expenses increased by in compared to the increase in expenses was caused primarily by cost increases in healthcare benefits  insurance and pension benefits 
in addition  the company incurred  more in charges related to various headcount reductions and other exit costs in than in these increases were offset by company programs to decrease expenses  which included downsizing the labor force  reducing pay to salaried workers  keeping overtime pay to a minimum  and decreasing employee benefits 
translating stronger foreign currencies into us dollars  the euro up  the british pound sterling up and the average of all the other foreign currencies in our international segment up slightly increased operating expenses when compared to and also offset the decreases made to operating expenses in included in selling  general and administrative expenses are startup expenses and net losses of approximately  for from osl offshore machinery and deck systems osl 
osl is a company we started to expand our oil and gas industry presence 
on december  we acquired the remaining interest in this company after absorbing of the net loss generated by osl in accordingly  we have consolidated osl s financial statements into our financial statements from the date we obtained majority ownership 
the company s research and development expenses totaled  which was a  increase over these expenses were  in compared to  in cost cutting programs in were the primary reason for the change in the company continues its commitment to the design and manufacture of new and more efficient hydraulic products to gain new customers and to new applications for the company s products 
interest expense increased by approximately  in as the result of increased interest rates compared to and decreased by  in  primarily due to the decrease in interest rates  compared to income tax effective rates were  and in  and  respectively 
in recent years  the company has recorded income tax expense on losses before income taxes and minority interest due to significant losses in the domestic segment that are not benefited for tax purposes  coupled with earnings and related income tax expense in the european and international segments 
in  the reserve for income tax exposure items was reduced by approximately  to an amount supported by the risk associated with the possible tax liability  which is the primary reason for the negative effective tax rate 
changes in the valuation allowance were the principal reason for the fluctuation in effective tax rate in also see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional reconciliation of the tax rates 
the net loss of  for was primarily the result of approximately  of costs related to the quality problems in our fremont factory  approximately  of charges relating to inventory  receivables and fixed assets written off in our international segment and  of employee termination and other exit costs 
the net loss of  for was the result of decreased net sales  a higher proportion of products with lower profit margins  employee termination and other exit costs of approximately  increased health care costs  increased pension costs  increased insurance costs   of losses and startup charges for osl  and increased competitive pressure due to a decrease in global capital expenditures 
outlook the fluid power industry data is starting to show signs of a recovery in the first two months of our net orders in the first two months of increased by approximately compared to the first two months of  and our backlog at february  is at a near record level of approximately  an increase of  or since december  a weaker us dollar has continued which should have a positive effect on net sales and gross margins in the european and international segments 
we have achieved substantial savings from cost cutting programs we have initiated during the past three years  ie reducing employment  cutting salaries  reducing benefits and hours  closing facilities in longview  texas  novi  michigan and bedford  england  and lower cost outsourcing 
however  increasing costs for healthcare  pension  insurance  and legal  auditing and other sarbanes oxley compliance costs will offset part of the savings 
as part of our cost reduction and efficiency improvement efforts  we are in the process of downsizing our facility in leeds  england and we expect to sign a lease to move these operations to a smaller  more efficient facility 
the lease will require the lessor to construct a building per our specifications on an already approved site 
the earliest we could move would be late in we have entered into a conditional contract with a developer to sell our existing facility for  british pound sterling 
the contract is contingent upon receiving government authorization to convert the property to residential use and for us to relocate to our new site 
we anticipate that the zoning will be changed at a meeting with the zoning commission in leeds scheduled for april the property has a zero carrying value so the transaction may provide a significant capital gain 
inflation and changing prices oilgear uses the lifo method of accounting for of its inventories and has reserves for obsolete and slow moving inventory 
approximately of the total assets of the company reside in the united states and western europe 
these assets are in operation and have been maintained in good condition through the years 
management believes that inflation has not significantly affected the net earnings loss reported by the company 
quarterly financial information unaudited first second third fourth net sales net loss basic loss per share of common stock diluted loss per share of common stock stock price low stock price high first second third fourth net sales net earnings loss basic earnings loss per share of common stock diluted earnings loss per share of common stock stock price low stock price high high and low sales prices in the nasdaq stock market or the nasdaq small cap stock market  as applicable 
financial condition and liquidity we signed an amended credit agreement in march which extended our credit agreement to april  and set covenants for and the first quarter of the amended credit agreement includes a term loan and a revolving line of credit facility 
the term loan balance at december  was  with an annual interest rate equal to the greater of or libor plus to basis points with payments equal to  per month 
the basis points added to libor are determined by the ratio of funded debt to ebitda  as defined in the agreement 
the revolving line of credit has a bank commitment of  at an annual interest rate equal to the greater of or libor plus to basis points 
the amount available under the  bank commitment is limited by a formula which is calculated on a weekly basis 
the formula includes only eligible domestic segment assets 
these assets include of qualifying trade receivables and of inventory limited to 
the variable interest rate at december  was 
these loans are secured by substantially all of the company s domestic assets 
the loan agreement contains various covenants that adjust over the term of the agreement 
the covenants in the new credit agreement include the following we may not make capital expenditures of greater than  for  we must maintain a minimum cumulative amount of ebitda as defined in the agreement as of the end of each quarter in  and we must also maintain cumulative monthly minimums of earnings and losses before income taxes and minority interest for and the first quarter of the covenants were set taking into account both the company s expected levels of capital expenditures and earnings for and early and the bank s requirements for debt service  but there are risks and uncertainties that could result in a shortfall 
if we do not meet the required minimums  the loans could be accelerated  and the company might not have sufficient liquid resources to satisfy these obligations 
the bank has waived all past covenant violations in connection with the extension of the credit facilities 
the consolidated balance sheets present the company s financial position at year end compared with the previous year end 
this financial presentation provides information intended to assist in assessing factors such as the company s liquidity and financial resources 
working capital current assets current liabilities working capital current ratio working capital increased slightly in  which was mostly due to the favorable affect from the conversion of foreign currencies 
the current ratio decreased to at december  from at december  the increase in short term borrowings and an increase in accounts payable in the united states were the primary reasons for the decrease in this ratio 
the company s working capital ratio is primarily driven by inventory values of  and  at december  and  respectively  which is not an easily liquidated asset 
capitalization interest bearing debt shareholders equity debt and equity ratio long term debt repayments have decreased interest bearing debt by  in but the increases in short term debt and current installments on long term debt increased interest bearing debt by  shareholders equity was negatively impacted during by i the consolidated net loss in of approximately  and ii the fact that lower discount rates increased the equity adjustment for minimum pension liability by  these negative items were more than offset by the effect of foreign currency rate changes during brought on by a weaker us dollar which caused a  increase in total shareholders equity 
in the fourth quarter of the company switched from the nasdaq national market to the nasdaq small cap stock market because of the decrease in the valuation of its stock 
the company s common stock is traded under the symbol olgr 
oilgear believes it is desirable for its employees to have an ownership interest in the company 
several programs that are described in note to the consolidated financial statements support this concept 
in december the company announced a stock buy back program for a total of  shares of common stock during the following three years 
the company bought and  shares in and  respectively 
no shares were repurchased in the company is currently negotiating the terms of new financing to replace its existing credit agreement 
the march amendment to the credit agreement requires a  fee if the company has not received a firm commitment for the new financing by april  we expect to obtain a firm commitment on or before that date  but this cannot yet be assured 
during  the company s leeds  england subsidiary negotiated a loan agreement with a local british bank with an availability of  british pounds approximately  to be drawn down in two  pound tranches 
the first tranche was taken in may the second tranche will be available when the leeds planning commission changes the zoning of the leeds property to residential 
the loan is secured by the existing land and building in leeds  england and is to be repaid when the sale of the leeds property is closed 
the interest rate applicable to this loan is libor plus  which was at december  for more information about our efforts to sell the leeds property  see outlook above in this section at december   the company had approximately  of unused borrowings available under its short term and long term credit facilities 
interest bearing debt increased by  at december  compared with year end the cash was used to fund the working capital needs and additions to property  plant and equipment 
net cash provided by operating activities was  in compared to  provided in and  provided in depreciation and amortization have decreased by  and  in and  respectively  because additions to plant and equipment are decreasing 
approximately  of cash was provided from trade accounts receivable in compared to  in the increase in work in process inventory resulting from an increase in net sales caused total inventories to increase and use  cash in the decrease in net sales in compared to was the primary reason cash was provided in and the decrease in customer deposits offset accounts receivable and was the primary reason cash was provided in the decrease in work in process inventory resulted from lower net sales and caused total inventories to decrease and provided  of cash in increased shipments in the fourth quarter of and slower payment of accounts payable were the primary reasons for the  and  respectively  of cash provided in and in  the contracts using percentage of completion had more billings and payments than accumulated costs and provided  of cash 
contracts using percentage of completion had more accumulated costs than billings in causing billings  costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts to use  of cash

there are no other off balance sheet arrangements 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions for the reporting period and as of the financial statement date 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
actual results could differ from those amounts 
a more complete description of our accounting policies is presented in note to the consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies are those that are important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results  and which require management to make difficult  subjective and or complex judgments 
critical accounting policies cover accounting matters that are inherently uncertain because the future resolution of such matters is unknown 
the company believes that critical accounting policies include accounting for percentage of completion contracts  accounting for allowances for doubtful accounts receivable  accounting for pensions and accounting for inventory obsolescence 
accounting for contracts using percentage of completion requires estimates of costs to complete each contract 
revenue earned is recorded based on accumulated incurred costs to total estimated costs to perform each contract 
management reviews these estimated costs on a monthly basis and revises costs and income recognized when changes in estimates occur 
to the extent the estimate of costs to complete varies  so does the timing of recording profits or losses on contracts 
management is required to make judgments  based on historical experience and future expectations  as to the collectibility of accounts receivable 
the allowance for doubtful accounts represent allowances for customer trade accounts receivable that are estimated to be partially or entirely uncollectible 
these allowances are used to reduce gross trade receivables to their net realizable value 
the company records these allowances based on estimates related to the following factors i customer specific allowances  ii amounts based upon an aging schedule  and iii an estimated amount  based on the company s historical experience  for issues not yet identified 
our accounting for pension benefits is primarily affected by our assumptions about the discount rate  expected and actual return on plan assets and other assumptions made by management  and is impacted by outside factors such as equity and fixed income market performance 
pension liability is principally the estimated present value of future benefits  net of plan assets 
pension expense is principally the sum of interest and service cost of the plan  less the expected return on plan assets and the amortization of the difference between our assumptions and actual experience 
the expected return on plan assets is calculated by applying an assumed rate of return to the fair value of plan assets 
if plan assets decline due to poor performance by the equity markets and or long term interest rates decline  as was experienced in and  our pension liability and cash funding requirements will increase  ultimately increasing future pension expense 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value and are categorized as raw materials  work in progress or finished goods 
inventory reserves are recorded for damaged  obsolete  excess and slow moving inventory 
management uses estimates to record these reserves 
slow moving inventory is reviewed by category and may be partially or fully reserved for depending on the type of product and the length of time the product has been included in inventory 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas 
sfas requires the company to record the fair value of an asset retirement obligation as a liability in the period in which it incurs a legal obligation associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets that result from the acquisition  construction  development and or normal use of the assets 
the company also records a corresponding asset that is depreciated over the life of the asset 
subsequent to the initial measurement of the asset retirement obligation  the obligation will be adjusted at the end of each period to reflect the passage of time and changes in the estimated future cash flows underlying the obligation 
the company adopted sfas on january  the adoption of sfas did not have a material effect on the company s financial statements for in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and supersedes emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
sfas requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
in addition  sfas establishes that fair value is the objective for initial measurement of the liability 
sfas is effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december  the adoption of sfas did not have a material effect on the company s financial statements for in november  the eitf issued issue no 
 accounting for consideration received from a vendor by a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products eitf  effective for fiscal periods beginning after december  eitf requires cash consideration received from a vendor be recognized in the customer s financial statements as a reduction to cost of sales  unless certain limited conditions are met 
if these specific requirements related to individual vendors are met  the consideration is accounted for as a reduction in the related expense category  such as selling and administrative expense 
the adoption of eitf did not have a material effect on the company s financial statements for in december  the fasb issued a revised interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities interpretation r  which addresses how a business enterprise should evaluate whether it has a controlling financial interest in an entity through means other than voting rights and accordingly should consolidate the entity 
interpretation r replaces interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  which was issued in january the company will be required to apply interpretation r to interests in variable interest entities vie created after december  for variable interests in vies created before january   the interpretation will be applied beginning on january  for any vies that must be consolidated under interpretation r that were created before january   the assets  liabilities and noncontrolling interests of the vie initially would be measured at their carrying amounts with any difference between the net amount added to the balance sheet and any previously recognized interest being recognized as the cumulative effect of an accounting change 
if determining the carrying amounts is not practicable  fair value at the date interpretation r first applies may be used to measure the assets  liabilities and noncontrolling interest of the vie 
the adoption of interpretation r is not expected to have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity sfas 
sfas establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
it requires an issuer to classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability or an asset in some circumstances 
an issuer previously classified many of those instruments as equity

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk management the company is exposed to market risk stemming from changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates 
changes in these factors could cause fluctuations in earnings and cash flows 
the company has significant foreign operations  for which the functional currencies are denominated primarily in the euro and british pound sterling 
as the values of the currencies of the foreign countries in which the company has operations increase or decrease relative to the us dollar  the sales  expenses  profits  assets and liabilities of the company s foreign operations  as reported in the company s consolidated financial statements  increase or decrease accordingly 
if foreign exchange rates would have been collectively weaker against the us dollar in  the net loss would have increased by approximately  the company s debt structure and interest rate risk are managed through the use of fixed and floating rate debt 
the company s primary exposure is to united states interest rates see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
a basis point movement in interest rates on floating rate debt outstanding at december  would result in a change in earnings loss before income taxes of approximately  the company occasionally uses forward contracts to reduce fluctuations in foreign currency cash flows related to third party material purchases  intercompany product shipments and intercompany loans 
at december   the company had no open forward exchange contracts
