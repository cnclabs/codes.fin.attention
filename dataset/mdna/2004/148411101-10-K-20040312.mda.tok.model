table of contents table year qtr qtr qtr qtr the index shows declining activity to flat growth in the manufacturing sector of the economy since the third quarter of  that generally continued until the final quarter of in early  the index rose above indicating some growth  however  it was not sustained 
management initiatives reacting to this prolonged downturn in the markets the company serves  management implemented a series of initiatives in its metals segment to increase operating margins and improve asset management 
as a result  over time  the company lowered its consolidated breakeven level by reducing operating expense in its metals segment while increasing worker productivity 
to illustrate worker productivity  table shows a comparison of lines sold per employee for the years through lines as used in this context represent a single grade and size item on a customer invoice  which is a common workflow related volume measurement at castle 
management frequently reviews lines sold against its total employee base  including executive management  sales and support personnel  as an internal measurement of productivity 
table lines per employee cumulative improvement throughout  and  the company aggressively pursued permanent cost saving initiatives  which included exiting non strategic and or non performing business s units and flattening its overall organization  eliminating areas of redundant effort and related costs 
the combination of volume reductions  productivity improvements and cost savings reduced quarterly operating expenses as shown in table dollars in millions

table of contents additionally  in the last three years  the company aggressively lowered its investment in inventory and sold unused facility space in select operations 
the cash generated from these actions  along with the previously mentioned sale of certain non performing business units  allowed the company to reduce its total debt and other financing arrangements including its accounts receivable securitization facility by million since the end of as illustrated in table dollars in millions 
table december  long term debt receivable securitization total financing arrangements increase decrease in summary  the company s results have suffered in recent years due largely to the economics within its primary customer markets 
management initiated several actions that served to generate cash  which in turn  reduced the company s debt load and restructured its base operating costs to better position itself to favorably leverage incremental sales in the future 
many of the actions initiated resulted in charges being taken against current year earnings in the form of impairment or other special charges million in 
current business outlook in the fourth quarter of  the marketplace and hence  the company began to show signs of some economic recovery 
specifically  fourth quarter sales in were ahead of the corresponding period in this increase was broad based across most of our product lines  further confirming improving business conditions in the manufacturing sector of the us economy 
operating expenses excluding the impact of impairment charges  declined million or versus the first quarter of  to a level of of sales 
additionally  material costs from our suppliers have surged in recent months  resulting in immediate price increases on the company s transactional business 
the company s plastic subsidiary  total plastics inc  grew its revenue base by in and currently represents more than of the company s consolidated sales 
this growth was achieved in part through the start up of two new facilities in the new york and florida markets 
more detail on this business segment can be found in the year to year comparisons included in this section of the k 
in the very early weeks of  the evidence of a manufacturing sector recovery continues through both increased demand and pricing 
the january pmi was reported at  which is the highest it has been since late these market driven factors  coupled with the company s lower cost structure due to actions completed in  give management optimism concerning the company s business plan and its return to profitability 
risk factors as part of its current financing agreements with its various lenders  the company has specific principal payments required over the next few years as summarized below in table dollars in millions table and beyond required principal payments on debt in addition  the company s principal source of operating cash is derived from its accounts receivable securitization agreement  which expires in december despite the recent signs of what appears to be an upswing in the manufacturing sector of the economy  there can be no guarantee as to its magnitude or duration 
additionally  the company s ability to pass through recently accelerating supplier driven material cost increases to its customer base on a timely basis is also critical to meeting required debt service requirements and remaining in compliance with its debt covenants 
should the economic and market recovery turn out to be short term in length  management could pursue further options to ensure it generates enough cash to facilitate the required 
table of contents payments of principal as outlined in its agreements with its primary lenders 
these options could include  but not necessarily be limited to  further operating cost reductions and organizational restructuring  further working capital improvements  deferral of non critical capital projects  sale of assets or business units  refinancing of the company through additional equity or debt infusions  or renegotiating existing loans outstanding 
management cannot guarantee that any of these options will be available if needed 
none of these options are under consideration at this time  other than the ongoing analysis and review of operating expense and levels of working capital required in the business 
all current business conditions lead management to believe it will be able to generate sufficient cash from operations and planned working capital improvements  to fund its ongoing capital expenditure program and to meet its debt obligations

recent accounting pronouncements a description of recent accounting pronouncements is included in footnote notes to consolidated financial statements under the caption new accounting standards 
critical accounting policies the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principals  which necessarily include amounts that are based on estimates and assumptions 
the following is a description of some of the more significant valuation policies accounts receivable accounts receivable are evaluated on a quarterly basis and any significant customers with delinquent balances are reviewed to determine future collectibility 
assessments are based on legal issues bankruptcy status  past history  current financial and credit agency reports  and the experience of the credit representatives 
accounts judged to be uncollectible are reserved or written off in the quarter in which the determination is made 
additional reserves are maintained based on the company s historical bad debt experience 
inventory substantially all inventories are valued using the last in first out lifo method 
under this method  the current value of material sold is recorded as cost of material sold rather than the actual cost in the order in which it was purchased 
this means that older costs are included in inventory  which may be higher or lower than current costs 
this method of valuation is subject to year to year fluctuations in cost of material sold  which is influenced by the inflation or deflation existing within the metals or plastics industry 
the use of lifo for inventory valuation was chosen to better match replacement cost of inventory with the current pricing used to bill customers 
retirement plans the company values retirement plan assets and liabilities based on assumptions and valuations established by management following consultation with its independent actuary 
future valuations are subject to market changes  which are not in the control of the company and could differ materially from the amounts currently reported 
insurance plans the company is self insured for a portion of worker s compensation and automobile insurance 
self insurance amounts are capped for individual claims  and  in the aggregate  for each policy year by an insurance company 
self insurance reserves are based on unpaid  known claims including related administrative fees assessed by the insurance company for claims processing and a reserve for incurred but not reported claims based on the company s historical claim experience and development 
revenue recognition revenue from product sales is largely recognized upon shipment  whereupon title passes and the company has no further obligations to the customer 
the company has entered into consignment inventory agreements with a few select customers whereby revenue is not recorded until the customer has consumed product from the consigned inventory and title has passed 
provisions for sales discounts and rebates to customers  and returns and other adjustments are provided for in the same period the related sales are recorded 
shipping and handling charges are recorded as operating expenses in the period incurred 

table of contents goodwill impairment the carrying value of goodwill is evaluated annually during the first quarter of each fiscal year or when certain events eg the potential sale of an entity occur which require a more current valuation 
the valuation is based on the comparison of an entity s discounted cash flow equity valuation to its carrying value 
if the carrying value exceeds the equity valuation the goodwill is impaired appropriately 
the equity valuation is based on historical data and management assumptions of future cash flow 
since the assumptions are forward looking actual results could differ materially from those used in the valuation process 
income taxes income tax provisions are based on income reported for financial statement purposes 
deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes 
the company records valuation allowances or adjustments against its deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that the amounts will not be recognized 
capital expenditures capital expenditures for totalled million as compared to million in major expenditures included the replacement and upgrading of machinery and equipment  and enhancements to information processing systems 
it is anticipated that capital expenditures will be approximately million in  mainly in the area of repair and replacement of existing machinery and equipment 
capital expenditures for totalled million as compared to million in major expenditures included replacement of machinery and equipment  increased processing capabilities and enhancements to a warehouse management system 
during and  the company sold and leased back approximately million and million of fixed assets respectively  which added to cash flow and minimized other financing requirements 
the leaseback transactions are recorded as operating leases and therefore are not reflected as debt on the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources the company s operating results have suffered in recent years due largely to the economic conditions within its primary customer markets 
management initiated several actions that served to generate cash  which in turn  reduced the company s debt load and restructured its base operating costs to better position itself to favorably leverage incremental sales in the future 
many of the actions initiated resulted in charges being taken against current year earnings in the form of impairment or other special charges million in

gross trade receivables prior to the impact of receivables sold under the securitization facility increased million

as of december   the company remains in compliance with the covenants of its financial agreements  which require it to maintain certain funded debt to capital ratios  working capital to debt ratios and a minimum equity value as defined within the agreement 
a summary of covenant compliance is shown below 
actual required debt to capital ratio working capital to debt ratio minimum equity value million million decreases to 
on march  all current business conditions lead management to believe it will be able to generate sufficient cash from operations and planned working capital improvements principally from reduced inventories  to fund its ongoing capital expenditure programs and meet its debt obligations 
cash commitments the following is a schedule of cash commitments for long term debt and non cancelable lease payments payments due in debt leases total later years total item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to various rate and metal price risks that arise in the normal course of business 
the company finances its operations with fixed and variable rate borrowings and the accounts receivable securitization facility 
market risk arises from changes in variable interest rates 
an increase of in interest rates on the variable rate indebtedness and accounts receivable securitization facility would increase the company s annual interest expense and discount on sale of accounts receivable by approximately million 
the company s raw material costs are comprised primarily of highly engineered metals and plastics 
market risk arises from changes in the price of steel  other metals and plastics 
although average selling prices generally increase or decrease as material costs increase or decrease  the impact of a change in the purchase price of materials is more immediately reflected in the company s cost of goods sold than in its selling prices 

table of contents commitments and contingencies the company is the defendant in several lawsuits arising out of the conduct of its business 
these lawsuits are incidental and occur in the normal course of the company s business affairs 
it is the opinion of the company s in house counsel that no significant uninsured liability will result from the outcome of the litigation  and thus there is no material financial exposure to the company
