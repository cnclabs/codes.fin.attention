item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
business overview and discussion of known trends we develop  manufacture and market minimally invasive products that use radiofrequency energy to treat patients with solid cancerous or benign tumors 
in  we commercially launched our starburst xli family of disposable devices and significantly expanded our direct domestic sales organization and our international distribution network 
in  the xli family of disposable devices gained wide acceptance with our customers in the united states 
in  we introduced our next generation in infusion technology  the xli enhanced xlie disposable device 
the xlie device builds upon our established infusion expertise  making the ablation process easier and more efficient 
management relies on certain statistical measurements to assess trends in sales growth and the effectiveness of our selling strategies 
the following table  derived from our consolidated statements of operations and other unaudited data for the years ended december   and  sets forth some of these measurements years ended december  total sales in thousands percentage of sales united states percentage of sales international percentage of sales disposable products percentage of sales hardware products gross margin our products are sold in the united states through our direct sales force and internationally through distribution partners 
our sales in the united states are more profitable than our sales in international markets because direct selling  which avoids distributor discounts  permits higher average selling prices for our products 
accordingly  we have made significant investments in our domestic sales force in an effort to increase sales growth in the united states  and have  to date  introduced our premium priced starburst xli and xlie families of disposable needles only in this region 
these actions have resulted in a growing percentage of sales derived from the domestic market 
in contrast  our international markets in europe and japan have relatively more restrictive reimbursement conditions than those in the united states  which combined with our distributor discounts  limit our average selling prices in these markets 
further  some of our distributors in europe and japan have been reducing their inventory levels 
these factors have resulted in slow growth or even declining volume in some of our international markets 
going forward  we expect sales growth in the united states to continue to outpace international growth  because we believe our international markets  particularly japan  will continue to reduce inventory levels  and because we believe the introduction of premium products to our international distributors will have a relatively small impact on growth due to pricing limitations 
however  we also note reimbursement approval for our procedure in japan  effective april   and we believe that japan will once again be an important source of international revenue beginning in all of our revenue is derived from the sale of our disposable devices and radiofrequency generators 
as the number of customers using our products grows  we expect that the percentage of sales related to disposable products will grow relative to that of hardware products  although we have  in the past  seen temporary deviations from this trend as a result of large hardware shipments to international distributors 
since our disposable products are self manufactured and more profitable than our vendor sourced hardware products  a growing percentage of disposable product sales is favorable to the company 
in  we will continue to focus on expanding our base of customers and on increasing usage of our disposable products in our established accounts 
as a result  we expect revenue from the sale of our higher margin disposable devices to grow faster than revenue from the sale of our generators 
we have  in the past  experienced supply shortages that limited our sales 
we are not currently experiencing such shortages and do not expect shortages in the future  although there cannot be complete assurance to this effect 

table of contents to date  essentially all of our revenue has come from products sold in the treatment of cancerous liver tumors 
in  however  we began to see some additional nominal revenue from the use of the rita system sold for the treatment of patients with metastatic bone tumors 
our sales from devices used in bone tumor procedures remained small in  but we expect the january approval of a reimbursement code for bone procedures to have a favorable impact going forward 
we are conducting research and clinical trials in other organs that may lead to additional sources of revenue in future years  although there can be no assurances that such additional revenue will materialize 
our manufacturing costs consist of raw materials  including generators and ancillary hardware components produced for us by third party suppliers  labor to produce our disposable devices and to inspect incoming  in process and finished goods  sterilization performed by an outside service provider and general overhead expenses 
our manufacturing costs are volume dependent  and our unit costs should decrease as our production volumes increase 
we also have the opportunity to reduce the cost of our vendor supplied hardware products through higher order volumes or product redesign 
besides manufacturing costs  our cost of goods sold for reflects amortization of capitalized license fees associated with the april settlement of our patent litigation dispute with boston scientific corporation 
we expect these amortization charges to continue through further  our cost of goods sold also includes provisions to our reserve for obsolete inventory 
technology in our marketplace has evolved rapidly and we have  from time to time  recognized relatively high expenses related to obsolete inventory as our product line has changed 
we may experience similar product changes and related obsolete inventory provisions in the future  although we generally expect only modest impacts from such provisions 
our gross margins reflect our selling prices  our domestic international mix percentages  our product mix percentages  our production volumes  the costs we pay for vendor manufactured product and our provisions for obsolete product 
the net effect of these factors has been improvement in our gross margin rate from in  to in and to in in  we expect continued modest improvement in our gross margin rate  based on projected improvements in domestic international and product sales mix  lower manufacturing costs and relatively modest provisions for obsolete product 
in addition to the selling statistics discussed above  management relies on certain measurements to assess the effectiveness of our operations 
the following tables sets forth some of these measurements  derived from our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended december   and  and our consolidated balance sheets as of december   and years ended december  research and development expense selling  general and administrative expense total operating expenses december  cash and cash equivalents marketable securities  current and long term total cash and marketable securities if we are to become profitable  we must continue to manage our operating expenses 
our operating expenses consist of product development costs  clinical trial expenses  patent litigation expenses  sales and marketing expenses related to our selling efforts in the united states and europe  and administrative expenses  including the costs associated with our status as a public company  professional service expenses and our provisions for uncollectible accounts 
changes in these areas are determined by the breadth of our new product development 
table of contents portfolio  the number of headcount we maintain in our selling and administrative functions  the scope of our marketing efforts  the costs we incur in defense of our patents and intellectual property rights and the extent to which credit issues and economic conditions constrain our ability to collect our receivables 
for the year ended december   research and development expense was lower than in  while selling  general and administrative expense was down by from  reflecting lower headcount and reduced activity in research projects and clinical trials 
in  we expect a modest increase in research expenditures  reflecting the ongoing need to develop innovative technology  but little or no growth in selling  general and administrative expense 
in addition to management of our operating expenses  we must continue to conserve our cash and or raise additional cash 
our combined total of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities was million as of december   down from million as of december  our net cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  was million 
however  our rate of net cash used in operating activities fell to million in the second half of  as compared to million in the first half of  and with this lower rate of cash use we believe we have sufficient cash on hand for at least months of operations 
we incurred net losses of million for the year ended december  due to the costs associated with research and development programs and our sales and marketing efforts  we expect to incur net losses throughout profitability depends on our success in expanding product usage in our current markets and in developing new markets 
to the extent current or new markets do not materialize in accordance with our expectations  our sales and profitability could be lower than expected and we may be unable to achieve or sustain profitability 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we believe the following accounting policies have been critical in the preparation of our financial statements because they involve a high degree of judgment and complexity 
we believe users of our financial statements  including potential and current investors  will find an explanation of these policies important to understanding our discussions of financial condition  results of operations and liquidity 
a more extensive review of all accounting policies considered to be significant in the preparation of our financial statements appears in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k 
trade accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts we extend credit to our customers  who are primarily private companies in the united states  europe and asia 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition and past transaction credit worthiness and generally require no collateral 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable based on our assessment of the likelihood of collection of individual accounts 
this allowance may prove to be inadequate if collections fail to meet current estimates  which could occur as a result of general economic conditions or the insolvency of specific key customers 
inventories and inventory reserves inventories are stated at the lower of cost determined on a first in  first out basis or market 
we maintain a reserve for obsolete  unmarketable or excess product based on assumptions regarding future demand or market conditions 
we may be required to make further provisions to our reserve if market conditions prove less favorable than our current expectations  or if the introduction of new products renders existing products obsolete 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized upon receipt of a customer purchase order and subsequent product shipment provided no significant obligations remain and collection of the associated receivable is 
table of contents deemed reasonably assured 
our customers  including our distributors  have no price protection and no return rights on product purchased 
should changes in conditions or the status of obligations cause us to determine that our criteria are not met for certain future transactions  revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely affected 
payments for maintenance services are usually prepaid and the related maintenance revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the service contract term 
service contract terms range from to months 
we do not generally engage in bundling transactions that would call for the deferral of revenue 
through december   all of our billings have been denominated in us dollars  although we expect relatively minor billings in foreign currencies in future periods 
deferred tax valuation allowance deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized 
we have established a full valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to zero 
while we have considered potential future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the full valuation allowance  in the event that we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase net income in the period such determination was made 
results of operations the following table sets forth the percentage of sales represented by certain items in our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended december   and years ended december  sales cost of goods sold gross profit operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative total operating expenses loss from operations interest and other income expense  net net loss years ended december  and for the year ended december   sales totaled million  a decrease of from million in this result was due to a reduction of million  or  in year to year sales to our distributor in japan  where the reduction of in country inventory levels severely limited demand in elsewhere  our business grew 
domestic sales were higher in than in  as we increased our installed customer base 
international sales  excluding japan  grew by in  compared with  reflecting higher sales in the rest of asia and some european markets 
for the year ended december   domestic sales represented of total sales  compared to in sales of our disposable products grew by compared with results  although hardware sales  influenced by the decrease in shipments to japan  decreased 
for the year ended december   disposable sales accounted for of total revenue  compared to in cost of goods sold for the year ended december  was million as compared to million in  resulting in a gross margin for compared to a gross margin rate in cost of goods sold 
table of contents was affected by charges for obsolete inventory that totaled approximately million for  down from million in we may experience similar product changes and related obsolete inventory provisions in the future  although we generally expect only modest impacts from such provisions 
costs for the first two quarters of were further increased by temporary price increases of approximately million on our vendor sourced ancillary infusion pumps 
these temporary price increases ceased by june of and we do not expect increases of this sort in the future 
our cost of goods sold in also included million amortization of capitalized license fees associated with the settlement of our patent litigation dispute with boston scientific corporation 
we expect such amortization charges to continue through research and development expenses for the year ended december  were million as compared to million in this decrease was due to reduced new product development and clinical trial costs 
also  there were no charges for amortization of deferred stock based compensation in  compared to million of such charges for we expect a modest increase in research expenditures for  driven by developmental charges associated with technical innovation of our products 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were million as compared to million in about million of this decrease is due to lower selling expenses  on lower headcount  reflecting organizational changes in our domestic sales group 
another million in reduced expense resulted from lower provisions to our allowance for uncollectible accounts  as our collection experience with our international customers stabilized 
also  there were no charges for amortization of deferred stock based compensation in  compared to million of such charges for other marketing and general administrative expense areas increased by million in over we expect our selling  general and administrative expense to show little or no growth in  reflecting the full year impact of our organizational changes 
interest income was million for the year ended december   down from million in  because average daily cash balances fell during as we utilized cash for operations 
we had no interest expense for  compared with  for years ended december  and for the year ended december   sales totaled million  an increase of from million in we experienced growth in our domestic market  with domestic sales increasing by over  reflecting increased physician awareness of our technology and increased coverage from our domestic sales group  which was larger in than in sales in our international markets decreased by in compared to  as our global distributor network reduced inventories and coped with weak economic conditions 
for the year ended december   domestic sales represented of total sales  compared to in sales of our disposable products grew by and generator sales increased by compared with results 
also  for the year ended december   disposable sales accounted for of total sales  compared to in results in in our domestic business were constrained by supply issues relating to accessory infusion pumps used with our starburst xli line of disposable products 
we believe that these issues have been addressed and have had no further significant impact on sales in our generator placements increased compared with  reflecting both the expansion of our customer base and the introduction of newer technology to our existing customers 
cost of goods sold for the year ended december  was million as compared to million in costs associated with increased unit shipments of generators and other hardware components of the rita system increased by million over  but lower unit shipments of devices resulted in a million reduction in costs associated with these products 
also  cost of goods sold was affected by charges for obsolete inventory  which totaled million for  but were only nominal in further  amortization of deferred stock based compensation of  was included in cost of goods sold  down from  in our gross margin was in  compared to in 
table of contents research and development expenses for the year ended december  were million as compared to million in this decrease was primarily due to a million reduction in new product development costs and clinical trial costs  as the large development expenses associated with the introduction of our starburst xli product line in were not matched by similarly scaled programs in also  amortization of deferred stock based compensation was  for the year  down from  in selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were million as compared to million in the increase was primarily attributable to the expansion of our domestic sales organization  which resulted in higher compensation and travel expenses in also  we made additional investments in market development and public relations  and recognized higher administrative expenses relating to provisions to our allowance for uncollectible accounts 
amortization of deferred stock based compensation was  for the year  down from  in interest income was million for the year ended december   down from million in  because average daily cash balances fell during as we utilized cash for operations 
interest expense for was  down from  in  as we carried no bank debt in and recognized only nominal amounts of interest expense associated with capital lease payments 
liquidity and capital resources prior to august  we financed our operations principally through private placements of convertible preferred stock  raising approximately million net of expenses 
on august   we completed our initial public offering of million common shares at a price of per share  raising approximately million net of expenses 
all outstanding convertible preferred shares were converted to common shares at that time 
to a lesser extent  we also financed our operations through equipment financing and other loans see below  which were fully repaid as of december  in january of  we raised an additional million  net of expenses  through a private placement of our common shares 
as of december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents  million of marketable securities  million in investments intended for resale and million of working capital 
for the year ended december   net cash used in operating activities was million principally due to our net loss of million  offset by non cash charges of million  including depreciation and amortization and provisions to reserves for uncollectible accounts and inventory 
amortization of our deferred stock based compensation was completed in the year ended december   so there were no further charges in approximately million in cash was used in by changes in working capital accounts  with million in reduced inventory offset by reduced payables and liabilities  and a million increase in accounts receivable 
our investing activities for the year were limited to the purchase of property and equipment in the amount of million 
through april of  when we settled our outstanding patent disputes with boston scientific corporation  we capitalized certain patent defense litigation costs  such costs totaled million for the year ended december  in april of  we also capitalized million in payments made in settlement of those disputes 
maturities and net sales of investment instruments provided million in cash in support of operations 
financing activities for the year provided million in cash  including the million we raised in our january private placement of common stock and million related to the issuance of common stock in conjunction with the exercise of stock options 
for the year ended december   net cash used in operating activities was million principally due to our net loss of million  offset by million in non cash charges and million provided by reduced accounts receivable and other changes in working capital accounts 
our investing activities for the year were limited to the purchase of property and equipment in the amount of million and million of net sales of short term investment instruments 
net cash provided by financing activities for the year was million  primarily the proceeds received from issuance of common stock in conjunction with the exercise of stock options 

table of contents we have  from time to time  financed equipment through capital and operating leases 
as of december   we had no future minimum payments due under capital leases  and future minimum payments due under operating leases were as follows in thousands payments due in total of future minimum operating lease payments our capital requirements depend on numerous factors including our research and development expenditures  expenses related to selling  general and administrative operations and working capital to support business growth 
our net cash used in operating activities averaged million per month for the year ended december   but net cash used in operating activities averaged only million per month for the last half of the year 
although it is difficult for us to predict future liquidity requirements with certainty  we believe that our current balances of cash and cash equivalents  and the sale of marketable securities as necessary  will satisfy our cash requirements for at least the next months 
during or after this period  if cash generated by operations is insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  we may need to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain an additional credit facility 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available to us or  if available  that such financing will be available on terms favorable to the company and our stockholders 
private placement of securities in january of  the company issued  shares of unregistered common stock at a price of per share  netting approximately million after issuance fees and expenses 
the issuance was deemed to be exempt from registration under the securities act in reliance upon section thereof as transactions by an issuer not involving any public offering 
on february   our registration statement on form s  which registered the shares of common stock sold to sf capital partners ltd  riverview group  llc  baystar capital ii  lp  and baystar international ii  lp  was declared effective by the sec 
income taxes as of december   we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million  available to offset future regular taxable income 
we have fully reserved our deferred tax assets  however  because realization of favorable tax assets in future returns is very uncertain 
the federal net operating loss carryforwards will expire between and  and the state net operating loss carryforwards will expire between and  if not utilized 
the tax reform act of limits the use of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards in certain situations where changes occur in the stock ownership of the company  and our utilization of our carryforwards could be restricted

did not have a material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 

table of contents factors that may affect future results in addition to the other information in this report  the following factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our business and prospects due to our dependence on the rita system  failure to achieve market acceptance in a timely manner could harm our business 
because all of our revenue comes from the sale of the rita system  our financial performance will depend upon physician adoption and patient awareness of this system 
if we are unable to convince physicians to use the rita system  we may not be able to generate revenues because we do not have alternative products 
we have a history of losses and may never achieve profitability 
although operating expenses during the final two quarters of the year ended december  were lower than in preceding quarters  and although we believe that our quarterly operating expenses will stabilize at or below these levels throughout  to become profitable we must increase our sales and continue to manage our operating expenses 
if our sales do not grow  we may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability in the future 
in particular  we incurred net losses of million in  million in  million in  million in and million in at december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
because we face significant competition from companies with greater resources than we have  we may be unable to compete effectively 
the market for our products is intensely competitive  subject to rapid change and significantly affected by new product introductions and other market activities of industry participants 
we compete directly with two companies in the domestic and international markets radiotherapeutics corporation  a division of boston scientific corporation  and radionics  inc  a division of tyco healthcare  which is a division of tyco international 
boston scientific corporation and tyco international are publicly traded companies with substantially greater resources than we have 
both radiotherapeutics and radionics sell products that use radiofrequency energy to ablate soft tissue 
furthermore  in april  we entered into a license agreement with boston scientific  its affiliates and licensors  pursuant to which we granted boston scientific rights to manufacture and sell products using our infusion technology after october  as a result  boston scientific may develop and sell some competing products that would  in the absence of this license agreement  infringe our patents 
we are also aware of several companies in international markets which sell products that compete directly with ours 
these companies are affecting our international market share and may erode that share in the future 
in addition  one of these companies  berchtold corporation  has received fda clearance for using radiofrequency energy to ablate soft tissue 
alternative therapies could prove to be superior to the rita system  and physician adoption could be negatively affected 
in addition to competing against other companies offering products that use radiofrequency energy to ablate soft tissue  we also compete against companies developing  manufacturing and marketing alternative therapies that address solid cancerous and benign tumors 
if these alternative therapies prove to offer treatment options that are perceived to be superior to our system or to have less severe side effects than those resulting from our system  physician adoption of our products could be negatively affected and our revenues could decline 

table of contents we currently lack long term data regarding the safety and efficacy of our products and may find that long term data does not support our short term clinical results or that further short or long term studies do not support the safety and efficacy of our products in various applications 
if the safety or efficacy of our products is questioned  our sales could decline 
our products are supported by clinical follow up data in published clinical reports or scientific presentations covering periods from five months to five years after radiofrequency ablation 
if additional studies in liver cancer or in other applications fail to confirm or demonstrate the effectiveness of our products  our sales could decline 
if longer term patient follow up or clinical studies indicate that our procedures cause unexpected  serious complications or other unforeseen negative effects  we could be subject to significant liability 
further  because some of our data has been produced in studies that were retrospective  not randomized  or included small patient populations and because  in certain circumstances  we rely on clinical data developed by independent third party physicians  our clinical data may not be reproduced in wider patient populations 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights or if we are found to infringe the rights of others  we may lose market share to our competitors and our business could suffer 
our success depends significantly on our ability to protect our proprietary rights to the technologies used in our products  and yet we may be unable to do so 
a number of companies in our market  as well as universities and research institutions  have issued patents and have filed patent applications that relate to the use of radiofrequency energy to ablate soft tissue 
under certain circumstances these could result in lawsuits against us 
our pending united states and foreign patent applications may not issue or may issue and be subsequently successfully challenged by others 
in addition  our pending patent applications include claims to material aspects of our products that are not currently protected by issued patents 
both the patent application process and the process of managing patent disputes can be time consuming and expensive 
in the event a competitor infringes on our patent or other intellectual property rights  enforcing those rights may be difficult and time consuming 
even if successful  litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights or to defend our patents against challenge could be expensive and time consuming and could divert management s attention 
we may not have sufficient resources to enforce our intellectual property rights or to defend our patents against a challenge 
in addition  confidentiality agreements executed by our employees  consultants and advisors may not be enforceable or may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets or other proprietary information in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights  we could lose market share to our competitors and our business could suffer 
our dependence on international revenues  which account for a significant portion of our total revenues  could harm our business 
because our future profitability will depend in part on our ability to increase product sales in international markets  we are exposed to risks specific to business operations outside the united states 
these risks include the challenge of managing international sales without direct access to the end customer  the risk of inventory build up by our distributors which could negatively impact sales in future periods for example  our distributor in japan has built up a significant inventory of product in anticipation of the receipt of reimbursement approvals  obtaining reimbursement for procedures using our devices in some foreign markets  the burden of complying with complex and changing foreign regulatory requirements  longer accounts receivable collection time  significant currency fluctuations  which could cause our distributors to reduce the number of products they purchase from us because the cost of our products to them could increase relative to the price they could charge their customers  
table of contents reduced protection of intellectual property rights in some foreign countries  and contractual provisions governed by foreign laws 
we are substantially dependent on two distributors in our international markets  and if we lose either distributor or if either distributor significantly reduces its product demand  our international and total revenues could decline 
we are substantially dependent on a limited number of significant distributors in our international markets  and if we lose these distributors and fail to attract additional distributors  our international revenues could decline 
itx corporation  formerly known as nissho iwai corporation  is our primary distributor in asia 
it accounted for of our international revenues in and of our international revenues in mdh mdh forniture ospedaliere  our distributor in italy  accounted for of our international revenues in and of our international revenues for because international revenues accounted for of our total revenues for and these two distributors represented of that total  the loss of either distributor or a significant decrease in unit purchases by either distributor could cause our revenues to decline substantially 
if we are unable to attract additional international distributors  our international revenues may not grow 
our relationships with third party distributors could negatively affect our sales 
we sell our products in international markets through third party distributors over whom we have limited control  and  if they fail to adequately support our products  our sales could decline 
during the first quarter of  we terminated our agreements with three of our international distributors and although we contracted with replacement distributors we have expended significant time and resources in doing so  and our sales in the three affected markets have suffered during the transition period that we estimate ended september  however  if our distributors or we terminate other distributor agreements  we could incur similar or more burdensome expenses  have to expend significant time and resources in finding replacement distributors and our sales could decrease during any related transition period 
we are aware that some of our international distributors have built up inventory of our products 
as a result  future sales to these distributors could be negatively impacted and sales to our japanese distributor were so affected 
in addition  while these distributors have no price protection and no right of return relating to purchased products  if we permit the return of any of these products  we will have to adjust our revenues relating to these products which may also impact our revenue recognition policy on future distributor sales 
in  we significantly increased our allowance for uncollectible accounts to address the risk associated with longer collection periods that have arisen principally with our european distributors 
although the deterioration we experienced in international collections in stabilized in  we may encounter new difficulties with collections that require further increases in our allowance for uncollectible accounts in the future  and we may require specific accounts to post letters of credit or pay in advance to minimize credit risk to the company 
additional future increases in our allowance for uncollectible accounts would reduce our profits 
if customers in markets outside the united states experience difficulty obtaining reimbursement for procedures using our products  international sales could decline 
certain of the markets outside the united states in which we sell our products require that specific reimbursement codes be obtained before reimbursement for procedures using our products can be approved 
as a result  in countries where specific reimbursement codes are strictly required and have not yet been issued  reimbursement has been denied on that basis 
for example  itx corporation  our distributor in japan  is seeking to obtain reimbursement coverage in japan  but to date has not received this approval 
if we or our distributors are unable to either obtain the required reimbursement codes or develop an effective strategy to resolve the reimbursement issue  physicians in foreign markets may be unwilling to purchase our products which could negatively impact our international revenues 

table of contents if third party payors do not reimburse health care providers for use of the rita system  purchases could be delayed and our revenues could decline 
physicians  hospitals and other health care providers may be reluctant to purchase our products if they do not receive coverage or adequate reimbursement for the cost of procedures using our products from third party payors  such as medicare  medicaid and private health insurance plans 
if physicians believe that using our system will add cost to a procedure but will not add sufficient offsetting economic or clinical benefits  physician adoption of our products could be delayed 
even though the american medical association has established cpt codes relating to liver procedures and bone tumor procedures  some third party payors still may not cover or reimburse adequately for liver or bone tumor procedures using our products 
we are aware of liver procedures using our system where the patient s insurance has denied coverage 
in addition  there are no assigned cpt codes for radiofrequency ablation of tumors in organs other than liver or bone 
further  we believe the advent of the medicare fixed payment schedules has made it difficult to receive adequate liver reimbursement for procedures using our products in the outpatient setting 
medicare reimbursement levels for procedures using our products are highest when our products are used in an in patient setting 
if there is a trend toward the use of our products on an outpatient basis or if coverage continues to be denied or reimbursement levels continue to be inadequate  physician use of our products could decline which would cause our revenues to decline 
we depend on key employees in a competitive market for skilled personnel and without additional employees  we cannot grow or achieve profitability 
we are highly dependent on the principal members of our management team  including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer  as well as key staff in the areas of finance  operations and research and development 
our future success will depend in part on the continued service of our staff and our ability to identify  hire and retain additional personnel 
the market for qualified management personnel in northern california  where our offices are located  is competitive and is expected to remain so 
because the environment for good personnel is so competitive  costs related to compensation may increase significantly 
if we are unable to attract and retain both the management team and key personnel we need to support and grow our business  our business will suffer 
we may be subject to costly and time consuming product liability actions 
we manufacture medical devices that are used on patients in both minimally invasive and open surgical procedures and  as a result  we may be subject to product liability lawsuits 
to date  we have not been subject to a product liability claim  however  any product liability claim brought against us  with or without merit  could result in the increase of our product liability insurance rates or the inability to secure coverage in the future 
in addition  we could have to pay any amount awarded by a court in excess of policy limits 
finally  even a meritless or unsuccessful product liability claim could be time consuming and expensive to defend and could result in the diversion of management s attention from managing our core business 
any failure in our physician training efforts could result in lower than expected product sales 
it is critical to our sales effort to train a sufficient number of physicians and to instruct them properly in the procedures that utilize our products 
we have established formal physician training programs and rely on physicians to devote adequate time to understanding how and when our products should be used 
if physicians are not properly trained  they may misuse or ineffectively use our products 
such use may result in unsatisfactory patient outcomes  patient injury and related liability or negative publicity that could have an adverse effect on our product sales 
we may incur significant costs related to a class action lawsuit due to the likely volatility of our stock 
our stock price may fluctuate for a number of reasons including failure of the public market to support the valuation established in our initial public offering or our private placement transaction  
table of contents our ability to successfully commercialize our products  announcements regarding patent litigation or the issuance of patents to us or our competitors  quarterly fluctuations in our results of operations  announcements of technological or competitive developments by us or our competitors  product liability claims  regulatory developments regarding us or our competitors  acquisitions or strategic alliances by us or our competitors  changes in estimates of our financial performance or changes in recommendations by securities analysts  and general market conditions  particularly for companies with small market capitalizations 
securities class action litigation is often brought against a company after a period of volatility in the market price of its stock 
if our future quarterly operating results are below the expectations of securities analysts or investors  the price of our common stock would likely decline 
stock price fluctuations may be exaggerated if the trading volume of our common stock is low 
any securities litigation claims brought against us could result in substantial expense and divert management s attention from our core business 
we have limited experience manufacturing our disposable devices in substantial quantities  and if we are unable to hire sufficient additional personnel or to purchase additional equipment or are otherwise unable to meet customer demand  our business could suffer 
to be successful  we must manufacture our products in substantial quantities in compliance with regulatory requirements at acceptable costs 
if we do not succeed in manufacturing quantities of our disposable devices that meet customer demand  we could lose customers and our business could suffer 
at the present time  we have limited high volume manufacturing experience 
our manufacturing operations are currently focused on the in house assembly of our disposable devices 
as we increase our manufacturing volume and the number of product designs for our disposable devices  the complexity of our manufacturing processes will increase 
because our manufacturing operations are primarily dependent upon manual assembly  if demand for our system increases we will need to hire additional personnel and may need to purchase additional equipment 
if we are unable to sufficiently staff and equip our manufacturing operations or are otherwise unable to meet customer demand for our products  our business could suffer 
we may be required to relocate  or choose to relocate  to a new facility in if so  we will incur moving expenses  and if we become unable to meet custormer demand  our business could suffer 
the operating lease on our current facility expires in august of we believe that during we will be able to either renew the lease on our existing facility  or lease alternative space  at commercially reasonable terms 
if we choose to relocate to a new facility  we will incur normal and customary moving costs and may experience an interruption in our manufacturing operations 
if we become unable to meet customer demand for our products  our business could suffer 
we are dependent on two suppliers as the only sources of a component that we use in our disposable devices  and any disruption in the supply of this component could negatively affect our business 
until  there was only one supplier available to provide us with a component that we include in our disposable devices 
during the quarter ended june   we qualified a second supplier 
however  a disruption in the supply of this component is still possible and could negatively affect revenues 
if we were unable to remedy a disruption in supply of this component within twelve months  we could be required to 
table of contents redesign the handle of our disposable devices  which could divert engineering resources from other projects or add to product costs 
in addition  a new or supplemental filing with applicable regulatory authorities may require clearance prior to our marketing a product containing new materials 
this clearance process may take a substantial period of time  and we may be unable to obtain necessary regulatory approvals for any new material to be used in our products on a timely basis  if at all 
this could also create supply disruptions that could negatively affect our business 
we are dependent on two suppliers as our only sources of an accessory device used in conjunction with our starburst xli and xlie lines of disposable devices  and any disruption in the supply of these devices could negatively affect our revenues 
until december  we had only one supplier available to provide us with accessory infusion pumps used in conjunction with our starburst xli line of disposable devices 
our starburst xlie product line  introduced in  also requires an accessory infusion pump 
during the quarters ended september  and december   we experienced shortages in the supply of accessory infusion pumps 
in december  we qualified a new accessory infusion pump from our existing supplier for which we now have approval from ul and conditional approval from tuv for use in the united states and europe 
also in december  we qualified a second supplier of an accessory infusion pump  although we have not yet shipped this product to our customers commercially 
although we were able to remedy this supply disruption  future disruptions in the supply of this component are still possible and  in that event  our business could suffer through lower revenues or higher costs 
additionally  we have limited experience with both the primary and alternative pump and if either pump fails to perform as desired  revenues could be negatively affected 
we are dependent on two third party contractors for the supply of our generators  and any failure to deliver generators to us could result in lower than expected revenues 
we are dependent on two third party suppliers to produce our generators 
while we have agreements with both of these suppliers  any delay in shipments of generators to us could result in our failure to ship generators to customers and could negatively affect revenues 
complying with the fda and other domestic and foreign regulatory authorities is an expensive and time consuming process  and any failure to comply could result in substantial penalties 
we are subject to a host of federal  state  local and foreign regulations regarding the manufacture and marketing of our products 
in particular  our failure to comply with fda regulations could result in  among other things  seizures or recalls of our products  an injunction  substantial fines and or criminal charges against our employees and us 
the fda s medical device reporting regulations require us to report any incident in which our products may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury  or in which our products malfunctioned in a way that would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction recurred 
sales of our products outside the united states are subject to foreign regulatory requirements that vary from country to country 
the time required to obtain approvals from foreign countries may be longer than that required for fda approval or clearance  and requirements for foreign licensing may differ from fda requirements 
for example  some of our newer products have not received approval in japan 
any failure to obtain necessary regulatory approvals for our new products in foreign countries could negatively affect revenues 
product introductions or modifications may be delayed or canceled as a result of the fda regulatory process  which could cause our revenues to be below expectations 
unless we are exempt  we must obtain the appropriate fda approval or clearance before we can sell a new medical device in the united states 
obtaining this approval or clearance can be a lengthy and time consuming process 
to date  all of our products have received clearances from the fda through premarket notification 
table of contents under section k of the federal food  drug and cosmetic act 
however  if the fda requires us to submit a new premarket notification under section k for modifications to our existing products  or if the fda requires us to go through a lengthier  more rigorous examination than we now expect  our product introductions or modifications could be delayed or canceled which could cause our revenues to be below expectations 
the fda may determine that future products will require the more costly  lengthy and uncertain premarket approval process 
in addition  modifications to medical device products cleared via the k process may require a new k submission 
we have made minor modifications to our system 
using the guidelines established by the fda  we have determined that some of these modifications do not require us to file new k submissions 
if the fda disagrees with our determinations  we may not be able to sell the rita system until the fda has cleared new k submissions for these modifications  or it may require us to recall previously sold products 
in addition  we intend to request additional label indications  such as approvals or clearances for the ablation of tumors in additional organs  including lung  uterus and breast  for our current products 
the fda may either deny these requests outright  require additional extensive clinical data to support any additional indications or impose limitations on the intended use of any cleared product as a condition of approval or clearance 
therefore  obtaining necessary approvals or clearances for these additional applications could be an expensive and lengthy process 
in addition  in the course of the fda process leading to clearance or approval for a new indication  the fda may request an advisory panel meeting or meetings to discuss the clinical data  the appropriate study design or other criteria for clearance or approval 
in the event that the advisory panel advises fda that the clinical data are inadequate or the study design or other criteria are inappropriate  and the fda concurs  the fda clearance or approval process could be lengthened and anticipated revenues from that new indication would be delayed 
we may acquire technologies or companies in the future  which could result in the dilution of our stockholders and disruption of our business  and reduce our revenues 
we are continually evaluating business alliances and external investments in technologies related to our business 
acquisitions of companies  divisions of companies  businesses or products entail numerous risks  any of which could materially harm our business in several ways  including diversion of management s attention from our core business objectives and other business concerns  failure to integrate efficiently businesses or technologies acquired in the future with our pre existing business or technologies  potential loss of key employees from either our pre existing business or the acquired business  dilution of our existing stockholders as a result of issuing equity securities  and assumption of liabilities of the acquired company 
some or all of these problems may result from future acquisitions or investments 
furthermore  we may not realize any value from such acquisitions or investments 
we may need to raise additional capital in the future resulting in dilution to our stockholders 
we may need to raise additional funds for our business operations and to execute our business strategy 
we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or to obtain an additional credit facility 
the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities could result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of debt securities  these securities could have rights that are senior to holders of common stock and could contain covenants that would restrict our operations 
any additional financing may not be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
our executive officers and directors own a large percentage of our voting stock and could exert significant influence over matters requiring stockholder approval 
because our executive officers and directors  and their respective affiliates  own approximately percent of our outstanding common stock as of december   these stockholders may  as a practical matter  be able 
table of contents to exert significant influence over matters requiring approval by our stockholders  including the election of directors and the approval of mergers or other business combinations 
this concentration of voting stock could have the effect of delaying or preventing a merger or acquisition or other change of control that a stockholder may consider favorable 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to interest rate risk at december  and december  is related to our investment portfolio 
we had no interest rate sensitive borrowings as of december  or december  fixed rate investments and borrowings may have their fair market value adversely impacted from changes in interest rates 
floating rate investments may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall  and floating rate borrowings  should we acquire any  will lead to additional interest expense if interest rates increase 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations  and our interest expense may be above our expectations 
further  we may suffer losses in investment principal if we are forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
we invest our excess cash in debt instruments of the united states government and its agencies and in high quality corporate issuers 
the average contractual duration of our investments in was less than one year 
due to the short term nature of these investments  we believe that there is no material exposure to interest rate risk arising from our investments 
all of our sales and purchases have historically been denominated in united states dollars 
in the future  we may begin to make sales in other currencies such as the euro 
we believe we currently have no significant direct foreign currency exchange rate risk and that such risk in the future will be minimal
