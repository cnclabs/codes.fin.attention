regulatory and environmental matters play a significant role in the company s forest products operations 
see item business forest products operations regulatory and environmental matters and note for a discussion of these matters 
regulatory compliance and related litigation have caused and may continue to cause delays in approval of thps and delays in harvesting on thps once they are approved 
this could result in a decline in harvest  an increase in the cost of logging operations and increased costs related to timbe r harvest litigation 
as discussed in item business regulatory and environmental factors water quality  the north coast water board is requiring palco to appl y various waste discharge reporting  mitigation and erosion control requirements in respect of timber harvesting activities in several of its watersheds  and ma y impose additional measures in the future 
the requirements imposed to date have modestly increased operating costs  additional requirements imposed in the future could further increase costs and cause delays in thp approvals or lower harvest levels 
also discussed in note is the enactment of california senate bill  which provides regional water quality control boards with additional authority related to the approval of thps 
implementation of this law could result in delays in obtaining approvals of thps  increased costs and additional water protection measures beyond those contained in the hcp 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that certain other pending legal  regulatory and environmental matters or future governmental regulations  legislation or judicial or administrative decisions  adverse weather conditions or low lumber or log prices  will not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position  results of operations or liquidity

palco has continued to examine ways in which to achieve additional cost savings 
subsequent to december   palco opened a new planer facility in scotia and began construction on a million sawmill project in scotia 
funds for this project will come from existing cash resource s and borrowings under palco s new credit facility 
see financial condition an d investing and financing activities overview

forest products operations substantially all of mgi s consolidated assets are owned by palco  and a significant portion of palco s consolidated assets are owned by scotia llc 
the holders of the timber notes have priority over the claims of creditors of palco with respect to the assets and cash flows of scotia llc 
palco s credit facilit y discussed below contains certain restrictive covenants which effectively preclude the distribution of funds from palco to mgi 
the scotia llc line of credit allows scotia llc to borrow up to one year s interest on the timber notes the scotia llc line of credit

due to its highly leveraged condition  scotia llc is more sensitive than less leveraged companies to factors affecting its operations  including low log prices  governmental regulation and litigation affecting its timber harvesting practices see results of operations forest products operations above and note  and general economic conditions 
scotia llc s cash flows from operations are significantly impacted by harvest volumes and log prices 
the master purchase agreement between scotia llc and palco see item business forest products operations relationship with scotia llc contemplates that all sales of logs by scotia llc to palco will be at fair market value based on stumpage prices for each species and category of timber the master purchase agreement provides that if the purchase price equals or exceeds the sbe price and a structuring price set forth in a schedule to the timber notes indenture  the purchase price is deemed to be at fair market value if the purchase price equals or exceeds the sbe price  but is less than the structuring price  then scotia llc is required to engage an independent forestr y consultant to confirm that the purchase price reflects fair market value 
in january  the state board of equalization adopted the new harvest value schedule for the first half of the prices published in that schedul e reflected a increase in the sbe price for small redwood logs and a decrease for small douglas fir logs from the prices published for the second half of on august   standard poor s ratings services announced that it was lowering its ratings on all classes of the timber notes 
the rating on the class a timber notes was lowered from a to bbb  the rating on the class a timber notes was lowered from a to bbb  and the rating on the class a timber notes was lowered from bbb to bb 
standard poor s also indicated that the ratings remain on creditwatch with negative implications and that the lowered ratings reflect the negative impact that depressed timber prices  lower harvest levels  and higher operating costs have had on scotia llc s cash flow available for debt service 
as discussed in note  palco and scotia llc received million and million  respectively  in november from the sale of timberlands in th e grizzly creek grove 
the proceeds received by scotia llc were used to pay down a portion of the scotia llc line of credit 
with respect to short term liquidity  scotia llc believes that cash flows from operations and funds available under the scotia llc line of credit in respect of interest payments and the sar account in respect of principal payments  should provide sufficient funds to meet its working capital  capital expenditures and debt service obligations through  however  there can be n o assurance that this will be the case 
with respect to long term liquidity  although scotia llc believes that cash flows from operations and funds availabl e under the scotia llc line of credit and the sar account should be adequate to meet its working capital  capital expenditure and debt service obligations unless log prices continue to improve there can be no assurance that this will be the case 
in addition  liquidity  capital resources and results of operation s will be adversely affected if harvest levels decline or costs increase as a result of the various regulatory  environmental and litigation matters discusse d in results of operations forest products operations industry overview and selected operational data above and note see also note for further information regarding the timber notes 
at december   million of letters of credit and no borrowings were outstanding under palco s prior revolving credit agreement 
unused availability was limited to million at december  on january   palco entered into a new million asset based credit agreement with a bank the palco credit agreement 
this agreement provides revolving credit for three years after which palco may request a one year extension 
borrowings under the agreement bear interest at rates based upon and at variable margins above libor or the prime rate  and are secured by the substantial portion of palco s assets 
at february   million was outstanding under the palco credit agreement 
in accordance with the agreement  palco is required to maintain borrowings of million through february   palco had million of unused availability at february  palco anticipates that wit h respect to the first quarter of  it will not meet certain quarterly earnings thresholds required under the palco credit agreement  and is therefore seeking a waiver from the lender 
the lender has preliminarily indicated that i t will grant such a waiver  however  there can be no assurance that this will be the case 
capital expenditures were made during the past three years to improve production efficiency and reduce operating costs 
in february  palco undertook a project to construct a new sawmill in scotia  california 
the project is expected to cost million with various phases scheduled for completion from august through early funds for this project will com e from existing cash resources and borrowings under the palco credit agreement 
palco believes that the new sawmill will reduce annual operating costs by at least million beginning in as part of the project  the equipment from palco s carlotta mill will be moved to the new mill in scotia 
after this equipment is moved  the carlotta mill will be permanently closed  and managemen t is considering alternative uses for the property 
capital expenditures  excluding expenditures for the new sawmill and for timberlands  are estimated t o be between million and million per year for the period 
palco and scotia llc may purchase additional timberlands from time to time as appropriate opportunities arise 
the company estimates that funding requirements for pension benefits for will range from million to million 
palco s share of these amounts ranges from million to million 
such funding requirements are uncertain due to legislation currently pending in congress 
palco will require funds available under the palco credit agreement in order to meet its working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the next year 
palco s ability to meet such requirements could be adversely affecte d should the lender  under the palco credit agreement  not grant palco the waiver discussed above 
furthermore  palco s cash flows from operations may be adversely affected by diminished availability of logs from scotia llc  lower lumber prices  adverse weather conditions  pending legal  regulatory and environmental matters or increased funding requirements for its pension plan 
see results of operations forest products operations above as well as note for further discussion of the regulatory  environmental and legal matters affecting harvest levels 
with respect to long term liquidity  although mgi and its subsidiaries expect that their existing cash and cash equivalents  lines of credit and ability to generate cash flows from operations should provide sufficient funds to meet their debt service  working capital and capital expenditure requirements  until such time as palco has adequate cash flows from operations and or dividends from scotia llc  there can be no assurance that this will be the case 
liquidity  capital resources and results of operations in the long term may continue to be adversely affected by the same factors discussed above which are affecting short term cash flows from operations 
real estate operations one of the company s development projects in fountain hills has been delayed as a result of a local utility s current inability to demonstrate that it has adequate water supplies  and this delay will have a somewhat negative impact on cash flows for see trends real estate operations below for further discussion of this matter 
in march  the company s casino facility at its palmas del mar operation in puerto rico ceased operations due to the closure of a hotel which was owned and operated by a third party from whom the casino leased adjacent space 
as discussed further in note  the company does not expect that it will be able to lease space for its casino operations from the new hotel owner at palmas  and therefore does not expect cash flows from these operations in the future 
net cash flows from the casino s operations for were approximately million 
furthermore  the company expects that the new hotel owner will no t reopen the hotel until some time in late or pdmpi benefitted from th e revenues generated as a result of guests of the hotel using pdmpi s golf course and other resort related assets  and the hotel s continued closure could adversely affect the performance of pdmpi in other ways which are not able to b e quantified

with respect to the long term liquidity of such subsidiaries  the company believes that their ability to generate cash from the sale of their existing real estate  together with their ability to obtain financing and joint venture partners  should provide sufficient funds to meet their working capital and capital expenditure requirements 
pdmpi and its subsidiaries  however  have required advances from maxxam parent in prior years to fund their operations  and pdmpi may require such advances in the future

critical accounting policies and estimates this section contains statements which constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the pslra 
see item business general an d below for cautionary information with respect to such forward looking statements 
the discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations is based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the result of this process forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
the company re evaluates its estimates and judgments on a regular  ongoing basis 
actual results may differ from these estimates due to changed circumstances and conditions 
the following accounting policies and estimates are considered critical i n light of the potentially material impact that the estimates  judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of these policies might have on the company s reported financial information 
principles of consolidation deconsolidation of kaiser under generally accepted accounting principles for entities consolidated through voting interests  consolidation is generally required for investments o f more than of the outstanding voting stock of an investee  except when control is not held by the majority owner 
under these principles  legal reorganization or bankruptcy represent conditions which can preclude consolidation in instances where control rests with the bankruptcy court  rathe r than the majority owner 
as discussed above  on february   kaiser and certain of its subsidiaries filed for reorganization under chapter of the code 
as a result  the company deconsolidated kaiser s financial results beginning february   and began reporting its investment in kaiser using the cost method 
through february   under generally accepted principles of consolidation  the company had recognized losses in excess of its investment in kaiser of million 
since kaiser s results are no longer consolidated and the company believes that it is not probable that it will be obligated to fund losses related to its investment in kaiser  any adjustments reflected in kaiser s financial statements subsequent to february  relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities or the effects on existing stockholders deficit as well as adjustments made to kaiser s financial information for loss contingencies and other matters  are not expected to affect the company s financial results 
the company expects it will consider reversal of these losses when either kaiser s bankruptcy is resolved and the amount of the company s remaining investment in kaiser is determined or the company disposes of the kaiser shares 
accordingly  these consolidated financial statements do not reflect any adjustments related to the deconsolidation of kaiser other than presenting the company s investment in kaiser using the cost method  which reflects the investment as a single amount on its balance sheet  and discontinuing the recording of earnings or losses from kaiser after february  when eithe r of the events described above occurs  the company will re evaluate the appropriate accounting treatment of its investment in kaiser based upon the facts and circumstances at such time 
the debtors have indicated that the equit y of kaiser s stockholders will likely be cancelled without consideration as a result of kaiser s plan of reorganization 
loss contingencies the company is involved in various claims  lawsuits and other proceedings discussed in note such litigation involves uncertainty as to possible losse s the company may ultimately realize when one or more future events occur or fail to occur 
the company accrues and charges to income estimated losses from contingencies when it is probable at the balance sheet date that an asset has been impaired or liability incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
differences between estimates recorded and actual amounts determined in subsequent periods are treated as changes in accounting estimates ie  the y are reflected in the financial statements in the period in which they are determined to be losses  with no retroactive restatement 
the company estimates the probability of losses on legal contingencies based on the advice of internal and external counsel  the outcomes from similar litigation  the status of the lawsuits including settlement initiatives  legislative and regulatory developments  and other factors 
risks and uncertainties are inherent with respect to the ultimate outcome of litigation 
see note for further discussion of the company s material legal contingencies 
deferred tax asset valuation allowances as of december   the company had million of deferred tax assets net of million in valuation allowances and million of deferred tax liabilities 
the deferred tax assets and liabilities reported in the company s balance sheet reflect the amount of taxes that the company has prepaid or will receive a tax benefit for an asset or will have to pay in the future a liability because of temporary differences that result from differences in timing of revenue recognition or expense deductibility between generally accepted accounting principles and the internal revenue code 
accounting rules require that a deferred tax asset be reduced by a valuation allowance if  based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not a likelihood of more than that some portion or all of the deferred ta x asset will not be realized 
the company considers all available evidence  both positive and negative  to determine whether a valuation allowance is needed 
th e need for a valuation allowance ultimately depends on the existence of sufficien t taxable income to realize the benefit of a future deductible amount 
assessing the need for and amount of a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets requires significant judgment 
the fact that a benefit may be expected for a portion but not all of a deferred tax asset increases the judgmental complexity 
projections of future taxable income  by their very nature  require estimates and judgments about future events that  although they might conceivably be predictable  are far less certain than events that have already occurred and can be objectively measured 
uncertainties that might exist with respect to the realization of the company s deferred tax assets relate to future taxable income 
see note for further discussion of the company s valuation allowances on deferred tax assets obligations related to pension and other postretirement benefit plans estimating future benefit payments for purposes of measuring pension benefit obligations requires the company to make a number of assumptions about future experience 
these assumptions are combined with the terms of the company s plans to produce an estimate of required future benefit payments  which is discounted to reflect the time value of money 
as a result  assumption s about the covered population demographic assumptions and about the economic environment economic assumptions significantly affect pension and other postretirement benefit obligations 
the most significant demographic assumption s are expected retirement age  life expectancy  and turnover  while the key economic assumptions are the discount rate  the salary growth rate  and the expected return on plan assets 
the projected benefit obligation for the company s pension plans and the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation for the company s other postretirement benefit plans was determined using a discount rate of at december   and at december  the assumed long term rate o f compensation increase is 
the assumed long term rate of return on plan assets is 
plan assets consist principally of common stocks  us government and other fixed income obligations 
the estimated impact of a basis point decrease in the discount rate from to would increase the company s aggregate benefit obligation by approximately million  while the estimated impact of a basis point increase in the discount rate from to would decrease the company s aggregate benefit obligation by approximately million 
generally accepted accounting principles are applied to determine the expense that the company recognizes related to pension obligations  while pension plan funding is governed by tax and labor laws 
the company expects pension expense to be approximately million in  while cash contributions are expected to range from million to million in expected funding requirements for are uncertain due to legislation currently pending in congress 
this compared to pension expense of millio n and cash contributions of million in at december   the company had million in accrued liabilitie s related to pension benefits 
this amount consists of an accrued liability of million reflecting the cumulative excess of the amount the company has expensed over the amount the company has funded since inception of its plans  a s well as an additional minimum liability of million reflecting the excess o f the accumulated benefit obligation over the fair value of plan assets 
the decrease in in the underfunded status of the company s plans is primarily due to higher investment returns 
this favorable impact was offset in part by the impact of the lower discount rate 
see note for further discussion of the company s obligations related t o pension and other postretirement benefit plans 
impairment of noncurrent assets the company reviews noncurrent assets for impairment when circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
impairment is indicated if the total undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from use of the assets  including the possible residual value associated with their eventual disposition  are less than the carrying amount of the assets 
assets are written down to fair value and a loss is recognized upon impairment 
fair value increases on assets previously written down for impairment losses are not recognized 
considerable judgment is exercised in the company s assessment of the nee d for an impairment write down 
indicators of impairment must be present 
the estimates of future cash flows  based on reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections  require management s subjective judgments 
in some instances  situations might exist where impairments are the result of changes in economic conditions or other factors that develop over time  which increases the subjectivity of assumptions made 
depending on the assumptions and estimates used  the estimated future cash flows projected in the evaluation of long lived assets can vary within a wide range of outcomes 
a probability weighted approach is used for situations in which alternative courses of action to recover the carrying amount of long lived assets are under consideration or a range is estimated for the amount of possible future cash flows 
new accounting standards see note for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements and their potential impact on the company 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to changes in interest rates primarily under the scotia llc line of credit and the new palco credit agreement  as well as certai n other debt facilities used to finance real estate development activities 
these facilities bear interest at either the prime interest rate or libor plus a specified percentage point spread 
the scotia llc line of credit was establishe d in conjunction with the offering of the timber notes 
the company s objective i n maintaining its other variable rate borrowings is flexibility in borrowing fund s and making repayments without penalties 
as of december   there were million in borrowings outstanding under all variable rate facilities 
based on the amount of borrowings outstanding under these facilities during  a change in interest rates effective from the beginning of the year would have resulted in an increase or decrease in annual interest expense of million 
all of the company s other debt is fixed rate  and therefore  does not expose the company to the risk of higher interest payments due to changes in market interest rates 
the company does not utilize interest rate swaps or similar hedging arrangements
