item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition overview usg corporation the corporation and of its united states subsidiaries collectively  the debtors are currently operating under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code the bankruptcy code  an action taken to resolve asbestos claims in a fair and equitable manner  to protect the long term value of the debtors businesses  and to maintain the debtors leadership positions in their markets 
to properly understand the corporation and its businesses  investors  creditors or other readers of this report should first understand the nature of this voluntary reorganization process under chapter and the potential impacts the reorganization may have on their rights and interests in the corporation as described in more detail below 
at this point  there is great uncertainty as to the amount of the debtors asbestos related liability and thus the value of any recovery for pre petition creditors or stockholders under any final plan of reorganization 
no plan of reorganization has thus far been proposed  and the debtors have the exclusive right to propose a plan until march   subject to possible further extensions of the period of exclusivity 
the corporation had million of cash  cash equivalents  restricted cash and marketable securities as of december   and management believes that this available liquidity plus expected operating cash flows will meet the corporation s cash needs  including making regular capital investments to maintain and enhance its businesses throughout the chapter proceedings 
the corporation s net sales increased in as compared with demand for products sold by the corporation s north american gypsum and building products distribution operating segments was strong in due to strength in the new housing and repair and remodel markets in the united states 
however  continued weakness in the nonresidential construction market has depressed sales for the corporation s worldwide ceilings operating segment 
these trends are expected to continue in shipments of gypsum wallboard were at record levels for the corporation and the industry in and are expected to be strong in however  excess industry capacity has resulted in only a small increase in gypsum wallboard prices despite the strong demand 
the corporation s gross margin was in  down from in gross margin was adversely affected in by higher costs related to natural gas  benefits for plant employees pension and medical insurance for active employees and retirees  other insurance  information technology  and steel used in the manufacture of ceiling grid  which together added approximately million to cost of products sold in as compared with these costs are expected to continue to rise in voluntary reorganization under chapter on june  the petition date  the debtors filed voluntary petitions for reorganization the filing under the bankruptcy code 
these bankruptcy cases the chapter cases are pending in the united states bankruptcy court for the district of delaware the bankruptcy court 
the debtors intend to address their liability for all present and future asbestos claims  as well as all other pre petition claims  in a plan or plans of reorganization approved by the bankruptcy court 
a key factor in determining the recovery of pre petition creditors or stockholders under any such plan of reorganization is the amount that must be provided in the plan to resolve the debtors liability for present and future asbestos claims 
at this time  there is substantial uncertainty as to the amount that will be required to resolve these asbestos claims and thus whether or to what extent there will be any recovery for pre petition creditors or stockholders under any plan of reorganization 
background and principal impacts of the filing at the time of the filing  united states gypsum company us gypsum  a subsidiary of the corporation  was a defendant in more than  asbestos personal injury lawsuits 
us gypsum was also a defendant in asbestos lawsuits alleging property damage 
during late and in  following the bankruptcy filings of other defendants in asbestos personal injury litigation  plaintiffs substantially increased their settlement demands to us gypsum 
during that period  payments to resolve asbestos personal injury lawsuits against us gypsum increased dramatically 
us gypsum s asbestos related costs on a cash basis and before insurance rose from million in to million in and  absent the filing  were expected to exceed million in the corporation determined that voluntary protection under chapter would be the best way to resolve asbestos claims in a fair and equitable manner 
as a consequence of the filing  all asbestos lawsuits and other lawsuits pending against the debtors as of the petition date are stayed  and no party may take any action to pursue or collect pre petition claims except pursuant to an order of the bankruptcy court 
the debtors are operating their businesses without interruption as debtors in possession subject to the provisions of the bankruptcy code  and vendors are being paid for goods furnished and services provided after the filing 
prior to the filing  in the fourth quarter of  us gypsum recorded a noncash  pretax provision of million  increasing to  million its total accrued reserve for resolving in the tort system the asbestos claims pending as of december   and expected to be filed through at that time  the estimated range of us gypsum s probable liability was between million and  million  including defense costs 
as of december   the corporation s accrued reserve for asbestos claims totaled  million 
the debtors asbestos liabilities to be funded under a plan of reorganization have not yet been determined and are subject to substantial uncertainty 
counsel for the official committee of asbestos personal injury claimants and counsel for the legal representative for future asbestos personal injury claimants  appointed in the chapter cases  have indicated that they believe the debtors liabilities for present and future asbestos claims exceed the value of the debtors assets and  therefore  are significantly greater than both the reserved amount and the high end of the range estimated in  and that the debtors are insolvent 
in contrast  the debtors believe they are solvent if their asbestos liabilities are fairly and appropriately valued 
if federal legislation addressing asbestos personal injury claims is passed  which is extremely speculative at this time  such legislation may affect the amount that will be required to resolve the debtors asbestos personal injury liability in the debtors chapter cases 
see potential federal legislation regarding asbestos personal injury claims  below 
if the amount of the debtors asbestos liabilities is not resolved through negotiation in the chapter cases or addressed by federal legislation  the outcome of litigation proceedings in the chapter cases may determine the debtors liability for present and future asbestos claims 
because of these uncertainties  the corporation believes that no change should be made at this time to the previously recorded reserve for asbestos claims  except to reflect certain minor asbestos related costs incurred since the filing 
as the chapter cases and potential legislation activities proceed  the debtors likely will gain more information from which a reasonable estimate of the debtors probable liability for present and future asbestos claims can be determined 
if such estimate differs from the existing reserve  the reserve will be adjusted  and it is possible that a charge to results of operations will be necessary at that time 
in such a case  the debtors asbestos liability could vary significantly from the recorded estimate of liability and could be greater than the high end of the range estimated in this difference could be material to the corporation s financial position  cash flows and results of operations in the period recorded 
while it is the debtors intention to seek a full recovery for their creditors  it is not possible to predict the amount that will have to be provided in the plan of reorganization to resolve present and future asbestos claims  how the plan of reorganization will treat other pre petition claims  whether there will be sufficient assets to satisfy the debtors pre petition liabilities  and what impact any plan may have on the value of the shares of the corporation s common stock and other outstanding securities 
the payment rights and other entitlements of pre petition creditors and the corporation s shareholders may be substantially altered by any plan of reorganization confirmed in the chapter cases 
pre petition creditors may receive under the plan of reorganization less than of the face value of their claims  the pre petition creditors of some debtors may be treated differently from the pre petition creditors of other debtors  and the interests of the corporation s stockholders are likely to be substantially diluted or cancelled in whole or in part 
there can be no assurance as to the value of any distributions that might be made under any plan of reorganization with respect to such pre petition claims  equity interests  or other outstanding securities 
it is also not possible to predict how the plan of reorganization will treat intercompany indebtedness  licenses  transfers of goods and services  and other intercompany arrangements  transactions  and relationships that were entered into before the petition date 
these arrangements  transactions  and relationships may be challenged by various parties in the chapter cases  and the outcome of those challenges  if any  may have an impact on the treatment of various claims under any plan of reorganization 
see part ii  item note litigation for additional information on the background of asbestos litigation  developments in the corporation s reorganization proceeding and estimated cost 
potential federal legislation regarding asbestos personal injury claims the corporation has for many years actively supported proposals for federal legislation addressing asbestos personal injury claims 
on july   the judiciary committee of the united states senate narrowly approved the fairness in asbestos injury resolution act of senate bill  the fair bill  which is intended to establish a nationally administered trust to compensate asbestos personal injury claimants 
the fair bill has not been approved by the senate  has not been introduced in the house of representatives  and is not law 
under the terms of the fair bill as approved by the judiciary committee  companies that have been defendants in asbestos personal injury litigation  as well as insurance companies  are to contribute amounts to a national trust fund on a periodic basis to fund payment of claims filed by asbestos personal injury claimants who qualify for payment under the fair bill 
the amounts to be paid to the national fund are based on an allocation methodology specified in the fair bill 
it is not possible to predict whether the fair bill will be presented for a vote or passed by the full senate or the house of representatives  whether the fair bill will be signed into law  the final terms or cost of any bill that might become law  or the impact any such law might have on the corporation or the chapter cases 
enactment of the fair bill or other legislation addressing the financial contributions of the debtors for asbestos personal injury claims would have a material impact on the amount of the debtors asbestos personal injury liability 
the fair bill may also affect the manner in which such liability may be addressed in the debtors chapter cases 
however  it is extremely speculative as to whether the fair bill or similar legislation will be enacted or what the terms of any such legislation might be 
during this process  the chapter cases are expected to continue 
see part ii  item note voluntary reorganization under chapter for additional information on the fair bill 
accounting impact the corporation is required to follow american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position sop  financial reporting by entities in reorganization under the bankruptcy code 
pursuant to sop  the corporation s pre petition liabilities that are subject to compromise are reported separately on the consolidated balance sheet 
virtually all of the corporation s pre petition debt is currently in default and was recorded at face value and classified within liabilities subject to compromise 
us gypsum s asbestos liability also is classified within liabilities subject to compromise 
see part ii  item note voluntary reorganization under chapter  which includes information related to financial statement presentation  the debtor in possession statements and detail of liabilities subject to compromise and chapter reorganization expenses 
consolidated results of operations net sales net sales in were  million  up from net sales for the corporation s north american gypsum segment were up in primarily due to record shipments of sheetrock r brand gypsum wallboard  sheetrock r brand joint compounds and durock r brand cement board 
net sales for the building products distribution segment rose due to record shipments of gypsum wallboard sold by l w supply corporation l w supply and increased sales of complementary products 
however  net sales for the worldwide ceilings segment were down slightly as a result of the depressed ceilings market 
in  net sales of  million were up from this increase reflected higher levels of sales for north american gypsum and building products distribution  partially offset by lower sales for worldwide ceilings 
net sales for north american gypsum were up in primarily due to a increase in average selling prices for sheetrock r brand gypsum wallboard sold by us gypsum 
shipments of us gypsum s gypsum wallboard were up in versus net sales for building products distribution were up in primarily due to increased shipments and selling prices for gypsum wallboard sold by l w supply 
net sales for worldwide ceilings declined in as a result of lower domestic and export shipments of ceiling tile and lower shipments of domestic and internationally produced ceiling grid 
cost of products sold cost of products sold totaled  million in   million in and  million in key factors for the increase in were costs related to natural gas  benefits for plant employees pension and medical insurance for active employees and retirees  other insurance  information technology and steel used in the manufacture of ceiling grid 
these costs accounted for approximately million  or  of the total year on year increase 
cost of products sold for included an million charge recorded in the fourth quarter related to the downsizing of operations in europe  as discussed below under core business results worldwide ceilings 
however  manufacturing costs in for sheetrock r brand gypsum wallboard declined versus primarily due to lower energy costs  partially offset by higher prices for wastepaper  the primary raw material of wallboard paper 
in addition  cost reductions were realized for ceiling tile as a result of lower energy and raw materials costs and from the closure of a high cost ceiling tile production line in the fourth quarter of gross profit gross profit net sales less cost of products sold in was million  a decrease from million in gross margin gross profit as a percent of net sales was in  down from in these declines primarily reflect the aforementioned margin pressures affecting cost of products sold 
gross profit in was million  which was of net sales 
selling and administrative expenses selling and administrative expenses totaled million in  million in and million in as a percentage of net sales  these expenses were  and in  and  respectively 
increases over the three year period reflect in part the impact of a bankruptcy court approved key employee retention plan kerp  which became effective in the third quarter of expenses associated with this plan amounted to million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the increase in versus also reflected higher expenses related to benefits for non plant employees pension and medical insurance for active employees and retirees  which increased million year on year 
in addition  the corporation recorded a fourth quarter charge of million for severance related to a salaried workforce reduction of approximately employees 
these increases were partially offset by a lower level of accruals for employee incentive compensation associated with the attainment of profit and other performance goals 
the increase in versus reflected the timing difference related to the kerp a full year of kerp expense in  compared with one half year in and a higher level of accruals for employee incentive compensation 
chapter reorganization expenses chapter reorganization expenses consisted of the following millions legal and financial advisory fees bankruptcy related interest income accelerated amortization of debt issuance costs total chapter reorganization expenses provisions for impairment and restructuring in the fourth quarter of  the corporation recorded impairment charges totaling million pretax million after tax 
included in this total was million pretax related to the aubange  belgium  ceiling tile plant 
this impairment resulted from a decline in demand  which had been significantly affected by a worldwide slowdown in the nonresidential construction market  and from the plant s high cost structure 
the remaining million pretax was related to the port hawkesbury  nova scotia  gypsum fiber panel plant 
this impairment resulted from high delivered costs of products manufactured at port hawkesbury combined with the consolidation of production of fiberock r brand products at the gypsum  ohio  plant 
estimated future cash flows related to these facilities indicated that impairment charges were necessary to write down the assets to their third party appraised fair values 
also in the fourth quarter of  the corporation recorded a charge of million pretax million after tax related to a restructuring plan that included the shutdown of a gypsum wallboard plant in fremont  calif  a drywall steel plant in prestice  czech republic  a ceiling tile plant in san juan ixhuatepec  mexico  a ceiling tile manufacturing line in greenville  miss  and other restructuring activities 
included in the million pretax charge was million for severance related to a workforce reduction of more than positions primarily hourly positions  million for the write off of property  plant and equipment  and million for line shutdown and removal and contract cancellations 
the restructuring was intended to allow the corporation to optimize its manufacturing operations 
during the third quarter of  the corporation reversed million pretax million after tax of a restructuring reserve recorded in the fourth quarter of due to changes from previous estimates and to reflect a change in the scope of restructuring activities undertaken 
see part ii  item note exit activities for additional information related to restructuring payments and reserve balances 
operating profit operating profit totaled million in  million in and million in operating profit in included charges for impairment and restructuring  as discussed above 
interest expense interest expense was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
under sop  virtually all of the corporation s outstanding debt is classified as liabilities subject to compromise  and interest expense on this debt has not been accrued or recorded since the petition date 
consequently  comparisons of interest expense for and versus are not meaningful 
contractual interest expense not accrued or recorded on pre petition debt totaled million in  million in and million in although no post petition accruals are required to be made for such contractual interest expense  debtholders may seek to recover such amounts in the chapter cases 
interest income non bankruptcy related interest income was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
other income expense  net other income  net was million and million in and  respectively  compared with other expense  net of million in for  other income  net primarily represented net realized currency gains 
for  other expense  net included million of net realized currency losses related to the repayment of intercompany loans by a belgian subsidiary that was liquidated 
income taxes income taxes amounted to million in  million in and million in the corporation s effective tax rate was  and in  and  respectively 
the decrease in the effective tax rate in versus was primarily attributable to a reduction of the corporation s income tax payable during this reduction was determined upon completion of the corporation s federal income tax return and resulted from an actual tax liability that was lower than the estimate of taxes payable as of december  the change in the effective tax rate in versus was primarily attributable to the impact on the effective tax rate of the corporation s foreign operations  which in had no net earnings before taxes yet owed taxes in certain jurisdictions

net sales and operating profit in increased and  respectively  versus comparing with  us gypsum reported a increase in net sales primarily reflecting record shipments of sheetrock r brand gypsum wallboard  sheetrock r brand joint compounds and durock r brand cement board 
slightly higher selling prices for sheetrock r brand gypsum wallboard also contributed to the higher level of sales 
however  operating profit for us gypsum fell largely due to higher manufacturing costs 
us gypsum sold billion square feet of sheetrock r brand gypsum wallboard during  a increase from the previous record of billion square feet sold in us gypsum s wallboard plants operated at of capacity in  compared with in industry shipments of gypsum wallboard were up approximately from us gypsum s nationwide average realized price for gypsum wallboard was per thousand square feet in  up from in us gypsum s manufacturing costs for gypsum wallboard continued to be up in primarily due to increased energy and employee benefits costs 
market prices for natural gas  a major source of energy for the company  were up more than versus however  improved production efficiencies at the company s gypsum wallboard plants and hedging activities offset a portion of the cost increase 
higher energy  raw materials and employee benefits costs also had an adverse effect on profit margins for us gypsum s other products 
comparing with  net sales for us gypsum increased in primarily due to higher selling prices for sheetrock r brand gypsum wallboard 
the average selling price of per thousand square feet was up from in shipments of sheetrock r brand gypsum wallboard in totaled billion square feet  up from billion square feet in us gypsum s plants operated at of capacity in  compared with in shipments of sheetrock r brand joint compounds and durock r brand cement board also set records in and were up and  respectively  from prior year levels 
operating profit for us gypsum increased significantly in primarily due to the higher wallboard selling prices and increased level of shipments 
manufacturing costs in for sheetrock r brand gypsum wallboard declined versus primarily due to lower energy costs  partially offset by higher prices for wastepaper  the primary raw material of wallboard paper 
the gypsum business of canada based cgc inc cgc reported increases of in for both net sales and operating profit 
these results were primarily attributable to increased shipments of sheetrock r brand gypsum wallboard and a stronger canadian dollar 
comparing with  net sales and operating profit for cgc were up and  respectively  primarily reflecting increased shipments of sheetrock r brand gypsum wallboard and joint compounds and higher selling prices for joint compounds 
operating profit in also benefited from lower raw materials costs 
worldwide ceilings net sales of million in were down slightly from million in  while operating profit of million increased million  or 
however  as explained below  operating profit in included a fourth quarter million charge for the downsizing of european operations 
net sales for usg interiors  inc usg interiors  the corporation s domestic ceilings business  were down in versus as lower shipments of ceiling tile and grid were offset to a large extent by improved pricing for most of the company s ceiling product lines 
a decline in usg interiors operating profit primarily reflected increases in the costs of natural gas  steel and employee benefits 
due to strong demand for steel in china  japan and other non us markets  reduced production of steel in north america and europe  and a severe shortage of raw material used in the production of pig iron  it is possible that usg interiors could experience shortages of steel used for the manufacture of ceiling grid in for  usg interiors is implementing new marketing and distribution policies to improve profitability 
during  improved profitability was reported for usg international following the shutdown of the aubange  belgium  plant and other downsizing activities in the fourth quarter of comparing with  net sales of million and operating profit of million for the worldwide ceilings segment were down and  respectively 
net sales for usg interiors were down from primarily due to lower industry demand for commercial ceilings products in both the united states and europe 
as a result  domestic shipments of ceiling tile and grid and export shipments of ceiling tile were down in however  operating profit for usg interiors increased to million from million in primarily due to lower costs 
cost reductions resulted from lower energy and raw materials costs and from the closure of a high cost ceiling tile production line in the fourth quarter of net sales in for usg international were down from primarily due to lower demand for ceiling tile and grid in europe 
usg international reported an operating loss of million in  compared with an operating loss of million in the operating loss in included an million charge recorded in the fourth quarter related to management s decision to shut down the aubange  belgium  ceiling tile plant and other downsizing activities that addressed the continuing weakness of the commercial ceilings market in europe 
the charge was included in cost of products sold and reflected severance of million related to a workforce reduction of more than positions salaried and hourly  equipment writedowns of million and other reserves of million 
the other reserves primarily related to lease cancellations  inventories and receivables 
building products distribution l w supply  the leading specialty building products distribution business in the united states  reported net sales of  million and operating profit of million  representing increases of and  respectively  versus these increases reflected record shipments of gypsum wallboard and complementary building products  primarily drywall metal  joint compound  roofing and ceilings products 
shipments of gypsum wallboard by l w supply were up  while selling prices declined compared with in  l w supply reported net sales of  million  a increase from the higher level of sales primarily reflected higher selling prices up and increased shipments up for gypsum wallboard 
in addition  sales of complementary building products increased 
however  operating profit of million fell primarily due to higher gypsum wallboard unit costs up  which more than offset the increases in prices and shipments 
l w supply s gypsum wallboard margin declined as gypsum manufacturers higher selling prices to l w supply were not fully passed on to its customers 
l w supply remains focused on opportunities to profitably grow its specialty business  as well as opportunities to reduce costs and optimize asset utilization 
as part of its plan  l w supply opened or acquired eight locations and closed or consolidated six locations during  leaving a total of locations in the united states as of december   compared with and locations as of december  and  respectively 
market conditions and outlook industry shipments of gypsum wallboard in the united states were an estimated billion square feet in  an all time record and a increase from billion square feet in the new housing market continued to be strong in based on preliminary data issued by the us bureau of the census  us housing starts in were an estimated million units  compared with actual housing starts of million units in and million units in the repair and remodel market accounts for the second largest portion of the corporation s sales  behind new housing construction 
because many buyers begin to remodel an existing home within two years of purchase  opportunity from the repair and remodel market in was solid  as sales of existing homes in and remained at historically high levels 
the growth in new housing and a strong level of residential remodeling resulted in the record shipments of gypsum wallboard described above 
however  despite the favorable levels of activity in these two markets  which together account for nearly two thirds of all demand for gypsum wallboard  and increased operating rates in the gypsum industry for the second half of  selling prices for gypsum wallboard remained relatively unchanged primarily due to excess capacity 
future demand for the corporation s products from new nonresidential construction is determined by floor space for which contracts are signed 
installation of gypsum and ceilings products follows signing of construction contracts by about a year 
current information indicates that floor space for which contracts were signed was at historically low levels in both and as commercial construction has been affected by reduced corporate earnings  resulting in lower investments in office and other commercial space 
the outlook for the corporation s markets in is mixed 
industry demand for gypsum wallboard is expected to remain strong due to continued high demand for new homes and favorable levels of activity in the residential remodeling market 
despite the strong level of demand  the gypsum wallboard industry continues to experience a large amount of excess capacity 
industry utilization rates are expected to remain in the upper range 
nonresidential construction  the principal market for the corporation s ceilings products and a major market for its distribution business  is expected to remain weak 
in addition  the corporation  like many other companies  faces many ongoing margin pressures such as higher prices for natural gas and raw materials and increased employee benefits and insurance costs 
in this environment  the corporation continues to focus its management attention and investments on improving customer service  manufacturing costs and operating efficiencies  as well as selectively investing to grow its businesses 
in addition  the corporation will diligently continue its attempt to resolve the chapter proceedings  consistent with the goal of achieving a fair  comprehensive and final resolution to its asbestos liability 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity as of december   the corporation had million of cash  cash equivalents  restricted cash and marketable securities  of which million of cash and cash equivalents was held by non debtor subsidiaries 
the total amount of million was up million  or  from million as of december  these high levels of liquidity were generated by strong operating cash flows and the absence of cash payments related to asbestos settlements and interest on pre petition debt since the petition date 
contractual interest expense not accrued or recorded on pre petition debt was million in in july  a million debtor in possession financing facility the dip facility was approved by the bankruptcy court to supplement liquidity and fund operations during the reorganization process 
in june  the corporation terminated the dip facility 
this action was taken at the election of the corporation due to the levels of cash and marketable securities on hand and to eliminate costs associated with the dip facility 
cash flows as shown on the consolidated statement of cash flows  cash and cash equivalents increased million during the primary source of cash in was earnings from operations 
primary uses of cash were capital spending of million  working capital of million and net purchases of marketable securities of million 
an additional million was used to acquire several businesses  and million was designated as restricted cash representing cash collateral to support outstanding letters of credit 
comparing with  net cash provided by operating activities decreased to million from million primarily due the absence in of a federal income tax refund received in and the impact of a higher level of accrued employee incentive compensation in net cash used for investing activities decreased to million from million due to lower net purchases of marketable securities in net cash used for financing activities increased by million due to the aforementioned designation of restricted cash 
capital expenditures capital spending amounted to million in  compared with million in as of december   remaining capital expenditure commitments for the replacement  modernization and expansion of operations amounted to million  compared with million as of december  during the bankruptcy proceeding  the corporation expects to have limited ability to access capital other than its own cash  marketable securities and future cash flows to fund potential future growth opportunities such as new products  acquisitions and joint ventures 
nonetheless  the corporation expects to be able to maintain a program of capital spending aimed at maintaining and enhancing its businesses 
working capital total working capital current assets less current liabilities as of december   amounted to  million  and the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was to as of december   working capital amounted to million  and the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was to receivables increased to million as of december   from million as of december   primarily reflecting a increase in net sales for the month of december as compared with december inventories and payables also were up from december   primarily due to the increased level of business 
inventories increased to million from million  and accounts payable increased to million from million 
accrued expenses declined to million from million as of december   primarily due to a lower level of accruals for employee incentive compensation 
marketable securities as of december   million was invested in marketable securities  up million from million as of december  of the year end amount  million was invested in long term marketable securities and million in short term marketable securities 
the corporation s marketable securities are classified as available for sale securities and reported at fair market value with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss on the consolidated balance sheet 
letters of credit in june  the corporation entered into a three year  million credit agreement with lasalle bank na the lasalle facility to be used exclusively to support the issuance of letters of credit needed to support business operations 
as of december   million of letters of credit  which are cash collateralized at  were outstanding 
as of december   million of standby letters of credit remained outstanding under the dip facility 
following the termination of the dip facility in june  the corporation has been required to cash collateralize of these outstanding letters of credit until the letters of credit either expire or are returned by the beneficiary 
as of december   a total of million in cash collateral was posted to back up letters of credit as indicated above and was reported as restricted cash on the consolidated balance sheet 
debt as of december   total debt amounted to  million  of which  million was included in liabilities subject to compromise 
these amounts were unchanged from the december   levels and do not include any accruals for post petition contractual interest expense 
contractual obligations and other commitments contractual obligations the following table summarizes the corporation s commitments to make future payments under certain contractual obligations as of december  purchase obligations primarily consist of contracts to purchase energy and certain raw materials 
other long term liabilities primarily consist of asset retirement obligations as required under sfas no

in accordance with the corporation s funding policy  the corporation expects to contribute cash of approximately million to the us pension plan trust in the corporation voluntarily provides retiree health care and life insurance benefits for all eligible employees and retirees 
the portion of benefit claim payments made by the corporation in was million 
the corporation expects to experience cost trends in the future that are comparable to those of the past few years 
as of december   purchase obligations  as defined by sfas no 
 disclosure of long term obligations  were immaterial 
off balance sheet arrangements with the exception of letters of credit  it is not the corporation s general business practice to use off balance sheet arrangements  such as third party special purpose entities  or to issue guarantees to third parties 
as of december   the corporation had outstanding letters of credit of million under the lasalle facility and million under the dip facility 
the corporation had an additional million of outstanding letters of credit under a pre petition revolving credit facility provided by a syndicate of lenders led by jpmorgan chase bank formerly the chase manhattan bank 
to the extent that any of these letters of credit are drawn  jpmorgan chase bank would assert a pre petition claim in a corresponding amount against the corporation in the bankruptcy proceeding 
other matters legal contingencies as a result of the filing  all pending asbestos lawsuits against the debtors are stayed  and no party may take any action to pursue or collect on such asbestos claims absent specific authorization of the bankruptcy court 
see part ii  item note litigation for additional information on the background of asbestos litigation  developments in the corporation s reorganization proceeding and estimated cost 
the corporation and certain of its subsidiaries have been notified by state and federal environmental protection agencies of possible involvement as one of numerous potentially responsible parties in a number of so called superfund sites in the united states 
the corporation believes that neither these matters nor any other known governmental proceeding regarding environmental matters will have a material adverse effect upon its financial position  cash flows or results of operations 
see part ii  item note litigation for additional information on environmental litigation 
critical accounting policies the corporation s consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting policies generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
the following is a summary of the accounting policies the corporation believes are the most important to aid in understanding its financial results 
voluntary reorganization under chapter as a result of the filing  the corporation s consolidated financial statements reflect the provisions of sop and are prepared on a going concern basis  which contemplates continuity of operations  realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the ordinary course of business 
however  because of the filing  such realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities  without substantial adjustments and or changes of ownership  are subject to uncertainty 
given this uncertainty  there is substantial doubt about the corporation s ability to continue as a going concern 
such doubt includes  but is not limited to  a possible change in control of the corporation  as well as a potential change in the composition of the corporation s business portfolio 
while operating as debtors in possession under the protection of chapter of the bankruptcy code and subject to bankruptcy court approval or otherwise as permitted in the ordinary course of business  the debtors  or any of them  may sell or otherwise dispose of assets and liquidate or settle liabilities for amounts other than those reflected in the consolidated financial statements 
further  a plan of reorganization could materially change the amounts and classifications in the historical consolidated financial statements 
one of the key provisions of sop requires the reporting of the debtors liabilities incurred prior to the commencement of the chapter cases as liabilities subject to compromise 
the various liabilities that are subject to compromise include us gypsum s asbestos reserve and the debtors pre petition debt  accounts payable  accrued expenses and other long term liabilities 
the amounts for these items represent the debtors estimate of known or potential pre petition claims to be resolved in connection with the chapter cases 
such claims remain subject to future adjustments 
adjustments may result from i negotiations  ii actions of the bankruptcy court  iii further developments with respect to disputed claims  iv rejection of executory contracts and unexpired leases  v the determination as to the value of any collateral securing claims  vi proofs of claim  including unaccrued and unrecorded post petition interest expense  vii effect of any legislation which may be enacted or viii other events 
in particular  the amount of the asbestos reserve reflects us gypsum s pre petition estimate of liability associated with asbestos claims to be filed in the tort system through  and this liability  including liability for post claims  is the subject of significant legal proceedings and negotiation in the chapter cases 
other provisions of sop involve interest expense and interest income 
interest expense on debt classified as liabilities subject to compromise is not accrued or recorded 
interest income on cash accumulated during the bankruptcy process to settle claims under a plan of reorganization is netted against chapter reorganization expenses 
see part ii  item note voluntary reorganization under chapter for additional information related to the filing 
asbestos liability in evaluating us gypsum s estimated asbestos liability prior to the filing  the corporation considered numerous uncertainties that made it difficult to estimate reliably us gypsum s asbestos liability in the tort system for both pending and future asbestos claims 
in the property damage cases as defined in part ii  item note litigation  such uncertainties included  but were not limited to  the identification and volume of asbestos containing products in the buildings at issue in each case  which is often disputed  the claimed damages  the viability of statute of limitations and other defenses  the amount for which such cases can be resolved  which normally but not uniformly has been substantially lower than the claimed damages  and the viability of claims for punitive and other forms of multiple damages 
uncertainties in the personal injury cases as defined in part ii  item note litigation included  but were not limited to  the number  disease  age  and occupational characteristics of claimants in the personal injury cases  the jurisdiction and venue in which such cases are filed  the viability of claims for conspiracy or punitive damages  the elimination of indemnity sharing among members of the center for claims resolution the center for future settlements and its negative impact on us gypsum s ability to continue to resolve claims at historical or acceptable levels  the adverse impact on us gypsum s settlement costs of recent bankruptcies of co defendants  the continued solvency of other defendants and the possibility of additional bankruptcies  the possibility of significant adverse verdicts due to recent changes in settlement strategies and related effects on liquidity  the inability or refusal of former center members to fund their share of existing settlements and its effect on such settlement agreements  the continued ability to negotiate settlements or develop other mechanisms that defer or reduce claims from unimpaired claimants  and the possibility that federal legislation addressing asbestos litigation would be enacted 
the corporation reported that adverse developments with respect to any of these uncertainties could have a material impact on us gypsum s settlement costs and could materially increase the cost above the estimated range discussed below 
in  an independent actuarial study of us gypsum s current and potential future asbestos liabilities was completed 
this analysis was based on the assumption that us gypsum s asbestos liability would continue to be resolved in the tort system 
as part of this analysis  the corporation reviewed  among other things  the factors listed above as well as epidemiological data concerning the incidence of past and projected future asbestos related diseases  trends in the propensity of persons alleging asbestos related disease to sue us gypsum  the adverse effect on settlement costs of historical reductions in the number of solvent defendants available to pay claims  including reductions in membership of the center  the pre agreed settlement recommendations in  and the viability of  the long term settlements as defined in part ii  item note litigation  anticipated trends in recruitment by plaintiffs law firms of non malignant or unimpaired claimants  future defense costs  and allegations that us gypsum and the other center members bear joint liability for the share of certain settlement agreements that was to be paid by former members that now have refused or are unable to pay 
the study attempted to weigh relevant variables and assess the impact of likely outcomes on future case filings and settlement costs 
based upon the results of the actuarial study  the corporation determined that  although substantial uncertainty remained  it was probable that asbestos claims pending against us gypsum and future asbestos claims to be filed against it through both property damage and personal injury could be resolved in the tort system for an amount between million and  million  including defense costs  and that within this range the most likely estimate was  million 
consistent with this analysis  in the fourth quarter of  the corporation recorded a pretax noncash charge of million to results of operations  which  combined with the previously existing reserve  increased us gypsum s reserve for asbestos claims to  million 
these amounts are stated before tax benefit and are not discounted to present value 
less than percent of the reserve is attributable to defense and administrative costs 
the reserve as of december   was  million 
at the time of recording this reserve  it was expected that the reserve amounts would be expended over a period extending several years beyond  because asbestos cases in the tort system historically have been resolved an average of three years after filing 
the corporation concluded that it did not have adequate information to allow it to reasonably estimate the number of claims to be filed after  or the liability associated with such claims 
the corporation believes that  as a result of the filing and activities relating to potential federal legislation addressing asbestos personal injury claims  there is greater uncertainty in estimating the reasonably possible range of asbestos liability for pending and future claims as well as the most likely estimate of liability within this range 
there are significant differences in the treatment of asbestos claims in a bankruptcy proceeding as compared to the tort litigation system 
among other things  these uncertainties include i how the long term settlements will be treated in the bankruptcy proceeding and plan of reorganization and whether those settlements will be set aside  ii the number of asbestos claims that will be filed or addressed in the proceeding  iii the number of future claims that will be estimated in connection with preparing a plan of reorganization  iv how claims for punitive damages and claims by persons with no objective evidence of asbestos related disease will be treated and whether such claims will be allowed or compensated  v the impact historical settlement values for asbestos claims may have on the estimation of asbestos liability in the bankruptcy proceeding  vi the results of any litigation proceedings in the chapter cases regarding the estimated value of present and future asbestos personal injury claims alleging cancer or other diseases  vii the treatment of asbestos property damage claims in the bankruptcy proceeding  and viii the impact any relevant potential federal legislation may have on the proceeding 
see note voluntary reorganization under chapter potential federal legislation regarding asbestos personal injury claims 
these factors  as well as the uncertainties discussed above in connection with the resolution of asbestos cases in the tort system  increase the uncertainty of any estimate of asbestos liability 
as a result  it is the corporation s view that no change should be made at this time to the previously recorded reserve for asbestos claims  except to reflect certain minor asbestos related costs incurred since the filing 
as the chapter cases proceed  and the issues relating to estimation of the debtors asbestos liabilities are addressed  the debtors likely will gain more information from which a reasonable estimate of the debtors probable liability for present and future asbestos claims can be determined 
if such estimate differs from the existing reserve  the reserve will be adjusted  and it is possible that a charge to results of operations will be necessary at that time 
in such a case  the debtors asbestos liability could vary significantly from the recorded estimate of liability and could be greater than the high end of the range estimated in this difference could be material to the corporation s financial position  cash flows and results of operations in the period recorded

self insurance reserves the corporation purchases insurance from third parties for workers compensation  automobile  product and general liability claims that exceed certain levels 
however  the corporation is responsible for the payment of claims up to such levels 
in estimating the obligation associated with incurred and incurred but not reported losses  the corporation utilizes estimates prepared by actuarial consultants 
these estimates utilize the corporation s historical data to project the future development of losses 
the corporation monitors and reviews all estimates and related assumptions for reasonableness 
loss estimates are adjusted based upon actual claims settlements and reported claims 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized upon the shipment of products to customers  which is when title and risk of loss is transferred to customers 
the corporation believes this is the appropriate point of revenue recognition as the corporation has no further performance obligations unless the customer notifies the corporation of shortage of products or defective products shipped within five days after receipt of such products 
the corporation s products are shipped free on board fob shipping point 
provisions for discounts to customers are recorded based on the terms of sale in the same period the related sales are recorded 
the corporation also records estimated reductions to revenue for shortage of products or defective products  customer programs and incentive offerings  including promotions and other volume based incentives  based on historical information and review of major customer activity 
adoption of sfas no

 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
this standard requires the recording of the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred 
the corporation s asset retirement obligations include reclamation requirements as regulated by government authorities related principally to assets such as the corporation s mines  quarries  landfills  ponds and wells 
the accounting for asset retirement obligations requires a number of estimates by management as to the timing of asset retirements  the cost of retirement obligations  discount and inflation rates used in the determination of fair values and the methods of remediation associated with the corporation s asset retirement obligations 
the corporation generally utilizes assumptions and estimates reflective of the most likely remediation method on a site by site basis

forward looking statements this report contains forward looking statements related to management s expectations about future conditions 
the effects of the filing and the conduct  outcome and costs of the chapter cases  as well as the ultimate costs associated with the corporation s asbestos litigation  including the possible impact of any asbestos related legislation  may differ from management s expectations 
actual business or other conditions may also differ from management s expectations and accordingly affect the corporation s sales and profitability or other results 
actual results may differ due to various other factors  including economic conditions such as the levels of construction activity  interest rates  currency exchange rates and consumer confidence  competitive conditions such as price and product competition  shortages in raw materials  increases in raw materials and energy costs  and the unpredictable effects of acts of terrorism or war upon domestic and international economies and financial markets 
the corporation assumes no obligation to update any forward looking information contained in this report 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s in the normal course of business  the corporation uses financial instruments  including fixed and variable rate debt  to finance its operations 
in addition  the corporation uses derivative instruments from time to time to manage selected commodity price and foreign currency exposures 
the corporation does not use derivative instruments for trading purposes 
interest rate risk the corporation has interest rate risk with respect to the fair market value of its marketable securities portfolio 
derivative instruments are used to enhance the liquidity of the marketable securities portfolio 
the corporation s million of marketable securities consist of debt instruments that generate interest income for the corporation on excess cash balances generated during the corporation s chapter bankruptcy proceeding 
a portion of these instruments contain embedded derivative features that enhance the liquidity of the portfolio by enabling the corporation to liquidate the instrument prior to the stated maturity date  thus shortening the average duration of the portfolio to less than one year 
based on results of a sensitivity analysis  which may differ from actual results  the corporation s exposure to interest rate fluctuations is not material 
commodity price risk the corporation uses swap contracts to manage its exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices associated with anticipated purchases of natural gas 
a sensitivity analysis was prepared to estimate the potential change in the fair value of the corporation s natural gas swap contracts assuming a hypothetical change in market prices 
based on results of this analysis  which may differ from actual results  the potential change in the fair value of the corporation s natural gas swap contracts is million 
this analysis does not consider the underlying exposure 
foreign currency exchange risk the corporation has operations in a number of countries and uses forward contracts from time to time to hedge selected risk of changes in cash flows resulting from forecasted intercompany and third party sales or purchases denominated in non us currencies 
as of december   the corporation had no outstanding forward contracts
