the discussion and analysis that follows provides information management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of at t s consolidated results of operations for the years ended december   and  and financial condition as of december  and overview at t corp 
at t has undertaken significant changes to its business in recent years 
in  we spun off our broadband business and in we spun off our wireless business 
today  we are in the midst of transforming our business from a predominantly voice services business to a more diversified telecommunications and networking provider 
however  the communications industry we operate in continues to be fraught with economic and competitive challenges  reflecting significant changes the industry is undergoing 
industry dynamics that have impacted us include years of excess investment that has led to overcapacity and lower prices 
our results reflect the impacts of this challenging environment 
we continue to see declines in long distance voice revenue  which has long been the mainstay of our business 
for  stand alone long distance voice services accounted for approximately one half of our total revenue compared with nearly two thirds in we offer a growing list of services to businesses of all sizes  government agencies and residential customers 
our product set includes stand alone long distance voice services  local voice services  data services  internet protocol ip and enhanced services  as well as a variety of bundled offerings that package long distance voice  local voice  wireless and internet services 
in addition  we believe our balance sheet at t corp 
and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued provides us with a competitive advantage 
during  we increased our quarterly dividend by and reduced our total debt by billion 
at the same time  we ended with billion in cash 
we believe the strength of our balance sheet provides us with the flexibility to continue to make investments in our business that will drive further process enhancements and operating improvements 
within at t business services  we provide long distance voice services to retail customers and wholesale customers 
the retail business has experienced declines in long distance voice revenue as a result of lower volumes reflecting a competitive market and wireless and email substitution 
lower volumes can also be attributed to a weak economy that has affected many of the sectors in which our customers operate  such as financial services and travel 
although retail long distance voice volumes have declined  overall long distance voice volumes have increased due to demand for wholesale long distance voice services created largely by wireless industry growth 
as a result  our wholesale business has grown  and in accounted for approximately of at t business services total long distance voice volumes compared with approximately in our wholesale business represents sales of long distance voice services to resellers such as other long distance companies  local phone services providers  wireless carriers and cable companies  which are typically at a much lower rate per minute than retail 
although it costs us less to service a wholesale customer than a retail customer  the wholesale business generally has a lower operating income margin than the retail business due to lower pricing 
at t consumer services long distance voice business has experienced similar trends as those of at t business services 
stand alone long distance voice services revenue has continued to decline due to competition and technology substitution customers using wireless or internet services in lieu of a wireline call 
we have introduced lower priced calling plans to which many of our customers have migrated 
in addition  customers are migrating to bundled calling plans that  while negatively impact stand alone long distance revenue  positively contribute to growth in bundled revenue  although generally to a lesser degree  as bundled long distance pricing is lower 
due to the intense competition in long distance voice services  it is evident we must continue to diversify and grow our non long distance voice products and persist in our cost reduction efforts 
we continue to identify services customers want and stand ready to provide them 
we recently rolled out products such as wi fi wireless fidelity  switched ethernet service and voicetone 
all of these products demonstrate our intention to lead the industry in the next generation of technology 
they also demonstrate how we are leveraging technological innovation to transform the way networking is done  allowing customers to focus on their core competencies 
we continue to roll out bundled offers to consumers and small businesses  with our unlimited local and long distance plans of at t one rate usa sm for consumers and at t all in one advantage sm plan for small businesses 
during  we experienced revenue growth in advanced services of internet protocol ip and enhanced services and business local voice 
we also saw continued success in our consumer bundled offer 
for the fourth quarter of  bundled revenue represented nearly of total at t consumer services revenue compared with approximately for the fourth quarter of since these new product offerings are lower priced  and in some instances have not generated volumes necessary for economies of scale  they are significantly lower margin products 
as a result of this  coupled with the industry dynamics  we expect an operating income margin in of six to eight percent compared with in in addition  in light of the potential acquisition of at t wireless  we are evaluating opportunities to offer an at t branded wireless product 
these opportunities include reselling another company s wireless service under the at t wireless name 
we believe this will enhance the bundled offers we currently have 
we also have concentrated on  and will continue to concentrate on cost reductions  particularly within costs of services and products  and selling  general and administrative sg a expenses 
the ratio of total costs of services and products and sg a to revenue was essentially flat from to reflecting this focus 
contributing to this trend was a total headcount reduction of  which partially benefited  but at t corp 
and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued will more significantly benefit much of this headcount reduction was facilitated by the investments we made to streamline our processes that allowed us to cut costs  while also enhancing the customer experience 
during  we made improvements in cycle times complete time to install a customer s service and on time measures the percentage of time we meet the customer s installation date  both of which contribute to customer satisfaction 
one of the other ways we manage our costs is to continue to improve the efficiency of our network 
we are in the midst of a multi year plan to develop a network technology based in ip called multiprotocol label switching  or mpls 
in the next few years  we plan to have a fully mpls enabled backbone network in all locations worldwide 
instead of operating separate networks for different types of data and voice traffic  all traffic types will travel over a single core network 
a network based on ip supports faster provisioning times  thus enabling customers to be brought online more quickly 
we expect that an mpls based network will require less capital expenditures to expand its capabilities and incur less costs to develop and operate than today s network 
other costs such as access and other connection expenses  which represent the costs we pay to other services providers to connect calls using their facilities  are not as much within our control given they are based on rates generally set by governmental agencies 
many of these costs are volume driven and as volumes of lower priced services increase  these costs as a percentage of revenue increase  generating a negative impact to profit margins 
in order to control these costs  we continually search for alternate ways of connecting to our customers 
such initiatives include directly connecting more buildings to our network  thereby allowing us to avoid paying access charges 
we are also rolling out voice over internet protocol  or voip  as an alternative to paying terminating access fees to local exchange carriers as internet traffic is not currently regulated as a telephone service and is therefore not presently subject to access charges 
however  voip is an area that is receiving scrutiny by the fcc and could become regulated  which would eliminate some or all of the access cost savings we expect to receive 
however  voip is still a more efficient use of the network than the traditional circuit switched transport and is expected to reduce network costs 
in  we intend to aggressively market a full suite of voip enabled services to business customers worldwide via our mpls network 
for consumers  we intend to launch a voip offer in key markets in the second quarter of critical accounting estimates and judgments the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we have identified the critical accounting estimates that we believe require significant judgment in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we consider these accounting estimates to be critical because changes in the assumptions or estimates we have selected have the potential of materially impacting our financial statements 
estimated useful lives of plant and equipment we estimate the useful lives of plant and equipment in order to determine the amount of depreciation and amortization expense to be recorded during any reporting period 
the majority of our telecommunications plant and equipment is depreciated using the group method  which develops a depreciation rate annually based on the average useful life of a specific group of assets  rather than for each individual asset as would be utilized under the unit method 
the estimated life of the group changes as the composition of the group of assets changes and their related lives 
such estimated life of the group is based on historical experience with similar assets  as well as taking into account anticipated technological or other changes 
if technological changes were to occur more rapidly than anticipated or in a at t corp 
and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued different form than anticipated  the useful lives assigned to these assets may need to be shortened  resulting in the recognition of increased depreciation and amortization expense in future periods 
likewise  if the anticipated technological or other changes occur more slowly than expected  the life of the group could be extended based on the life assigned to new assets added to the group 
this could result in a reduction of depreciation and amortization expense in future periods 
a one year decrease or increase in the useful life of these assets would increase or decrease depreciation and amortization expense by approximately billion and billion  respectively 
we review these types of assets for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable over the remaining lives of the assets 
in assessing impairments  we follow the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
access and local connectivity costs we use various estimates and assumptions to determine the amount of access and local connectivity costs recognized during any reporting period 
switched access costs are accrued utilizing estimated rates by product  formulated from historical data and adjusted for known rate changes and volume levels  which are estimated for certain products and known for other products 
such estimates are adjusted monthly to reflect newly available information  such as rate changes and new contractual agreements 
bills reflecting actual incurred information are generally not received until three months subsequent to the end of the reporting period  at which point a final adjustment is made to the accrued switched access expense 
dedicated access costs are estimated based on the number of circuits and the average projected circuit costs  based on historical data adjusted for rate changes 
these costs are adjusted to reflect actual expenses over the three months following the end of the reporting period as bills are received 
as of december   approximately billion was accrued relating to our estimated switched and dedicated access costs 
recovery of goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we review goodwill for impairment annually  or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our business enterprise below its carrying value 
the impairment test requires us to estimate the fair value of our overall business enterprise down to the reporting unit level 
we estimate fair value using both a discounted cash flows model  as well as an approach using market comparables  both of which are weighted equally to determine fair value 
under the discounted cash flows method  we utilize estimated long term revenue and cash flows forecasts developed as part of our planning process  as well as assumptions of terminal value  together with an applicable discount rate  to determine fair value 
under the market approach  fair value is determined by comparing us to similar businesses or guideline companies 
selection of guideline companies and market ratios require management s judgment 
the use of different assumptions within our discounted cash flows model or within our market approach model when determining fair value could result in different valuations for goodwill 
as a result of our annual testing for this year  no impairment of goodwill was indicated 
pension and postretirement benefits the amounts recognized in the financial statements related to pension and postretirement benefits are determined on an actuarial basis utilizing several different assumptions 
a significant assumption used in determining our net pension credit income and postretirement benefit expense is the expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
in  we used an expected long term rate of return of  this rate remains unchanged for in determining this rate  we considered the current and projected investment portfolio mix and estimated long term investment returns for each asset class 
the projected portfolio mix of the plan assets is developed in consideration of the expected duration of related plan obligations and as such is more heavily weighted toward equity investments  including public and private equity positions 
the actual average return on pension plan assets over the last and years has been and per annum  respectively 
the expected return on plan assets is determined by applying the expected long term rate of return to the market related value of plan assets 
asset gains and losses resulting from actual returns that differ from our expected returns are recognized in the market related value at t corp 
and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued of assets evenly over a five year period 
the combined market related value of plan assets of the pension and postretirement benefit plans as of december   was approximately billion  about billion lower than the related fair value of plan assets 
the expected return on assets of the pension and postretirement benefit plans included in operating income was income of billion 
holding all other factors constant  a basis point decrease or increase in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets would have decreased or increased operating income by approximately billion 
another significant estimate is the discount rate used in the annual actuarial valuation of pension and postretirement benefit plan obligations 
in determining the appropriate discount rate at year end  we considered the current yields on high quality corporate fixed income investments with maturities corresponding to the expected duration of the benefit obligations 
as of december   we reduced the discount rate basis points to 
changes to the discount rate do not have a material impact on our results of operations  however  the discount rate does impact the benefit obligations 
holding all other factors constant  a basis point decrease or increase in the discount rate would increase or decrease the projected benefit obligation by approximately billion 
income taxes assessment of the appropriate amount and classification of income taxes is dependent on several factors  including estimates of the timing and probability of realization of deferred income taxes and the timing of income tax payments 
deferred income taxes are provided for the effect of temporary differences between the amounts of assets and liabilities recognized for financial reporting purposes and the amounts recognized for income tax purposes 
we measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates that  if changed  would result in either an increase or decrease in the provision for income taxes in the period of change 
a one percentage point increase in the enacted federal income tax rate as of december   would decrease net income by approximately billion 
a valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
in assessing the likelihood of realization  management considers estimates of future taxable income  the character of income needed to realize future tax benefits  and all available evidence 
actual income taxes could vary from estimated amounts due to the future impacts of various items  including changes in income tax laws  our financial condition and results of operations in future periods  as well as final review of our tax returns by taxing authorities  which  as a matter of course  are regularly audited by federal  state and foreign tax authorities 
legal contingencies we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings and have accrued amounts as appropriate that represent our estimate of the probable outcome of these matters 
the judgments we make with regard to whether to establish a reserve are based on an evaluation of all relevant factors by internal and external legal counsel  as well as subject matter experts 
the relevant factors analyzed include an analysis of the complaint  documents  testimony and other materials as applicable 
the damages claimed in most legal proceedings are not a meaningful predictor of actual potential liability because the amounts claimed generally have little or no relationship to the actual damages suffered or sustained 
in certain cases  the plaintiff may not have asserted a specified amount of damages 
claims are continually monitored and reevaluated as new information is obtained 
we may not establish a liability for a particular matter until long after the litigation is filed  once a liability becomes probable and estimable 
the actual settlement of such matters could differ from the judgments made in determining how much  if any  to accrue 
in addition  we may be responsible for a portion of certain legal proceedings associated with former affiliates pursuant to separation and distribution agreements 
such agreements require us to share in the cost of certain litigation relating to matters while affiliated with at t if a judgment or settlement exceeds certain thresholds 
however  in the event these former subsidiaries are unable to meet their obligations with respect to these liabilities due to financial difficulties  we could be held responsible for all or a portion of these costs  irrespective of the sharing agreements 
at t corp 
and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued other significant accounting policies not involving the same degree of judgment and uncertainty as those discussed above are nevertheless important to an understanding of the financial statements 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of accounting policies that we have selected from acceptable alternatives 
consolidated results of operations the comparison of results with results was impacted by the april  unwind of concert  our joint venture with british telecommunications plc bt 
the venture s assets and customer accounts were distributed back to the parent companies 
as a result  revenue and expenses associated with these customers and businesses are included in our results of operations for the full year of  as compared with nine months in  from april  through december  for the first quarter of  our proportionate share of concert s earnings and related charges are included in net losses related to other equity investments 
for the period august   through december   our interest in at t latin america was fully consolidated in our results 
in december  we signed a non binding term sheet for the sale of our economic interest voting interest in at t latin america and began accounting for at t latin america as an asset held for sale the operations of at t latin america did not qualify for treatment as a discontinued operation 
as a result  we recorded an impairment charge of billion to write down at t latin america s assets and liabilities to fair value  and reclassified these assets and liabilities to other current assets and other current liabilities at december  the operating losses of at t latin america for are reflected in net restructuring and other charges 
on april   at t latin america filed for chapter bankruptcy and on june   the at t appointed members of the at t latin america board of directors resigned 
they were replaced with three new independent directors 
this action resulted in the deconsolidation of at t latin america as of june  our consolidated financial statements reflect at t broadband and at t wireless as discontinued operations 
at t broadband was spun off on november   and at t wireless was split off on july  accordingly  the revenue  expenses and cash flows of at t broadband and at t wireless have been excluded from the respective captions in the consolidated statements of operations and consolidated statements of cash flows  and have been reported through their respective dates of separation as net loss from discontinued operations and as net cash used in provided by discontinued operations 
revenue for the years ended december  dollars in millions at t business services    at t consumer services    corporate and other total revenue    total revenue decreased  or billion  in compared with  and decreased  or billion  in compared with the decrease in both years was largely driven by continued declines in stand alone long distance voice revenue of billion in and billion in  reflecting competition  which has led to lower prices and loss of market share  as well as the impact of substitution by consumers  partially offset by strength in business wholesale volumes 
total long distance voice volumes including long distance volumes sold as part of a bundled offer increased approximately for as at t corp 
and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued growth in lower priced business wholesale more than offset the declines in business retail and consumer long distance volumes 
total long distance volumes decreased approximately in due to declines in consumer long distance coupled with slight growth in business volumes  as growth in wholesale was largely offset by a decline in retail volumes 
also contributing to the decline in total revenue for was lower outsourcing and professional services of billion and lower data services revenue of billion in at t business services 
partially offsetting the decline in total revenue was an increase in bundled services revenue primarily local and long distance voice in at t consumer services of approximately billion in and billion in also positively contributing to total revenue was at t business services local revenue  which increased billion in and billion in and ip enhanced services revenue  which increased billion in and billion in the variances include a positive impact attributable to the reintegration of customers and assets from the unwind of concert 
in  we expect total revenue to decline to resulting from continued declines in stand alone long distance voice revenue due to ongoing competition and product substitution  partially offset by growth in our local voice services revenue 
revenue by segment is discussed in greater detail in the segment results section 
operating expenses for the years ended december  dollars in millions access and other connection    costs of services and products    selling  general and administrative    depreciation and amortization    net restructuring and other charges   total operating expenses    operating income    operating margin included within access and other connection expenses are costs we pay to connect calls using the facilities of other service providers  as well as the universal service fund contributions and per line charges mandated by the fcc 
we pay domestic access charges to local exchange carriers to complete long distance calls carried across the at t network and terminated on a local exchange carrier s network 
we also pay local connectivity charges for leasing components of local exchange carrier networks in order to provide local service to our customers 
international connection charges paid to telephone companies outside of the united states to connect international calls are also included within access and other connection expenses 
universal service fund contributions are charged to all telecommunications carriers by the fcc based on a percentage of state to state and international services revenue to provide affordable services to eligible customers 
in addition  the fcc assesses charges on a per line basis 
since most of the universal service fund contributions and per line charges are passed through to the customer  a reduction in these expenses generally results in a corresponding reduction in revenue 
access and other connection expenses increased  or million  in compared with access charges for included a billion access expense adjustment to reflect the proper estimate of the liability relating to access costs incurred in and see note to the consolidated financial statements at t corp 
and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued for additional information 
excluding this adjustment  access and other connection expenses declined billion driven by a decline in domestic access charges of billion in  primarily due to more efficient network usage and product mix aggregating billion 
in addition  the decline was due to lower universal service fund contributions of billion resulting from the decline in long distance voice revenue and lower per line charges of billion due to a decline in customer levels 
these declines in domestic access charges were partially offset by higher costs of billion as a result of overall long distance volume growth 
also contributing to the decline in access and other connection expenses were lower international connection charges of billion  primarily as a result of lower rates 
these declines were partially offset by an increase in local connectivity costs of billion  primarily due to local subscriber increases resulting from new state entries and growth in existing markets 
in  we expect domestic access expense and international connection costs to be lower than in due to our ongoing efforts to more efficiently manage our network and negotiate lower rates  as well as from continued changes in product mix  partially offset by increased local connectivity costs as we continue to grow our local voice business 
access and other connection expenses decreased  or billion  in compared with domestic access charges declined billion driven by lower universal service fund contributions and per line charges of billion  which were primarily driven by the decline in long distance voice revenue and lower customer levels 
in addition  domestic access charges decreased billion primarily due to product mix and fcc mandated access rate reductions 
international connection charges decreased approximately billion driven primarily by lower rates and the reintegration of customers and assets from the unwind of concert 
these reductions were partially offset by an increase in local connectivity costs of billion 
costs of services and products include the costs of operating and maintaining our networks  the provision for uncollectible receivables and other service related costs  including the cost of equipment sold 
costs of services and products decreased billion  or  in compared with approximately billion of the decline was attributable to the overall impact of lower revenue and related costs  including cost cutting initiatives 
also contributing to the decline was a lower provision for uncollectible receivables of billion resulting from lower revenue and improved collections as well as lower expenses of billion resulting from the deconsolidation of our at t latin america subsidiary 
these declines were partially offset by billion due to the impact of a weak us dollar and billion of increased postretirement and pension costs resulting from a lower expected long term rate of return on plan assets and the effects of lower actual plan assets 
we expect that costs of services and products will continue to decline in driven both by lower expected revenue and our ongoing cost control efforts 
in  these costs decreased billion  or  compared with approximately billion of the decrease was due to the overall impact of lower revenue and related costs 
in addition  costs decreased approximately billion due to losses on certain long term contracts recorded in by at t business services 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase of billion in at t business services provision for uncollectible receivables primarily attributable to the weak economy 
costs of services and products also increased as a result of the reintegration of customers and assets from the unwind of concert 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses decreased billion  or  in compared with the decline was primarily attributable to cost control efforts throughout at t  as well as reduced customer care volumes at at t consumer services resulting from a reduction in the number of residential customers  totaling billion 
cost control efforts included headcount reductions  lower long distance and brand advertising and promotional spending  and other process improvements 
in addition  expenses decreased billion in connection with the deconsolidation of at t latin america 
such declines were partially at t corp 
and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued offset by billion of increased pension and postretirement costs primarily resulting from a lower expected long term rate of return on plan assets in and the effects of lower actual plan assets  as well as approximately billion of increased marketing  customer care and sales expenses associated with new local service offerings by at t consumer services 
we expect that our sg a expenses will continue to decline in  as we continue to focus on further cost reduction efforts 
sg a expenses decreased billion  or  in compared with this decrease was driven by a reduction in the number of residential customers as well as cost control efforts of billion  and lower transaction costs of billion associated with the at t restructuring 
partially offsetting these decreases was billion of lower pension credits income primarily due to a lower expected long term rate of return on plan assets and the effects of lower actual plan assets  and billion associated with increased marketing and sales expenses for new local consumer service offerings and increased investment for business sales and customer care development 
sg a expenses also increased as a result of the reintegration of customers and assets from the unwind of concert 
depreciation and amortization expenses decreased million  or  in compared with the decreases were primarily due to the adoption of sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  lower depreciation associated with our at t latin america subsidiary which was classified as an asset held for sale in december and lower asset impairments in these declines were largely offset by an increase in the asset base 
in  we expect depreciation and amortization expenses to remain relatively flat compared with as lower expenses resulting from reduced levels of capital expenditures in recent years will essentially be offset by increased expenses associated with the shortening of lives of certain network assets in connection with our development of an ip based network 
depreciation and amortization expenses increased billion  or  in compared with the increase was primarily due to a larger asset base resulting from continued infrastructure investment supporting our advanced services 
the increase was partially offset by the adoption of sfas no 
as of january   which eliminated the amortization of goodwill 
in  we recorded billion of amortization expense on goodwill 
total capital expenditures were billion  billion and billion for  and  respectively 
the amount includes billion recorded in connection with the adoption of financial accounting standards board interpretation fin no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
the decreases in expenditures were primarily due to less spending on infrastructure related projects  as many projects were completed in  partially offset by increased spending on capitalized software related to process improvements and initiatives to improve the customer experience 
during  approximately one quarter of our spending related to capitalized software 
we continue to focus the majority of our capital spending on our advanced services offerings of ip e services and data services  both of which included managed services  as well as local voice services 
we expect capital expenditures to be approximately billion in in  net restructuring and other charges of billion primarily consisted of separation costs associated with our management realignment efforts 
the net charge included billion related to at t business services  million related to at t consumer services and million related to the corporate and other group 
the separations were involuntary and impacted approximately  managers  more than of which have exited the business as of december  these activities were partially offset by the reversal of million of excess vintage employee separation liabilities 
these exit plans did not yield cash savings net of severance benefit payouts or a benefit to operating income net of the restructuring charge at t corp 
and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued recorded in  however  we expect to realize approximately billion of cash savings and benefit to operating income in subsequent years  when the exit plan is completed 
as we continue to evaluate our cost structure and improve processes  further workforce reductions are anticipated to occur during  and are expected to result in the recognition of additional charges 
in  net restructuring and other charges were billion 
the net charge included billion related to at t business services  billion related to at t consumer services and million related to the corporate and other group 
in december  our board of directors approved a plan for at t to sell its approximate voting stake in at t latin america in its current condition 
on december   we signed a non binding term sheet for the sale of our shares within one year for a nominal amount 
as a result of this action  we recorded a billion asset impairment charge to write down at t latin america s assets to fair value 
this charge was recorded within our at t business services segment 
an impairment charge of billion was also recorded in relating to certain digital subscriber line dsl assets including internal use software  licenses  and property  plant equipment that would not be utilized by at t as a result of changes to our dsl build strategy 
instead of building dsl capabilities in all geographic areas initially targeted  we have signed an agreement with covad communications to offer dsl services over its network 
as a result  the assets in these areas were impaired 
this charge was recorded within our at t consumer services segment 
net business restructuring charges of billion recorded in consisted of new exit plans totaling billion and reversals of liabilities associated with prior years exit plans of billion 
the new plans primarily consisted of billion for employee separation costs million of which was recorded as a pension liability associated with management employees to be separated in  which was funded from the pension trust and million of facility closing reserves 
these exit plans separated slightly more than  employees  approximately one half of whom were management employees and one half were non management employees 
the majority of these employee separations were involuntary and were largely the result of improved processes and automation in provisioning and maintenance of services for business customers 
the billion reversal primarily consisted of billion of employee separation costs approximately million of which was reversed from the pension liability and million related to prior plan facility closings that were deemed to be no longer necessary 
the reversals were primarily due to management s determination that the restructuring plan established in the fourth quarter of for certain areas of at t business services  including network services  needed to be modified given industry conditions at that time  as well as the redeployment of certain employees to different functions 
during  net restructuring and other charges of billion were primarily comprised of billion for employee separations  of which billion related to benefits to be paid from pension assets as well as pension and postretirement curtailment losses  and billion for facility closings 
the restructuring and exit plans supported our cost reduction efforts through headcount reductions across all segments of the business  primarily network support and customer care functions in at t business services 
these charges were slightly offset by the reversal of million related to business restructuring plans announced in the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of of which million related to employee separations and million related to contract terminations 
the net charge consisted of billion related to at t business services  million related to at t consumer services and billion related to the corporate and other group 
the charge covered separation costs for approximately  employees  approximately one half of whom were management and one half were non management employees 
more than  employee separations related to involuntary terminations and the remaining  were voluntary 
at t corp

in  ongoing difficulties in the airline industry resulted in the write downs of the residual values of certain aircraft 
the lower impairment charges related to these leases and aircraft in compared with favorably impacted other income by billion in also  in  investment related impairment charges declined billion  primarily driven by the impairment of time warner telecom in our investment in time warner telecom was subsequently sold in further contributing to the favorable other income variance was higher investment related income of billion  largely reflecting improved market returns on certain holdings 
partially offsetting these favorable variances were losses of billion on the early call and repurchase of long term debt in this loss was comprised of billion associated with the early call and repurchase of long term debt instruments  partially offset by a billion gain on the early retirement of exchangeable notes that were indexed to at t wireless common stock 
also offsetting the favorable variance was a decline in settlements associated with disposed businesses  primarily reflecting reimbursements from comcast corporation comcast in in connection with the debt exchange completed in conjunction with the spin off of at t broadband 
we continue to hold investments in leveraged leases of commercial aircraft  which we lease to domestic airlines as well as aircraft related companies 
should the financial difficulties in the us airline industry lead to further bankruptcies or lease restructurings  we could record additional losses associated with our aircraft lease portfolio 
in addition  in the event of bankruptcy or renegotiation of lease terms  if any portion of the non recourse debt is canceled  such amounts would result in taxable income to at t and accordingly a cash tax expense 
other income expense  net  in was expense of billion compared with income of billion in the unfavorable variance of billion was primarily due to billion of higher net gains on sales of businesses and investments in  including gains on the sale of at t s retained interest in at t wireless and japan telecom 
the unfavorable variance was also due to impairments of billion recorded in related to certain leases of aircraft that are accounted for as leveraged leases  billion of lower income related to mark to market adjustments on derivative instruments and lower investment related income of billion  reflecting the declines in the stock market 
favorably impacting other income expense  net  were lower investment impairment charges of billion in  primarily driven by lower impairment charges for time warner telecom 
in and  as a result of significant changes in the general business climate as evidenced by the severe downward movement in the us stock market  including the decline in the value of publicly traded industry stocks  we recorded an other than temporary investment impairment on our investment in time warner telecom

the effective tax rate was positively impacted by approximately percentage points due to the recognition of approximately billion of tax benefits associated with refund claims related to research and experimentation tax credits generated in prior years 
in addition  the effective tax rate was positively impacted by the recognition of tax benefits in connection with the exchange and sale of at t s remaining interest in at t wireless common stock 
the rate was adversely impacted by approximately percentage points due to the billion impairment charge recorded in relating to our interest in at t latin america for which no tax benefit was recorded 
also negatively impacting the rate was the impact of at t latin america s losses from operations for which no tax benefit was recorded because realization of a tax benefit was not likely to occur and the losses were not includable in at t s consolidated income tax return 
in  the effective tax rate was positively impacted by tax benefits associated with the tax free gain from the disposal of a portion of our retained interest in at t wireless in a debt for equity exchange  partially offset by the consolidation of at t latin america s pretax losses for which no tax benefit was provided 
in  we recorded a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset attributable to the book and tax basis difference for our investment in at t latin america 
during february  the subsidiaries of at t latin america were sold to telefonos de mexico sa de sa  or telmex  and the plan of liquidation of at t latin america became effective 
as a result  we will reevaluate the need for this valuation allowance and could record an income tax benefit of approximately billion in the first quarter of for the years ended december  dollars in millions minority interest income minority interest income represents the net losses attributable to the equity that minority holders have in less than owned consolidated subsidiaries of at t 
in december  the losses attributable to the minority holders of at t latin america exceeded the remaining equity of those minority holders  therefore in  losses of at t latin america were no longer allocated to the minority holders 
also in  at t latin america filed for chapter bankruptcy and the at t appointed members of the at t latin america board of directors resigned 
this resulted in the deconsolidation of at t latin america

we redeemed each outstanding share of class a and class b liberty media group lmg tracking stock for one share of liberty media corporation s series a and series b common stock  respectively 
we did not have a controlling financial interest in lmg for financial accounting purposes  therefore  our ownership in lmg was reflected as an investment accounted for under the equity method 
for the years ended december  dollars in millions net losses related to other equity investments  net losses related to other equity investments  which are recorded net of income taxes  declined billion in the favorable variance was driven primarily by after tax charges of billion billion pretax recorded in related to the estimated loss on our commitment to purchase the shares of at t canada we did not own 
the charges reflected further deterioration in the underlying value of at t canada as well as accretion of the floor price of our obligation to purchase at t canada shares 
we satisfied this purchase obligation in see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
net losses related to other equity investments declined billion in compared with due to lower net losses of billion for concert  billion for at t canada and billion for netphone  inc  primarily resulting from impairment charges recorded in for the years ended december  dollars in millions net loss from discontinued operations  net of income taxes   gain on disposition of discontinued operations   net loss from discontinued operations for reflects an estimated cost related to potential legal liabilities for certain environmental clean up matters associated with ncr corp 
ncr  which was spun off from at t in and accounted for as a discontinued operation 
ncr has been formally notified by federal and state agencies that it is a potentially responsible party prp for environmental claims under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act of cercla and other statutes arising out of the presence of polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs in sediments in the lower fox river and in the bay of green bay in wisconsin 
ncr was identified as a prp because of alleged pcb discharges from two carbonless copy paper manufacturing facilities it previously owned  which were located along the fox river 
in july  the government clarified its planned approach for remediation of the contaminated sediments  which caused ncr to increase its estimated liability 
under the separation and distribution agreement between at t and ncr  we are required to pay a portion of such costs that ncr incurs above a certain threshold 
therefore  in  we recorded our estimated proportionate share of certain costs associated with the fox river matter  which totaled million on both a pretax and after tax basis 
the extent of ncr s potential liability is subject to numerous variables that are uncertain at this time  including the actual remediation costs and the percentage ncr may ultimately be responsible for 
as a result  our actual liability may be different than the estimated amount 
pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement  ncr is liable for the first million of costs in connection with this liability 
we are liable for at t corp 
and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued of costs incurred by ncr beyond such million threshold 
all such amounts are determined after reduction of any monies collected by ncr from other parties 
net loss from discontinued operations in includes a loss of billion from the discontinued operations of at t broadband which was primarily comprised of the at t broadband segment  which was spun off to at t shareowners on november  simultaneously  at t broadband combined with comcast 
the combination was accomplished through a distribution of stock to at t shareowners  who received shares of comcast class a common stock for each share of at t they owned at market close on november   the record date 
approximately billion comcast shares were issued to at t shareowners at a value of approximately billion  based on the comcast stock price on november  at t shareowners received a economic stake and a voting interest in comcast 
net loss from discontinued operations in also included an estimated loss on the litigation settlement associated with the business of lucent technologies inc lucent  which was spun off from at t in and accounted for as a discontinued operation 
sparks  et al 
v 
at t and lucent et al  was a class action lawsuit filed in in illinois state court 
on august   a settlement proposal was submitted to and accepted by the court 
in accordance with the separation and distribution agreement between at t and lucent  our estimated proportionate share of the settlement and legal costs recorded in totaled million after taxes million pretax 
depending upon the number of claims submitted and accepted  the actual cost of the settlement may be different than the amounts accrued 
while similar consumer class actions are pending in various state courts  the illinois state court has held that the class it certified covers claims in the other state court class actions 
in  net loss from discontinued operations included a loss of billion from the discontinued operations of at t broadband  and income of billion from the discontinued operations of at t wireless  which was split off from at t on july   as a separate  independently traded company 
all at t wireless group tracking stock was converted into at t wireless common stock on a one for one basis and  million shares of at t wireless common stock held by at t were distributed to at t common shareowners on a basis of shares of at t wireless for each at t share outstanding 
we issued the at t wireless tracking stock in april  to track the financial performance of at t wireless group 
in  we realized a noncash gain on the disposition of at t broadband of billion  which represented the difference between the fair value of the at t broadband business at the date of the spin off and our book value of at t broadband  net of certain charges triggered by the spin off of billion  and the related income tax effect of billion 
these charges included compensation expense due to the accelerated vesting of stock options as well as the enhancement of certain incentive plans

for the years ended december  dollars in millions cumulative effect of accounting changes when we adopt new accounting standards issued by the financial accounting standards board  the impact of changing from the previous accounting principle to the new accounting principle is recorded as the cumulative effect of an accounting change 
at t corp 
and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued effective july   we early adopted fin no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of accounting research bulletin arb no 
 resulting in a charge of million  net of income taxes of million  recognized as the cumulative effect of accounting change in the third quarter of this interpretation requires the primary beneficiary to consolidate a variable interest entity vie if it has a variable interest that will absorb a majority of the entity s expected losses if they occur  receive a majority of the entity s expected residual returns if they occur  or both 
based on this standard  two entities that we leased buildings from qualified as vies and  therefore  were consolidated as of july  later in  we exercised our purchase option on these buildings and  therefore  no longer have an interest in these vies 
effective january   we adopted sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  resulting in million of income  net of income taxes of million  as the cumulative effect of this accounting principle 
this standard requires that obligations that are legally enforceable and unavoidable  and are associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets  be recorded as liabilities when those obligations are incurred  with the amount of the liability initially measured at fair value 
historically we included in our group depreciation rates an amount related to the cost of removal for certain assets 
however  such amounts are not legally enforceable or unavoidable  therefore  the cumulative effect impact primarily reflects the reversal of such amounts accrued in accumulated depreciation 
effective january   we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
in accordance with sfas no 
 franchise costs were tested for impairment as of january   by comparing the fair value to the carrying value at the market level 
as a result of this test  an impairment loss related to discontinued operations of billion  net of income taxes of billion  was recorded in effective january   we adopted sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the cumulative effect of this accounting change  net of applicable income taxes  was comprised of billion for at t excluding lmg of which billion related to discontinued operations and billion for lmg 
the billion was attributable primarily to fair value adjustments of equity derivative instruments embedded in indexed debt instruments and warrants held in public and private companies 
the billion recorded by lmg represented the impact of separately recording the embedded call option obligations associated with lmg s senior exchangeable debentures

the beneficial conversion feature was computed upon the issuance of the preferred stock to ntt docomo and represented the excess of the fair value of the preferred shares issued over the proceeds received 
this beneficial feature was being accreted over the time period ntt docomo was required to hold the shares 
on july   in conjunction with the split off of at t wireless group  these preferred shares were converted into at t wireless common stock 
as a result  the beneficial conversion feature was fully accreted 
in may  we completed an exchange offer of at t common stock for at t wireless tracking stock 
the premium on the exchange  which represented the excess of the fair value of the at t wireless tracking stock issued over the fair value of the at t common stock exchanged  reduced net income available to common shareowners

nearly all prepaid pension assets  taxes and corporate owned or leased real estate are held at the corporate level  and therefore are included in the corporate and other group 
a substantial majority of our property  plant and equipment including network assets is included in the at t business services segment 
the net loss from discontinued operations is not reflected in the corporate and other group 
capital additions for each segment include capital expenditures for property  plant and equipment  additions to nonconsolidated investments and additions to internal use software 
our existing segments reflect certain managerial changes that were implemented during the changes primarily include a redistribution of property  plant and equipment from the corporate and other group to at t business services and a transfer of deferred taxes from at t consumer services to the corporate and other group 
based on a review of our management model in  we plan to transfer our remaining payphone business from the at t consumer services segment to the at t business services segment  which will require the restatement of our segments

partially offsetting these declines was an increase  in both years  in lower priced wholesale minutes 
total long distance calling volumes grew approximately and  in and  respectively 
the volume growth differential in compared with is reflective of the acceleration in of wholesale minute growth 
data services revenue declined billion  or  in compared with the decline was primarily driven by competitive pricing pressure and weak demand  primarily in data bandwidth services 
the at t corp

there were approximately million  million and million access lines in service at the end of  and  respectively 
in  we expect at t business services revenue will decline to as competitive pressures in long distance voice and data services continue  combined with the ongoing shift in the retail wholesale mix in long distance voice services  which will be partially offset by growth in local voice and ip e services revenue 
operating income operating income declined billion  or  in compared with  primarily due to the decrease in the long distance voice business resulting from the impact of continued decline in the average price per minute and declining retail volumes tied to the weak economy and substitution 
the decline in operating income was also impacted by a billion access expense adjustment recorded in the third quarter of largely offsetting these declines were lower net restructuring and other charges due to the billion at t latin america impairment charge and ongoing cost control efforts 
in  operating income decreased billion  or  compared with  primarily due to the decrease in the long distance voice business resulting from the impact of pricing pressures and a billion impairment charge recorded in for at t latin america 
these decreases were partially offset by billion in lower net business restructuring charges recorded in compared with operating margin was  and in  and  respectively 
the margin was negatively impacted by approximately percentage points relating to the billion at t latin america asset impairment charge 
adjusting for this item  the downward margin trend is primarily reflective of the declining higher margin long distance retail voice business  coupled with growth of lower margin advanced services and wholesale services 
other items capital additions were billion  billion and billion for  and  respectively 
the amount includes billion recorded in connection with the adoption of fin no 
the declines in spending were primarily due to less spending on infrastructure related projects  as many projects were completed during  partially offset by increased spending on capitalized software related to process improvements and initiatives to improve customer experience

total assets decreased billion  or  at december   compared with december  the decrease was primarily driven by lower net property  plant and equipment as a result of depreciation during the period  partially offset by capital expenditures 
also contributing to the decline was lower accounts receivable resulting from lower revenue and improved cash collections  and a decrease in other current assets as a result of the deconsolidation of at t latin america in the second quarter of at t consumer services at t consumer services provides a variety of communication services to residential customers

in addition  stand alone long distance voice services have been negatively impacted by the continued migration of customers to lower priced optional calling plans and other products offered by at t  such as bundled services 
partially offsetting the declines in stand alone long distance voice services were pricing actions taken  including a monthly fee that we began billing in to recover costs  including certain access charges and property taxes 
partially offsetting the overall decline was an increase in bundled revenue  which increased billion and billion in and  respectively  reflecting an increase in subscribers primarily due to penetration in existing markets  as well as the entry into new markets

total long distance calling volumes including long distance volumes sold as part of a bundle declined approximately and in and  respectively  as a result of competition and wireless and internet substitution 
the volume decline was partially offset by an increase in prepaid card usage 
in  approximately of at t consumer services total revenue and more than of prepaid card revenue was related to a contract with wal mart  inc  which was renewed at the end of if this contract is not further renewed at the next renewal date  january  subject to early termination if certain events occur  at t consumer services revenue would be adversely affected if we are unsuccessful in selling the cards through a different channel 
we expect at t consumer services revenue to decline in due to the ongoing negative impacts of competition including the continued penetration of regional bell operating companies into the long distance market  substitution and customer migration to lower priced calling plans and products

conversely  bundled services  which has a negative margin due to initial costs incurred to enter new markets  has grown as a percentage of our total business 
the combination of these factors has resulted in total lower margins 
the margin was also negatively impacted by an asset impairment charge related to certain digital subscriber line assets

operating loss in  operating loss was billion  compared with billion in this increase was primarily due to higher compensation and benefit costs reflecting higher postretirement and pension expense driven in part by a lower expected rate of return on plan assets  the effects of lower actual plan assets and a lower discount rate 
these increases were partially offset by transaction costs associated with at t s restructuring recorded in and an asset impairment charge recorded in operating loss improved billion to a deficit of billion in compared with the improvement was largely due to lower business restructuring charges  as well as lower transaction costs associated with at t s restructuring announced in october of  totaling billion 
these operating loss improvements were partially offset by lower pension credit income of billion primarily driven by a lower long term expected rate of return on plan assets and the effects of lower actual plan assets

in addition  other assets declined due to a reduction of the intangible pension asset at t corp

these declines in other assets were partially offset by increased mark to market adjustments on foreign currency swaps  net of cash received

these reductions in debt were partially offset by billion of mark to market adjustments 
also contributing to the decline in total liabilities was lower short term and long term compensation and benefit related liabilities of billion due to a revaluation of the minimum pension liability  as well as lower restructuring and bonus accruals 
partially offsetting these decreases in total liabilities was an increase in deferred taxes of billion  primarily as a result of greater tax deductions related to property  plant and equipment

additionally  the credit facility contains a financial covenant that requires at t to meet a debt to ebitda ratio as defined in the credit agreement not exceeding to and an ebitda to net interest expense ratio as defined in the credit agreement of at least to for four consecutive quarters ending on the last day of each fiscal quarter 
at december   we were in compliance with these covenants 
pursuant to the definitions in the facility  business restructuring and asset impairment charges have no impact on the ebitda financial covenants in the credit facility 
in july  we renewed our at t consumer services day customer accounts receivable securitization facility and entered into a new at t business services day customer accounts receivable securitization facility 
at december   together the programs provided billion of available financing  limited by the eligible receivables balance  which varies from month to month 
in early march  at t reduced the combined facility size to billion  limited by the eligible receivables balance 
proceeds from the securitizations are recorded as borrowings and included in short term debt 
at december   approximately billion was outstanding 
the facilities require at t to meet a debt to ebitda ratio as defined in the agreements not exceeding to  which we were in compliance with at december  the new facilities do not include a provision contained in the previous facilities that required the outstanding balances to be paid by the collection of the receivables in the event at t s ratings were downgraded below investment grade 
at t corp 
and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued we anticipate continuing to fund our operations in primarily with cash and cash equivalents on hand  as well as cash from operations 
if economic conditions worsen or do not improve and or competition and product substitution accelerate beyond current expectations  our cash flows from operations would decrease  negatively impacting our liquidity 
however  we believe our access to the capital markets is adequate to provide the flexibility we desire in funding our operations 
sources of liquidity include the commercial paper market  billion remaining under a universal shelf registration  a billion securitization program limited by eligible receivables and a billion credit facility 
the maximum amount of commercial paper outstanding during was approximately billion 
we cannot provide any assurances that any or all of these sources of funding will be available at the time they are needed or in the amounts required 
credit ratings and related debt implications during  at t s long term credit ratings were lowered by both standard poor s s p and fitch 
as of december   our credit ratings were as follows credit rating agency short term rating long term rating outlook standard poor s a bbb stable fitch f bbb negative moody s p baa negative subsequent to  s p and fitch lowered the short term credit and commercial paper rating to a and f  respectively  fitch lowered at t s long term credit rating to bbb  and s p changed the outlook to negative 
currently  none of at t s ratings are under review or on creditwatch for further downgrade 
our access to capital markets as well as the cost of our borrowings are affected by our debt ratings 
the rating action by s p in july  triggered a basis point interest rate step up on approximately billion in notional amount of debt billion of which matured in november 
this step up was effective for interest payment periods that began after november  resulting in an expected increase in interest expense of approximately million in further debt rating downgrades could require at t to pay higher rates on certain existing debt and post cash collateral for certain interest rate and equity swaps if we are in a net payable position 
if at t s debt ratings are further downgraded  at t s access to the capital markets may be restricted and or such replacement financing may be more costly or have additional covenants than we had in connection with our debt at december  in addition  the market environment for financing in general  and within the telecommunications sector in particular  has been adversely affected by economic conditions and bankruptcies of other telecommunications providers 
if the financial markets become more cautious regarding the industry ratings category we operate in  our ability to obtain financing would be further reduced and the cost of any new financings may be higher 
the holders of certain private debt with an outstanding balance of billion at december   have an annual put right to cause at t to repay the debt upon payment of an exercise fee 
in exchange for the debt holders agreeing not to exercise their put right  in  at t renewed a cash collateralized letter of credit totaling billion now expiring in march the holders could accelerate repayment of the debt based on certain events such as the occurrence of unfavorable local law or regulation changes in its country of operation 
at t also has the right to call this debt at anytime 
at t corp 
is generally the obligor for debt issuances 
however  we have some instances where at t corp 
is not the obligor  for example  the securitization facilities and certain capital leases 
the total debt of these entities  which are fully consolidated  is approximately billion at december   and is included within short term and long term debt 
at t corp 
and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued cash requirements our cash needs for will be primarily related to capital expenditures  repayment of debt and payment of dividends 
we expect our capital expenditures for to be approximately billion 
effective with the third quarter dividend paid in november  at t s quarterly dividend was increased to per share  an increase of per share 
in february  we offered to repurchase  for cash  any and all of our billion outstanding notes maturing in november  which now carry an interest rate of 
the offer to early redeem these securities expired on march   with billion of notes redeemed  which will result in a loss of approximately million in the first quarter of in connection with the debt redemption  we unwound million notional amount of fixed to floating interest rate swaps 
also  at t offered to repurchase for cash up to e billion of its outstanding e billion notes due november  which now carry an interest rate of 
this repurchase is expected to close by the end of march these redemptions are part of at t s plan  as announced in january  to repurchase up to billion of debt  which may take the form of calls  tender offers or open market transactions and will be completed subject to market conditions throughout at t anticipates contributing approximately billion to the us postretirement benefit plans in we expect to contribute approximately million to our us nonqualified pension plan in no contribution is expected for our us qualified pension plans in contractual cash obligations the following summarizes at t s contractual cash obligations and commercial commitments at december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on liquidity and cash flows in future periods 
included in the table below are purchase obligations under which we have legal obligations for payments in specific years 
the minimum commitment for certain obligations is based on termination penalties that could be paid to exit the contract 
since termination penalties would not be paid in every year  such penalties are excluded from the table 
see note to the table 
other long term liabilities were included in the table based on the year of required payment or an estimate of the year of payment 
such estimate of payment is based on a review of past trends for these items  as well as a forecast of future activities 
certain items  were excluded from the table below as the year of payment is unknown and could not be reliably estimated since past trends were not deemed an indicator of future payment 
see note to the table 
payments due by period less than after total year years years years contractual obligations dollars in millions long term debt  including current maturities    capital lease obligations operating leases  unconditional purchase obligations  other long term obligations reflected in the balance sheet at december   total contractual cash obligations     in february  we offered to repurchase  for cash  any and all of our billion outstanding notes maturing in november the offer to early redeem these securities expired on march   with billion of notes redeemed 
these notes are included in the above table based on their original maturity date of additionally  the impact of discounts and derivative instruments are excluded from long term debt in the above table 
at t corp 
and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued under certain real estate operating leases  we could be required to make payments to the lessors of up to million at the end of the lease term in such amounts are excluded from the above table 
at t has contractual obligations to utilize network facilities from local exchange carriers with terms greater than one year 
since the contracts have no minimum volume requirements  and are based on an interrelationship of volumes and discounted rates  we assessed our minimum commitment based on penalties to exit the contracts  assuming we exited the contracts on december  at december   the penalties at t would have incurred to exit all of these contracts would have been billion 
such termination penalties decline throughout the lives of the contracts  and could be billion in  billion in  billion in  billion in or billion in  assuming all contracts are exited 
these termination fees are excluded from the above table as the fees would not be paid in every year and the timing of such payments  if any  is uncertain 
we calculated the minimum obligation for certain agreements to purchase goods or services based on termination fees that can be paid to exit the contract 
if we elect to exit these contracts  termination fees for all such contracts in the year of termination could be approximately million in  million in aggregate for and  million in aggregate for and  or million  in the aggregate  thereafter 
these termination fees are excluded from the above table as the fees would not be paid in every year and the timing of such payments  if any  is uncertain 
other long term liabilities of billion and deferred income taxes of billion have been excluded from the above table due to the uncertainty of the timing of payments  combined with the absence of historical trending to be used as a predictor for such payments 
also  long term liabilities totaling billion have been excluded from the above table as settlement of such liabilities will not require the use of cash 
certain long term benefit related liabilities  including pensions  postretirement health and welfare benefits and postemployment benefit obligations are appropriately recorded on the balance sheet at present value 
the accrued liability  which is impacted by various actuarial assumptions  will differ from the sum of future value of estimated payments 
estimated payments are billion in  billion in and billion  thereafter  and differs from the obligation recognized on the balance sheet by billion 
although we provide various employee benefit plans  programs and arrangements to our employees  we reserve the right to amend  modify or terminate these plans  programs or arrangements at any time  subject to the terms and conditions of such plans  programs or arrangements and applicable law 
accordingly  these amounts have been excluded from the above table  as we are not legally obligated for such cash outflows 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
other commercial commitments in certain circumstances we guarantee the debt of our subsidiaries  and  in connection with the separation of certain subsidiaries  these guarantees remained outstanding  and we issued guarantees for certain debt and other obligations 
these guarantees relate to our former subsidiaries at t wireless  at t broadband and ncr 
we currently hold no collateral for such guarantees  and have not recorded corresponding obligations 
we have been provided with cross guarantees or indemnifications by third parties for certain of these guarantees 
in the event that the financial condition of the parties to the various agreements deteriorates to the point at which they declare bankruptcy  other third parties to the agreements could look to us for payment 
at t provides a guarantee of an obligation that at t wireless has to ntt docomo 
in connection with an investment ntt docomo made in at t wireless  at t and at t wireless agreed that  under certain circumstances  including if at t wireless fails to meet specific technological milestones by june   ntt docomo would have the right to require at t wireless to repurchase its at t wireless common stock for billion plus interest 
on december   at t wireless and ntt docomo entered into an amendment to the original agreement  which  among other things  extended the deadline for compliance with the technological milestones to december  at t s guarantee expires on june   in accordance with the terms of the original agreement 
in the event at t wireless is unable to satisfy its entire obligation  at t is secondarily liable for up to billion  plus interest  or approximately billion 
prior to the spin off of at t broadband  we had guaranteed various obligations of at t broadband  including operating leases for real estate  surety bonds  and equity hedges  which we continue to provide 
comcast has provided indemnifications for the full amount of these guarantees 
such commitments total at t corp 
and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued million and are expected to expire as follows million in  million in  and million in the total amount of guaranteed debt at december  was million 
such debt guarantees relate to ncr  with the substantial portion of the debt maturing subsequent to off balance sheet arrangements in addition to the purchase obligations and guarantees discussed above  see note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of letters of credit 
risk management we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest and foreign exchange rates  as well as changes in equity prices associated with previously affiliated companies 
in addition  we were exposed to market risk from fluctuations in the prices of securities  some of which we had monetized through the issuance of debt in prior years 
on a limited basis  we use certain derivative financial instruments  including interest rate swaps  foreign exchange contracts  combined interest rate foreign currency contracts  options  forwards  equity hedges and other derivative contracts  to manage these risks 
we do not use financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
all financial instruments are used in accordance with board approved policies 
we enter into foreign currency contracts to minimize our exposure to risk of adverse changes in currency exchange rates 
we are subject to foreign exchange risk for foreign currency denominated transactions  such as debt issued  recognized payables and receivables and forecasted transactions 
at december   our foreign currency exposures were principally euros  british pound sterling  danish krone and swiss francs 
the fair value of foreign exchange contracts is subject to the changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
for the purpose of assessing specific risks  we use a sensitivity analysis to determine the effects that market risk exposures may have on the fair value of our financial instruments and results of operations 
to perform the sensitivity analysis  we assess the risk of loss in fair values from the effect of a hypothetical adverse change in the value of foreign currencies positive change in the value of us dollar  assuming no change in interest rates 
for foreign exchange contracts outstanding at december  and  assuming a hypothetical appreciation of the us dollar against foreign currencies from the prevailing foreign currency exchange rates  the fair value of the foreign exchange contracts net asset would have decreased million and million  respectively 
because our foreign exchange contracts are entered into for hedging purposes  we believe that these losses would be largely offset by gains on the underlying transactions 
we have also entered into combined interest rate foreign currency contracts to hedge foreign currency denominated debt 
at december  and  assuming a hypothetical appreciation in the us dollar against foreign currencies from the prevailing foreign currency exchange rates  the fair value of the combined interest rate foreign currency contracts net asset would have decreased billion and billion  respectively 
because our foreign exchange contracts are entered into for hedging purposes  we believe that these losses would be largely offset by gains on the underlying foreign currency denominated debt 
the model to determine sensitivity assumes a parallel shift in all foreign currency exchange rates  although exchange rates rarely move in the same direction 
additionally  the amounts above do not necessarily represent the actual changes in fair value we would incur under normal market conditions because all variables  other than the exchange rates  are held constant in the calculations 
we use interest rate swaps to manage the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows 
we perform a sensitivity analysis on our interest rate swaps to assess the risk of changes in fair value 
the model to determine sensitivity assumes a hypothetical parallel shift in all interest rates 
at december  and  assuming a hypothetical decrease in interest rates  the fair value of interest rate swaps net liability would have decreased by million and million  respectively 
at t corp 
and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued as discussed above  we have also entered into combined interest rate foreign currency contracts to hedge foreign currency denominated debt 
assuming a hypothetical decrease in interest rates  the fair value of the contracts net asset would have decreased by million at december  assuming a hypothetical increase in interest rates  the fair value of the contracts net asset would have decreased by million at december  the fair value of our fixed rate long term debt is sensitive to changes in interest rates 
interest rate changes would result in gains or losses in the market value of the debt due to differences between the market interest rates and rates at the inception of the obligation 
assuming a downward shift in interest rates at december  and  the fair value of unhedged debt would have increased by billion and billion  respectively 
at december   we had certain notes  with embedded derivatives  which were indexed to the market price of equity securities we owned 
changes in the market prices of these securities resulted in changes in the fair value of the derivatives 
assuming a hypothetical increase in the market price of these equity securities asset  the fair value of the collars would have decreased million at december  because these collars hedged the underlying equity securities monetized  we believed that the decrease in the fair value of the collars would have been largely offset by increases in the fair value of the underlying equity securities 
the changes in fair values referenced above do not represent the actual changes in fair value we would incur under normal market conditions because all variables other than the equity prices were held constant in the calculations 
we use equity hedges to manage our exposure to changes in equity prices associated with various equity awards of previously affiliated companies 
assuming a hypothetical decrease in equity prices of these companies  the fair value of the equity hedges net liability would have increased by million at december  and million at december  because these contracts are entered into for hedging purposes  we believe that the increase in fair value would be largely offset by decreases in the underlying liabilities 
the risk of loss in fair values of all other financial instruments resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in market prices was not significant as of december  and in order to determine the changes in fair value of our various financial instruments  including options  equity collars and other equity awards  we use certain financial modeling techniques 
we apply rate sensitivity changes directly to our interest rate swap transactions and forward rate sensitivity to our foreign currency forward contracts 
the changes in fair value  as discussed above  assume the occurrence of certain market conditions  which could have an adverse financial impact on at t 
they do not consider the potential effect of changes in market factors that would result in favorable impacts to us  and do not represent projected losses in fair value that we expect to incur 
future impacts would be based on actual developments in global financial markets 
we do not foresee any significant changes in the strategies used to manage interest rate risk  foreign currency rate risk or equity price risk in the near future 
subsequent events in february  we offered to repurchase  for cash  any and all of our billion outstanding notes maturing in november  which now carry an interest rate of 
the offer to early redeem these securities expired on march   with billion of notes redeemed  which will result in a loss of approximately million in the first quarter of in connection with the debt redemption  we unwound million notional amount of fixed to floating interest rate swaps 
also  at t offered to repurchase for at t corp 
and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued cash up to e billion of its outstanding e billion notes due november  which now carry an interest rate of 
this repurchase is expected to close by the end of march in march  a us court of appeals vacated a number of recent fcc rulings made in connection with the triennial review  including the fcc s delegation to state commissions of decisions over impairment as applied to mass market switching and certain transport elements 
if this decision is not reversed  or unless the fcc issues new valid rules  which assure us of fair resale prices  our current local business could be materially affected
