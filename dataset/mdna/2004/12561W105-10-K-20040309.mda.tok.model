the following table sets forth the amounts of power generated by cleco power for the years indicated 
period thousand mwh percent of total energy requirements fuel and purchased power changes in fuel and purchased power expenses reflect fluctuations in fuel used for electric generation  fuel handling costs  availability of economical power for purchase  and deferral of expenses for recovery from customers in subsequent months through cleco power s fuel adjustment clause 
the following table sets forth the percentages of power generated from various fuels at cleco power s electric generating plants  the cost of fuel used per kwh attributable to each such fuel  and the weighted average fuel cost per kwh 
lignite coal gas fuel oil year cost per kwh cents percent of generation cost per kwh cents percent of generation cost per kwh cents percent of generation cost per kwh cents percent of generation weighted average cost per kwh cents less than of one percent power purchases when transmission capacity is available  cleco power purchases power from energy marketing companies  whose power is typically produced by exempt wholesale generators  or neighboring utilities when the price is more economical than self generation of power or when cleco power needs power to supplement its own electric generation 
these purchases are made from the wholesale power market in the form of generation capacity and or energy 
portions of cleco power s capacity and power purchases are made at fixed prices  and the remainder is made at prevailing market prices based upon time of purchase 
cleco power has three power contracts with two marketing companies  williams energy and dynegy for a total of mw of capacity in and  increasing to mw of capacity in  and decreasing to mw of capacity in cleco power obtains approximately of its annual capacity from these contracts with williams energy and dynegy 
these contracts were approved by the lpsc in march cleco power also has a long term contract under which it purchases mw of power from the sabine river authority  which operates a hydroelectric generating plant 
in addition  cleco power has wholesale power contracts with the city of ruston mw expiring may and the city of natchitoches mw expiring december 
management expects to meet its native load demand through with cleco power s own generation capacity and the contracts with williams energy and dynegy  but with a significant portion of the contracts expiring on december   cleco power currently is evaluating its short term and long term capacity and energy needs 
cleco power initiated a solicitation during the second quarter of to identify existing or new generation resources for and subsequent years  including new power purchase contracts  to replace the williams energy contracts and the dynegy contract 
there were no winning proposals selected from the rfp  however  on january   cleco power agreed to terms for a one year contract to purchase mw of capacity from ces starting in january such one year contracts are not subject to the lpsc s rfp general order requirements  but do remain subject to certification approval by the lpsc 
cleco power anticipates that this contract will be executed by late march and the mw of capacity from ces is expected to fill the shortfall left by the williams energy and dynegy contracts expiring at the end of  however  cleco power continues to evaluate meeting capacity requirements in future periods 
given transmission constraints in the area  this short term power contract with ces minimizes risks associated with transmission constraints 
during the third quarter of  cleco power created an irp team to evaluate generation supply options 
irp is a process to evaluate resources in order to provide a reliable and flexible service to electric customers at the lowest system cost 
a full range of options are being analyzed including power purchases  fuel conversion  repowering projects  asset acquisitions  cogeneration  renewables  energy conservation  plant retirements  and mothballing of existing assets 
the process takes into account necessary features for system operation  such as fuel diversity  reliability  ease of dispatch  environmental impact  and other factors of risk 
the irp process also treats demand and supply resources on a consistent basis while taking into account such variables as fuel pricing  fuel deliverability  load growth  environmental impacts  capital expenditures  and operation and maintenance costs 
the irp team presently is developing a framework for evaluating proposed actions to optimize reliable and least cost electric service for cleco s customers needs and to reduce and stabilize their fuel cost without sacrificing reliability 
cleco power s transmission personnel are also evaluating additional transmission capacity alternatives as part of the irp process 
any viable generation alternative must then be validated through a lpsc sanctioned solicitation process where cleco power would issue a rfp 
as part of the irp effort  cleco power plans to issue a new rfp in mid to identify existing or additional generation resources 
for additional information on the irp process and on cleco power s planned rfp  see part ii  item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations cleco power significant factors affecting cleco power fuel and purchased power are primarily affected by the following factors 
the following table sets forth the amounts of power purchased by cleco power on the wholesale market for the years indicated 
period thousand mwh percent of total energy requirements during  of cleco power s energy requirements were met with purchased power  up from in the primary factor causing the increase in power purchases in as compared to was the lower price of purchased power compared to the incremental cost of cleco power s generation of power 
for information on cleco power s ability to pass on to its customers substantially all of its fuel and purchased power expenses  see regulatory matters  industry developments  and franchises rates 
in february  the lpsc approved the transfer of the existing cps assets out of cleco power s lpsc regulated rate base into evangeline  an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of cleco corporation 
the actual transfer occurred in november in return for the approval of the asset transfer  cleco power agreed to extend the terms of its rate settlement with the lpsc for an additional three years to september  see part ii  item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations financial condition retail rates of cleco power for more information about the lpsc settlement 
this agreement also contains specific provisions designed to hold cleco power s customers harmless from negative impacts that might result from the removal of the cps generating assets from its rate base 
in return  cleco power completed the transfer of cps generating and transmission assets to evangeline at their net book value of approximately million 
this resulted in a mw reduction in cleco power s generating capability 
because of its location on the transmission grid  cleco power relies on one main supplier of electric transmission  and constraints sometimes limit the amount of purchased power it can import into its system 
the power contracts described above may be affected by these transmission constraints 
natural gas supply during  cleco power purchased a total of  mmbtu of natural gas for the generation of electricity 
the annual and average per day quantities of gas purchased by cleco power from each supplier are shown in the table below 
natural gas supplier purchases mmbtu average amount purchased per day mmbtu percent of total gas used american electric power cinergy bp amoco occidental energy marketing murphy oil usa others total in june  cle intrastate transferred its natural gas interconnections at rodemacher and teche power stations with trunkline gas company  louisiana intrastate pipeline company  and anr pipeline company to cleco power 
the pipeline interconnections allow cleco power to access various additional natural gas supply markets  which helps to maintain a more economical fuel supply for cleco power s customers 
natural gas was available without interruption throughout  except during hurricane related curtailments 
cleco power expects to continue to meet its natural gas requirements with purchases on the spot market through daily  monthly  and seasonal contracts with various natural gas suppliers 
however  future supplies to cleco power remain vulnerable to disruptions due to weather events and transportation delays 
cleco power has access to multiple sources of natural gas at each plant and therefore access to diverse supplies 
nevertheless  large industrial users of natural gas  including electric utilities  generally have low priority among gas users in the event pipeline suppliers are forced to curtail deliveries due to inadequate supplies 
as a result  supplies of natural gas may become unavailable from time to time  or prices may increase rapidly in response to temporary supply interruptions 
such events  though rare  may require cleco power to shift its gas fired generation to alternative fuel sources  such as fuel oil  to the extent it has the capability to burn alternative fuels 
currently  cleco power anticipates that its diverse supply options and alternative fuel capability  combined with its solid fuel generation resources  are adequate to meet its fuel needs during any temporary interruption of natural gas supplies 
coal and lignite supply cleco power uses coal for generation at rodemacher unit the majority of the coal for rodemacher unit is purchased from mines in wyoming 
a contract  which includes fixed pricing through december   was negotiated in with kennecott energy company kennecott 
after purchasing a given annual quantity of base coal approximately  tons  cleco power has the right to purchase additional coal from kennecott or from third parties in the spot market through competitive bidding 
cleco power elected to purchase additional coal under these terms of the kennecott agreement  providing it with a total of  tons in this agreement provides the platform to govern future agreements with kennecott 
renegotiations  which began in january  are expected to be completed by july if renegotiation is not successful  cleco power expects to purchase coal from other suppliers 
the coal is transported to the rodemacher unit site under a long term rail transportation contract in trains that are under various long term leases to cleco power 
this long term rail transportation contract expires on december  cleco power uses lignite for generation at dolet hills unit substantially all of the lignite used to fuel dolet hills unit is obtained under two long term agreements 
cleco power and swepco  each a owner of dolet hills unit  have entered into agreements pursuant to which each acquired an undivided interest in the other s leased and owned lignite reserves in northwestern louisiana 
in may  cleco power and swepco entered into a long term agreement with annual renewals through with dolet hills lignite company  llc for the mining and delivery of such lignite reserves 
these reserves are expected to provide a substantial portion of the fuel requirements throughout the life of the contract with dolet hills lignite company  llc 
the may agreement replaced a previous lignite mining agreement that was terminated under a settlement agreement in connection with certain litigation relating to the previous lignite mining agreement 
additionally  cleco power and swepco have entered into a long term agreement which expires in with red river mining company to purchase lignite 
cleco power s minimum annual purchase requirement of lignite under this agreement is  tons 
the lignite price under the contract is a base price per mmbtu  subject to escalation  plus certain pass through costs 
dolet hills lignite company provides all of the lignite in excess of the  tons base commitment 
the continuous supply of coal and lignite from the mining sources described above may be subject to interruption due to adverse weather conditions or other factors that may disrupt mining operations or transportation 
at december   cleco power s coal inventory at rodemacher unit was approximately  tons about an day supply  and cleco power s lignite inventory at dolet hills unit was approximately  tons about a day supply 
oil supply cleco power stores fuel oil as an alternative fuel source at rodemacher and teche power stations 
the rodemacher power station has storage capacity for an approximate day supply and the teche power station has storage capacity for an approximate day supply 
however  in accordance with cleco power s current fuel oil inventory practices  cleco power had approximately a day total supply of fuel oil stored at these generating stations at december  during  approximately million gallons of fuel oil was burned producing  mwh of energy 
sales cleco power is a public utility engaged principally in the generation  transmission  distribution  and sale of electricity within louisiana
