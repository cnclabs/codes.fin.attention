overview innovative solutions and support was founded in the company designs  develops  manufactures and markets flight information computers  large flat panel displays and advanced monitoring systems that measure and display critical flight information  including data relative to aircraft separation rvsm  airspeed and altitude as well as engine and fuel data measurements 
our sales are derived from the sale of our products to the retrofit market and  to a lesser extent  original equipment manufacturers oems 
our customers include the dod and their commercial contractors  aircraft operators  aircraft modification centers and various oems 
although we occasionally sell our products directly to the dod  we primarily have sold our products to commercial customers for end use in dod programs 
sales to defense contractors are on commercial terms  although some of the termination and other provisions of government contracts are applicable to these contracts 

back to contents our cost of sales are comprised of material components purchased through our supplier base and direct in house assembly labor and overhead costs 
many of the components we use in assembling our products are standard  although certain parts are manufactured to meet our specifications 
the overhead portion of cost of sales is primarily comprised of salaries and benefits  building occupancy  supplies  and outside service costs related to our production  purchasing  material control and quality departments as well as warranty costs 
we intend to continue investing in the development of new products that complement our current product offerings and will expense associated research and development costs as they are incurred 
our selling  general and administrative expenses consist of sales  marketing  business development  professional services and salaries and benefits for executive and administrative personnel as well as facility costs  recruiting  legal  accounting and other general corporate expenses 
results of operations fiscal year ended september  compared to fiscal year ended september  net sales 
net sales increased million or to million for the fiscal year ended september  from million in the fiscal year ended september  the rise in net sales was primarily due to increased demand for our air data display units  digital air data computers and other related air data products 
the increased demand is in response to commercial aviation and air transport customers continuing to upgrade their respective aircraft with up to date air data systems that fully meet the federal aviation administration s faa reduced vertical separation minimum rvsm mandate 
several customers  including garrett  northwest airlines  bombardier  plain avionics  raytheon  star aviation and avcon contributed to the year over year growth 
cost of sales 
cost of sales increased million or to million  or of net sales  for fiscal from million  or of net sales  for fiscal the increase in the dollar amount was essentially due to higher sales in the period 
the decline as a percent of net sales was primarily the result of cost containment efforts coupled with fixed operating costs being absorbed over higher net sales in the current period 
research and development 
research and development expenses increased million  or  to million  or of net sales in fiscal from million or of net sales in fiscal the dollar increase was principally due to increased spending on the flat panel program as the company was in final stages of submitting its technical standard order tso application to the faa 
as a result of that effort the company was awarded a tso certification for their flat panel display on july  by the faa 
on a percent to sales basis  fiscal was less than fiscal by two percentage points because of higher net sales in the current period 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million or to million  or of net sales  for fiscal from million  or of net sales  for fiscal the increase in the dollar amount was the result of higher wages  corporate governance initiatives and commissions due to higher net sales 
the decrease as a percent of net sales was the result of higher net sales in the current period 
interest income expense  net 
net interest income decreased less than million to million in fiscal as compared to net interest income of million in fiscal net interest income for fiscal was lower because of lower interest rates in the current period 
income tax 
income tax expense was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the million income tax increase was the result of a higher profit before tax and a smaller research and development tax credit in fiscal as compared to fiscal net income 
as a result of the factors described above  net income increased million or to million  or of net sales in fiscal from million  or of net sales in fiscal on a fully diluted basis  earnings per share eps increased or to during fiscal from in fiscal fiscal year ended september  compared to fiscal year ended september  net sales 
net sales in fiscal were million 
this amount was essentially unchanged from the million recorded in fiscal the sales mix  however  reflected some significant changes as evidenced in a drop off from the completed kc business from million in fiscal to only million in fiscal this million reduction was offset with replacement rvsm business from several customers  including garrett  northwest airlines and bombardier and cip revenues from the lcac and boeing programs 

back to contents cost of sales 
cost of sales remained flat at million or  of net sales  for fiscal from million  or of net sales  for fiscal research and development 
research and development expenses decreased million  or  to million  or of net sales  for fiscal from million  or of net sales  for fiscal the decline in both dollar amount and percent of sales was the result of the following in fiscal the company expensed million of certification cost that was incurred in prior periods and carried as an intangible asset supporting flat panel certification on the pilatus airplane 
the decision to change our initial launch aircraft from a pilatus pc to a boeing necessitated recognizing the change at that time 
as a result  fiscal s research and development spending was lower by million  the amount of the prior year s write down 
the balance of the million decrease was principally due to research and development expenses related to the non recurring engineering contracts that provided revenue 
as a result  these costs were recognized in cost of sales 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million or to million  or of net sales  for fiscal from million  or of net sales  for fiscal the increase was principally driven by salary and relocation expenses for new hires including our new president 
interest income expense  net 
net interest income decreased million to million in fiscal as compared to net interest income of million in fiscal net interest income for fiscal was lower because of lower interest rates in the year 
income tax 
income tax expense was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the million income tax increase was the result of a higher profit before tax and a smaller research and development tax credit in fiscal as compared to fiscal net income 
as a result of the factors described above  net income increased million or to million  or of net sales in fiscal from million  or of net sales in fiscal on a fully diluted basis  earnings per share eps increased or to during fiscal from in fiscal related party transactions the company incurred legal fees of   and  with a law firm which is a shareholder of the company for the years ended september   and  respectively 
the fees paid were comparable with the fees paid prior to the law firm s investment in the company 
the company derived net sales of   and  for the years ended september   and  respectively from an entity which is a shareholder  and purchased   and of component parts used in the manufacturing process from this related party during such years 
for the years ended september   and  respectively  we incurred service fees of   and  with a commercial graphics firm controlled by an individual who is married to a significant shareholder and the daughter of the company s chairman and chief executive officer 
liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of liquidity have been cash flows from operations  proceeds from our initial public offering ipo  and borrowings 
we require cash principally to finance inventory  payroll and accounts receivable 
our cash flow provided from operating activities was million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal the increase in year over year cash flow was primarily the result of higher net income million  improved accounts receivable million  accrued expenses million and accounts payable million partially offset with million of higher inventory 
cash flow provided by operating activities was million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal the decrease in year over year cash flow was primarily the result of prior year reductions in inventory and accounts receivable that were not repeated in fiscal our cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal as compared to million used in fiscal the year over year increase in investing activities primarily relates to purchases of manufacturing and engineering equipment 
our cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal as compared to million used in fiscal the year over year decrease in investing activities primarily relates to our new building being completed in fiscal our cash inflow from financing activities in fiscal was million as opposed to cash used in fiscal of million 
the cash inflow in fiscal relates to the exercise of stock options million and warrants million 
the outflow or use of cash in fiscal relates to the open market re purchase of our stock 
the stock re purchase was treated as treasury stock and the amount purchased in fiscal was  shares at an aggregate price of million 
in fiscal the company purchased  shares at an aggregate price of million 

back to contents we allowed our credit facility to lapse in august as a result of the strong cash balance we have from the net proceeds of our ipo 
we are in discussions with a number of financial institutions regarding the establishment of a new credit facility 
to accommodate our future growth  we purchased and acres of land in the eagleview corporate park  exton  pennsylvania 
there we constructed a  square foot facility  completed in october  that is expandable to  square feet 
both the land and building cost approximate million 
of this amount  million was funded through an industrial development bond idb and the remainder from cash from operations 
our future capital requirements depend on numerous factors  including market acceptance of our products  the timing and rate of expansion of our business  acquisitions  joint ventures and other factors 
we have experienced increases in our expenditures since our inception consistent with growth in our operations  personnel  and product line and we anticipate that our operations and expenditures will continue to increase in the foreseeable future 
we believe that our cash and cash equivalents  together with net proceeds from any new credit facility we may enter into  will provide sufficient capital to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months 
however  we may need to raise additional funds through public or private financing or other arrangements in order to support more rapid expansion of our business than we currently anticipate 
further  we may develop and introduce new or enhanced products  respond to competitive pressures  invest in or acquire businesses or technologies or respond to unanticipated requirements or developments 
payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years after years interest on loan from chester county industrial dev

 principal on chester county industrial loan   operating leases   capital leases     purchase obligations   the interest on the industrial development bond assumes the current rate of 
the interest rate set by the remarketing agent is consistent with day tax exempt commercial paper 
a purchase obligation is defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding on the company and that specifies all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
these amounts are primarily comprised of open purchase order commitments to vendors and subcontractors pertaining to fulfillment of our current order backlog 
off balance sheet arrangements the company does not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our financial position or results of operations during the past three years 
however  we cannot predict the future effects of inflation 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the company s most critical accounting policies are revenue recognition  income taxes  allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory valuation and warranty reserves 

back to contents the company recognizes sales for products when the following revenue recognition criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  product delivery and acceptance has occurred  pricing is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
the company recognizes sales upon shipment of products to customers 
sales related to certain long term contracts requiring development and delivery of products over several years are accounted for under the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
we consider the nature of these contracts as well as the types of products and services provided when determining the appropriate accounting treatment for a particular contract 
certain long term contracts are recorded on a percentage of completion basis using cost to cost methodology to measure progress towards completion 
the company offers its customers extended warranties for additional fees 
these warranty sales are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as sales on a straight line basis over the warranty period 
the company enters into certain sales arrangements that include multiple deliverables as defined in emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
effective july   the company identifies all goods and or services that are to be delivered separately under a sales arrangement and allocates revenue to each deliverable based on fair value that is established with the customer during contract negotiations 
in general  revenues are separated between product sales and non recurring engineering services 
the allocated revenue for each deliverable is then recognized using appropriate revenue recognition methods 
effective for transactions entered into after october   the company accounts for transactions with software and non software components under eitf issue  applicability of aicpa statement of position  software revenue recognition  to non software deliverables in an arrangement containing more than incidental software 
income taxes are recorded in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
provisions for federal and state income taxes are calculated on reported financial statement pre tax income based on current tax law 
the company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of the company s assets and liabilities and expected benefits of utilizing net operating loss carryforwards 
the impact on deferred taxes of changes in tax rates and laws  if any  applied to the years during which temporary differences are expected to be settled  are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the period of enactment 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
these allowances are determined by analyzing historical data and trends 
if actual losses are greater than estimated amounts or if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  future results from operations could be adversely affected 
inventories are written down for estimated obsolescence equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated net realizable value based upon assumptions about future market conditions 
if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
we offer warranties on some products of various lengths 
at the time of shipment  we establish a reserve for the estimated cost of warranties based on our best estimate of the amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims using historical data on products sold as of the balance sheet date 
the length of the warranty period  the product s failure rates and the customer s usage affects warranty cost 
if the actual cost of warranties differs from our estimated amounts  future results of operations could be adversely affected 
new accounting pronouncements in january  the fasb issued fin  consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of arb no 
fin addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities 
the fasb then issued fin r  consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of arb no 
 which replaced fin application of fin r is required in financial statements of public entities that have interests in variable interest entities or potential variable interest entities commonly referred to as special purpose entities for periods ending after december  application by public entities for all other types of entities is required in financial statements for periods ending after march  the company has adopted both fin and fin r  and their adoption had no impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 

back to contents in may  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
this statement establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
it requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability or an asset in some circumstances 
this statement is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  the company adopted the provisions of sfas  including the deferral of certain effective dates as a result of the provisions of fasb staff position  effective date  disclosures  and transition for mandatorily redeemable financial instruments of certain nonpublic entities and certain mandatorily redeemable noncontrolling interests under fasb statement no

the company adopted this statement and it did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial position or results of operations 
business segments the company operates in one principal business segment which designs  manufactures and sells flight information computers  large flat panel displays and advanced monitoring systems to the dod  government agencies  defense contractors  commercial air transport carriers and corporate general aviation markets 
the company currently derives virtually all of its revenues from the sale of this equipment 
almost all of the company s sales  operating results and identifiable assets are in the united states 
risk factors risks related to our business most of our sales are of air data systems products  and we cannot be certain that the market will continue to accept these or our other products 
during fiscal and  we derived and  respectively  of our revenues from the sale of air data systems and related products 
we expect that revenues from our air data products will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues in the future 
accordingly  our revenues will decrease if such products do not continue to receive market acceptance or if our existing customers do not continue to incorporate our products in their retrofitting or manufacturing of aircraft 
in seeking new customers  it may be difficult for our products to displace competing air data products 
accordingly  we cannot assure you that potential customers will accept our products or that existing customers will not abandon them 
a portion of our sales has been  and we expect will continue to be  to defense contractors or government agencies in connection with government aircraft retrofit or original manufacturing contracts 
sales to government contractors and government agencies accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of our revenues during fiscal  and accordingly  our revenues in this area could decline further as a result of dod spending cuts and general budgetary constraints 
in addition  our revenues are concentrated with a limited number of customers 
we derived of our revenues during fiscal year from five customers  bombardier  northwest airlines  star aviation  plain avionics and raytheon and of our revenues during fiscal year from five customers  bombardier  dhl  garrett  northwest airlines and the dod 
we expect a relatively small number of customers to account for a majority of our revenues for the foreseeable future 
as a result of our concentrated customer base  a loss of one or more of these customers could adversely affect our revenues and results of operations 
the growth of our customer base could be limited by delays or difficulties in completing the development and introduction of our planned products or product enhancements 
if we fail to enhance existing products or to develop and achieve market acceptance for flat panel displays and other new products that meet customer requirements  our business may not grow 

back to contents although a substantial majority of our revenues has come from sales of air data systems and related products  we expect to spend a large portion of our research and development efforts in developing and marketing our large flat panel display systems cip and complementary products 
our ability to grow and diversify our operations through the introduction and sale of new products  such as large flat panel displays  is dependent upon our success in continuing product development and engineering activities as well as our sales and marketing efforts and our ability to obtain requisite approvals to sell such products 
our sales growth will also depend in part on the market acceptance of and demand for our cip and future products 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to develop  introduce or market our cip or other new products or product enhancements in a timely or cost effective manner or that any new products will receive market acceptance or necessary regulatory approval 
we rely on third party suppliers for the components of our air data systems products  and any interruption in the supply of these components could hinder our ability to deliver our products 
our manufacturing process consists primarily of assembling components purchased from our supply chain 
these suppliers may not continue to be available to us 
if we are unable to maintain relationships with key third party suppliers  the development and distribution of our products could be delayed until equivalent components can be obtained and integrated into our products 
in addition  substitution of certain components from other manufacturers may require faa or other approval  which could delay our ability to ship products 
our government retrofit projects are generally pursuant to either a direct contract with a government agency or a subcontract with the general contractor to a government agency 
each contract includes various federal regulations that impose certain requirements on us  including the ability of the government agency or general contractor to alter the price  quantity or delivery schedule of our products 
in addition  the government agency or general contractor retains the right to terminate the contract at any time at its convenience 
upon alteration or termination of these contracts  we would be entitled to an equitable adjustment to the contract price so that we may receive the purchase price for items we have delivered and reimbursement for allowable costs we have incurred 
accordingly  because these contracts can be terminated  we cannot assure you that our government retrofit backlog will result in sales 
we depend on our key personnel to manage our business effectively  and if we are unable to retain our key employees  our ability to compete could be harmed 
our success depends on the efforts  abilities and expertise of our senior management and other key personnel 
with the exception of our president  we generally do not have employment agreements with our employees 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain such employees  the loss of some of whom could hurt our ability to execute our business strategy 
we intend to continue hiring key management and sales and marketing personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense  and we may not be able to attract or retain additional qualified personnel 
we do not maintain key man life insurance for our executive officers 
our future success will depend in part on our ability to implement and improve our operational  administrative and financial systems and controls and to manage  train and expand our employee base 
we cannot assure you that our current and planned personnel levels  systems  procedures and controls will be adequate to support our future operations 
if inadequate  we may not be able to exploit existing and potential market opportunities 
any delays or difficulties we encounter could impair our ability to attract new customers or enhance our relationships with existing customers 
our revenue and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter  which may cause our stock price to decline 
our revenues and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors  including demand for our products  capital expenditure budgets of aircraft owners and operators and the appropriation cycles of the us government  changes in the use of our products  including air data systems and flat panel displays  delays in introducing or obtaining government approval for new products  new product introductions by competitors  changes in our pricing policies or the pricing policies of our competitors  and costs related to possible acquisitions of technologies or businesses 

back to contents we plan to increase our operating expenses to expand our sales and marketing operations and fund greater levels of product development 
as a result  a delay in generating revenues could cause significant variations in our operating results from quarter to quarter 
our competition includes other manufacturers of air data systems and flight information displays against whom we may not be able to compete successfully 
the markets for our products are intensely competitive and subject to rapid technological change 
our competitors include kollsman  inc  honeywell international inc  rockwell collins inc  smiths industries plc and l communications 
substantially all of our competitors have significantly greater financial  technical and human resources than we do 
in addition  our competitors have much greater experience in and resources for marketing their products 
as a result  our competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and customer preferences or devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of their products than we can 
our competitors may also have greater name recognition and more extensive customer bases that they can use to their benefit 
this competition could result in price reductions  fewer customer orders  reduced gross margins and loss of market share 
we may not be able to identify or complete acquisitions or we may consummate an acquisition that adversely affects our operating results 
one of our strategies is to acquire businesses or technologies that will complement our existing operations 
we have limited experience in acquiring businesses or technologies 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to acquire or profitably manage acquisitions or successfully integrate them into our operations 
furthermore  certain risks are inherent in our acquisition strategy  such as the diversion of management s time and attention and combining disparate company cultures and facilities 
acquisitions may have an adverse effect on our operating results  particularly in quarters immediately following the consummation of such transactions  as we integrate the operations of the acquired businesses into our operations 
once integrated  acquisitions may not perform as expected 
our success depends on our ability to protect our proprietary rights  and there is a risk of infringement 
if we are unable to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights  we may be unable to compete effectively 
our success and ability to compete will depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent or other protection for our technology and products  both in the united states and abroad 
in addition  we must operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others 
we currently hold twelve us patents and have seven us patent applications pending 
in addition  we have eight international patents and twenty four international patent applications pending 
we cannot be certain that patents will be issued on any of our present or future applications 
in addition  our existing patents or any future patents may not adequately protect our technology if they are not broad enough  are successfully challenged or other entities are able to develop competing methods without violating our patents 
if we are not successful in protecting our intellectual property  competitors could begin to offer products that incorporate our technology 
patent protection involves complex legal and factual questions and  therefore  is highly uncertain  and litigation relating to intellectual property is often very time consuming and expensive 
if a successful claim of patent infringement were made against us or we are unable to develop non infringing technology or license the infringed or similar technology on a timely and cost effective basis  we might not be able to make some of our products 
risks related to our industry if we are unable to respond to rapid technological change  our products could become obsolete and our reputation could suffer 
future generations of air data systems  engine and fuel displays and flat panel displays embodying new technologies or new industry standards could render our products obsolete 
the market for aviation products is subject to rapid technological change  new product introductions  changes in customer preferences and evolving industry standards 
our future success will depend on our ability to adapt to rapidly changing technologies  adapt our products to evolving industry standards  and develop and introduce a variety of new products and product enhancements to address the increasingly sophisticated needs of our customers 
our future success will also depend on our developing high quality  cost effective products and enhancements to our products that satisfy the needs of our customers and on our introducing these new technologies to the marketplace in a timely manner 
if we fail to modify or improve our products in response to evolving industry standards  our products could rapidly become obsolete 

back to contents our products are currently subject to direct regulation by the us federal aviation administration faa  its european counterpart  the joint aviation authorities jaa  and other comparable organizations 
our products  as they relate to aircraft applications  must be approved by the faa  jaa or other comparable organizations before they can be used in an aircraft 
to be certified  we must demonstrate that our products are accurate and able to maintain certain levels of repeatability over time 
although the certification requirements of the faa and the jaa are substantially similar  there is no formal reciprocity between the two systems 
accordingly  even though some of our products are faa approved  we may need to obtain approval from the jaa or other appropriate organizations to have them certified for installation outside the united states 
significant delay in receiving certification for newly developed products or enhancements to our products or losing certification for our existing products could result in lost sales or delays in sales 
furthermore  the adoption of additional regulations or product standards  as well as changes to the existing product standards  could require us to change our products and underlying technology 
we cannot assure you that we will receive regulatory approval on a timely basis or at all 
because our products utilize sophisticated technology and are deployed in complex aircraft cockpit environments  problems with these products may arise that could seriously harm our reputation for quality assurance and our business 
our products use complex system designs and components that may contain errors  omissions or defects  particularly when we incorporate new technologies into our products or we release new versions or enhancements of our products 
despite our quality assurance process  errors  omissions or defects could occur in our current products  in new products or in new versions or enhancements of existing products after commercial shipment has begun 
we may be required to redesign or recall those products or pay damages 
such an event could result in the following the delay or loss of revenues  the cancellation of customer contracts  the diversion of development resources  damage to our reputation  increased service and warranty costs  or litigation costs 
although we currently carry product liability insurance  this insurance may not be adequate to cover our losses in the event of a product liability claim 
moreover  we may not be able to maintain such insurance in the future 
we expect to derive an increasing amount of our revenues from sales outside the united states  particularly in europe 
we have limited experience in marketing and distributing our products internationally 
in addition  there are certain risks inherent in doing business on an international basis  such as differing regulatory requirements for products being installed in aircraft  legal uncertainty regarding liability  tariffs  trade barriers and other regulatory barriers  political and economic instability  changes in diplomatic and trade relationships  potentially adverse tax consequences  the impact of recessions in economies outside the united states  and variance and unexpected changes in local laws and regulations 

back to contents currently  all of our international sales are denominated in us dollars 
an increase in the value of the dollar compared to other currencies could make our products less competitive in foreign markets 
in the future  we may conduct sales in local currencies  exposing us to changes in exchange rates that could adversely affect our operating results 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s operations are exposed to market risks primarily as a result of changes in interest rates 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
the company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to its cash equivalents and an industrial revenue bond 
the company s cash equivalents consist of funds invested in money market accounts  which bear interest at a variable rate  while the industrial revenue bond carries an interest rate that is consistent with day tax exempt commercial paper 
as the interest rates are variable  a change in interest rates earned on the cash equivalents or paid on the industrial revenue bond  would impact interest income and expense along with cash flows  but would not impact the fair market value of the related underlying instruments
