item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations year ended december  compared to december  the following discussion is intended to provide a more comprehensive review of the company s operating results and financial condition than can be obtained from reading the consolidated financial statements alone 
the discussion should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and the notes thereto included later in this report 
all numbers  except per share data  are expressed in thousands of dollars 
management highlights the past year the company experienced strong asset growth 
the steep slope of the yield curve and a strong capital base provided an opportunity to significantly increase the investment securities portfolio 
commercial loan growth was also very positive increasing million 
the historical low interest rates for mortgage loans during most of resulted in a large volume of residential loans being refinanced which reduced the amount of residential real estate loans held by the company and also created a large volume of prepayments of the mortgage related securities held in the investment portfolio 
the refinancing activity resulted in the loss of higher rate mortgage loans which reduced interest income 
in addition the earnings on other types of loans also declined due to refinancing and new loans booked at substantially reduced rates 
securities prepayment activity resulted in a high level of premium amortization  which reduced the earnings on the existing securities  and the reinvestment of funds was generally at lower rates 
offsetting the reduced interest income was further reduction in interest expense on deposits and borrowed funds as maturing items were replaced with lower rate liabilities 
the net interest margin declined through much of the year until the fourth quarter when the margin increased 
non interest bearing deposits increased during the year providing a stable low cost funding source for a portion of the asset growth 
non interest bearing deposits also ended the year with increased totals 
asset growth that exceeded the increase in deposits was funded with federal home loan bank advances which also were at low interest rates 
with the very low mortgage loan rates the origination of residential loans was at an all time high which resulted in an increase of nearly million in gain on sale of loans 
service charges and fee income also increased nicely in the company also took the opportunity to record a net gain on the sale of securities of million during the year 
total revenue from net interest income and non interest income increased million  or  over the prior year  the cumulative effect of the above described items 
non interest expense increased million  or  from last year with the largest increase occurring in compensation and benefits expense 
additional locations and related staffing  commissions on residential loan originations  and merit increases were the primary reasons for this increase 
other operating expenses also increased reflecting the increased volume of activities in loan and deposit operations 
looking forward  our future performance will depend on many factors including economic conditions  interest rate changes  increasing competition for deposits and quality loans  and regulatory burden 
increasing interest rates slow the volume of real estate loan originations which reduces the fee income from that activity while at the same time reducing commission expense for loan originators 
increasing rates result in increased earnings on assets  however  the cost of interest bearing funds also increase 
the company goal of asset and liability management practices is to maintain or increase the level of net interest income within an acceptable level of interest rate risk 
during the earnings on the mortgage backed securities investments was reduced significantly by the premium amortization expense 
higher interest rates result in a reduction of premium amortization which adds substantially to the investment earnings and the net interest margin 
regulatory burden seems to be never ending as additional regulations continue to add cost 
the sarbanes oxley act will result in substantial increases in audit and consulting fees during  and future years  to assure compliance

the pend oreille bank acquisition by the mountain west bank subsidiary on july  contributed million of that growth 
without the acquisition assets increased million  or percent 
the majority of the increase in assets was in the investment portfolio which increased million or percent over the prior year end balances 
investments were acquired to use the funding derived from increasing deposits  and borrowing capacity  that exceeded quality loan growth opportunities 
loans  including million from the acquisition  increased million  or percent 
commercial loans increased million  or percent  during the period and continues to be the focus of our lending 
real estate loan volume was at record levels during with originations of million  up from million in most of the residential loans originated were sold in the secondary market  which coupled with the refinancing of loans existing in our portfolio  resulted in a reduction of million in real estate loans outstanding at december  compared to the december  balances 
of the million decrease  million was attributed to a reduction in loans held for sale from one year end to the next  with the remaining million reduction coming from loans held for investment 
consumer loans showed an increase of million during the year  a percent increase from last year 
the type of loans contained in the consumer loan portfolio is changing 
with extremely low  or zero  interest rates offered by automobile manufacturers the number of loans for motor vehicles made by the banks is quite small 
the balances for those loans continues to decline while home equity loans continue to increase 
during home equity loans increased approximately million  or percent  and now comprise percent of the consumer loan amount outstanding 
the following table summarizes the major asset components as a percentage of total assets as of december    and december  assets cash  and cash equivalents  investment securities  fhlb and federal reserve stock real estate loans and loans held for sale commercial loans consumer loans other assets 
table of contents the percentage of assets held as cash  and cash equivalents  investment securities  fhlb and federal reserve stock has increased from percent at december  to percent at december  most of this increase is attributed to investment securities which increased by million during several factors have influenced this increase including declining yields on the loan portfolio  increasing levels of non interest earning deposits which has provided additional low cost funding  strong capital position to support larger asset base  growth rate in loans insufficient to use available liquidity  very steep slope in the short end of the yield curve  and well structured asset liability mix with limited interest rate risk 
with the low interest rates  and resulting refinance activity  coupled with the decision to not hold fixed rate long term mortgages  residential real estate loans have declined which moved the percentage of assets from to percent 
although the balances in commercial loans have continued to increase the percentage of loans to total assets has only increased approximately percent due to the large increase in investment securities added to the asset totals 
the total consumer loans ratio also declined in due to the significant increase in total assets 
liabilities the following table summarizes the liability balances as of december  and  the amount of change  and percentage change during december  liabilities in thousands change change non interest bearing deposits interest bearing deposits advances from federal home loan bank securities sold under agreements to repurchase and other borrowed funds other liabilities subordinated debentures total liabilities non interest bearing deposits increased million  or percent  during the year with million coming from the pend oreille acquisition 
a high performance checking program was implemented during at the four banks not previously using the program  which contributed to the deposit growth 
interest bearing deposits increased million of which million was from the pend oreille acquisition 
interest rates offered by the bank subsidiaries have been mid market which has resulted in small growth in interest bearing deposits 
the company balances its funding needs between deposits and borrowings to minimize interest expense 
advances from the federal home loan bank of seattle fhlb increased million during proceeds were used to acquire investment securities with a resulting increase in net interest income  although at a lower level than the interest spread experienced on the core asset base 
the difference in interest rates between the very short maturities  days  and the two to five year maturity slope of the yield curve has provided this opportunity 
reduction in the difference in rates between maturities a flattening of the yield curve could result in curtailment of this strategy with a resulting reduction in investments and advances

the following narrative provides additional information on those results 
interest income historical low interest rates during most of the year resulted in a million reduction in interest income even though the earning assets of the company increased significantly 
with the sustained low rates throughout the year many loans of all types were refinanced with the rate on the new loans substantially lower than the prepaid loans 
new loans also were at much lower rates than the average rates earned on the existing loans 
mortgage related investment securities experienced much of the same results as the loan portfolio 
investments were prepaid which negatively impacted interest income in two ways securities that were purchased at a premium that experienced prepayments had an acceleration of the amortization of the premium which reduced the 
table of contents income  reinvestment of the proceeds was at a lower rate than previously enjoyed on the amounts invested 
the weighted average yield on earning assets tax free income adjusted for tax effects decreased from percent for the year to percent in increased balances in earning assets offset much of the rate impact 
interest expense interest expense decreased even more with total interest expense million  or percent  lower in most of the expense reduction came from deposits as rates continued to decline during the year 
in addition higher rate certificates of deposits matured which further reduced interest expense 
these rate reductions coupled with increasing balances in non interest bearing deposits resulted in the deposit expense reduction 
the balance in fhlb advances increased million during the year  however  with a combination of maturing higher cost advances and lower rates on new advances the interest expense on total advances decreased by  from the prior year 
the weighted average rate on advances decreased from percent for to for the weighted rate on total advances outstanding at december  was percent 
the prolonged low interest rates have resulted in a reduction in the net interest margin ratio of net interest income divided by average earning assets from percent in to percent in with the third quarter of being the lowest level at percent 
the ratio increased to percent in the fourth quarter of primarily due to increased earnings on investments 
with the low interest rates many real estate loans have either been refinanced which lowers the future earnings rate on the loans that are retained  or the loan is paid off which also lowers future earnings 
to remain competitive it has become necessary to reduce rates to market levels on all loan types which reduces interest income on those loans 
investment income also is lower on securities purchased during this low rate period than on securities previously held in the portfolio 
prepayment of mortgage backed securities also has occurred as underlying mortgage loans have been prepaid 
this prepayment not only reduced the level of assets with higher rates but also resulted in much faster amortization of premiums associated with the securities further reducing interest income 
to offset the reduction in interest income  rates on interest bearing deposits have been reduced and matured borrowings have been renewed at lower rates 
the increased level of non interest bearing deposits has reduced the need for additional borrowings which also has resulted in lower interest expense 
non interest income total non interest income increased million  or percent over the prior year 
million of the increase was from increased volumes in loan and deposit activity and the resulting fees 
million of the increase was contributed by net gains on sale of investment securities 
the largest portion of the increase was from a million increase in the gain on sale of loans  the majority of which was from residential real estate loans 
the low interest rates during resulted in a very large increase in the number of loans being refinanced to obtain low long term financing  and an increase in new home loans because of affordable monthly payments 
increasing rates affect the level of fee income created from the origination and sale of mortgage loans as the refinance of loans is substantially reduced or eliminated 
purchases of homes can also be affected because of reduced affordability due to higher monthly payments with higher interest rates 
the subsidiary banks are located in areas of robust population growth which somewhat mitigates the risk of significant reduction in home purchases 
reduction in refinance activity also reduces the variable expenses such as commissions for loan origination and could result in additional reductions in expense 
non interest expense summary years ended december  in thousands change change compensation and employee benefits occupancy and equipment expense outsourced data processing core deposit intangibles amortization other expenses total non interest expense non interest expense non interest expense also increased million  a percent increase  with million of the increase in the compensation and benefits classification 
the pend oreille acquisition  additional branches in the boise and bozeman markets  commissions paid to mortgage loan originators  normal increases for job performance  and some benefits that are tied to the company stock price performance account for the majority of the increase 
advertising and marketing  start up expenses for the high performance checking program  and other volume related expenses made up most of the remainder of the increased expense 

table of contents the efficiency ratio  which measures the cost per dollar of revenue generated  increased from percent in to percent in although this increased from the prior year it is still significantly less than the percent average of similar sized banking companies 
credit quality information december  december  unaudited in thousands allowance for loan losses non performing assets allowance as a percentage of non performing assets non performing assets as a percentage of total assets allowance as a percentage of total loans net charge offs as a percentage of loans provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses was million in which was a reduction of million from charged off loans  net of recoveries of loans previously charged off  were million lower in than the prior year 
the balance in the allowance for loan losses increased million from the prior year end 
at december  non performing assets non accrual loans  accruing loans days or more overdue  real estate acquired by foreclosure  and repossessed personal property totaled million  or 
percent of total assets  compared to million  or 
percent at december  the peer group average according to the federal reserve bank performance report as of september   the most recent information available  for banking companies similar to our size was 
percent of total assets 
the allowance for loan losses was percent of non performing assets  and percent of total loans as of december  which compares to percent and percent  respectively  at december  effect of inflation and changing prices generally accepted accounting principles require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars  without consideration for change in relative purchasing power over time due to inflation 
virtually all assets of a financial institution are monetary in nature  therefore  interest rates generally have a more significant impact on a company s performance than does the effect of inflation 
commitments in the normal course of business  there are various outstanding commitments to extend credit  such as letter of credit and un advanced loan commitments  which are not reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
management does not anticipate any material losses as a result of these transactions 
the company has outstanding debt maturities  the largest of which are the advances from the federal home loan bank 
see footnote for the maturity schedule of the advances 
the following table represents our contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period dollars in thousands total thereafter capital lease obligations operating lease obligations market risk market risk is the risk of loss in a financial instrument arising from adverse changes in market rates prices such as interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices  and equity prices 
the company s primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk 
the ongoing monitoring and management of this risk is an important component of the company s asset liability management process which is governed by policies established by its board of directors that are reviewed and approved annually 
the board of 
table of contents directors delegates responsibility for carrying out the asset liability management policies to the asset liability committee alco 
in this capacity alco develops guidelines and strategies impacting the company s asset liability management related activities based upon estimated market risk sensitivity  policy limits and overall market interest rate levels trends 
interest rate risk the objective of interest rate risk management is to contain the risks associated with interest rate fluctuations 
the process involves identification and management of the sensitivity of net interest income to changing interest rates 
managing interest rate risk is not an exact science 
the interval between repricing of interest rates of assets and liabilities changes from day to day as the assets and liabilities change 
for some assets and liabilities contractual maturity and the actual cash flows experienced are not the same 
a good example is residential mortgages that have long term contractual maturities but may be repaid well in advance of the maturity when current prevailing interest rates become lower than the contractual rate 
interest bearing deposits without a stated maturity could be withdrawn after seven days  however  the bank s experience indicates that these funding pools have a much longer duration and are not as sensitive to interest rate changes as other financial instruments 
prime based loans generally have rate changes when the federal reserve bank changes short term interest rates  however  depending on the magnitude of the rate change and the relationship of the current rates to rate floors and rate ceilings that may be in place on the loans  the loan rate may not change 
gap analysis the following table gives a description of our gap position for various time periods 
as of december   we had a negative gap position at six months and a positive gap position at twelve months 
the cumulative gap as a percentage of total assets for six months is a negative which compares to a negative at december  and a negative at december  the table also shows the gap earnings sensitivity  and earnings sensitivity ratio  along with a brief description as to how they are calculated 
the methodology used to compile this gap information is based on our mix of assets and liabilities and the historical experience accumulated regarding their rate sensitivity

this table estimates the repricing maturities of the company s assets and liabilities  based upon the company s assessment of the repricing characteristics of the various instruments 
interest bearing checking and regular savings are included in the more than years category 
money market balances are included in the less than months category 
mortgage backed securities are at the anticipated principal payments based on the weighted average life 
net interest income simulation the traditional one dimensional view of gap is not sufficient to show a bank s ability to withstand interest rate changes 
because of limitations in gap modeling the asset liability management committee alco of the company uses a detailed and dynamic simulation model to quantify the estimated exposure of net interest income nii to sustained interest rate changes 
while alco routinely monitors simulated nii sensitivity over a rolling two year horizon  it also utilizes additional tools to monitor potential longer term interest rate risk 
the simulation model captures the impact of changing interest rates on the interest income received and interest expense paid on all assets and liabilities reflected on the company s statement of financial condition 
this sensitivity analysis is compared to alco policy limits which specify a maximum tolerance level for nii exposure over a one year horizon  assuming no balance sheet growth  given a or basis point bp upward and downward shift in interest rates 
a parallel and pro rata shift in rates over a month period is assumed as a benchmark 
other non parallel rate movement scenarios are also modeled to determine the potential impact on net interest income 
the following reflects the company s nii sensitivity analysis as of december  and as compared to the board approved policy limit 
bp estimated sensitivity estimated decrease in net interest income bp estimated sensitivity estimated increase in net interest income the preceding sensitivity analysis does not represent a forecast and should not be relied upon as being indicative of expected operating results 
these hypothetical estimates are based upon numerous assumptions including the nature and timing of interest rate levels including yield curve shape  prepayments on loans and securities  deposit decay rates  pricing decisions on loans and deposits  reinvestment replacement of assets and liability cash flows  and others 
while assumptions are developed based upon current economic and local market conditions  the company cannot make any assurances as to the predictive nature of these assumptions including how customer preferences or competitor influences might change 
also  as market conditions vary from those assumed in the sensitivity analysis  actual results will also differ due to prepayment refinancing levels likely deviating from those assumed  the varying impact of interest rate change caps or floors on adjustable rate assets  the potential effect of changing debt service levels on customers with adjustable rate loans  depositor early withdrawals and product preference changes  and other internal external variables 
furthermore  the sensitivity analysis does not reflect actions that alco might take in responding to or anticipating changes in interest rates 
liquidity risk liquidity risk is the possibility that the company will not be able to fund present and future obligations 
the objective of liquidity management is to maintain cash flows adequate to meet current and future needs for credit demand  deposit withdrawals  maturing liabilities and corporate operating expenses 
core deposits  fhlb credit lines  available for sale investment securities  and net income are the key elements in meeting these objectives 
all seven subsidiaries are members of the fhlb 
this membership provides for established lines of credit in the form of advances that are a supplemental source of funds for lending and other general business purposes 
as of year ended december   the company had million of available fhlb line of which million was utilized 
accordingly  management of the company has a wide range of versatility in managing the liquidity and asset liability mix for each individual institution as well as the company as a whole 
during  all seven financial institutions maintained liquidity levels in excess of regulatory requirements and deemed sufficient to meet operating cash needs 
capital resources and adequacy maintaining capital strength has been a long term objective 
ample capital is necessary to sustain growth  provide protection against unanticipated declines in asset values  and to safeguard the funds of depositors 
capital also is a source of funds for loan demand and enables the company to effectively manage its assets and liabilities 
shareholders equity increased million during  or 
table of contents percent the net result of earnings of million  less cash dividend payments and a decline of million in the net unrealized gains on available for sale investment securities 
for additional information see footnote in the consolidated financial statements 
dividend payments were increased by 
per share  or percent in the payment of dividends is subject to government regulation  in that regulatory authorities may prohibit banks and bank holding companies from paying dividends which would constitute an unsafe or unsound banking practice 
critical accounting policies companies may apply certain critical accounting policies requiring management to make subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to estimate the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the company considers its only material critical accounting policy to be the allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is established through a provision for loan losses charged against earnings 
the balance of allowance for loan losses is maintained at the amount management believes will be adequate to absorb known and inherent losses in the loan portfolio 
the appropriate balance of allowance for loan losses is determined by applying estimated loss factors to the credit exposure from outstanding loans 
estimated loss factors are based on subjective measurements including management s assessment of the internal risk classifications  changes in the nature of the loan portfolio  industry concentrations and the impact of current local  regional and national economic factors on the quality of the loan portfolio 
changes in these estimates and assumptions are reasonably possible and may have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements  results of operations or liquidity 
for additional information regarding the allowance for loan losses  its relation to the provision for loans losses and risk related to asset quality  see note to the consolidated financial statements in
