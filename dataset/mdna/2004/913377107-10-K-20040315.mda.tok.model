pyramid life was acquired on march  and its operating results prior to the date of acquisition are not included in universal american s consolidated results of operations 
overview our principal business segments are career agency  senior market brokerage and administrative services 
we also report the activities of our holding company in a separate segment 
reclassifications have been made to conform prior year amounts to the current year presentation 
a description of our segments follows career agency the career agency segment is comprised of the operations of pennsylvania life  penncorp life canada  and  beginning march   pyramid life 
pennsylvania life and pyramid life operate in the united states  while penncorp life canada operates exclusively in canada 
this segment s products include medicare supplement select  other supplemental senior health insurance  fixed benefit accident and sickness disability insurance  life insurance  and annuities and are distributed by career agents who are under contract with pennsylvania life  pyramid life or penncorp life canada

the products include medicare supplement select  long term care  senior life insurance and annuities

corporate this segment reflects the activities of our holding company  including the payment of interest on our debt  certain senior executive compensation  and the expense of being a public company 
intersegment revenues and expenses are reported on a gross basis in each of the operating segments 
these intersegment revenue and expenses affect the amounts reported on the individual financial statement line items  but are eliminated in consolidation and do not change operating income before taxes 
the significant items eliminated include intersegment revenue and expense relating to services performed by the administrative services segment for the career agency and senior market brokerage segments and interest on notes issued by the corporate segment to the other operating segments 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of assets and liabilities reported by us at the date of the financial statements and the revenues and expenses reported during the reporting period 
in developing these estimates  management makes subjective and complex judgments that are inherently uncertain and subject to material change as facts and circumstances develop 
although variability is inherent in these estimates  management believes the amounts provided are appropriate based upon the facts available upon compilation of the financial statements 
as additional information becomes available or actual amounts become determinable  the recorded estimates may be revised and reflected in operating results 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we have identified the following accounts that involve a higher degree of judgment and are subject to a significant degree of variability include policy related liabilities  deferred policy acquisition costs  present value of future profits and other amortizing intangibles  valuation of certain investments and income taxes 
policy related liabilities we calculate and maintain reserves for the estimated future payment of claims to our policyholders using the same actuarial assumptions that we use in the pricing of our products 
for our accident and health insurance business  we establish an active life reserve plus a liability for due and unpaid claims  claims in the course of settlement and incurred but not reported claims  as well as a reserve for the present value of amounts not yet due on claims 
many factors can affect these reserves and liabilities  such as economic and social conditions  inflation  hospital and pharmaceutical costs  changes in doctrines of legal liability and extra contractual damage awards 
therefore  the reserves and liabilities we establish are based on extensive estimates  assumptions and prior years statistics 
when we acquire other insurance companies or blocks of insurance  our assessment of the adequacy of transferred policy liabilities is subject to similar estimates and assumptions 
establishing reserves is an uncertain process  and it is possible that actual claims will materially exceed our reserves and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
our net income depends significantly upon the extent to which our actual claims experience is consistent with the assumptions we used in setting our reserves and pricing our policies 
if our assumptions with respect to future claims are incorrect  and our reserves are insufficient to cover our actual losses and expenses  we would be required to increase our liabilities resulting in reduced net income and shareholders equity 
deferred policy acquisition costs the cost of acquiring new business  principally non level commissions and agency production  underwriting  policy issuance  and associated costs  all of which vary with  and are primarily related to the production of new and renewal business  have been deferred 
for interest sensitive life and annuity products  these costs are being amortized in relation to the present value of expected gross profits on the policies arising principally from investment  mortality and expense margins in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting and reporting by insurance enterprises for certain long duration contracts and for realized gains and losses from the sale of investments 
for other life and health products  these costs are amortized in proportion to premium revenue using the same assumptions used in estimating the liabilities for future policy benefits in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting and reporting by insurance enterprises 
the determination of expected gross profits for intrest sensitive products is an inherently uncertain process that relies on assumptions including projected interest rates  the persistency of the policies issued as well as anticipated benefits  commissions and expenses 
it is possible that the actual profits from the business will vary materially from the assumptions used in the determination and amortization of deferred acquisition costs 
deferred policy acquisition costs are written off to the extent that it is determined that future policy premiums and investment income or gross profits would not be adequate to cover related losses and expenses 
present value of future profits and other intangibles business combinations accounted for as a purchase result in the allocation of the purchase consideration to the fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired  including the present value of future profits  establishing such fair values as the new accounting basis 
the present value of future profits is based on an estimate of the cash flows of the in force business acquired  discounted to reflect the present value of those cash flows 
the discount rate selected depends upon the general market conditions at the time of the acquisition and the inherent risk in the transaction 
purchase consideration in excess of the fair value of net assets acquired  including the present value of future profits and other identified intangibles  for a specific acquisition  is allocated to goodwill 
allocation of purchase price is performed in the period in which the purchase is consummated 
adjustments  if any  in subsequent periods relate to resolution of pre acquisition contingencies and refinements made to estimates of fair value in connection with the preliminary allocation 
amortization of present value of future profits is based upon the pattern of the projected cash flows of the in force business acquired  over periods ranging from ten to forty years 
other identified intangibles are amortized over their estimated lives 
prior to december   goodwill was amortized on a straight line basis over periods ranging from twenty to thirty years 
subsequent to december   goodwill is no longer amortized  see adoption of new accounting pronouncements below 
on a periodic basis  management reviews the unamortized balances of present value of future profits  goodwill and other identified intangibles to determine whether events or circumstances indicate the carrying value of such assets is not recoverable  in which case an impairment charge would be recognized 
management believes that no impairments of present value of future profits  goodwill or other identified intangibles existed as of december  investment valuation fair value of investments is based upon quoted market prices  where available  or on values obtained from independent pricing services 
for certain mortgage and asset backed securities  the determination of fair value is based primarily upon the amount and timing of expected future cash flows of the security 
estimates of these cash flows are based upon current economic conditions  past credit loss experience and other circumstances 
we regularly evaluate the amortized cost of our investments compared to the fair value of those investments 
impairments of securities generally are recognized when a decline in fair value below the amortized cost basis is considered to be other than temporary 
generally  we consider a decline in fair value to be other than temporary when the fair value of an individual security is below amortized cost for an extended period and we do not believe that recovery in fair value is probable 
impairment losses for certain mortgage and asset backed securities are recognized when an adverse change in the amount or timing of estimated cash flows occurs  unless the adverse change is solely a result of changes in estimated market interest rates 
the cost basis for securities determined to be impaired are reduced to their fair value  with the excess of the cost basis over the fair value recognized as a realized investment loss 
income taxes we use the asset and liability method to account for deferred income taxes 
under the asset and liability method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date of a change in tax rates 
we establish valuation allowances on our deferred tax assets for amounts that we determine will not be recoverable based upon our analysis of projected taxable income and our ability to implement prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
increases in these valuation allowances are recognized as deferred tax expense 
subsequent determinations that portions of the valuation allowances are no longer necessary are reflected as deferred tax benefits 
to the extent that valuation allowances were established in conjunction with acquisitions  changes in those allowances are first applied to increasing or decreasing the goodwill but not below zero or other intangibles related to the acquisition and then applied as an increase or decrease in income tax expense 
acquisitions  divestitures and financing activity acquisition of ameriplus on august   we acquired of the outstanding common stock of ameriplus preferred care  inc ameriplus 
ameriplus is engaged in the business of creating and maintaining a network of hospitals for the purpose of providing discounts to our medicare select policyholders

no ceding allowance was paid by american pioneer in the recapture and american pioneer currently retains of the risks on the million of medicare supplement business 
there was no gain or loss reported on these recapture agreements 
acquisition of pyramid life on march   we acquired all of the outstanding common stock of pyramid life 
pyramid life specializes in selling health and life insurance products to the senior market  including medicare supplement and select  long term care  life insurance  and annuities

health maintenance organization hmos dis enrollment beginning in  many hmos realized that their medicare programs were unprofitable and  therefore  decided to terminate these programs 
as a result  millions of seniors were involuntarily dis enrolled from these programs 
this development contributed to our increased new sales of medicare supplement products in and under applicable legislation  such dis enrollees had the right to acquire medicare supplement insurance without medical underwriting or pre existing condition limitations 
as we expected  beginning in new sales of our medicare products have slowed since the hmos are not dis enrolling members as much as they were in prior years 
to offset this impact  we have continued to expand geographically  and we have stepped up recruiting effort to augment our production 
additionally  we have increased our retention on new medicare supplement business 
as a result  we believe that we will continue to grow our net premiums

the total annual rent obligation for these field offices is approximately  administrative service company liquidity for our administrative service company is measured by its ability to pay operating expenses 
the primary source of liquidity is fees collected from clients 
we believe that the sources of cash for our administrative service company exceed scheduled uses of cash and results in amounts available to dividend to our parent holding company

as of december   the principal amount of the surplus note was million 
the note bears interest to our parent holding company at libor plus basis points 
we anticipate that the surplus notes will be primarily serviced by dividends from pennsylvania life  a wholly owned subsidiary of american exchange  and by tax sharing payments among the insurance companies that are wholly owned by american exchange and file a consolidated federal income tax return 
no principal payments were made during or during  the surplus note was reduced by million in the form of a capital contribution to american exchange by our holding company

insurance subsidiaries liquidity for our insurance company subsidiaries is measured by their ability to pay scheduled contractual benefits  pay operating expenses  and fund investment commitments 
sources of liquidity include scheduled and unscheduled principal and interest payments on investments  premium payments and deposits and the sale of liquid investments 
we believe that these sources of cash for our insurance company subsidiaries exceed scheduled uses of cash 
liquidity is also affected by unscheduled benefit payments including death benefits  benefits under accident and health insurance policies and interest sensitive policy surrenders and withdrawals 
the amount of surrenders and withdrawals is affected by a variety of factors such as credited interest rates for similar products  general economic conditions and events in the industry that affect policyholders confidence 
although the contractual terms of substantially all of our in force life insurance policies and annuities give the holders the right to surrender the policies and annuities  we impose penalties for early surrenders 
as of december  we held reserves that exceeded the underlying cash surrender values of our net retained in force life insurance and annuities by million 
our insurance subsidiaries  in our view  have not experienced any material changes in surrender and withdrawal activity in recent years 
changes in interest rates may affect the incidence of policy surrenders and withdrawals 
in addition to the potential impact on liquidity  unanticipated surrenders and withdrawals in a changed interest rate environment could adversely affect earnings if we were required to sell investments at reduced values in order to meet liquidity demands 
we manage our asset and liability portfolios in order to minimize the adverse earnings impact of changing market rates 
we seek to invest in assets that have duration and interest rate characteristics similar to the liabilities that they support 
the net yields on our cash and invested assets decreased to in from in a portion of these securities are held to support the liabilities for policyholder account balances  which liabilities are subject to periodic adjustments to their credited interest rates 
the credited interest rates of the interest sensitive policyholder account balances are determined by us based upon factors such as portfolio rates of return and prevailing market rates and typically follow the pattern of yields on the assets supporting these liabilities 
our insurance subsidiaries are required to maintain minimum amounts of capital and surplus as determined by statutory accounting practices 
as of december   each insurance company subsidiary s statutory capital and surplus exceeded its respective minimum requirement 
however  substantially more than these minimum amounts are needed to meet statutory and administrative requirements of adequate capital and surplus to support the current level of our insurance subsidiaries operations 
the statutory capital and surplus  including asset valuation reserves  of our us domiciled insurance subsidiaries totaled million at december  and million at december  the net statutory income for the year ended december  was million  which included net realized losses of million 
the net statutory loss for the year ended december  was million  which included net realized losses of million 
the national association of insurance commissioners has developed  and state insurance regulators have adopted  risk based capital requirements on life insurance enterprises 
at december  all of our insurance company subsidiaries maintained ratios of total adjusted capital to risk based capital in excess of the minimum trigger point for regulatory action 
penncorp life canada is subject to canadian capital requirements and reports its results to canadian regulatory authorities based upon canadian generally accepted accounting principles that vary in some respects from us statutory accounting practices  and us generally accepted accounting principles 
under canadian generally accepted actuarial practice  periodic morbidity and lapse experience studies are performed  that may result in an increase or decrease in policy benefit liabilities in that year 
penncorp life canada completed such a study during the fourth quarter of  resulting in a c million reduction in policy benefit liabilities 
net income based on canadian generally accepted accounting principles was c million us million for the year ended december  and was c million us million for canadian net assets based upon canadian generally accepted accounting principles were c million us million at december  and c million us million as of december  penncorp life canada maintained a minimum continuing capital and surplus requirement ratio mccsr in excess of the minimum requirement at december  dividend payments by our u 
s insurance companies to our holding company or to intermediate subsidiaries are limited by  or subject to the approval of the insurance regulatory authorities of each insurance company s state of domicile 
such dividend requirements and approval processes vary significantly from state to state 
pennsylvania life would be able to pay ordinary dividends of up to million and constitution would be able to pay million to american exchange their direct parent without the prior approval from the pennsylvania or texas insurance departments in pyramid life would be able to pay ordinary dividends of up to million to pennsylvania life its direct parent without the prior approval from the kansas insurance department and marquette would be able to pay ordinary dividends of up to million to constitution its direct parent without the prior approval from the texas insurance department in american exchange  american pioneer and union bankers had negative earned surplus at december  and would not be able to pay dividends in without special approval 
penncorp life canada is a canadian insurance company 
canadian law provides that a life insurer may pay a dividend after such dividend declaration has been approved by its board of directors and upon at least days prior notification to the superintendent of financial institutions 
such a dividend is limited to retained net income based on canadian gaap for the preceding two years  plus net income earned for the current year 
in considering approval of a dividend  the board of directors must consider whether the payment of such dividend would be in contravention of the insurance companies act of canada 
during the first quarter of  penncorp life canada paid dividends of c million approximately us million to universal american in accordingly  we anticipate that penncorp canada will be able to pay dividends equal to its net income earned during we do not expect that our other insurance subsidiaries will be able to pay ordinary dividends in investments our investment policy is to balance the portfolio duration to achieve investment returns consistent with the preservation of capital and maintenance of liquidity adequate to meet payment of policy benefits and claims 
we invest in assets permitted under the insurance laws of the various states in which we operate 
such laws generally prescribe the nature  quality of and limitations on various types of investments that may be made 
however  we do not currently have investments in partnerships  special purpose entities  real estate  commodity contracts  or other derivative securities 
we currently engage the services of three investment advisors under the direction of the management of our insurance company subsidiaries and in accordance with guidelines adopted by the investment committees of their respective boards of directors 
conning asset management company manages the portfolio of all of our united states subsidiaries  except for the portfolio of pyramid life  which is managed by hyperion capital 
mfc global investment management manages our canadian portfolio 
we invest primarily in fixed maturity securities of the us government and its agencies and in corporate fixed maturity securities with investment grade ratings of bbb standard poor s corporation  baa moody s investor service or higher 
our current policy is not to invest in derivative programs or other hybrid securities  except for gnma s  fnma s and investment grade corporate collateralized mortgage obligations 
as of december   of our fixed maturity investments had investment grade ratings from standard poor s corporation or moodys investor service 
there were no non income producing fixed maturities as of december  we wrote down the value of certain fixed maturity securities by million during  and by million during primarily as a result of the impairment of our world com holdings 
in each case  these write downs represent our estimate of other than temporary declines in value and were included in net realized gains losses on investments in our consolidated statements of operations 
as of december   our insurance company subsidiaries held cash and cash equivalents totaling million  as well as fixed maturity securities that could readily be converted to cash with carrying values and fair values of million 
the fair values of these holdings totaled  million as of december  federal income taxation of the company we file a consolidated return for federal income tax purposes  in which the insurance companies are not currently included 
as of december  we exclusive of the insurance companies had net operating tax loss carryforwards of approximately million that expire in the year and capital loss carryforwards of million that expire in as of december   we also had an alternative minimum tax amt credit carryforward for federal income tax purposes of approximately million that can be carried forward indefinitely 
as a result of the change in our ownership in july  use of most of our loss carryforwards is subject to annual limitations 
american exchange and the other u 
s 
insurance companies  other than peninsular  file a separate consolidated federal income tax return 
as of december   these companies had net operating loss carryforwards  most of which were incurred prior to their acquisition by us  of approximately million that expire in the years to at december   american exchange and its subsidiaries also had capital loss carryforwards of million that expire in years and as a result of the change in the ownership of the companies acquired in  use of most of these loss carryforwards is subject to annual limitations 
as of december  and  we carried valuation allowances of million and million  respectively  with respect to our tax loss carryforwards deferred tax assets 
we determine a valuation allowance based upon an analysis of projected taxable income and our ability to implement prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
the tax planning strategies include the expense reductions anticipated from our increased scale and from the income generated by our administrative services companies 
as a result of the continued profitability of the insurance subsidiaries acquired in and  valuation allowances on certain of the life tax loss carryforwards were considered not necessary at december  the amount of the life valuation allowance released during was million and was recorded as a benefit in the deferred income tax expense 
this benefit was reduced by reserve amounts established related to pre acquisition tax years of certain life insurance subsidiaries that currently are being examined by the internal revenue service 
as a result of the increased profitability of the administrative services segment  valuation allowances on certain of the non life tax loss carryforwards were considered not necessary as of december  the amount of the non life valuation allowance released during was million and was recorded as a benefit in the deferred income tax expense 
we believe it is more likely than not that we will realize the recorded net deferred tax assets 
our us insurance company subsidiaries  other than peninsular life insurance company  are taxed as life insurance companies as provided in the internal revenue code 
the omnibus budget reconciliation act of amended the internal revenue code to require a portion of the expenses incurred in selling insurance products to be capitalized and amortized over a period of years  as opposed to an immediate deduction in the year incurred 
instead of measuring actual selling expenses  the amount capitalized for tax purposes is based on a percentage of premiums 
in general  the capitalized amounts are subject to amortization over a ten year period 
since this change only affects the timing of the deductions  it does not  assuming stability of rates  affect the provisions for taxes reflected in our financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap 
however  by deferring deductions  the change does have the effect of increasing the current tax expense  thereby reducing statutory surplus 
because of our insurance company subsidiaries net operating loss carryforwards  there was no material increase in our current income tax provision for any of the three years in the period ended december  due to this provision 
effects of recently issued and pending accounting pronouncements for a discussion of our accounting policies  including recently issued and pending accounting pronouncements  see note summary of significant accounting policies 
there was no material impact on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations as a result of our adoption of the recently issued accounting pronouncements  nor do we anticipate any material impact from the future adoption of the pending accounting pronouncements 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in general  market risk relates to changes in the value of financial instruments that arise from adverse movements in interest rates  equity prices and foreign exchange rates 
we are exposed principally to changes in interest rates that affect the market prices of our fixed income securities as well as the cost of our debt 
additionally  we are exposed to changes in the canadian dollar that affects the translation of the financial position and the results of operations of our canadian subsidiary 
interest rate sensitivity our profitability could be affected if we were required to liquidate fixed income securities during periods of rising and or volatile interest rates 
however  we attempt to mitigate our exposure to adverse interest rate movements through a combination of active portfolio management and by staggering the maturities of our fixed income investments to assure sufficient liquidity to meet our obligations and to address reinvestment risk considerations 
our insurance liabilities generally arise over relatively long periods of time  which typically permits ample time to prepare for their settlement 
to date  we have not used various financial risk management tools on our investment securities  such as interest rate swaps  forwards  futures and options to modify our exposure to changes in interest rates 
however  we may consider using risk management tools in the future 
certain classes of mortgage backed securities are subject to significant prepayment risk due to the fact that in periods of declining interest rates  individuals may refinance higher rate mortgages to take advantage of the lower rates then available 
we monitor and adjust our investment portfolio mix to mitigate this risk 
we regularly conduct various analyses to gauge the financial impact of changes in interest rate on our financial condition 
the ranges selected in these analyses reflect our assessment as being reasonably possible over the succeeding twelve month period 
the magnitude of changes modeled in the accompanying analyses should not be construed as a prediction of future economic events  but rather  be treated as a simple illustration of the potential impact of such events on our financial results 
the sensitivity analysis of interest rate risk assumes an instantaneous shift in a parallel fashion across the yield curve  with scenarios of interest rates increasing and decreasing and basis points from their levels as of december   and with all other variables held constant 
a basis point increase in market interest rates would result in a pre tax decrease in the market value of our fixed income investments of million and a basis point increase in market interest rates would result in million decrease 
similarly  a basis point decrease in market interest rates would result in a pre tax increase in the market value of our fixed income investments of million and a basis point decrease in market interest rates would result in a million increase

as of and for the year ended december   approximately of our assets  of our revenues  excluding realized gains  and of our income before realized gains and taxes were derived from our canadian operations 
accordingly  our earnings and shareholder s equity are affected by fluctuations in the value of the us dollar as compared to the canadian dollar 
although this risk is somewhat mitigated by the fact that both the assets and liabilities for our foreign operations are denominated in canadian dollars  we are still subject to translation gains and losses 
we periodically conduct various analyses to gauge the financial impact of changes in the foreign currency exchange rate on our financial condition 
the ranges selected in these analyses reflect our assessment of what is reasonably possible over the succeeding twelve month period 
a strengthening of the us dollar relative to the canadian dollar  as compared to the actual exchange rate for  would have resulted in a decrease in our income before realized gains and taxes of approximately million for and a decrease in our shareholders equity of approximately million at december  a weakening of the us dollar relative to the canadian dollar would have resulted in an increase in our income before realized gains and taxes of approximately million for and an increase in shareholders equity of approximately million at december  our sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in any potential change in sales levels  local prices or any other variables 
the magnitude of changes reflected in the above analysis regarding interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates should  in no manner  be construed as a prediction of future economic events  but rather as a simple illustration of the potential impact of such events on our financial results 
debt we pay interest on our term loan and a portion of our trust preferred securities based on the london interbank offering rate libor for one  two or three months 
due to the variable interest rate for this loan  the company would be subject to higher interest costs if short term interest rates rise 
we have attempted to mitigate our exposure to adverse interest rate movements by fixing the rate on million of the trust preferred securities for a five year period through the contractual terms of the security at inception and an additional million through the use of an interest rate swap 
we regularly conduct various analyses to gauge the financial impact of changes in interest rate on our financial condition 
the ranges selected in these analyses reflect our assessment as being reasonably possible over the succeeding twelve month period 
the magnitude of changes modeled in the accompanying analyses should not be construed as a prediction of future economic events  but rather  be treated as a simple illustration of the potential impact of such events on our financial results 
the sensitivity analysis of interest rate risk assumes scenarios increases or decreases in libor of and basis points from their levels as of december   and with all other variables held constant

further  we anticipate that the weighted average balance of our floating rate trust preferred will increase to million in  as a result of the impact of the issuances being outstanding for the full year 
however  we also anticipate that in connection with the pending acquisition of heritage health systems  inc  we will refinance our floating rate debt and possibly issue additional trust preferred securities
