item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this document 
executive level overview in september  shareholders of the former pioneer standard electronics  inc approved an amendment to change the name of the company to agilysys  inc the company or agilysys 
following the approval of the name change  the company launched a new identity branding campaign  positioning the agilysys name with employees  customers  suppliers  shareholders and industry analysts 
fiscal was a year of single business focus for agilysys 
the single business focus of providing enterprise computer technology solutions allowed the company to quickly capitalize on improving trends in the marketplace  including increased it spending across small and medium end users  as well as large corporate customers 
this resulted in an increase in net sales and gross margin dollars during compared with the prior year 
agilysys was also able to execute two acquisitions that enhanced the company s competitive position and expanded its intellectual capital 
the company completed the acquisitions of kyrus corporation  or the agilysys retail solutions group and inter american data  inc  or the agilysys hospitality solutions group 
these acquisitions provide the company with opportunities for growth in retail and hospitality markets 
in addition  the acquisitions have allowed the company to enter new markets  broaden its customer base  expand its technology solutions offering and provide additional selling opportunities for its distribution  reseller and service businesses 
the results of the acquisitions of kyrus corporation on september  and inter american data  inc on february  are included in results of operations from their respective dates of acquisition 
these results may not be indicative of future annualized results 
during the fourth quarter of  the company also recorded a pre tax gain of million resulting from the settlement of an outstanding lawsuit 
the gain is included in other income expense in the consolidated statement of operations 
agilysys significantly reduced the level of outstanding senior notes in fiscal during the year the company repurchased million of senior notes  thus reducing its outstanding balance by approximately from the beginning of the year 
the company recorded losses totaling million resulting from the premiums paid and deferred costs expensed in connection with these debt retirements 
the repurchases significantly reduced agilysys financial leverage and will result in lower interest expense in agilysys reported net income of million for  or earnings per diluted share on net sales of billion  as compared with a net loss of million  or loss per diluted share on net sales of billion reported in the company intends the discussion of its financial condition and results of operations that follows to provide information that will assist in understanding financial statements  the changes in certain key items in the financial statements from year to year  and the primary factors that accounted for those changes  as well as how certain accounting principles  policies and estimates affect our financial statements 
critical accounting policies agilysys discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting policies generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make significant estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  restructuring and contingencies and litigation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
the company s most significant accounting policies relate to the sale  purchase  distribution and promotion of its products 
the policies discussed below are considered by management to be critical to an understanding of agilysys consolidated financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on management s judgment  with financial reporting results relying on estimation about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
specific risks for these critical accounting policies are described in the following paragraphs 
for all of these policies  management cautions that future events rarely develop exactly as forecast  and the best estimates routinely require adjustment 
revenue recognition the company derives revenue from three primary sources hardware servers and storage  software  and services 
in general  revenue is recognized when it is realized or realizable and earned 
the company considers revenue realized or realizable and earned when it has persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the product has been shipped or services have been provided to the customer  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
the company reduces revenue for discounts  sales incentives  estimated customer returns and other allowances 
the company offers discounts based on the volume of products and services purchased 
shipping and handling fees billed to customers are recognized as revenue and the related costs are recognized in costs of goods sold in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
in addition to this general policy  the following are the specific revenue recognition policies for each category of revenue 
hardware revenue of hardware sales is recognized generally when the product is shipped to the customer and when there are no unfulfilled obligations that affect the customer s final acceptance of the hardware 
the company s hardware  software  and services are predominantly sold on a stand alone basis 
in limited occurrences  sales with multiple products and or services are offered to customers 
when elements of hardware  software  and services are contained in a single arrangement  the company allocates revenue to each element based on its relative fair value  provided that such elements meet the criteria for treatment as a separate unit of accounting in accordance with eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
if the criteria for separate unit of accounting are not met  revenue is deferred until such criteria are met or until the period s over which the last undelivered element is delivered 
a portion of the company s business involves shipment directly from its suppliers to its customers 
in these transactions  the company is responsible for negotiating price both with the supplier and customer  payment to the supplier  establishing payment terms with the customer  product returns  and has risk of loss if the customer does not make payment 
as the principal with the customer  the company recognizes revenue when the company is notified by the supplier that the product has been shipped 
software revenue of software sales is recognized in accordance with aicpa statement of position  software revenue recognition  using the residual method 
software revenue is recognized when the software has been delivered and installed and there are no significant obligations remaining 
services revenue from service contracts is recognized as earned based on the performance requirements of the contract  generally as the services are provided 
in addition  service revenue from maintenance contracts is recognized over the life of the contract 
unspecified upgrades and technical support relating to software sales are recognized over the period such items are delivered 
the company does not include with the initial hardware purchase any element of a maintenance contract 
customers may opt to separately purchase premium service coverage or extended maintenance beyond the expiration date of the respective product s standard warranty as offered by the maker of the product 
the company also facilitates the sale of certain service contracts between its suppliers and customers 
revenue derived from such sales is recognized under the net method in accordance with eitf  reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent  since the company acts as an agent in the transaction 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
these allowances are based on both recent trends of certain customers estimated to be a greater credit risk as well as general trends of the entire customer pool 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
to mitigate this credit risk the company performs frequent credit evaluations of its customers 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out basis or market  net of related reserves 
the company s inventory is monitored to ensure appropriate valuation 
adjustments of inventories to lower of cost or market  if necessary  are based upon contractual provisions governing price protection  stock rotation right of return status  and technological obsolescence  as well as turnover and assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if assumptions about future demand change and or actual market condi tions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional adjustments to inventory valuations may be required 
the company provides a reserve for obsolescence  which is calculated based on factors including an analysis of historical sales of products  the age of the inventory and return provisions provided by the distribution agreements 
actual amounts could be different from those estimated 
investments the company holds strategic marketable equity securities that are carried at fair value 
impairment of investment securities results in a charge to operations when a market decline below cost is deemed other than temporary 
management regularly reviews each investment security for impairment based on criteria that include the extent to which cost exceeds market value  the duration of the market decline  management s ability and intent to hold the investment  and the financial condition of and specific prospects of the issuer 
agilysys also evaluates available information such as published financial reports and market research and analyzes cyclical trends within the industry segments in which the various companies operate to determine whether market declines should be considered other than temporary 
when management s intent or the financial condition of the issuer changes  or trends in the industry shift dramatically  the company considers the impairment other than temporary and records a charge to operations for the market decline 
deferred taxes the carrying value of the company s deferred tax assets is dependent upon the company s ability to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions 
should the company determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be expensed in the period such determination was made 
the company presently records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event that the company were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount including valuation allowance  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
goodwill and long lived assets in assessing the recoverability of the company s goodwill and other long lived assets  significant assumptions regarding the estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets must be made  as well as the related estimated useful lives 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future as a result of changes in strategy or market conditions  the company may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
for further information concerning the company s calculation of impairment  see notes and in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
restructuring and other special charges the company has recorded a reserve in connection with reorganizing its ongoing business subsequent to its sale of ied in this reserve principally includes estimates related to employee separation costs  the consolidation and impairment of facilities and other assets deemed inconsistent with continuing operations 
actual amounts could be different from those estimated 
determination of the impairment of assets is discussed above in goodwill and long lived assets 
facilities reserves are calculated using a probability weighted present value of future minimum lease payments  offset by an estimate for future sublease income provided by external brokers 
present value is calculated using a risk free treasury rate with a maturity equivalent to the lease term 
valuation of accounts payable the company s accounts payable has been reduced by amounts claimed to vendors for returns  price protection and other amounts related to incentive programs 
amounts related to price protection and other incentive programs are recorded as adjustments to cost of goods sold or operating expenses  depending on the nature of the program 
there is a time delay between the submission of a claim by the company and confirmation of agreement by our vendors 
historically  our estimated claims have approximated amounts agreed to by our vendors 
supplier programs the company receives funds from suppliers for price protection  product sales incentives and marketing and training programs  which are generally recorded  net of direct costs  as adjustments to cost of goods sold or operating expenses according to the nature of the program 
the product sales incentives are generally based on a particular quarter s sales activity and are primarily formula based 
some of these programs may extend over one or more quarterly reporting periods 
the company accrues supplier sales incentives and other supplier incentives as earned based on sales of qualifying products or as services are provided in accordance with the terms of the related program 
actual supplier sales incentives may vary based on volume or other sales achievement levels  which could result in an increase or reduction in the estimated amounts previously accrued  and can  at times  result in significant earnings fluctuations on a quarterly basis

gross margin the decrease in gross margin was predominantly due to a change in sales mix 
sales to resellers increased by approximately  while sales to commercial end users decreased by approximately during selling  general and administrative expenses the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses resulted primarily from the elimination of goodwill amortization under sfas no

 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
addresses the accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets after an acquisition 
goodwill and other intangibles that have indefinite lives are no longer amortized  but are subject to annual impairment tests 
all other intangible assets continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives 
effective april   the company discontinued amortization of its goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
under the required transitional provisions of sfas no 
 the company identified and evaluated its reporting units for impairment as of april   the first day of the company s fiscal year  using a two step process 
the first step involved identifying the reporting units with carrying values  including goodwill  in excess of fair value 
the fair value of goodwill was estimated using a combination of a discounted cash flow valuation model  incorporating a discount rate commensurate with the risks involved for each reporting unit  and a market approach of guideline companies in similar transactions 
as a result of completing the first step of the process  it was determined that there was an impairment of goodwill at the date of adoption 
this was due primarily to market conditions and relatively low levels of sales 
in the second step of the process  the implied fair value of the affected reporting unit s goodwill was compared with its carrying value in order to determine the amount of impairment  that is  the amount by which the carrying amount exceeded the fair value 
as a result  the company recorded an impairment charge of million  before tax  which was recorded as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in the first quarter of and is reflected in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the year ended march  the goodwill impairment was comprised of million for the industrial electronics division and million for the operations of aprisa which were sold and discontinued  respectively  in the fourth quarter of as reflected in the accompanying consolidated statement of cash flows for the charge resulting from the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle did not impact cash flow

the significant increase in accounts receivable relates primarily to the increase in fourth quarter sales volume of compared with last year 
in addition  the company recognized a slight decline in customer payment patterns during the year  which steadily improved throughout the year 
management believes that the improving trend will continue  and combined with the company s focused initiatives  accounts receivable turnover will return to historical levels  thus resulting in positive cash flows from operations in fiscal the increase in current liabilities  excluding discontinued operations  is largely due to the increase in accounts payable compared to prior year

in  as a result of the company s sale of ied and subsequent change in business focus  agilysys changed its intent relative to this investment 
the investment no longer held strategic value and the company no longer intended to hold it for an extended period of time

in october  the company completed a three year accounts receivable securitization financing the asset securitization that provided for borrowings up to million  limited to certain borrowing base calculations  and was secured by certain trade accounts receivable 
under the terms of this agreement  the company transferred receivables to a wholly owned  consolidated subsidiary that in turn utilized the receivables to secure the borrowings  which were funded through a vehicle that issues commercial paper in the short term market 
the yield on the commercial paper  which is the commercial paper rate plus program fees  is considered a financing cost and included in interest expense  net in the consolidated statements of operations 
the company had not used this facility since april in february  the company canceled the asset securitization  based on the company s strong liquidity position and low anticipated borrowing needs 
there were no advances outstanding under the facility as of the cancellation date 
during fiscal  the company entered into a revolving credit agreement the revolver with a group of commercial banks  which provided the company the ability to borrow  on an unsecured basis  up to million  limited to certain borrowing base calculations 
this agreement was scheduled to expire in september on december   in connection with the pending sales of ied  the revolver was amended to reduce the company s ability to borrow to million  limited to certain borrowing base calculations  and accelerate the expiration date to june the company had not used the facility since april on march   the company terminated this agreement 
there were no advances outstanding under the revolver as of the termination date 
as a result of the above noted terminations  there were no outstanding financial or non financial covenants as of march  on april   the company entered into an unsecured  three year revolving credit agreement the revolver with a consortium of six banks 
the revolver provides the company with the ability to borrow up to million  limited to certain borrowing base calculations  and allows for increases  under certain conditions  up to million during the life of the facility 
the revolver also contains standard pricing terms and conditions for companies with similar credit ratings  including limitations on other borrowings  investment expenditures and the maintenance of certain financial ratios  such as leverage  fixed charge coverage and net worth  among other restrictions 
the revolver advances bear interest at various levels over libor  and a facility fee is required  both of which are determined based on the company s leverage ratio 
the revolver does not contain a pre payment penalty 
during fiscal  the revolver was amended several times to substitute a quick ratio financial covenant for the fixed charge coverage ratio and interest coverage ratio  as well as temporarily increase the letter of credit limit to accommodate increased vendor credit terms during peak demand 
at march   there were no outstanding borrowings under the revolver 
the company is currently exposed to interest rate risk from the various floating rate pricing mechanisms on the revolver 
prior to march  the company was exposed to interest rate risk primarily from floating rate pricing mechanisms on the revolver and the asset securitization s the facilities variable short term market interest rates 
prior to october  the interest rate exposure was managed by an interest rate swap used to fix the interest on a portion of the revolver 
this interest swap was terminated in october during  total interest bearing debt on the facilities decreased by million 
the decrease primarily represents the repayment of borrowings against the asset securitization with cash generated from operations due to lower working capital needs 
in march and april  the company s wholly owned subsidiary  the pioneer standard financial trust the pioneer standard trust  issued  shares relating to million of mandatorily redeemable convertible trust preferred securities the trust preferred securities 
the sole asset of the pioneer standard trust is million aggregate principal amount of junior convertible subordinated debentures due march  the company executed a guarantee providing a full and unconditional guarantee of the pioneer standard trust s obligations under the trust preferred securities 
a portion of the company s cash flow from operations is dedicated to servicing these aggregate obligations and is not available for other purposes 
however  the company may cause the pioneer standard trust to delay payment of these servicing obligations for consecutive quarters 
during such deferral periods  distributions  to which holders of the securities are entitled  will compound quarterly  and the company may not declare or pay any dividends on its common shares
