overview all of the operations of airtran holdings  inc are conducted by our wholly owned subsidiary  airtran airways  inc  which is the second largest low fare scheduled airline in the united states in terms of departures 
we offer scheduled airline service principally serving short haul markets  primarily from our hub at hartsfield jackson atlanta international airport in atlanta  georgia 
as of march   we operate aircraft making approximately flights per day serving airports across the united states  serving more than communities in states  the district of columbia and the bahamas 
we have created a successful niche in selected markets by targeting price sensitive business and leisure travelers 
in addition to offering an affordable fare alternative to higher priced airlines  we believe we contribute toward the overall growth of the markets we serve by stimulating demand among travelers who may otherwise utilize ground transportation or not travel at all 
our service is intended not only to satisfy the transportation needs of our target customers  but also to provide customers with a travel experience worth repeating 
the success of this strategy is evidenced by the million revenue passengers we carried in the year ended december   a percent increase from the million revenue passengers we carried in the prior year ended december  with this traffic and revenue base  our operating margins  excluding special items  rank among the highest in the domestic airline industry 
we achieved this result with a cost structure that ranks among the best in the indu stry in terms of cost per available seat mile 
year in review in  we achieved a number of significant accomplishments during what continues to be one of the most challenging periods in the commercial airline industry 
while the industry recorded significant losses in  we recorded net income of million including a million payment under the wartime act  a charge of million of deferred debt discount issuance cost amortization resulting from the paydown of debt and a million credit due to the reversal of a tax valuation allowance 
we achieved these results in an operational and financial environment characterized by significant increases in aviation insurance costs  increased passenger screening costs resulting from evolving security laws and procedures  escalating fuel prices  and  in general  a recessionary domestic economic environment 
we have undertaken a number of key initiatives to strengthen our competitive position  including a fleet renewal plan 
we have upgraded our aircraft fleet through the acquisition of boeing b through december  we were the launch customer for the b  which was designed specifically for efficient short haul service and is considered among the most modern  innovative  comfortable and environmentally friendly commercial aircraft available today 
we retired our last dc on january  we believe the conversion to the bs will continue to enhance our overall image and improve our operating performance 
during  we committed to acquire b aircraft with delivery dates beginning in june with options and purchase rights to acquire an additional b aircraft through we also offer amenities such as a business class  assigned seating  a frequent flier program  same concourse connections at hartsfield jackson atlanta international airport and full participation in tr avel agents computer reservations 
additionally we strengthened our balance sheet by issuing million in common stock equity and million of convertible debt at while paying down million of long term debt at  million of long term debt at and converting to equity million of convertible debt at 
we ended the year with million in cash compared to million at december  our stockholders equity increased to million from million at december  additionally  our debt to equity ratio improved from in to at the end of other highlights from include the following inauguration of service to four new western destinations  including denver  co  los angeles  ca  las vegas  nv and san francisco  ca 
commenced new service to ronald reagan washington national airport 
rolled out self service kiosks at airport locations 
implemented online check in over the internet and other web based customer service enhancements celebrated the company s year anniversary on october  many of our competitors have experienced significant financial and operational hardships  including bankruptcy protection and capacity reductions 
as these competitors downsize their operations  market opportunities may become available to add frequencies in existing markets and new markets between existing cities as well as adding new cities as opportunities arise 
as a result  we expect to lower costs  improve productivity and increase aircraft utilization 
although we were able to generally offset the increased level of operating expenses in with lower maintenance and distribution costs  there can be no assurance we will be able to continue to offset any additional expenses  particularly resulting from increases in the price of fuel  further changes to security procedures or increases in aircraft insurance costs 
results of operations compared to summary for the year we recorded operating income of million  net income of million and diluted earnings per common share of 
these results reflect a credit of million for a payment from the united states government under the emergency wartime supplemental appropriations act of wartime act  a charge of million for the write off of debt discount and debt issuance costs due to early payoff of debt and the conversion of debt to equity and a credit of million created by the reversal of a tax valuation allowance 
our diluted earnings per common share were increased by upon recognition of these items see notes  and to the consolidated financial statements 
for the comparative period in  including special items  we recorded operating income of million  net income of million and diluted earnings per common share of 
our results included a credit of million for a government grant received pursuant to the air transportation sa fety and system stabilization act stabilization act 
our diluted earnings per common share for the year ended december  were increased by upon recognition of the government grant see note to the consolidated financial statements 
operating revenues our operating revenues for the year increased million percent primarily due to an increase in passenger revenues 
the increase in passenger revenues was primarily due to a percent increase in traffic  as measured by revenue passenger miles rpms 
during  we took delivery of boeing aircraft and retired nine owned dc aircraft and five leased dc aircraft total of dc aircraft 
as a result  our capacity  as measured by available seat miles asm  increased by percent 
when coupled with our rpm growth of percent  our load factor increased percentage points to percent 
while we continued to grow our operations by adding new aircraft to our fleet  new destinations to our route network  and additional frequencies between existing city pairs  we continued to experience a decline in yields during our average yield  as measured by revenue per passenger seat mile  decreased percent to cents per rpm 
the reduction in yield resulted from a percent increase in our average fare to and a percent increase in our average passenger trip length  as measured by rpms divided by revenue passengers  to miles 
this decline in yield  when combined with our percentage point increase in passenger load factor  resulted in a percent increase in passenger unit revenues  or passenger rasm  to cents per asm 
cargo revenues declined million primarily due to reduced levels of mail transported for the us postal service 
in general  the demand for short haul cargo transportation has diminished and we continue to focus our resources on passenger transportation 
operating expenses our operating expenses for the year increased million percent on an asm increase of percent 
this increase is due to operating an average of eight additional aircraft for the entire year and the end of the warranty period on our aircraft engines resulting in increases to maintenance expense 
in general  our operating expenses are significantly affected by changes in our capacity  as measured by asms 
the following table presents our unit costs  or operating expenses per asm  for and year ended december  percent change salaries  wages and benefits aircraft fuel aircraft rent maintenance  materials and repairs distribution landing fees and other rents aircraft insurance and security services marketing and advertising depreciation other operating total casm salaries  wages and benefits increased million percent overall or a decrease of percent on a casm basis primarily due to the addition of flight crews and ground support personnel hired to operate and support the growth of our b aircraft fleet and new destinations added to our route system  as well as contractual wage increases and higher costs associated with our employee benefit programs 
we employed approximately  employees including approximately  full time equivalents at year end representing roughly a percent increase over the comparative period 
aircraft fuel  including fuel hedging activities  increased million percent overall  and improved percent on a casm basis 
in  we consumed percent more fuel primarily due to the growth of our operations 
we also experienced increases in the price of aircraft fuel purchases 
improvements to our fuel consumption per block hour partially offset our greater fuel consumption and the price increases 
our average per gallon cost of fuel  including all fees  taxes  and hedging activities increased percent to cents 
our fuel consumption improved percent decreasing to gallons per block hour compared to gallons per block hour in we continue to realize savings from reduced fuel consumption per block hour as we replace the dc aircraft in our operating fleet with b aircraft that are more fuel efficient 
the results of our terminated derivative contracts increased aircraft fuel expense by million and million during and  respectively 
our fixed price fuel contracts and fuel cap contracts reduced our fuel expense by million and million during and  respectively 
aircraft rent increased million percent overall or percent on a casm basis due to a greater percentage of our aircraft fleet being leased 
twenty three lease financed b aircraft were added to our fleet during we have lease financing commitments in place to accept delivery of six b aircraft and six b aircraft during maintenance  materials and repairs increased million percent or percent on a casm basis 
on a block hour basis  maintenance costs increased percent to approximately per block hour 
prior to  the b aircraft parts and components were under warranty 
during  we commenced payments under previously negotiated agreements covering the maintenance  repair and overhaul of major b aircraft engine  parts and components 
under these agreements  we pay monthly fees based on either the number of flight hours flown or the number of landings made 
under these contracts  maintenance costs are expensed monthly as the aircraft is utilized 
distribution costs increased million percent overall or improved percent on a casm basis 
our improvement in this area  on a casm basis  was primarily due to i a greater percentage of our passenger sales being generated online via our website  and ii savings generated by revisions to our commission structure 
we recognize significant savings when our sales are transacted via our website as opposed to more traditional methods such as through travel agents and global distribution systems 
during we revised our commission structure to eliminate the standard percent commission for travel agencies 
we continue to offer a percent commission for sales transacted through the travel agent section of our website 
our commission cost savings was partially offset by increased computer reservation system and credit card fees 
the additional transaction volume derived from our growth in revenue passengers generated the escalation in these fees 
landing fees and other rents increased million percent  and percent on a casm basis reflecting landing fee rate increases  growth in the number of flights we operated and the leasing of facilities at the new destinations added to our route network 
aircraft insurance and security services declined million percent or percent on a casm basis primarily from a significant reduction in aircraft hull and passenger liability insurance rates in  despite increases in the insured fleet hull value as a result of the new b aircraft deliveries 
marketing and advertising increased million percent  and improved percent on a casm basis primarily reflecting our promotional efforts associated with the development of our new destinations and efforts to generate demand in all markets 
depreciation decreased million percent or percent on a casm basis primarily due to the retirement of and owned aircraft during and  respectively 
other operating expenses increased million percent  and improved percent on a casm basis primarily from added passenger related costs associated with the higher level of operations  contractual costs related to the opening of new destinations and the costs associated with our new reservations system and other automation projects 
non operating expenses other income expense  net decreased by million primarily due to the receipt of a government reimbursement pursuant to the wartime act of million  partially offset by a charge related to the write off of unamortized debt discount and issuance costs due to the early retirement of debt and of conversion of debt to equity see note to the consolidated financial statements 
additionally  interest expense decreased by approximately million due to the payoff of high interest rate debt and the issuance of lower interest rate debt 
interest income increased approximately million due to higher cash balances available for investment 
income tax benefit income tax benefit was million and million for and  respectively 
as a result of our two consecutive years of profitable results in and and the expectation of continued profitability  we recorded a tax benefit of million as a result of the reversal of the valuation allowance on the deferred tax asset related to our nol carryforwards 
we maintained a valuation allowance of approximately million consisting of million in amt credit carryforwards and million in state nol carryforwards that may expire without being used 
during we recorded income tax benefit of million due to a change in federal tax law as discussed below 
the job creation and worker assistance act of passed by congress in march resulted in a retroactive suspension of the amt nol percent limitation 
this legislation resulted in a tax benefit of million in in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes  the effect of changes in tax laws or rates is included in income in the period that includes the enactment date  resulting in recognition of the change in the first quarter of compared to summary for the year we recorded operating income of million  net income of million and diluted earnings per common share of 
these results reflect a credit of million for government grant funds received pursuant to the stabilization act 
our diluted earnings per common share were increased by upon recognition of the government grant see note to the consolidated financial statements 
for the comparative period in  including special items  we recorded operating income of million  a net loss of million and a diluted loss per common share of 
our results were significantly affected by the terrorist attacks on the united states that occurred on september  the september events and include i special charges of million in operating expenses that reflect reductions in aircraft fleet values  aircraft lease termination charges  and ii special charges of million directly related to the september events 
our non operating result s for included a special item of million representing additional debt discount amortization resulting from the exercise of conversion rights on approximately two thirds of our series b senior convertible notes and a credit of million for government grant funds we expected to receive pursuant to the stabilization act 
our diluted earnings per common share for the year ended december  were increased by upon recognition of the government grant see note to the consolidated financial statements 
our passenger revenues for the period from september through december were significantly affected by the september events 
in response to the terrorist attacks  the federal aviation administration faa immediately issued a federal ground stop order on september th  which prohibited all civil aviation flights from operation within the national airspace of the united states 
the us airspace was not reopened until september th  at which time we operated a portion of our pre september th scheduled operations 
once flights resumed  passenger traffic and yields were significantly lower than we had experienced prior to september th 
in an effort to match our capacity to the reduced level of demand  we reduced our operations to levels similar to those we operated during the same period in  despite the fact that we had been successful in growing our capacity by percent earlier in the year 
in addition  many corporations curtailed their business travel and leisure travelers cancelled or postponed vacations  which forced airlines to reduce airfares in an attempt to stimulate demand 
despite these actions  our traffic dropped in the post september th period by over percent  which resulted in our passenger load factor declining eight percentage points compared to the previous year 
passenger yields also suffered during the post september th period declining nearly percent year over year 
this resulted in a million  or percent  decline in passenger revenues compared to the same time period in on september   president bush signed into law the stabilization act  which provided  in part  for qualifying us airlines and air cargo carriers to receive up to billion in compensation for direct losses  including lost revenues  incurred as a direct result of the faa ground stop order and for incremental losses incurred through december  as a direct result of the september events  up to billion in federal government loan guarantees  reimbursement for certain insurance increases  and the extension in due dates for payment of certain excise taxes 
each air carrier was entitled to receive the lesser of its direct and incremental losses for the period of september  to december  or its available seat mile asm allocation of the billion compensation 
we received compensation payments of million and million during and  respectively 
related to these payments  we recognized income of million and million in and  respectively  which is included in other income expense  net government grant on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
operating revenues our operating revenues for the year increased million percent primarily due to an increase in passenger revenues 
the increase in passenger revenues was primarily due to a percent increase in traffic  as measured by revenue passenger miles rpms 
during  we took delivery of boeing aircraft and retired dc aircraft 
as a result  our capacity  as measured by asms  increased by percent 
when coupled with our rpm growth of percent  our load factor declined percentage points to percent 
although we continued to grow our operations by adding new aircraft to our fleet  new destinations to our route network  and additional frequencies between existing city pairs  the general erosion of yields and passenger load factors that began in the third quarter of continued to unfavorably affect our passenger revenues during our average yield  as measured by revenue per passenger seat mile  decreased percent to cents per rpm 
the reduction in yield resulted from a percent decrease in our average fare to and a percent increase in our average passenger trip length  as measured by rpms divided by revenue passengers  to miles 
this decline in yield  when combined with our percentage point decline in passenger load factor  resulted in a percent decline in passenger unit revenues  or passenger rasm  to cents per asm 
cargo revenues declined million primarily due to reduced levels of mail transported for the us postal service 
in general  the demand for short haul cargo transportation has diminished following the september events and we have alternatively focused our resources on passenger transportation 
operating expenses our operating expenses for the year increased million percent  including special items  on an asm increase of percent 
operating expenses for reflect i an impairment charge of million related to the write down of the net book value of our owned b fleet and for charges related to the termination of the lease on one b aircraft  ii special charges of million related to the impairment of our owned dc aircraft fleet  and iii million of other costs directly related to the september events 
excluding special items  our operating cost per asm casm improved percent to cents on asm growth of percent 
in general  our operating expenses are significantly affected by changes in our capacity  as measured by asms 
the following table presents our unit costs  or operating expenses per asm  for and year ended december  percent change salaries  wages and benefits aircraft fuel aircraft rent maintenance  materials and repairs distribution landing fees and other rents aircraft insurance and security services marketing and advertising depreciation other operating total casm note amounts for exclude impairment loss lease termination and special charges of million and million  respectively on a casm basis 
salaries  wages and benefits increased million percent overall or percent on a casm basis primarily due to the addition of flight crews and ground support personnel hired to operate and support the growth of our b aircraft fleet and new destinations added to our route system  as well as contractual wage increases and higher costs associated with our employee benefit programs 
we employed approximately  employees including approximately  full time equivalents at year end representing roughly a percent increase over the comparative period 
aircraft fuel  including fuel hedging activities  increased million percent overall  and improved percent on a casm basis 
in  we consumed percent more fuel primarily due to the growth of our operations 
decreases in the price of aircraft fuel purchases and improvements to our fuel consumption per block hour partially offset our greater fuel consumption 
our average per gallon cost of fuel  including all fees  taxes  and hedging activities decreased percent to cents 
our fuel consumption improved percent decreasing to gallons per block hour 
we continue to realize savings from reduced fuel consumption per block hour as we replace the dc aircraft in our operating fleet with b aircraft that are more fuel efficient 
we expect to derive additional fuel consumption per block hour improvements in as we retire the remaining dc aircraft and operate an all boeing aircraft fleet by the end of the year 
the results of our terminated derivati ve contracts increased aircraft fuel expense by million and million during and  respectively 
our fixed price fuel contracts and our fuel cap contracts reduced our fuel expense million during aircraft rent increased million percent overall or percent on a casm basis due to a greater percentage of our aircraft fleet being leased 
twenty lease financed b aircraft were added to our fleet during we have lease financing commitments in place to accept delivery of b aircraft during maintenance  materials and repairs decreased million percent or percent on a casm basis 
on a block hour basis  maintenance costs declined percent to approximately per block hour  primarily reflecting the retirement of dc aircraft in and seven dc aircraft in the timing of maintenance to be performed is predominantly determined by the number of hours the aircraft and engines are operated and their age 
the composition of our aircraft fleet continued to shift toward a greater percentage of new b aircraft that generally require less costly and less frequent scheduled maintenance 
our maintenance costs are expected to increase as these aircraft age and are utilized more frequently 
distribution costs decreased million percent overall or percent on a casm basis 
our improvement in this area was primarily due to i a greater percentage of our passenger sales being generated online via our website  and ii savings generated by revisions to our commission structure 
we recognize significant savings when our sales are transacted via our website as opposed to more traditional methods such as through travel agents and global distribution systems

aircraft insurance and security services increased million percent or percent on a casm basis primarily from additional aircraft insurance premiums for war risk liability insurance 
in addition  our insured fleet hull value increased as a result of the new b aircraft deliveries while the overall rates for basic hull and liability coverage also increased 
marketing and advertising increased million percent  and improved percent on a casm basis primarily reflecting our promotional efforts associated with the development of our new destinations 
depreciation decreased million percent or percent on a casm basis primarily due to the retirement of owned aircraft during and seven owned aircraft during our depreciation expense was reduced further by the reduction in the net book value of our b and dc aircraft as recorded during the second and third quarters of  respectively  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
a revision to the useful life of our b fleet during and our discontinued amortization of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets upon adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets during reduced our depreciation expense see note to the consolidated financial statements 
depreciation associated with additional spare parts and equipment provisioning for the b aircraft partially offset the aforementioned expense reductions 
other operating expenses increased million percent  and improved percent on a casm basis primarily from added passenger related costs associated with the higher level of operations  contractual costs related to the opening of new destinations and the costs associated with our new reservations system and other automation projects 
impairment loss lease termination represents i an impairment charge of million related to the write down of the net book value of our owned b fleet and for charges related to the termination of the lease on one b aircraft  and ii special charges of million related to the impairment of our owned dc aircraft fleet 
during the second quarter of we announced our intentions to retire our fleet of b aircraft in the third quarter of in order to simplify our fleet and reduce costs 
during the third quarter of  the september events had a profound impact on aircraft values worldwide  in particular on maintenance intensive  less fuel efficient aircraft such as b s  md s  as well as our dc fleet 
a significant number of the aircraft that were grounded by air carriers were of these aircraft types 
we performed evaluations of the b and dc aircraft fleets to determine  in accordance with sfas  whether future cash flows undiscounted and without int erest charges expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of these aircraft would be less than the aggregate carrying amount of these aircraft and related assets 
as a result of the evaluation  we determined that the estimated future cash flows expected to be generated by these aircraft would be less than their carrying amount  and therefore concluded that these aircraft were impaired as defined by sfas consequently  the net book value of the b and dc aircraft fleets and related assets were reduced during by approximately million to reflect the fair market value of these assets 
special charges primarily represent operating costs incurred during the faa s ground stop order following the september events 
non operating expenses other income expense  net increased by million percent primarily due to reductions in interest expense  convertible debt discount issuance cost amortization  and interest income  as well as adjustments related to our fuel hedges in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
additionally  a government grant credit of million and were recorded as income in and  respectively 
interest expense decreased as a result of having reduced our outstanding debt obligations during the period 
convertible debt discount issuance cost amortization represents the exercise of conversion rights on approximately two thirds of our series b convertible notes during upon conversion  we expensed million of the debt discount associated with this financial instrument 
interest income decreased due to lower interest rates earned on invested cash balances 
sfas adjustment income represents changes in the value of our now terminated fuel related derivative contracts see note to the consolidated financial statements 
income tax expense benefit income tax expense benefit was million and million for and  respectively 
during we recorded income tax benefit of million due to a change in federal tax law as discussed below 
during  the differences between our effective tax rates and statutory rates result from the expected utilization of a portion of our net operating loss nol carryforwards  offset in part by alternative minimum tax amt and the application to goodwill of the tax benefit related to the realization of a portion of the airways corporation  inc nol carryforwards

our net income improved by million primarily due to a million payment received from the government pursuant to the wartime act  the reversal of a million tax valuation allowance and to the growth of our business  as measured by passenger revenues 
as our business has grown  so has the level of our customers advance payments for future travel  commonly referred to as air traffic liability 
investing activities used cash flows of million in compared to cash flows provided of million in our property and equipment purchases in both years primarily consisted of spare parts and equipment provisioning for the b aircraft as well as improvements to our reservation systems and computer hardware and software 
to a lesser extent our property and equipment purchases consisted of capital expenditures on leasehold improvements and ground equipment to support our operations growth particularly for the cities added to our route network during those years 
cash flows for aircraft purchase deposits relate to our agreement to acquire b aircraft and b aircraft 
during  we committed to purchase up to b aircraft and obtained options to purchase an additional b aircraft  which required us to pay advance deposits of approximately million in during  we amended our b purchase agreement with the airframe manufacturer see commitments below

financing activities for consisted primarily of scheduled payments of debt obligations 
commitments as of december   airtran airways has contracted with the boeing company boeing and an aircraft leasing company to acquire b aircraft with delivery dates between and in connection with airtran airways agreement with boeing  airways also obtained options and purchase rights from boeing to acquire up to an additional b aircraft with delivery dates between and pursuant to airtran airways arrangement with the aircraft leasing company  airtran airways also entered into individual operating leases for of the b aircraft  and has entered into sale leaseback transactions with respect to six related spare engines  to be delivered between and additionally  airtran airways has obtained financing commitments from an affiliate of boeing for up to of the purchase price of of the b aircraft should airtran airways be unable to secure financing from the financial markets on acceptable terms 
during  airtran airways is scheduled to take delivery of eight of these b aircraft with six such aircraft subject to the individual operating leases as mentioned above 
there can be no assurance that sufficient financing will be available for all b aircraft and other capital expenditures not covered by firm financing commitments 
additionally  during  airtran airways acquired b aircraft in accordance with agreements with boeing and bcc  bringing our total b fleet to aircraft 
one aircraft was delivered through a sale leaseback transaction with an affiliate of bcc and aircraft are subject to individual operating leases with affiliates of bcc 
in july  we cancelled our remaining six options to acquire six b aircraft with boeing and agreed to purchase ten additional b aircraft during and these aircraft may be used or new and shall either be subject to individual operating leases or sale leaseback transactions with bcc or affiliates thereof 
we also obtained contingent options to acquire up to an additional four b aircraft under similar lease financing arrangements 
during  in connection with airtran airways agreements with boeing  airtran airways was refunded million in previously paid aircraft deposits and paid million in aircraft deposits under the new agreement with boeing for the acquisition of b aircraft 
during  we entered into a seven year cancelable agreement with a regional jet contractor to provide regional jet service between pre determined city pairs 
we pay the contractor to operate the flights and we are entitled to all the revenues associated with these flights 
under this agreement  we paid the contractor million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
these payments are recorded on a net basis as a reduction to passenger revenue 
in march  we announced that we had reached an agreement to end this regional jet service 
the move to end this service came after we performed an economic analysis and determined that we could operate b aircraft more efficiently in short haul markets 
the phase out of service will begin in july and all regional jet service will end in august at december   we had commitments to purchase aircraft fuel under fixed price contracts for use during and of approximately million 
subsequent to year end  we entered into an additional fixed price contract for that increased our commitments to purchase fuel to million 
these contracts  used to reduce our exposure to increases in fuel prices  cover approximately and of our planned fuel requirements for and  respectively 
during december  we broke ground for a planned million hangar facility at hartsfield jackson atlanta international airport 
the  square foot hangar will be large enough to hold two of our b aircraft simultaneously and will also have a  square foot  two story office building attached to the hangar to house engineers and other support staff 
completion of construction is expected by may the city of atlanta is financing construction of the facility 
upon completion  we intend to consummate a long term lease agreement for the hangar facility 
our expected contractual obligations and commitments to be paid were the following as of december  in millions nature of commitment total thereafter operating lease payments for aircraft and facility obligations aircraft fuel purchases long term debt obligations total contractual obligations and commitments excludes related interest payments 
a variety of assumptions were necessary in order to derive the information described in the paragraph herein  including  but not limited to i the timing of aircraft delivery dates  ii estimated rental factors which are correlated to floating interest rates prior to delivery  and iii future fuel prices  including fuel refining  transportation and into plane costs 
our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
other information in may  airtran holdings completed a private placement of million in convertible notes due in the proceeds are to be used to improve airtran holdings and airtran airways overall liquidity by providing working capital and for general corporate purposes 
the notes bear interest at payable semi annually on january and july the notes are unsecured senior obligations ranking equally with airtran holdings existing unsecured senior indebtedness 
the notes are unconditionally guaranteed by airways and rank equally with all unsecured obligations of airtran airways 
the unsecured notes and the note guarantee are junior to any secured obligations of airtran holdings or airtran airways to the extent of the collateral pledged and are also effectively subordinated to all liabilities of our subsidiaries other than airways  including deposits and trade payables

critical accounting policies and estimates general 
the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and are sufficiently sensitive to result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that our critical accounting policies are limited to those described below see note to the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
passenger and cargo revenue is recognized when transportation is provided or when the tickets expire unused rather than when a ticket is sold 
nonrefundable tickets expire one year from the date the ticket is purchased 
transportation purchased but not yet used is included in air traffic liability 
accounting for long lived assets 
effective january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas supercedes sfas we record impairment losses on long lived assets used in operations when events or circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the net book value of those assets 
in making these determinations  we utilize certain assumptions  including  but not limited to i estimated fair market value of the assets  and ii estimated future cash flows expected to be generated by these assets  which are based on additional assumptions such as asset utilization  length of service the asset will be used in our operations  and estimated salvage values 
we have approximately million of long lived assets as of december  on a cost basis  including approximately million of flight equipment and related equipment on a cost basis 
spare parts  materials and supplies 
spare parts  materials and supplies are stated at the lower of cost or market using the first in  first out method fifo 
these items are charged to expense when used 
allowances for obsolescence are provided for over the estimated useful life of the related aircraft and engines for spare parts expected to be on hand at the date aircraft are retired from service 
new product during  we entered into a one year charter agreement with a charter airline 
under this agreement  the charter airline provides the aircraft  crew  maintenance on the aircraft and the hull and liability insurance in exchange for a fixed block hour rate for flights operated on our behalf 
during  we paid this charter airline approximately million 
these payments are recorded on a net basis as a reduction to passenger revenues 
recently issued accounting standards effective january  we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for costs associated with disposal or exit activities 
sfas nullifies emerging issues task force issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity 
sfas requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized and measured initially at fair value only when the liability is incurred 
sfas is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  the adoption of sfas did not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
we also adopted the financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
fin requires a guarantor to recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
fin also expands the disclosures required to be made by a guarantor about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued 
initial recognition and measurement provisions of fin are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified 
this interpretation applies to guarantees issued or modified after december  and has no impact on our consolidated results of operations  consolidated balance sheet or consolidated cash flows 
see note effective october   we adopted fasb interpretation fin  consolidation of variable interest entities 
fin requires the consolidation of certain types of entities in which a company absorbs a majority of another entity s expected losses  receives a majority of the other entity s expected residual returns  or both  as a result of ownership  contractual or other financial interests in the other entity 
these entities are called variable interest entities or vies 
the principal characteristics of vies are an insufficient amount of equity to absorb the entity s expected losses  equity owners as a group are not able to make decisions about the entity s activities  or equity that does not absorb the entity s losses or receive the entity s residual returns 
variable interests are contractual  ownership or other monetary interests in an entity that change with fluctuations in the entity s net asset value 
as a result  vies can arise from items such as lease agreements  loan a rrangements  guarantees or service contracts 
if an entity is determined to be a vie  the entity must be consolidated by the primary beneficiary 
the primary beneficiary is the holder of the variable interests that absorb a majority of the vie s expected losses or receive a majority of the entity s residual returns in the event no holder has a majority of the expected losses 
there is no primary beneficiary in cases where no single holder absorbs the majority of the expected losses or receives a majority of the residual returns 
the determination of the primary beneficiary is based on projected cash flows at the inception of the variable interest 
we have variable interests in our aircraft leases 
the lessors are trusts established specifically to purchase  finance and lease aircraft to us 
these leasing entities meet the criteria of vies 
we are generally not the primary beneficiary of the leasing entities if the lease terms are consistent with market terms at the inception of the lease and do not include a residual value guarantee  fixed price purchase option or similar feature that obligates us to absorb decreases in value or entitles us to participate in increases in the value of the aircraft 
this is the case in the majority of our aircraft leases  however we have two aircraft leases that contain fixed price purchase option that allow us to purchase the aircraft at predetermined prices on specified dates during the lease term 
we have not consolidated the related trusts because even taking into consideration these purchase options  we are still not the primary beneficiary based on our cash flow analysis 
our maximum exposure under these leas es is the remaining lease payments  which are reflected in future lease commitments in note to the consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk sensitive instruments and positions we are subject to certain market risks  including interest rates and commodity prices ie  aircraft fuel 
the adverse effects of changes in these markets pose a potential loss as discussed below 
the sensitivity analyses do not consider the effects that such adverse changes may have on overall economic activity  nor do they consider additional actions we may take to mitigate our exposure to such changes 
actual results may differ 
see the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a description of our financial policies and additional information 
interest rates as of december  and  the fair value of our long term debt was estimated to be million and million  respectively  based upon discounted future cash flows using current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of instruments or market prices 
market risk  estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical basis point decrease in interest rates  was approximately million as of december   and approximately million as of december  our long term debt obligations bear fixed rates of interest and may be prepaid without penalty prior to their respective maturity dates and  therefore  a change in market interest rates generally would not affect our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
aviation fuel our results of operations are impacted by changes in the price of aircraft fuel 
excluding special items  aircraft fuel accounted for percent and percent of our operating expenses in and  respectively 
based on our projected fuel consumption  a percent increase in the average price per gallon of aircraft fuel for the year ending december   would increase fuel expense for the next twelve months by approximately million  including the effects of our fuel hedges 
comparatively  based on fuel usage  a percent increase in fuel prices would have resulted in an increase in fuel expense of approximately million  including the effects of our fuel hedges 
in  we terminated our fuel hedging contracts consisting of swap agreements and entered into fixed price fuel contracts and fuel cap contracts to partially protect against significant increases in aircraft fuel prices 
at december   we had hedged approximately percent of our projected fuel requirements for  as compared to approximately percent of our projected fuel requirements for at december  during the first quarter of  we entered into additional fixed price fuel contracts and fuel cap contracts that increased our fuel commitments to approximately percent of our estim ated fuel needs for
