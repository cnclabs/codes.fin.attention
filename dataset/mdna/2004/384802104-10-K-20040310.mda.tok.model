grainger serves customers through a network of branches  distribution centers and multiple web sites 
business environment 
several economic factors and industry trends shape grainger s business environment 
the current overall economy and leading economic indicators forecast by economists provide insight into anticipated economic factors for the near term and help in the development of projections for the upcoming year 
at the start of  the consensus forecast usa is predicting gdp and industrial production growth of to percent for grainger s sales to manufacturers tend to correlate more with employment levels than with manufacturing output  so job creation  in addition to manufacturing production  is an indicator for potential sales growth 
most recently  declining employment in the manufacturing sector  due to increased productivity and production moving offshore  has adversely affected the operating results of grainger 
this trend is likely to continue  and could adversely affect employment levels in one of grainger s largest sectors 
to address this trend  grainger has been focusing on government and commercial customers and healthcare institutions 
to reach more customer groups  grainger s market expansion program will increase branch coverage  expand local availability of products and add local sales professionals in high potential markets through a multi year program focused on local customers 
the customer s buying behavior also affects grainger s business environment 
in  grainger will continue to target large  multi site customers including government and national accounts 
sales from government accounts grew from of total sales in to in grainger believes that customers will increasingly focus on reducing their cost to procure facilities maintenance products 
grainger is addressing this anticipated shift in focus by expanding its market coverage and increasing product information available to branch employees for improved service to local customers by accelerating replacement of its legacy information systems 
grainger s financial strength  including its low debt and strong cash flow  leaves it well positioned to fund initiatives to accelerate top line growth 
in  grainger will be investing in the branch network and information technology including the following major items to million for the branch network  to million for information technology  to million for the branch telephone system replacement and million for completion of the logistics network 
in  total capital expenditures of to million are anticipated  more than double that of recent years 
capital spending for the market expansion program may be affected by decisions to lease  rather than purchase  the related facilities and or equipment 
matters affecting comparability 
the emerging issues task force eitf issued accounting by a customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a vendor  issue in november with transition provisions subsequently issued in january for more detailed information regarding this change in accounting  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
grainger s accounting treatment for vendor provided funds was consistent with issue  with the exception of vendor funded advertising allowances  which had been accounted for as an offset to operating advertising expenses 
this accounting treatment is only allowable under issue in certain specific circumstances 
as a result of issue  grainger will classify the majority of its vendor provided allowances as an offset to cost of merchandise sold rather than operating advertising expenses 
application of issue is on a prospective basis as contracts are either modified or renewed 
since a majority of the contracts with provisions for advertising allowances were entered into prior to december   the amounts classified as a reduction of cost of merchandise sold of million were not material to this change does not have any effect on net earnings

branch based distribution net sales at the branch based distribution businesses totaled  million in and were essentially flat when compared with sales of  million 
sales in the united states declined approximately in as compared with government account sales were up nearly in  while all other customer segments  including light and heavy manufacturing  were down when compared with the declines noted in the other customer segments were primarily due to the weakness in the us economy  particularly in manufacturing 
within these customer segments  sales to national accounts increased approximately over sales growth through internet channels continued in  increasing over and representing of segment sales 
grainger will continue to invest in procurement technology to encourage online purchases by its customers and expects sales growth from internet channels to continue in sales in canada increased in  principally due to a favorable exchange rate 
in local currency  sales grew  primarily in ontario and national accounts 
in mexico  sales declined in as compared with  principally due to a weak economy in mexico 
cost of merchandise sold of  million for in the branch based distribution businesses was essentially flat compared to  million in gross profit margins increased percentage points to in from in selected price increases designed to offset increased freight and other costs both in the united states and canada  combined with a favorable change in product mix  contributed to the margin increase 
the classification of vendor provided allowances from operating advertising expenses to cost of merchandise sold also increased gross profit margin by percentage points 
branch based distribution operating expenses increased in  primarily due to higher severance and healthcare expenses and increased occupancy costs 
the classification of vendor provided allowances from operating advertising expenses to cost of merchandise sold also contributed to the increase 
operating earnings of million in declined by million or as compared with the increase in operating expenses year over year more than offset the improvement in gross profit margin 
lab safety net sales at lab safety increased by million to million in  a increase over the sales growth was attributable to incremental sales from gempler s  acquired on april  excluding the results of gempler s  year over year net sales decreased as a result of weakness in the manufacturing sector of the us economy 
a major portion of lab safety s sales are to manufacturers 
the overall decline in the manufacturing sector was partially offset by increased sales to customers in the forestry and public safety markets 
the gross profit margin of decreased percentage points due to incremental sales of gempler s products  which have lower gross margins than the rest of lab safety s products 
in addition  in there was a shift in sales mix to lower margin new product sales 
lab safety operating expenses of million increased in  when compared with million for the primary driver of the year over year increase was the incremental costs associated with the addition of gempler s during the year and higher spending on catalog media 
as a result  operating earnings of million for lab safety in declined from operating earnings of million in integrated supply integrated supply net sales of million in were million lower than million of net sales in the decrease in net sales resulted from six site disengagements  as well as lower volumes from existing customers 
the decrease in sales was partially offset by incremental sales at seven new customer sites 
sales include both product sales  which are passed through to the customer at cost  and management fees 
gross profit declined million in due to lower management fees 
operating expenses of million increased in  when compared with million for the increase of million was principally due to a higher provision for bad debts  combined with incremental costs associated with a systems upgrade

see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the reduction in gains on sales of fixed assets resulted from the sale of one facility in versus two in income taxes income taxes of million in declined as compared with million in grainger s effective tax rates were and in and  respectively 
excluding the effect of the equity losses in unconsolidated entities and the write down of these investments  which did not result in tax benefits  the effective income tax rates were for and for this change in effective tax rate was primarily driven by lower nondeductible losses in mexico and a lower tax rate in canada 
compared to grainger s net sales of  million for decreased from net sales of  million in this decline resulted principally from decreases in the branch based distribution and lab safety segments and the elimination of the digital segment 
the decrease was partially offset by an increase at integrated supply 
the general weakness in the north american economy affected overall sales performance 
grainger s cost of merchandise sold of  million for decreased from the cost of merchandise sold of  million for this decrease was primarily volume related due to the decline in net sales and supply chain efficiencies 
operating expenses of  million for decreased from operating expenses of  million for operating expenses for included a pretax benefit related to a million reduction of a portion of the material logic shutdown reserve established in operating expenses for included a pretax restructuring charge of million related to the shutdown of material logic

branch based distribution net sales at the branch based distribution businesses amounted to  million in  a decrease as compared with sales of  million 
sales in the united states decreased slightly in as compared with primarily due to weakness in the north american economy 
while sales to government and national accounts increased and  respectively  when compared with the prior year  sales declines in other categories offset those increases 
the increased sales to government and national accounts were primarily due to sales and marketing programs focused on developing these markets 
sales were favorably affected by continued momentum in grainger s internet programs 
for  internet channels processed sales of million  a increase from the million processed in grainger continued to focus on converting its customers to purchasing online 
grainger has experienced incremental revenue across all channels from customers who convert to online purchasing 
in canada  sales decreased in as compared with this decrease was primarily due to the elimination of automotive aftermarket parts sales as a result of the joint venture with uni select inc  established on february  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
excluding the impact of the joint venture  sales were down for the year due to the weakness in the natural resources sector and the loss of a few major accounts 
in mexico  sales decreased in as compared with this decrease was attributable to the weak economy in mexico  partially offset by selected price increases intended to offset the declining value of the peso 
gross profit margins improved due to selected pricing actions in intended to cover freight and supplier cost increases and to favorable product mix 
partially offsetting these improvements were an unfavorable change in selling price category mix and higher freight costs related to the logistics project 
operating expenses increased in versus operating expenses increased due to higher payroll and benefits expenses  partially offset by lower advertising from fewer catalogs being printed and lower bad debt expenses from fewer bankruptcies of large customers 
operating earnings of million increased in as compared with million for the effect of higher gross profit margins was partially offset by lower sales and an increase in operating expenses 
lab safety net sales at lab safety amounted to million in  an decrease compared with sales of million 
sales at lab safety included the results of the ben meadows co  a company acquired on february  the sales decrease was primarily the result of weak sales in the us manufacturing sector 
cost of merchandise sold of million for at lab safety decreased by million as compared with million in this decrease was primarily volume related due to the sales decline 
lab safety operating expenses declined million in  primarily the result of second quarter workforce reductions and other cost control measures  including lower advertising expenditures

integrated supply net sales at integrated supply amounted to million in  an increase over sales of million 
sales growth for this business was primarily the result of increased penetration of existing customers and includes both product sales and management fees 
integrated supply had operating income of million in compared with million in this improvement in operating performance for was the result of eliminating or restructuring unprofitable contracts throughout and productivity gains attained by leveraging the existing cost structure 
operating income for also benefited from lower bad debt expense compared with  where provisions were made for losses related to two large customer bankruptcies 
digital in april  grainger announced that it would shut down the operations of material logic  with the exception of findmro 
material logic was launched in january as a utility for large customers to facilitate the purchase of facilities maintenance products over the internet 
material logic would have allowed large customers to access a single  networked catalog containing easily searchable and detailed product information  pre negotiated prices and availability information for indirect materials from major distributors 
in order for material logic to grow  it needed broad industry support and funding from other equity participants 
grainger closed material logic because economic and market conditions made it difficult to find funding partners and the market developed more slowly than anticipated 
in connection with this announcement  grainger took a pretax charge of million in beginning with the third quarter  the digital segment ceased operations 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
effective june   findmro was added to the branch based distribution segment 
consequently  no results were reported for the digital segment in  but million of net sales were reported in other income and expense other income and expense was million of income in  an improvement of million as compared with million of expense in the following table summarizes the components of other income and expense for the years ended december  in thousands of dollars other income and expense interest expense  net of interest income   equity in loss of unconsolidated entities  net   loss on liquidation of investment in unconsolidated entity  unclassified net gains on sales of investment securities  write down of investments   gains on sales of fixed assets  net   other in april  grainger wrote down its investment in other digital businesses and took a pretax charge of million 
this included the loss on the divestiture of grainger s investment in works

grainger acquired its ownership in works 
com  an unrelated third party  on august   when grainger s orderzone 
com business unit was combined with works 
com 
of this pretax charge  million related to the divestiture of works 
com and was reported on the income statement as loss on liquidation of investment in unconsolidated entity 
additionally  a loss of million was included in unclassified net relating to the write down to net realizable value of investments in other digital businesses 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
income taxes income taxes of million in increased as compared with million in grainger s effective tax rates were and in and  respectively 
the rate decrease in as compared with was primarily due to a reduction of losses in unconsolidated entities 
the effective tax rate for was also higher due to the write down of investments which did not result in tax benefits 
partially offsetting these items  which increased the tax rate  was the tax effect of the write off of investment in unconsolidated entity that had tax benefits disproportionate to the write off 
excluding the effect of these items  the effective tax rate was for both and cumulative effect of accounting change effective january   grainger adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
in the second quarter of  grainger completed the initial process of evaluating goodwill for impairment under sfas no 
fair values of reporting units were estimated using a present value method that discounted future cash flows 
when available and as appropriate  comparative market multiples were used to corroborate results of the discounted cash flows 
as a result of the application of the impairment methodology introduced by sfas no 
 grainger recorded a noncash charge to earnings of million million after tax  or per diluted share related to the write down of goodwill of its canadian subsidiary  acklands 
previous accounting rules required a comparison of book value to undiscounted cash flows  whereas new rules require a comparison of book value to discounted cash flows  which are lower 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
financial condition grainger expects its strong working capital position and cash flows from operations to continue  allowing it to fund its operations including growth initiatives  capital expenditures and payment of cash dividends 
cash flow net cash flows from operations of million in  million in and million in continued to improve grainger s financial position and serve as the primary source of funding for capital requirements 
net cash provided by operations in increased million over the change in operating assets and liabilities generated cash of million in  primarily from a decrease in inventory partially offset by a decrease in trade accounts payable 
the reduced inventory resulted from efficiencies realized from the redesigned logistics network  and the decrease in trade accounts payable was due to lower inventory purchases during the fourth quarter 
the majority of the decrease in net cash flows from operations from to was attributable to the inventory infusion to improve service levels and position the branch based distribution segment to gain share in an economic recovery 
net cash flows used in investing activities were million  million and million for  and  respectively 
capital expenditures for additions to property  buildings  equipment and capitalized software were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
additional information regarding capital spending is detailed in the capital expenditures section below 
grainger also funded million in to purchase gempler s  and million in to purchase ben meadows  both of which are part of the lab safety segment 
net cash used in financing activities for  and was million  million and million  respectively 
grainger s funding of treasury stock purchases decreased million in as grainger repurchased  shares in as compared with  shares in treasury stock purchases were  in as of december   approximately million shares of common stock remained available under grainger s repurchase authorization 
dividends paid to shareholders were million in  million in and million in in  more cash from financing activities was required to pay off a higher level of short term debt than in working capital internally generated funds have been the primary source of working capital and for funds used in business expansion  supplemented by debt as circumstances dictated 
in addition  funds were expended for facilities optimization and enhancements  business development and systems and other infrastructure improvements 
working capital was million at december   compared with million at december   and million at december  the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was  and  respectively  at such dates 
the current ratio decreased slightly in due to grainger s cross currency swap debt being reclassified from long term debt to current maturities of long term debt in  which increased current liabilities at a higher rate than current assets 
capital expenditures in each of the past three years  a portion of operating cash flow has been used for additions to property  buildings  equipment and capitalized software as summarized in the following table for the years ended december  in thousands of dollars land  buildings  structures and improvements   furniture  fixtures  machinery and equipment    subtotal    capitalized software    total    in  grainger continued to invest in the logistics network and information technology upgrades  as well as normal  recurring replacement of equipment 
higher capital spending in prior years reflects incremental spending for the logistics network project  which began in capital expenditures are expected to be to million in and include investments for branches  information technology  replacement of the branch phone system and completion of the logistics network 
the level of investment in branches may be influenced by decisions to lease  rather than purchase  the related facilities and or equipment 
grainger believes that cash flows from operations will remain strong and expects to fund the capital investments from existing working capital 
restructuring in  grainger shut down the operations of material logic  with the exception of findmro  and as a result took a pretax charge of million 
grainger has charged million against the reserve  of which million represented cash payments 
grainger has also reduced its estimate of expense by million since as of december   million of the reserve remains for future severance payments and  if not settled early  lease payments 
all expenditures will be finalized in see note to the consolidated financial statements 
debt grainger maintains a debt ratio and liquidity position that provides flexibility in funding working capital needs and long term cash requirements 
in addition to internally generated funds  grainger has various sources of financing available  including commercial paper sales and bank borrowings under lines of credit 
at december   grainger s long term debt was rated aa by standard poor s  a rating it has held since grainger s available lines of credit  as further discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  were million  million and million  as of december   and  respectively 
total debt as a percent of total capitalization was  and as of the same dates 
in september  grainger received net proceeds of million from the issuance of commercial paper 
the proceeds were used to repay outstanding long term debt in the amount of c million 
the long term debt that was repaid with the proceeds of the commercial paper issuance had been designated by grainger as a nonderivative hedge of grainger s net investment in its canadian subsidiary 
grainger entered into a two year cross currency swap on september   which replaced the canadian dollar long term debt as a hedge of the net investment in grainger s canadian subsidiary 
the counterparty to the financial instrument is an investment grade financial institution 
grainger does not expect any loss from nonperformance by this counterparty 
since grainger has the ability to refinance the commercial paper with debt having a longer maturity  and its intent is to keep the debt outstanding for the two year period of the cross currency swap  the commercial paper has been classified as long term debt 
as of december   grainger had not determined if it will renew the cross currency swap when it comes due in as a result  this commercial paper debt has been classified as current maturities of long term debt at december  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
grainger believes any circumstances that would trigger early payment or acceleration with respect to any outstanding debt securities would not have a material impact on its results of operations or financial condition 
holders of industrial revenue bonds may require grainger to redeem certain of the bonds  such as in response to changes in interest rates 
commitments and other contractual obligations at december   grainger s contractual obligations  including estimated payments due by period  are as follows payments due by period total amounts less than more than committed year years years years in thousands of dollars long term debt obligations    capital lease obligations operating lease obligations    purchase obligations uncompleted additions to property  buildings and equipment   commitments to purchase inventory   other purchase obligations    other long term liabilities reflected on the balance sheet total      purchase obligations consist primarily of inventory purchases made in the normal course of business to meet operating needs 
while purchase orders for both inventory purchases and non inventory purchases are generally cancelable without penalty  certain vendor agreements provide for minimum restocking charges based on the nature of the product 
the above table does not include million of accrued employment related benefits costs  of which million is related to grainger s postretirement benefits  because it is not certain when these liabilities will come due 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
see also notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
off balance sheet arrangements grainger does not have any material exposures to off balance sheet arrangements 
grainger does not have any variable interest entities or activities that include non exchange traded contracts accounted for at fair value 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements  in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  requires management to make judgments  estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses in the financial statements 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and other assumptions  which it believes are reasonable 
if actual amounts are ultimately different from these estimates  the revisions are included in grainger s results of operations for the period in which the actual amounts become known 
accounting policies are considered critical when they require management to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made and when different estimates than those management reasonably could have made have a material impact on the presentation of grainger s financial condition  changes in financial condition or results of operations 
note to the consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
the most significant areas involving management judgments and estimates follow 
actual results in these areas could differ materially from management s estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
postretirement healthcare benefits 
postretirement obligation and net periodic cost are dependent on assumptions and estimates used in calculating such amounts 
the assumptions used include  among others  discount rates  assumed rates of return on plan assets and healthcare cost trend rates 
changes in assumptions caused by conditions in equity markets or plan experience  for example could have a material effect on grainger s postretirement benefit obligations and expense  and could affect its results of operations and financial condition 
these changes in assumptions may also affect voluntary decisions to make additional contributions to the trust established for funding the postretirement benefit obligation 
the discount rate assumptions used by management reflect the rates available on high quality fixed income debt instruments as of december  the measurement date  of each year in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions 
a lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and net periodic postretirement benefit costs 
on december   grainger reduced the discount rate used in the calculation of its postretirement plan obligation from to 
grainger estimates that the noted reduction in the expected discount rate will decrease pretax earnings by approximately million 
grainger considers the long term historical actual return on plan assets and the historical performance of the s p to develop its expected long term return on plan assets 
in  grainger increased the expected long term rate of return on plan assets net of tax at from to based on the improved performance of the postretirement trust funds and the historical average long term rates of return 
the increase in the expected return on plan assets in is not anticipated to have a material affect on pretax earnings 
grainger may terminate or modify the postretirement plan at any time  subject to the provisions of the employee retirement income security act of erisa and the internal revenue code  as amended 
in the event the postretirement plan is terminated  all assets of the group benefit trust inure to the benefit of the participants 
the foregoing assumptions are based on the presumption that the postretirement plan will continue 
were the postretirement plan to terminate  different actuarial assumptions and other factors might be applicable 
while grainger has used its best judgment in making assumptions and estimates  and believes such assumptions and estimates used are appropriate  changes to the assumptions may be required in future years as a result of actual experience and new trends and therefore  may affect grainger s retirement plan obligations and future expense 
further  the benefit obligation and net periodic cost may be significantly affected by the medicare prescription drug  improvement  and modernization act of act enacted in december the plan may also need to be amended in order to benefit from the act 
for additional information concerning postretirement healthcare benefits  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
insurance reserves 
grainger retains a significant portion of the risk of certain losses related to workers compensation  general liability and property losses through the utilization of deductibles and self insured retentions 
there are also certain other risk areas for which grainger does not maintain insurance 
grainger is responsible for establishing policies on insurance reserves 
although it relies on outside parties to project future claims costs  it retains control over actuarial assumptions  including loss development factors and claim payment patterns 
grainger performs ongoing reviews of its insured and uninsured risks  which it uses to establish the appropriate reserve level 
the use of assumptions in the analysis leads to fluctuations in required reserves over time 
any change in the required reserve balance is reflected in the current period s results of operations 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
grainger uses several factors to estimate the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable including age of the receivable  the historical ratio of actual write offs to the age of the receivable and publicly available default rates 
the analyses performed also take into consideration economic conditions that may have an impact on a specific industry  group of customers or a specific customer 
in  reserves were increased in anticipation of adverse economic conditions 
the economic downturn that followed did not result in the incremental write offs expected and as a result  the reserve requirement declined 
write offs could be materially different than the reserves provided if economic conditions change or actual results deviate from historical trends or published default rates 
historically  the allowance established for doubtful accounts has been adequate without requiring material adjustment 
inventory reserves 
grainger establishes inventory reserves for shrinkage and excess and obsolete inventory 
provisions for inventory shrinkage are based on historical experience to account for unmeasured usage or loss 
actual inventory shrinkage could be materially different from these estimates affecting grainger s inventory values and cost of merchandise sold 
grainger regularly reviews inventory to evaluate continued demand and identify any obsolete or excess quantities of inventory 
grainger records provisions for the difference between excess and obsolete inventory and its estimated realizable value 
estimated realizable value is based on anticipated future product demand  market conditions and liquidation values 
actual results differing from these projections could have a material effect on grainger s results of operations 
historically  the reserves established for shrinkage and excess and obsolete inventory have been adequate without material adjustments 
other 
other significant accounting policies  not involving the same level of measurement uncertainties as those discussed above  are nevertheless important to an understanding of the financial statements 
policies relating to revenue recognition  depreciation  intangibles  long lived assets  income taxes and warranties require judgments on complex matters that are often subject to multiple external sources of authoritative guidance such as the financial accounting standards board  the securities and exchange commission  etc 
possible changes in estimates or assumptions associated with these policies are not expected to have a material effect on the financial condition or results of operations of grainger 
more information on these additional accounting policies can be found in note to the consolidated financial statements 
inflation and changing prices inflation during the last three years has not had a significant effect on operations 
the predominant use of the lifo method of accounting for inventories and accelerated depreciation methods for financial reporting and income tax purposes result in a substantial recognition of the effects of inflation in the financial statements 
the major impact of inflation is on buildings and improvements  where the gap between historic cost and replacement cost continues for these long lived assets 
the related depreciation expense associated with these assets increases when adjusting for the cumulative effect of inflation 
grainger believes the most positive means to combat inflation and advance the interests of investors lies in the continued application of basic business principles  which include improving productivity  increasing working capital turnover and offering products and services which can command appropriate prices in the marketplace 
forward looking statements this document contains forward looking statements under the federal securities laws 
the forward looking statements relate to grainger s expected future financial results and business plans  strategies and objectives and are not historical facts 
they are often identified by qualifiers such as will  expects  intends  is likely  when completed  anticipates  believes  positioned to  continue  estimates or similar expressions 
there are risks and uncertainties the outcome of which could cause grainger s results to differ materially from what is projected 
factors that may affect forward looking statements include the following higher product costs or other expenses  a major loss of customers  increased competitive pricing pressure on grainger s businesses  failure to develop or implement new technologies or other business strategies  the outcome of pending and future litigation and governmental proceedings  changes in laws and regulations  facilities disruptions or shutdowns  disruptions in transportation services  natural and other catastrophes  unanticipated weather conditions  and other difficulties in achieving or improving margins or financial performance 
trends and projections could also be affected by general industry and market conditions  gross domestic product growth rates  general economic conditions  including interest rate and currency rate fluctuations  global and other conflicts  job creation and employment levels  and other factors 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk grainger is exposed to foreign currency exchange risk related to its transactions  assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
during and  grainger partially hedged the net canadian dollar investment in acklands with either borrowings denominated in canadian dollars or with a cross currency swap agreement 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
for  a uniform strengthening of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies that affect grainger and its joint ventures would have resulted in a million decrease in net income 
comparatively  a uniform strengthening of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies that affect grainger and its joint ventures would have resulted in a million increase in net income in a uniform weakening of the us dollar would have resulted in a million increase in income for  as compared with a decrease in net income of million for this sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in potential changes in sales levels or local currency prices 
grainger does not hold derivatives for trading purposes 
grainger is also exposed to interest rate risk in its debt portfolio
