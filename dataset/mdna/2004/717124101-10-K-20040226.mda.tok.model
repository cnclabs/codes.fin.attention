item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis is provided to increase understanding of  and should be read in conjunction with  the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
in this discussion  the words ppd  we  our and us refer to pharmaceutical product development  inc  together with its subsidiaries where appropriate 
forward looking statements this form k contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws 
these statements relate to future events or our future financial performance 
forward looking statements include statements concerning plans  objectives  goals  strategies  future events or performances  expectations  predictions  assumptions and other statements that are not statements of historical facts 
in some cases  you can identify forward looking statements by terminology such as might  will  should  expect  plan  anticipate  believe  estimate  predict  intend  potential or continue  or the negative of these terms  or other comparable terminology 
these statements are only predictions 
these statements rely on a number of assumptions and estimates which could be inaccurate and which are subject to risks and uncertainties 
actual events or results might differ materially due to a number of factors  including those listed in potential volatility of quarterly operating results and stock price and in part i item business factors that might affect our business or stock price 
although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward looking statements are reasonable  we cannot guarantee future results  levels of activity  performance or achievements 
we generally undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward looking statements for any reason  even if new information becomes available or other events occur in the future 
overview we are a global clinical research organization  or cro  providing drug discovery and development services to pharmaceutical  biotechnology and medical device companies and to government agencies 
most of our revenues and cash are generated from these services 
we have also entered into compound partnering or risk sharing arrangements with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to develop and commercialize potential drug candidates 
because our revenues are dependent on a relatively small number of industries and clients  we closely monitor the market for cro services 
for a discussion of the trends affecting our market  see item business trends affecting the drug discovery and development industry above 
in the first half of  the market for cro services was less robust than in and our new business authorizations for the first two quarters of were lower than we expected 
in response  we refocused our business development and operational efforts 
we believe those efforts  together with a stronger market for cro services in the second half of the year  resulted in higher new authorizations in the third and fourth quarters of although we cannot predict the demand for cro services in  we believe the overall market continues to improve 
to increase authorizations in  we must continue to concentrate upon our business development efforts and to consistently provide timely  high quality services to our clients 
we believe there are several specific opportunities for growth in we currently conduct a significant amount of government sponsored research  and plan to continue our efforts to win new opportunities in this market 
we have also had an increase in demand for our phase i services and we plan to expand our phase i clinic in austin  texas 
we also believe the demand for our post marketing development services will continue to grow and we will also seek to expand our medical device offerings with the acquisition of eminent research systems in finally  we believe that we can increase the client base and service offerings for our laboratories 
we review various metrics  including period to period growth in backlog  new authorizations  revenue  margins and earnings  to evaluate our financial performance 
in  although cancellation rates were approximately higher than  our new authorizations exceeded billion and backlog grew from million on december  to  million at the end of for a detailed discussion of our revenue  margins  earnings and other financial results for  see results of operations year ended december  versus year ended december  below 

table of contents our compound partnering arrangements allow us to leverage our resources and global drug development expertise to create new opportunities for growth and to share the risks and potential rewards of drug development with our collaborative partners 
in  in addition to existing collaborations with alza and bayer  we entered into new collaborations with syrrx and chemokine therapeutics 
for a discussion of these compound partnering arrangements  see item business our services our discovery sciences group compound partnering programs above 
in  we expect to advance the development of the potential drug candidates associated with our existing compound partnering arrangements  and we should increase the number of candidates in various stages of human trials by the end of year 
as a result of this strategy  we expect to incur significant r d expense in in connection with these efforts 
furthermore  in addition to progressing our existing collaborations  we will continue to evaluate other opportunities for investment in this arena that we believe will help us achieve our mid to long term growth objectives 
acquisitions in  we completed four acquisitions 
for details regarding these acquisitions  see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in july  ppd acquired eminent research systems  a clinical research organization specializing in medical device development  and clinsights  a company affiliated with eminent through common ownership that provides a range of post market services to medical device and related pharmaceutical companies and operates proprietary web sites for the dissemination of medical information  online research and product marketing 
eminent and clinsights are now part of the development segment of ppd 
the results of operations are included in our consolidated condensed results of operations as of and since july   the effective date of the acquisitions 
ppd acquired eminent and clinsights for total consideration of million in cash 
we accounted for all of the acquisitions in and under the purchase method 
the purchase price for these acquisitions was allocated based on the estimated fair values of the assets and liabilities 
accordingly  the estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed were included in our condensed consolidated balance sheet as of the effective date of the acquisitions 
the results of operations are included in our condensed consolidated results of operations as of and since the effective dates of the acquisitions 
for further details regarding these acquisitions  see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
investments in april  the company purchased million shares of chemokine therapeutics series a convertible preferred stock for million 
in september  the company purchased million shares of surromed series f convertible preferred stock in exchange for million in cash and million in tangible assets and intellectual property 
in november  the company purchased million shares of syrrx  series f convertible preferred stock for million 
as a result of management s quarterly evaluations of our equity investments  during the company recorded charges to earnings for other than temporary declines in the fair market value of its investments in biodelivery sciences international of million  spotlight health of million  slil biomedical of million and signature bioscience formerly primecyte of million 
see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion of these investments 
new business authorizations and backlog we record new business authorizations  or sales of the company s services  when we receive a letter of intent  verbal commitment or when a contract is awarded 
authorizations can vary significantly from quarter to quarter  and contracts can have terms ranging from several months to several years 
we recognize revenue on these authorizations as services are performed 
our new authorizations for the years ended december   and were million   million and  million  respectively 
our backlog consists of anticipated net revenues from letters of intent  verbal commitments and contracts that either have not started but are anticipated to begin in the near future or are in process and have not been completed 
amounts included in backlog represent future revenues and exclude revenues that have been recognized previously in 
table of contents our statement of operations 
once contracted work begins  net revenue is recognized over the life of the contract 
our ending backlog for the years ended december   and was million  million and  million  respectively 
results of operations revenue recognition we recognize revenues from fixed price contracts on a proportional performance basis in our development group 
to measure performance on a given date  we compare direct costs incurred as of that date to estimated total contract direct costs 
we believe this is the best indicator of the performance of the contractual obligations because the costs relate to the amount of labor incurred to perform the service 
for time and materials contracts  we recognize revenues as hours are incurred  multiplied by the applicable billable rate in both our development group and discovery sciences group 
for our phase i and laboratory businesses  we recognize revenues from unitized contracts as subjects or samples are tested  multiplied by the applicable unit price 
in connection with the management of multi site clinical trials  we pay on behalf of our customers fees to investigators and test subjects  and other out of pocket costs for items such as travel  printing  meetings  and couriers 
our clients reimburse us for these costs 
as required by eitf  amounts paid by us as a principal for out of pocket costs are included in direct costs as reimbursable out of pocket expenses and the reimbursements we receive as a principal are reported as reimbursed out of pocket revenues 
amounts paid by us as an agent for out of pocket costs are combined with the corresponding reimbursements  or revenues  we receive as an agent in the statement of operations 
during the twelve months ended december   and  fees paid to investigators and other fees that ppd received as an agent and the associated reimbursements were approximately  and million  respectively 
most of the contracts for our development group can be terminated by our clients either immediately or after a specified period following notice by the client 
these contracts typically require payment to us of expenses to wind down a study  payment to us of fees earned to date  and in some cases  a termination fee or some portion of the fees or profit that we could have earned under the contract if it had not been terminated early 
discovery sciences group revenues also include nonrefundable technology license fees and milestone payments 
the non refundable license fees are generally up front payments for the initial license of and access to our technology 
for nonrefundable license fees received at the initiation of license agreements for which we have an ongoing research and development commitment  we defer these fees and recognize them ratably over the period of the related research and development 
for nonrefundable license fees received under license agreements where our continued performance of future research and development services is not required  we recognize revenue upon delivery of the technology 
in addition to license fees  our discovery sciences group also generates revenue from time to time in the form of milestone payments 
milestone payments are only received and recognized as revenues if the specified milestone is achieved and accepted by the customer and continued performance of future research and development services related to that milestone are not required 
although these payments are typically lower than up front license fees  these payments can be significant because they are triggered as a result of achieving specified scientific milestones 
we receive milestone payments in connection with licensing compounds 
recording of expenses we record our operating expenses among the following categories direct costs  research and development  selling  general and administrative  depreciation  amortization  gain on sale of assets  and restructuring charges 

table of contents direct costs consist of appropriate amounts necessary to carry out the revenue and earnings process  and include direct labor and related benefit charges  other costs directly related to contracts  an allocation of facility and information technology costs  and reimbursable out of pocket expenses 
direct costs  as a percentage of net revenues  tend to and are expected to fluctuate from one period to another as a result of changes in labor utilization and the mix of service offerings involved in the hundreds of studies conducted during any period of time 
research and development  or r d  expenses consist primarily of patent expenses  labor and related benefit charges associated with personnel performing internal research and development work  supplies associated with this work  and an allocation of facility and information technology costs 
selling  general and administrative  or sg a  expenses consist primarily of administrative payroll and related benefit charges  sales  advertising and promotional expenses  recruiting and relocation expenses  administrative travel  an allocation of facility and information technology costs  and costs related to operational employees performing administrative tasks 
depreciation expenses consist of depreciation costs recorded on a straight line method  based on estimated useful lives of to years for buildings  five years for laboratory equipment  two to three years for software  three to five years for computers and related equipment  and five to ten years for furniture and equipment  except for our airplane  which we are depreciating over years 
leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of the respective lives of the leases or the useful lives of the improvements 
property under capital leases is depreciated over the life of the lease or the service life  whichever is shorter 
amortization expenses consist of amortization costs recorded on intangible assets on a straight line method over the life of the intangible assets 
the excess of the purchase price of a business acquired over the fair value of net tangible assets  identifiable intangible assets and acquired in process research and development costs at the date of the acquisition has been assigned to goodwill 
goodwill was being amortized over periods of to years prior to january  we adopted sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets as of january  and no longer amortize goodwill 
in july  ppd announced the restructuring of its discovery sciences segment to focus on its other discovery sciences businesses 
as a part of this restructuring  ppd purchased million shares of surromed series f convertible preferred stock in exchange for million in cash and million in certain tangible assets and intellectual property from our menlo park operations 
the value of the tangible assets and intellectual property was based on an independent appraisal 
ppd recorded a gain on sale of assets of million as a result of this transaction 
the majority of the remaining menlo park tangible assets were transferred to the cro phase ii through iv division and the remaining discovery sciences operations 
ppd also entered into agreements with surromed to purchase biomarker discovery services from surromed for million over a period of four years and to serve as a non exclusive representative to market and sell additional surromed biomarker discovery services 
in connection with this restructuring  ppd consolidated its discovery sciences operations into its morrisville  north carolina and middleton  wisconsin facilities  and discontinued offering functional genomics services in menlo park  california 
ppd recorded a charge to earnings in the third quarter of of million for this restructuring 
restructuring charges included million for one time termination benefits  million for facility charges and million for other related charges 
all restructuring charges were incurred and paid during the third quarter of

the development group s operations generated net revenue of million  which accounted for of total net revenue for the increase in the development group s net revenue was primarily attributable to an increase in the amount of global cro phase ii through iv services we provided in as compared to the increase in global cro phase ii through iv revenue was due primarily to maintaining our market share in the pharmaceutical market and increasing our share of the biotechnology market 
net revenue for the development group also increased by approximately million due to the effect of the weakening of the us dollar relative to the euro and the british pound during the discovery sciences group generated net revenue of million in  a decrease of million from the decrease in the discovery sciences net revenue was mainly attributable to a reduction in net revenue 
table of contents from functional genomics services and chemistry services of million and million  respectively  due to fewer contracts for these services in we discontinued functional genomics and chemistry services in the third quarter of and the first quarter of  respectively 
the decreases in discovery sciences net revenue were partially offset by a milestone payment of million that we earned under our sublicense agreement with alza as a result of the initiation of phase iii clinical trials of dapoxetine  and by an increase of million in net revenue associated with our preclinical oncology operation  which we acquired in april as announced in early january  we amended our sublicense agreement with alza 
under the terms of the amendment  alza has made a cash payment to us of million in the first quarter of we do not expect to receive any additional milestone payments under this agreement in total direct costs increased to million in development group direct costs increased to million in this increase resulted primarily from increased personnel costs of million due to hiring additional employees in our global cro phase ii through iv division and to annual salary increases 
development group direct costs increased as a percentage of related net revenue from in to in direct costs  as a percentage of net revenues  have and are expected to fluctuate from one period to another as a result of changes in labor utilization and the mix of service offerings involved in the hundreds of studies conducted during any period of time 
discovery sciences direct costs decreased to million in this decrease resulted from a decline in direct costs of million related to our functional genomics services and chemistry services due in each case to fewer contracts being performed in these areas in we will not be generating any direct costs from functional genomics or chemistry services in the future because we discontinued offering these services in third quarter of and first quarter of  respectively 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in direct costs associated with sublicensing dapoxetine of million and the direct costs of million associated with our preclinical oncology operations  which we acquired in april r d expenses increased to million in in the fourth quarter of  the company acquired from eli lilly company the patents for the compound dapoxetine for development in the field of genitourinary disorders 
ppd paid lilly million in cash and agreed to pay lilly a royalty of on annual sales of dapoxetine  if any  in excess of million 
the million payment to lilly was recorded to research and development expenses because dapoxetine is still in development and has not been approved for sale in any country 
excluding that payment  r d expenses decreased million in compared to due to the closing of our functional genomics operations 
we expect to incur significant r d expenses in in connection with our existing compound partnering arrangements 
sg a expenses increased to million in the increase was primarily attributable to additional personnel costs of million attributable to administrative tasks which are not directly related to client projects  such as training costs 
this was partially offset by a decrease in recruitment agency fees of million 
as a percentage of net revenue  sg a expenses decreased to in from for this decrease is primarily attributable to the increase in net revenue and leveraging our sg a expenses 
depreciation expense increased to million in the increase was related to the depreciation of the property and equipment we acquired to accommodate our growth 
capital expenditures were million in capital expenditures primarily included additional spending in the development group to enhance and expand our information technology capacity 
we expect our capital expenditures to be approximately to million in  with the majority of the anticipated spending related to continued information technology enhancement and expansion 
amortization expenses in totaled million 
the million increase in amortization expense over was due to the amortization expense for a license agreement in the discovery sciences group that was placed into service during operating income decreased to million in as a percentage of net revenue  operating income decreased to of net revenue in from in operating income in includes the million payment to lilly  a million gain on the sale of assets  and a million charge related to the restructuring of the discovery sciences group 
the aggregate impact of these items was a million reduction in operating income for operating income was also negatively impacted by approximately million due to the effect of the 
table of contents weakening of the us dollar relative to the euro and the british pound  partially offset by the strengthening of the us dollar relative to the brazilian real during although these currency movements increased net revenue in the aggregate  the negative impact on operating income is attributable to dollar denominated contracts for services rendered in countries other than the united states 
in these cases  revenue is not impacted by the weakening of the us dollar  but the costs associated with performing these contracts  which are paid in local currency  are negatively impacted when translated to the us dollar 
during  we recorded charges to earnings for other than temporary declines in the fair market value of our investments in slil biomedical of million  spotlight health of million  signature bioscience formerly primecyte of million and biodelivery sciences of million 
we determined that slil and primecyte were impaired primarily as a result of the market condition of their respective industries  historical and projected performance and expected cash needs of the individual companies 
we recorded the write down of our investment in spotlight health primarily based on its historical and projected financial performance and issuance of shares to a new investor at a lower valuation 
biodelivery sciences is a publicly traded company  so we based its write down on the closing price of its securities as of december  although these securities had traded above cost for short periods of time throughout  we believe that due to the uncertainty of biodelivery sciences strategic direction  the decline in value as of each of these periods was other than temporary and therefore we recorded the charges to earnings 
prior to the third quarter of  market fluctuations were recorded through our equity accounts 
in  we recorded charges to earnings for other than temporary declines in the fair market value of our investment in gallery systems of million and our investment in intrabiotics pharmaceuticals of approximately million 
we also recorded a million write down of the carrying value of our investment in dna sciences for an other than temporary decline in value in at the time of the write down  we deemed our investment in dna sciences to be impaired as a result of historical and projected performance  cash needs and an independent valuation of the market value of dna sciences 
dna sciences subsequently filed bankruptcy and we no longer have any ownership interest in that entity 
our provision for income taxes decreased to million in this decrease in income tax expense was due to the impact on taxable income of acquiring the patents for the compound dapoxetine 
the resulting effective tax rate of in was due to the change in the geographic distribution of our pretax earnings among locations with varying tax rates 
during  we recorded impairments of equity investments of million 
because we were uncertain if we would use the deduction related to the impairments prior to its expiration  we recorded a valuation allowance of million in  thus providing a tax benefit of only million in the provision for income taxes in that year

table of contents liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents on hand 
our expected primary cash needs on both a short and long term basis are for capital expenditures  expansion of services  possible acquisitions  geographic expansion  working capital and other general corporate purposes 
we have historically funded our operations and growth  including acquisitions  with cash flow from operations  borrowings and sales of our stock 
we are exposed to changes in interest rates on cash equivalents and amounts outstanding under notes payable 
our cash and cash equivalents are invested in financial instruments that are rated a or better by standard poor s or moody s and earn interest at market rates 
in  our operating activities provided million in cash as compared to million last year 
the decrease in cash flow from operations is primarily due to a million increase in receivables due to increased revenue  an increase of million in deferred income taxes primarily related to the million payment to lilly to acquire the patents for the compound dapoxetine and a million decrease in impairments of investments for in  net income of million  impairment of equity investments of million  and depreciation and amortization of million were partially offset by a net increase of million in net operating assets and liabilities  the increase of million in deferred income taxes  and the gain on sale of assets of million 
in  our investing activities used million in cash 
the net cash used for acquisitions of million  purchases of investments of million and capital expenditures of million were partially offset by million received from the repayment of notes receivable 
we expect our capital expenditures to be approximately to million in  with the majority of the anticipated spending related to continued information technology enhancement and expansion 
in  our financing activities provided million in cash  as net proceeds from stock option exercises and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan totaling million were partially offset by million in repayments of long term debt and million in repayments of capital lease obligations 
working capital as of december  was million  compared to million at december  the decrease in working capital was due primarily to the decrease in cash of million which was partially offset by the increase in accounts receivable and unbilled services  net  of million  increase in unearned income of million and the increase in investigator advances of million 
the number of days revenue outstanding in accounts receivable and unbilled services  net of unearned income  also known as dso  were and days as of december  and december   respectively 
dso is calculated by dividing accounts receivable and unbilled services less unearned income by average daily gross revenue for the period presented 
over the past three years  our year to date dso has fluctuated between days and days 
we expect dso will fluctuate in the future depending on the mix of contracts performed within a quarter  the level of investigator advances and unearned income and our success in collecting receivables 
we maintain a defined benefit pension plan for certain employees and former employees in the united kingdom 
this pension plan was closed to new participants as of december  the projected benefit obligation for the benefit plan at december  and december   as determined in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  was million and million  respectively  and the value of the plan assets was million and million  respectively 
as a result  the plan was under funded by million in and by million in  net of december contributions of million and million for and  respectively 
it is likely that the amount of our contributions to the plan will increase in future years 
the amount of contributions to the plan for the years ended december  and were million and million  respectively 
in addition  we expect the pension cost to be recognized in the financial statements will increase from the million in to approximately million in the expense to be recognized in future periods could continue to increase  depending upon the change in fair market value of the plan assets and change in the projected benefit obligation 

table of contents a decrease in the market value of plan assets and or declines in interest rates are likely to cause the amount of the under funded status to increase 
after completion of the actuarial valuations in we could be required to record an additional reduction to shareholders equity 
we recorded a reduction to shareholders equity in and of million and million  respectively 
moreover  given the impact that the discount rate and stock market performance have on the projected benefit obligation and market value of plan assets  future changes in either one of these may significantly reduce or increase the amount of our pension plan under funding 
however  we do not believe the under funded status of the pension plan will materially affect our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
in july  we renewed our revolving credit facility for million with bank of america  n 
a 
indebtedness under the facility is unsecured and subject to traditional covenants relating to financial ratios and restrictions on investments without prior approval 
borrowings under this credit facility are available to provide working capital and for general corporate purposes 
as of december   there was no amount outstanding under this credit facility 
however  the aggregate amount we are able to borrow has been reduced by million due to outstanding letters of credit issued under this facility 
this credit facility is currently scheduled to expire in june  at which time any outstanding balance would be due 
we expect to renew this credit facility prior to its expiration 
in the past  we maintained a second revolving credit facility with wachovia bank  na on substantially similar terms and conditions 
however  based on our cash balance and historical ability to generate cash from operations  we elected not to renew our facility with wachovia  and it expired on june  in april  we made an investment in spotlight health 
in january  we entered into an agreement with spotlight health and wachovia to guarantee a million revolving line of credit provided to spotlight health by wachovia 
indebtedness under the line was unsecured and subject to traditional covenants relating to financial ratios 
this credit facility expired on june  in july  spotlight health replaced this credit facility with a new million revolving line of credit from bank of america 
the new line of credit is on terms substantially similar to the prior line of credit 
we continue to guarantee spotlight s obligations under the new credit facility  which is scheduled to expire on june   at which time any outstanding balance would be due 
as of december   spotlight health had million outstanding under this credit facility 
in accordance with the requirements of fasb statement no 
 accounting for contingencies  and as clarified by fasb interpretation no 
 we have recorded a liability in the amount of million for the fair value of the obligation we have assumed under this guarantee 
we review the financial statements of spotlight health on a quarterly basis to determine if they have sufficient financial resources to continue operations 
future events and circumstances might adversely affect spotlight health s financial condition and spotlight health might not be in the position to repay the facility  in which case bank of america may attempt to collect on our guarantee of this facility 
in september  ppd entered into agreements with surromed to purchase biomarker discovery services from surromed for million  million  million and million during the years ended december    and  respectively  and to serve as a non exclusive representative to market and sell additional surromed biomarker discovery services 
in november  we entered into a collaboration agreement with syrrx to jointly develop and commercialize syrrx designed human dipeptidyl peptidase iv  or dp  inhibitors as drug products for the treatment of type diabetes and other major human diseases 
under the terms of the agreement ppd will provide preclinical and clinical development resources and expertise for the collaboration  and will fund the majority of preclinical and clinical studies through phase iib development of selected dp inhibitors 
ppd and syrrx have agreed to share equally the costs of phase iii development 
in addition  ppd will make milestone payments to syrrx upon the occurrence of certain clinical and regulatory events 
in the event of approval to market a drug product  ppd and syrrx will share equally the profits from drug sales 
in april  we made an equity investment in chemokine therapeutics to continue development of a proprietary peptide that might be useful as a blood recovery therapeutic agent 
we anticipate this peptide will enter clinical trials in in connection with this investment  chemokine granted ppd an exclusive option to license the peptide for a one time license fee of million 
if we choose to exercise this option  we will be obligated to pay the costs for future development work 
chemokine also granted ppd the right to first negotiate a license to other chemokine peptides 

table of contents in november  we became a limited partner in a 
m 
pappas life science ventures iii  lp  a venture capital fund 
the pappas fund was established for the purpose of making investments in equity securities of privately held companies in the life sciences  healthcare or technology industries 
under the terms of the limited partnership agreement  we committed to invest up to an aggregate of million in the pappas fund 
each capital call cannot exceed of our aggregate capital commitment and no more than one third of our commitment can be called prior to may and no more than two thirds prior to may as such  we anticipate that our aggregate investment will be made through a series of future capital calls over the next several years 
no capital calls have been made to date and our capital commitment will expire in may under most of our agreements for development group services  we agree to indemnify and defend the sponsor against third party claims based on our negligence or willful misconduct 
any successful claims could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and future prospects 
we expect to continue expanding our operations through internal growth and strategic acquisitions and investments 
we expect these activities will be funded from existing cash  cash flow from operations and  if necessary or appropriate  borrowings under our existing or future credit facilities 
we believe that these sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund our operations for the foreseeable future  but offer no assurances 
from time to time  we evaluate potential acquisitions  investments and other growth opportunities  which might require additional external financing  and we might seek funds from public or private issuances of equity or debt securities 
in particular  our sources of liquidity could be affected by our dependence on a small number of industries and clients  compliance with regulations  international risks  personal injury  environmental or intellectual property claims  as well as other factors described under item business factors that might affect our business or stock price  in this item under the subheadings potential volatility of quarterly operating results and stock price and critical accounting policies and estimates  and under item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk contractual obligations future minimum payments for all contractual obligations for years subsequent to december  are as follows in thousands and thereafter total long term debt  including interest payments services purchase commitments capital leases  including interest payments operating leases less sublease income total as noted above  we became a limited partner in a venture capital fund in november under the terms of the limited partnership agreement  the company committed to invest up to an aggregate of million in the fund 
the company anticipates that its aggregate investment will be made through a series of future capital calls over the next several years 
also  in november  we entered into a collaboration agreement with syrrx 
under the terms of the agreement  ppd will fund the majority of preclinical and clinical development costs through phase iib development and will share phase iii costs equally with syrrx 
the company anticipates that it will be funding this work over the next several years and beyond if the development program is successful 
in addition  in connection with our investment in chemokine  chemokine granted ppd an exclusive option to license a proprietary peptide for million 
if we choose to exercise this option  we will be obligated to pay the costs for future development work 
we also have a long term liability on our balance sheet regarding the underfunding of our uk pension plan for million 
the company does not know when or if this will be funded since this liability will change based on the performance of the investments of the plan

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe that the following are some of the more critical judgment areas in the application of our accounting policies that affect our financial condition and results of operations 
we have discussed the application of these critical accounting policies with our finance audit committee 
revenue recognition the majority of our revenues are recorded from fixed price contracts on a proportional performance basis 
to measure performance  we compare direct costs incurred to estimated total contract direct costs 
we believe this is the best indicator of the performance of the contract obligations because the costs relate to the amount of labor hours incurred to perform the service 
direct costs are primarily comprised of labor overhead related to the delivery of services 
each month we accumulate costs on each project and compare them to the total current estimated costs to determine the percentage of completion 
we then multiply this percentage by the contract value to determine the amount of revenue that can be recognized 
each month we review the total current estimated costs on each project to determine if these estimates are still accurate and  if necessary  we adjust the total estimated costs for each project 
as the work progresses  original estimates might be deemed incorrect due to  among other things  revisions in the scope of work or patient enrollment rate  and a contract modification might be negotiated with the customer to cover additional costs 
if not  we bear the risk of cost overruns 
in the past  we have had to commit unanticipated resources to complete projects  resulting in lower gross margins on those projects 
we might experience similar situations in the future 
should our estimated costs on fixed price contracts prove to be low  future margins could be reduced  absent our ability to negotiate a contract modification 
we accumulate information on each project to refine our bidding process 
historically  the majority of our estimates and assumptions have been materially correct  but these estimates might not continue to be accurate in the future 
in our discovery science group  we generate revenue from time to time in the form of milestone payments 
milestone payments are only received and recognized as revenues if the specified milestone is achieved and accepted by the customer and continued performance of future research and development services related to that milestone are not required 
although these payments are typically lower than up front license fees  these payments can be significant because they are triggered as a result of achieving specified scientific milestones 
future potential milestone payments under various discovery contracts might never be received if the milestones are not achieved 
allowance for doubtful accounts included in accounts receivable and unbilled services  net on our consolidated balance sheets is an allowance for doubtful accounts 
generally  before we do business with a new client  we perform a credit check 
we also review our accounts receivable aging on a monthly basis to determine if any receivables will potentially be uncollectible 
the reserve includes the specific uncollectible accounts and an estimate of losses based on historical loss experience 
after all attempts to collect the receivable have failed  the receivable is written off against the allowance 
based on the information available to us  we believe our allowance for doubtful accounts as of december  was adequate to cover uncollectible balances 
however  actual write offs might exceed the recorded reserve 
investments most of our investments consist of equity investments in private entities for which fair values are not readily determinable 
therefore  we record these investments under the cost method of accounting 
many of our investments are in relatively early stage life sciences or biotechnology companies that do not have established products or proven technologies and some do not have any material revenue 
therefore  these investments might be worth less than we paid for them  and they are particularly subject to write down for impairment 
we assess our investment portfolio on a quarterly basis to determine whether declines in the market value of these securities are other than temporary 
this 
table of contents quarterly review includes an evaluation of  among other things  the market condition of the overall industry of the investee  historical and projected financial performance  expected cash needs and recent funding events 
given the nature of these companies  our assessments of value are highly subjective 
tax valuation allowance based on estimates of future taxable profits and losses in certain foreign tax jurisdictions  we determined that a valuation allowance of million was required for specific foreign tax loss carryforwards as of december  if these estimates prove inaccurate  a change in the valuation allowance  up or down  could be required in the future 
we also recorded a total valuation allowance of million related to the impairment of certain equity investments 
the valuation was determined based on the uncertainty regarding our ability to utilize some of the potential capital losses generated during the loss carryforward period 
a change in any of the investees financial health and or stock price  or a change in our ability to utilize a potential capital loss  could require a change of valuation allowance in the future 
long lived assets we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset might not be recoverable 
if indicators of impairment are present  we would evaluate the carrying value of property and equipment in relation to estimates of future undiscounted cash flows 
these undiscounted cash flows and fair values are based on judgments and assumptions 
additionally  we test goodwill for impairment on at least an annual basis by comparing the underlying reporting units goodwill to their estimated fair value 
these tests for impairment of goodwill involve the use of estimates related to the fair market value of the reporting unit with which the goodwill is associated  and are inherently subjective 
recently issued accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  or sfas no

fin clarifies the requirements of fasb statement no 
 accounting for contingencies  relating to the guarantor s accounting for  and disclosure of  the issuance of certain types of guarantees 
fin requires that upon issuance of a guarantee  the guarantor  must recognize a liability for the fair value of the obligation it assumes under that guarantee 
the disclosure provisions of fin are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods that end after december  fin s provisions for initial recognition and measurement should be applied on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december   irrespective of the guarantor s fiscal year end 
the guarantor s previous accounting for guarantees that were issued before the date of fin s initial application may not be revised or restated to reflect the effect of the recognition and measurement provisions of fin the adoption of this statement did not have an impact on our financial statements  other than the guarantee discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements

 consolidation of variable interest entities deferring the effective date for applying the provisions of fin for public entities interests in variable interest entities or potential variable interest entities created before february  until financial statements of interim or annual periods that end after december  in december  the fasb issued fin revised december  consolidation of variable interest entities 
this revised interpretation is effective for all entities no later than the end of the first reporting period that ends after march  we have no investment in or contractual relationship or other business relationship with a variable interest entity and therefore the adoption of this interpretation will not have any impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
however  if we enter into any such arrangement with a variable interest entity in the future or an entity with which we have a relationship is reconsidered based on guidance in the revised interpretation to be a variable interest entity  our consolidated financial position or results of operations might be impacted 
in november  during discussions on eitf issue  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments  the eitf reached a consensus which requires certain quantitative and qualitative disclosures for debt and marketable equity securities classified as available for sale or held to maturity under statements and that are impaired at the balance sheet date but for which an other than temporary impairment has not been recognized 
the consensus on quantitative and qualitative disclosures is effective for fiscal years ending after december  and comparative information for earlier periods presented is not required 
at december   we did not have any investments with unrealized losses and thus the adoption of this consensus did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
taxes because we conduct operations on a global basis  our effective tax rate has and will continue to depend upon the geographic distribution of our pretax earnings among locations with varying tax rates 
our profits are also impacted by changes in the tax rates of the various taxing jurisdictions 
in particular  as the geographic mix of our pre tax earnings among various tax jurisdictions changes  our effective tax rate might vary from period to period 
inflation our long term contracts  those in excess of one year  generally include an inflation or cost of living adjustment for the portion of the services to be performed beyond one year from the contract date 
as a result  we expect that inflation generally will not have a material adverse effect on our operations or financial condition 
potential liability and insurance drug development services involve the testing of new drugs on human volunteers pursuant to a study protocol 
this testing exposes us to the risk of liability for personal injury or death to patients resulting from  among other things  possible unforeseen adverse side effects or improper administration of the new drug 
many of these patients are already seriously ill and are at risk of further illness or death 
we attempt to manage our risk of liability for personal injury or death to patients from administration of products under study through measures such as stringent operating 
table of contents procedures  contractual indemnification provisions with clients and insurance 
we monitor our clinical trials in compliance with government regulations and guidelines 
we have adopted global standard operating procedures intended to satisfy regulatory requirements in the united states and in many foreign countries and serve as a tool for controlling and enhancing the quality of our clinical trials 
the contractual indemnifications generally do not protect us against our own actions  such as gross negligence 
we currently maintain professional liability insurance coverage with limits we believe are adequate and appropriate 
potential volatility of quarterly operating results and stock price our quarterly and annual operating results have fluctuated in the past  and we expect that they will continue to fluctuate in the future 
factors that could cause these fluctuations to occur include our dependence on a small number of industries and clients  the timing of the initiation  progress or cancellation of significant projects  the mix of products and services sold in a particular period  our need to recruit and retain experienced personnel  rapid technological change and the timing and amount of start up costs incurred in connection with the introduction of new products and services  intellectual property risks  impairment of investments or intangible assets  the timing of our discovery sciences group milestone payments or other revenue  the timing of the opening of new offices  the timing of other internal expansion costs  the timing and amount of costs associated with integrating acquisitions  the timing and amount of costs associated with r d and compound collaborations  and exchange rate fluctuations between periods 
delays and terminations of trials are often the result of actions taken by our customers or regulatory authorities and are not typically within our control 
because a large percentage of our operating costs are relatively fixed while revenue is subject to fluctuation  variations in the timing and progress of large contracts can materially affect our quarterly operating results 
we believe that comparisons of our quarterly financial results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
fluctuations in quarterly results or other factors beyond our control could affect the market price of our common stock 
these factors include changes in earnings estimates by analysts  market conditions in our industry  announcements by competitors  changes in pharmaceutical  biotechnology and medical device industries  general economic conditions  and differences in assumptions used as compared to actual results 
any effect on our common stock could be unrelated to our longer term operating performance 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to foreign currency risk by virtue of our international operations 
approximately  and of our net revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively  were derived from operations outside the united states 
funds generated by each subsidiary are reinvested in the country where they are earned 
our operations in the united kingdom generated more than of our net revenue from international operations during accordingly  we are exposed to adverse movements in the pound sterling and other foreign currencies 
until  the united kingdom has historically had a relatively stable currency compared to our functional currency  the us dollar 
the vast majority of our contracts are entered into by our united states or united kingdom subsidiaries 
the contracts entered into by the united states subsidiaries are almost always denominated in us dollars 
contracts entered into by our united kingdom subsidiaries are generally denominated in pounds sterling  us dollars or euros 
in the past  our mix of contracts and currencies has mitigated the effect of foreign currency fluctuations 
in  with the significant weakening of the us dollar to the euro and the pound sterling  our translation losses increased over 
table of contents the potential loss resulting from a hypothetical weakening of the us dollar relative to the pound sterling of is approximately million for a twelve month period based on revenues and costs related to the uk as a result  in january  we began engaging in hedging activities in an effort to manage our potential foreign exchange exposure 
we do have some currency risk resulting from the passage of time between the invoicing of customers under contracts and the ultimate collection of customer payments against those invoices 
if a contract is denominated in a currency other than the subsidiary s local currency  we recognize a receivable at the time of invoicing for the local currency equivalent of the foreign currency invoice amount 
changes in exchange rates from the time the invoice is prepared and payment from the customer is received will result in our receiving either more or less in local currency than the local currency equivalent of the invoice amount at the time the invoice was prepared and the receivable established 
we recognize this difference as a foreign currency transaction gain or loss  as applicable  and report it in other income  net 
if exchange rates were to change by in the future  we do not expect this to have a material effect on our financial statements 
changes in exchange rates between the applicable foreign currency and the us dollar will affect the translation of foreign subsidiaries financial results into us dollars for purposes of reporting our consolidated financial results 
the process by which each foreign subsidiary s financial results are translated to us dollars is as follows income statement accounts are translated at average exchange rates for the period  balance sheet assets and liability accounts are translated at end of period exchange rates  and equity accounts are translated at historical exchange rates 
translation of the balance sheet in this manner affects the shareholders equity account  referred to as the cumulative translation adjustment account 
this account exists only in the foreign subsidiary s us dollar balance sheet and is necessary to keep the foreign balance sheet  stated in us dollars  in balance 
translation adjustments are reported with accumulated other comprehensive income loss as a separate component of shareholders equity 
to date  cumulative translation adjustments have not been material to our consolidated financial position 
however  future translation adjustments could materially and adversely affect our financial position 
currently  there are no material exchange controls on the payment of dividends or otherwise restricting the transfer of funds out of or from within any country in which we conduct operations 
although we perform services for clients located in a number of foreign jurisdictions  to date  we have not experienced any difficulties in receiving funds remitted from foreign countries 
however  if any of these jurisdictions imposed or modified existing exchange control restrictions  the restrictions could have an adverse effect on our financial condition 
we are exposed to changes in interest rates on our cash equivalents and amounts outstanding under notes payable and lines of credit 
we invest our cash and cash equivalents in financial instruments with interest rates based on financial market conditions 
if interest rates were to increase or decrease by in the future  we do not expect this would have a material effect on our financial statements
