item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
this section contains forward looking statements based on current management expectations 
meaningful factors which could cause future results to differ materially from such expectations include  without limitation  the following i results from current and planned clinical trials  ii scientific data collected on our technologies currently in preclinical research and development  iii decisions made by the fda or other regulatory bodies with respect to the initiation of human clinical trials  iv decisions made by the fda or other regulatory bodies with respect to approval and commercial sale of any of our proposed products  v the commercial acceptance of any products approved for sale and our ability to manufacture  distribute and sell for a profit any products approved for sale  vi our ability to obtain the necessary patents and proprietary rights to effectively protect our technologies  vii the outcome of any collaborations or alliances entered into by us in the future with pharmaceutical or other biotechnology companies  viii dependence on key personnel  and ix maintaining nasdaq listing requirements 
overview description of company we are a biotechnology company engaged in the research and development of biopharmaceutical products for the diagnosis and treatment of central nervous system  or cns  and diseases and for the treatment of some cancers 
at december   we are considered a development stage enterprise as defined in statement of financial accounting standards no 
as of december   we have experienced total net losses since inception of approximately million 
for the foreseeable future  we expect to experience continuing operating losses and negative cash flows as management executes our current business plan 
we believe that the cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities available at december  will provide sufficient working capital to meet our anticipated expenditures for at least the next twelve months 
we will need to raise additional capital in the future through collaboration agreements with other pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies  debt financing and equity offerings 
there can be no assurance  however  that we will be successful or that additional funds will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
we have  in principal of notes that become due in june we have set aside approximately million in restricted cash and marketable securities to repay the notes and the future interest on the notes in accordance with the terms of our series e stock agreements 
however  there can be no assurance that we will not need to raise additional capital before june in order to maintain enough restricted cash and marketable securities to satisfy the notes and future interest payments on the notes when they become due 
product development altropane is an imaging agent being developed for the diagnosis of parkinsonian syndromes  or ps including parkinson s disease  or pd  parkinsonian tremor  and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder  or adhd 
we have completed a phase iii trial of altropane for use in differentiating ps movement disorders from non ps movement disorders 
we intend to conduct a new phase iii trial of altopane for use in distinguishing parkinsonian from non parkinsonian syndromes in patients with tremors and are seeking a binding written agreement with the fda relating to the design and analysis of the study protocol for this new phase iii trial 
we have had several communications with fda since the initial spa was filed with the agency 
the fda has provided recommendations pertaining to the design of the clinical protocol  including alternatives for inclusion criteria for the clinical indication being sought by us  and guidance concerning primary and secondary endpoints proposed in the statistical plan 
the fda also provided advice on further clarification of the spect imaging criteria 
in december and in february  we submitted revised protocols addressing fda s recommendations concerning study design  statistical plan and safety assessments 
we are currently awaiting final agreement from the fda on the most recent protocol submission for the new phase iii trial 
in order to expedite reaching a written agreement with the fda  our most recent submission was not made under the spa process  but rather was submitted under an alternative  expedited procedure 
the fda has assured us that a binding agreement reached under this alternative procedure will be equivalent to an agreement reached pursuant to the spa process 
we currently expect to receive correspondence from the fda containing a binding agreement relating to this protocol and to initiate the new phase iii trial in the first half of once initiated  we presently anticipate this new phase iii trial for altropane will take approximately twelve months to complete 
if the results of this phase iii trial are successful  we hope to submit an nda for altropane for use in distinguishing parkinsonian from non parkinsonian syndromes in patients with tremors within six months of the trial s completion 
we are currently conducting our second phase ii trial of altropane for the diagnosis of adhd in adults using a simplified scanning procedure and algorithm adjustments 
inosine is a nerve growth factor which specifically promotes axon outgrowth in cns cells 
we are currently conducting pre clinical studies required for the filing of an investigational new drug application  or ind 
we expect to file an ind for treatment of ischemic stroke for inosine in the third quarter of and  subsequent to fda s approval  initiate clinical trials in humans 
troponin i  or troponin  is our anti angiogenic agent under development as a potential treatment for cancer 
troponin is presently in pre clinical development 
earlier stage product candidates include fluoratec  a second generation imaging agent for the diagnosis of pd and adhd and compounds for the treatment of pd and other central nervous system disorders 
to date  we have not marketed  distributed or sold any products and  with the exception of the altropane imaging agent  all of our technologies and early stage product candidates are in pre clinical development 
our product candidates must undergo a rigorous regulatory approval process which includes extensive pre clinical and clinical testing to demonstrate safety and efficacy before any resulting product can be marketed 
the fda has stringent laboratory and manufacturing standards which must be complied with before we can test our product candidates in people or make them commercially available 
pre clinical testing and clinical trials are lengthy and expensive and the historical rate of failure for product candidates is high 
clinical trials require sufficient patient enrollment which is a function of many factors  and delays and difficulties in completing patient enrollment can result in increased costs and longer development times 
the foregoing uncertainties and risks limit our ability to estimate the timing and amount of future costs that will be required to complete the clinical development of each program 
in addition  we are unable to estimate when material net cash inflows are expected to commence as a result of the successful completion of one or more of our programs 
however  we do not currently expect to generate revenues from product sales for at least the next eighteen months 
the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are highly competitive and are dominated by larger  more experienced and better capitalized companies 
any delays we encounter in completing our clinical trial programs may adversely impact our competitive position in the markets in which we compete 
such delays may also adversely affect our financial position and liquidity 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared by us in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
our estimates include those related to marketable securities and research contracts 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
for a complete description of our significant accounting policies  see note to our consolidated financial statements in our annual report on form k 
marketable securities our marketable securities consist exclusively of investments in united states agency bonds and corporate debt obligations 
these marketable securities are adjusted to fair value on the consolidated balance sheet through other comprehensive income 
we disclose the value of restricted marketable securities  if any  in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
if a decline in the fair value of a security is considered to be other than temporary  the investment is written down to a new cost basis and the unrealized loss is removed from accumulated other comprehensive loss and recorded in the consolidated statement of operations 
we evaluate whether a decline in fair value is other than temporary based on factors such as the significance of the decline  the duration of time for which the decline has been in existence and our ability and intent to hold the security to maturity 
to date  we have not recorded any other than temporary impairments related to our marketable securities 
these marketable securities are classified as current assets because they are highly liquid and are available  as required  to meet working capital and other operating requirements 
research contracts we regularly enter into contracts with third parties to perform research and development activities in connection with our scientific technologies 
costs incurred under these contracts are recognized ratably over the term of the contract which we believe corresponds to the manner in which the work is performed 
clinical trial  contract services and other outside costs require that we make estimates of the costs incurred in a given accounting period and record accruals at period end as the third party service periods and billing terms do not always coincide with our period end 
we base our estimates on our knowledge of the research and development programs  services performed for the period  past history for related activities and the expected duration of the third party service contract where applicable 
fair value and classification of equity instruments historically  in connection with our debt and equity financings we have issued warrants to purchase shares of our common stock 
we record each of the securities issued on a relative fair value basis up to the amount of the proceeds received 
we estimate the fair value of the warrants using the black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes model is dependent on a number of variables and estimates including interest rates  dividend yield  volatility and the expected term of the warrants 
our estimates are based on market interest rates at the date of issuance  our past history for declaring dividends  our stock price volatility and the contractual term of the warrants 
the value ascribed to the warrants in connection with debt offerings is considered a cost of capital and amortized to interest expense over the term of the debt 
we have  at certain times  issued preferred stock and notes  which was convertible into common stock at a discount from the common stock market price at the date of issuance 
the discounted amount associated with such conversion rights represents an incremental yield  ie 
a beneficial conversion feature is recorded when the consideration allocated to the convertible security  divided by the number of common stock at the date of issuance of the convertible instrument 
a beneficial conversion feature associated with the preferred stock is recognized as a return to the preferred shareholders and represents a non cash charge in the determination of net loss available to common stockholders 
the beneficial conversion feature is recognized in full immediately if there is no redemption date for the preferred stock  or over the period of issuance through the redemption date  if applicable 
a beneficial conversion feature associated with debentures  notes or other debt instruments is recognized as discount to the debt and is amortized as additional interest expense ratably over the remaining term of the debt instrument 
results of operations year ended december  and our net loss was  during the year ended december  as compared with  during the year ended december  net loss attributable to common stockholders totaled per share during as compared with per share during the lower net loss in was primarily due to lower research and development expenses and the absence in of certain non recurring equity related charges  partially offset by higher interest expense in the lower net loss attributable to common stockholders on a per share basis in the period was primarily due to an increase in weighted average shares outstanding of approximately million shares  which was primarily the result of a private placement of common stock completed by us in the period 
research and development expenses were  during the year ended december  as compared with  during the year ended december  the decrease in was primarily attributable to lower manufacturing development costs for troponin of approximately  lower manufacturing development and nda preparation costs for altropane for the diagnosis of ps of approximately  and lower pre clinical costs for earlier stage product candidates of approximately  during the period  the company s manufacturing efforts on troponin were focused on continuing work on the development of the manufacturing process whereas in the period such efforts were focused on refining the purification process and accumulating material for further pre clinical studies 
we currently anticipate research and development expenses to increase during the year ended december  primarily due to our new phase iii trial for altropane 
general and administrative expenses were  during the year ended december  as compared with  during the year ended december  the increase in was primarily due to higher payroll and related costs of approximately  other expenses were zero during the year ended december  as compared with  during the year ended december  the decrease in was due to non cash charges related to agreements we entered into in and with significant securityholders to modify outstanding warrants 
in november  we agreed to extend the expiration date and lower the exercise price of certain warrants in return for the elimination of certain reset provisions of those warrants 
we recorded a one time charge of approximately  in related to this transaction 
in june  we agreed to issue additional warrants to a securityholder in return for a delay of the reset of the exercise price of certain warrants held by the securityholder 
we recorded charges of approximately  in both and related to this transaction 
the non cash charges recognized in each transaction were based upon a fair value calculation of the warrants modified or issued in each transaction as determined under the black scholes pricing model 
interest expense totaled  during the year ended december  as compared to  during the year ended december  the increase was due to higher daily average balances in the period related to the convertible senior secured promissory notes  or the notes  which were issued in july  and therefore  outstanding for all of compared to less than half of during the period  we incurred approximately  in interest on the coupon on the notes   in non cash interest associated with the amortization of the discounted carrying value of the notes and  in amortization of debt issuance costs 
interest income was  during the year ended december  as compared with interest income of  during the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to lower average interest rates in the period  partially offset by higher average cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities balances and higher realized gains of approximately  in the period 
accrual of preferred stock dividends was  during the year ended december  as compared with none during the year ended december  in december  we issued shares of series e stock with a purchase price of  per share of series e stock 
the holders of series e stock are entitled to receive a cumulative dividend of per annum  payable beginning on october  and on each anniversary thereof 
the dividend rate will increase to on june  in connection with the issuance of series e stock  we recorded a beneficial conversion feature of  during the year ended december  as compared to none during the year ended december  a beneficial conversion feature is recorded when the consideration allocated to the convertible security  divided by the number of common shares into which the security converts  is below the fair value of the common stock at the date of issuance of the convertible instrument 
the amount of the beneficial conversion feature has been immediately accreted and resulted in a deemed dividend as the preferred stock does not have a redemption term 
the value of the beneficial conversion feature has been reflected as an adjustment to the net loss attributable to common stockholders on the company s statement of operations 
at december   we had net deferred tax assets of approximately million for which a full valuation allowance has been established 
as a result of our concentrated efforts on research and development  we have a history of incurring net operating losses and expect to incur additional net operating losses for the foreseeable future 
accordingly  we have concluded that it is more likely than not that the future benefits related to the deferred tax assets will not be realized and  therefore  provided a full valuation allowance for these assets 
in the event we achieve profitability  these deferred tax assets may be available to offset future income tax liabilities and expense 
year ended december  and our net loss was  during the year ended december  as compared with  during the year ended december  net loss per share totaled per share during as compared with per share during the higher net loss in was primarily due to lower interest income in the decrease in interest income was partially offset by lower research and development expenses in research and development expenses were  during the year ended december  as compared with  during the year ended december  the decrease in was primarily attributable to lower manufacturing development costs for troponin of approximately  the decrease in these expenses was partially offset by higher pre clinical costs for inosine of approximately  and higher research and development wages resulting from increased headcount of approximately general and administrative expenses were  during the year ended december  as compared with  during the year ended december  the increase in was primarily due to higher professional service costs of approximately  including an increase in non cash expenses of  primarily related to the issuance of warrants to consultants 
the increase in these expenses was partially offset by the absence of approximately  in personnel recruitment costs that were incurred in the period when we hired a number of senior executives 
other expenses were  during the year ended december  as compared with  during the year ended december  the increase in was due to non cash charges related to agreements we entered into in and with significant securityholders to modify outstanding warrants 
in november  we agreed to extend the expiration date and lower the exercise price of certain warrants in return for the elimination of certain reset provisions of those warrants 
we recorded a one time charge of approximately  in related to this transaction 
during  we lowered the exercise price of certain warrants held by a securityholder in return for daily trading restrictions on the number of shares of common stock that the securityholder could sell through may  which resulted in a one time charge of  in june  we agreed to issue additional warrants to a securityholder in return for a delay of the reset of the exercise price of certain warrants held by the securityholder 
we recorded charges of approximately  in both and related to this transaction 
the non cash charges recognized in each transaction were based upon a fair value calculation of the warrants modified or issued in each transaction as determined under the black scholes pricing model 
interest expense totaled  during the year ended december  as compared to zero during the during the year ended december  in july  we issued million of notes  and incurred  in interest on the coupon   in non cash interest associated with the accretion of the discounted carrying value of the notes and approximately  in amortization of debt issuance costs 
interest income was  during the year ended december  as compared with interest income of  during the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to lower average cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities balances during the period as compared to the period 
liquidity and capital resources cash used for operating activities  primarily related to our net loss  totaled  in as compared to  in the decrease in is primarily related to lower research and development expenses in the period 
cash used for investing activities totaled  in as compared to cash provided by investing activities of  in the difference in investing activities principally reflects the increase in restricted cash in and the purchase of marketable securities with the proceeds from the private placements  described below  completed by us in  net of the sales of marketable securities which were subsequently used to fund operations 
cash provided by financing activities was  in as compared to  in the difference in financing activities principally reflects the effect of the private placements  described below  completed by us in and as of december   we have incurred total net losses since inception of approximately million 
to date  we have dedicated most of our financial resources to the research and development of our product candidates  preclinical compounds  general and administrative expenses and costs related to obtaining and protecting patents 
since inception  we have primarily satisfied our working capital requirements from the sale of our securities through private placements 
these private placements have included the sale of preferred stock and common stock  as well as notes payable and convertible debentures 
a summary of financings completed during the three years ended december  is as follows date net proceeds raised securities issued december million convertible preferred stock and warrants march million common stock july million convertible senior secured promissory notes and warrants march million common stock and warrants in the future  our working capital and capital requirements will depend on numerous factors  including the progress of our research and development activities  the level of resources that we devote to the developmental  clinical  and regulatory aspects of our technologies  and the extent to which we enter into collaborative relationships with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies 
at december   we had available cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities of approximately million and working capital of approximately million 
we believe that the cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities available at december  will provide sufficient working capital to meet our anticipated expenditures for at least the next twelve months 
in addition  we have approximately million in a segregated account to satisfy our obligations with respect to the notes which mature in june these segregated funds are not included in the available cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities and working capital amounts referenced above 
we will need to raise additional capital in the future through collaboration agreements with other pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies  debt financing and or equity offerings 
there can be no assurance  however  that we will be successful or that additional funds will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
in addition  we have certain covenants with the holders of our notes and the purchasers of our series e stock that may limit our ability to engage in certain types of financings in the future 
pending approval of additional authorized shares of common stock by stockholders at our annual meeting  we have a limited number of shares of authorized common stock for issuance in future financings 
following is information on the direct research and development costs incurred all amounts in thousands on our principal scientific technology programs currently under development 
these amounts do not include research and development employee and related overhead costs which total approximately million on a cumulative basis 
program th quarter fiscal cumulative diagnostic imaging anti angiogenesis cns regeneration other three months ended december  estimating costs and time to complete development of a specific program or technology is difficult due to the uncertainties of the development process and the requirements of the fda which could require additional clinical trials or other development and testing 
results of any testing could lead to a decision to change or terminate development of a technology  in which case estimated future costs could change substantially 
in the event we were to enter into a licensing or other collaborative agreement with a corporate partner involving sharing or funding by such corporate partner of development costs  the estimated development costs incurred by us could be substantially less than estimated 
additionally  research and development costs are extremely difficult to estimate for early stage technologies due to the fact that there is generally less comprehensive data available for such technologies to determine the development activities that would be required prior to the filing of an nda 
as a result  we cannot reasonably estimate the cost and the date of completion for any technology that is not at least in phase iii clinical development due to the uncertainty regarding the number of required trials  the size of such trials  and the duration of development 
we have not received final agreement from the fda on our revised protocol for the design of our new phase iii clinical trial for altropane 
we presently anticipate this trial will take approximately twelve months to complete and cost approximately million 
however  there can be no assurance that the fda will accept our revised protocol or that it will not request additional modifications 
contractual obligations and commitments research and development commitments consists of contractual obligations with third parties  as well as the estimated costs of approximately million to complete our new phase iii clinical trial for altropane 
we lease certain office equipment  office space and laboratory space under noncancelable operating leases 
our current corporate office lease expires in and contains provisions whereby we can sublet all or part of the space and fully retain any sublease income generated 
we also lease laboratory space that expires in may as of december   approximate future minimum commitments under the above leases and other contractual obligations are as follows year ended december  research and development operating lease other general and administrative maturity of debt thereafter in july  we entered into agreements pursuant to which we issued million in principal amount of notes to a single institutional investor in a private placement 
the notes mature in june and bear interest at per annum  payable semi annually on june and december we may elect to pay interest on the notes in either cash or  subject to certain limitations  additional notes on the same terms 
we elected to pay the interest due on december  and june  in additional notes in the amounts of  and  respectively 
in december  we elected to pay the interest due on december  in the amount of  in cash 
among other adjustments  unless the investor consents otherwise  if we issue equity securities in the future for consideration per share of common stock less than the then applicable conversion price of the notes  the conversion price of the notes will be reduced to equal that lower price 
the notes are currently convertible into common stock at a conversion price of per share 
the notes are secured by a first priority security interest and continuing lien on all current and after acquired property of ours 
we generally may obtain a release of the security interest by providing alternative collateral in the form of either cash or a bank letter of credit 
until the time  if any  that we provide alternative collateral or less than  principal amount of notes remains outstanding  the agreements also prohibit us  among other things  from entering into any merger  consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets  incurring additional indebtedness  encumbering our assets with any liens and redeeming or paying cash dividends on any of our capital stock 
we are permitted to grant licenses or sublicenses of our intellectual property to third parties in the ordinary course of business free from the security interest  but the holders of the notes will receive a first priority security interest and continuing lien on all amounts owing to us in respect of any such license or sublicense 
the agreements also contain customary events of default  including any change of control and breach by us of our representations and warranties and covenants contained in the agreements 
if an event of default were to occur  our obligations under the notes could be accelerated and become immediately due and payable in full 
as a condition of our december private placement of series e stock and warrants  we agreed to exercise our right to obtain a release of the security interest and continuing lien on our property that currently secure our outstanding notes by providing alternative collateral in the form of cash or a standby letter of credit in the amount of all remaining principal and interest payments on the notes through maturity 
the remaining principal and interest payments on the notes through maturity total approximately  we communicated to the holders of the notes our intention to obtain a release of the lien on our property by providing alternative collateral in the form of an irrevocable standby letter of credit in the amount of our remaining obligations 
to date  we have been unable to reach agreement with the noteholders on the terms of such a letter of credit 
we are currently reviewing our options regarding the release of liens and in the interim have set aside sufficient funds in a segregated account to satisfy our remaining obligations under the notes in order to comply with our covenant to the december private placement investors 
our series e stock includes a dividend obligation of through june  increasing to thereafter 
generally  we may elect to pay the dividend in cash or in shares of our common stock 
we have reserved a sufficient number of shares to pay the dividends payable in october and october in shares of our common stock 
recent accounting pronouncements in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
and in december issued a revised fin fin r which addresses the period of adoption of fin for entities created before january  fin provides a new consolidation model which determines control and consolidation based on potential variability in gains and losses 
the provisions of fin are effective for enterprises with variable interest entities created after january  we must adopt the provisions of fin in the first quarter of fiscal and do not expect the adoption to have a material impact on our financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
it requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability or an asset in some circumstances 
many of those instruments were previously classified as equity 
this statement is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after december  the adoption of sfas is not expected to have a material effect on our financial statements 
off balance sheet arrangements we had no off balance sheet arrangements as defined in the applicable securities and exchange commission rule during the year end december  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we generally maintain a portfolio of cash equivalents  and short term and long term marketable securities in a variety of securities which can include commercial paper  certificates of deposit  money market funds and government and non government debt securities 
the fair value of these available for sale securities are subject to changes in market interest rates and may fall in value if market interest rates increase 
our investment portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to help insure liquidity 
we have implemented policies regarding the amount and credit ratings of investments 
due to the conservative nature of these policies  we do not believe we have material exposure due to market risk 
we may not have the ability to hold our fixed income investments until maturity  and therefore our future operating results or cash flows could be affected if we are required to sell investments during a period in which increases in market interest rates have adversely affected the value of our securities portfolio
