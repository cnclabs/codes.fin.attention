item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a primarily reviews the financial condition and results of operations of community bank system  inc  and its subsidiaries cbsi or the company for the past two years  although in some circumstances a period longer than two years is covered in order to comply with securities and exchange commission disclosure requirements or to more fully explain long term trends 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the selected consolidated financial information on page and the company s consolidated financial statements and related notes that appear on pages through all references in the discussion to the financial condition and results of operations are to the consolidated position and results of the company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole 
all financial results reflect the acquisition of first liberty bank corp 
first liberty in accordance with the pooling of interests method of accounting 
unless otherwise noted  all earnings per share eps figures disclosed in the md a refer to diluted eps  interest income  net interest income and net interest margin are presented on a fully tax equivalent fte basis 
the term this year and equivalent terms refer to results in calendar year  last year and equivalent terms refer to calendar year  and all references to income statement results correspond to full year activity unless otherwise noted 
lastly  all references to peer banks pertain to a group of bank holding companies nationwide having billion to billion in assets and their associated composite financial results for the nine months ending september  the most recently available disclosure  as provided by the federal reserve board s division of banking supervision and regulation in the bank holding company performance report 
this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains certain forward looking statements with respect to the financial condition  results of operations and business of community bank system  inc these forward looking statements involve certain risks and uncertainties 
factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by such forward looking statements are set herein under the caption forward looking statements on page critical accounting policies as a result of the complex and dynamic nature of the company s business  management must exercise judgement in selecting and applying the most appropriate accounting policies for its various areas of operations 
the policy decision process not only ensures compliance with the latest generally accepted accounting principles  but also reflects on management s discretion with regard to choosing the most suitable methodology for reporting the company s financial performance 
it is management s opinion that the accounting estimates covering certain aspects of the business have more significance than others due to the relative importance of those areas to overall performance  or the level of subjectivity in the selection process 
these estimates affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
management believes that the critical accounting estimates include o allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses reflects management s best estimate of probable loan losses in the company s loan portfolio 
determination of the allowance for loan losses is inherently subjective 
it requires significant estimates including the amounts and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans and the amount of estimated losses on pools of homogeneous loans which is based on historical loss experience and consideration of current economic trends  all of which may be susceptible to significant change 
o actuarial assumptions associated with pension  post retirement and other employee benefit plans these assumptions include discount rate  rate of future compensation increases and expected return on plan assets 
table on page shows the impact of a one percentage point increase and decrease of each of these assumptions 
specific discussion of the assumptions used by management is discussed in note k on pages through o provision for income taxes the company is subject to examinations from various taxing authorities 
such examinations may result in challenges to the tax return treatment applied by the company to specific transactions 
management believes that the assumptions and judgements used to record tax related assets or liabilities have been appropriate 
should tax laws change or the taxing authorities determine that management s assumptions were inappropriate  an adjustment may be required which could have a material effect on the company s results of operations 
o fair value of certain investment securities fair values of investment securities are based on quoted market prices  where available 
if quoted market prices are not available  fair values are based on quoted market prices of comparable instruments 
o carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets is based upon discounted cash flow modeling techniques that require management to make estimates regarding the amount and timing of expected future cash flows 
it also requires them to select a discount rate that reflects the current return requirements of the market in relation to present risk free interest rates  required equity market premiums and company specific risk indicators 
a summary of the accounting policies used by management is disclosed in note a summary of significant accounting policies starting on page executive summary the company s business philosophy is to operate as a community bank with local decision making  principally in non metropolitan markets  providing a broad array of banking and financial services to retail  commercial  and municipal customers 
the company s core operating objectives are i grow the branch network  primarily through a disciplined acquisition strategy  ii build high quality  profitable loan portfolios using both organic and acquisition strategies  iii increase the non interest income component of total revenues through development of banking related fee income  growth in existing financial services business units  and the acquisition of additional financial services businesses  and iv utilize technology to deliver customer responsive products and services and to reduce operating costs 
significant factors management reviews to evaluate achievement of the company s operating objectives and its operating results and financial condition include  but are not limited to net income and earnings per share  return on assets and equity  net interest margins  non interest income  operating expenses  asset quality  loan and deposit growth  capital management  performance of individual banking and financial services business units  liquidity and interest rate sensitivity  enhancements to customer products and services  technology enhancements  market share  peer comparisons  and the performance of acquisition and integration activities 
in  the company reported record earnings as a result of strong net interest margins and significant increases in non interest income 
on an operating basis see table and related narrative  return on assets increased over  while return on equity declined slightly due to strengthened capital levels 
excluding acquisition activity  revenues generated by the financial services businesses declined slightly in  principally as a result of the effects of a challenging retail investment environment over the past three years 
operating expenses and the efficiency ratio increased due to acquisition activity as well as increased benefit costs 
asset quality improved in  with reductions in delinquency  charge off and non performing loan ratios over excluding acquisition activity  the company experienced strong loan growth in consumer mortgage and indirect installment lending  with declines in the commercial and direct installment portfolios 
on a geographical basis  the new york markets reported growth in all portfolios except consumer indirect 
the pennsylvania markets reported an increase in consumer indirect  with declines in other portfolios 
excluding acquisition activity  total deposits declined slightly from the company completed three acquisitions in  including harbridge consulting group  an actuarial and benefits consulting firm based in syracuse  ny that was acquired from pricewaterhousecoopers in july  peoples bankcorp inc  a million asset single branch bank in ogdensburg  ny acquired in september  and grange national banc corp  a million asset bank with twelve branches in five counties of northeastern pa  acquired in november 
in january  the company announced an agreement to acquire first heritage bank  a million asset commercial bank based in wilkes barre pa that is expected to close in may net income and profitability net income for was million  up million or from the prior year 
earnings per share of in were higher than s results 
the growth rate of eps was below that of net income due to higher weighted average diluted shares outstanding 
the increase in diluted shares was primarily driven by the million of common shares issued in conjunction with the acquisition of grange national banc corp 
grange in november  an increased level of option grants and exercises  and a higher average common share price refer to the earnings per share section of note a on page for information regarding the impact of share price on diluted shares 
the results were impacted by million of net losses from debt and security transactions  including million of debt restructuring charges associated with the early retirement of higher rate  medium term borrowings 
in contrast  earning per share benefited from net security and debt transaction gains of million 
net income and earnings per share for were million and  up and  respectively  from results 
the improvement in earnings in was primarily driven by a reduced level of acquisition expenses  which fell from million in to million in this was due to the fact that two of the company s three acquisitions in were completed in the first half of the year see note b acquisitions  and consequently the vast majority of deal related expenses were incurred during in addition  the results include the benefit of adopting sfas  an accounting standard that eliminates the regular amortization of goodwill related to the company s branch acquisitions  and sfas  which eliminates the requirement to regularly amortize goodwill related to its whole company acquisitions 
sfas and sfas were effective january  and increased earnings per share by and  respectively  versus eps 
earnings per share for rose by a lesser percentage than net income versus because of higher weighted average diluted shares outstanding  principally due to million common shares issued in november to partially fund the acquisition of branches from fleetboston financial 
in addition to the earnings results presented above in accordance with gaap  the company provides earnings results on a non gaap  or operating basis 
the determination of operating earnings excludes the effects of certain items the company considers to be non operating  including acquisition expenses  the results of securities transactions  and debt restructuring activities 
performance as measured by operating earnings is considered by management to be a useful measure for gauging the underlying performance of the company by eliminating the volatility caused by voluntary  transaction based items 
diluted operating earnings per share for were  up from the reported in the growth in earnings in was principally due to increased deposit service fee income  consumer mortgage growth  a higher net interest margin and a lower effective income tax rate 
these improvements to earnings were partially offset by higher personnel  occupancy and volume driven expenses and a planned reduction of investment portfolio balances 
a reconciliation of gaap based earnings results to operating based earnings results is as follows table reconciliation of gaap eps to operating eps years ended december  s omitted net income      eliminate after tax impact of net securities losses gains   loss on debt restructuring   acquisition expenses  net income operating      excluding the aforementioned benefits from adopting sfas and in  operating earnings per share of last year were higher than the operating eps generated in the resulting improvement largely reflects the full year impact of the fleetboston branch acquisition  an improved net interest margin  a larger securities portfolio and a lower effective income tax rate

the relative contribution of changing balances and better margins were relatively balanced at and  respectively see table on page 
the net interest margin benefited from the rates on deposits and borrowings declining more than the yields earned on investments in the low interest rate environment 
average loans grew million  primarily due to a record year for consumer mortgage volume as well as the impact of the acquisitions of grange and peoples bankcorp inc peoples 
average investments declined million in as a result of a de leveraging strategy undertaken in the first half of the year 
the growth in earning assets was funded by million more average deposits and slightly higher average borrowings up  or 
o the loan loss provision decreased million or from the prior year level 
net charge offs increased by million primarily as a result of a larger loan portfolio  as evidenced by a two basis point decrease in the net charge off ratio net charge offs total average loans to 
the loan loss provision decreased despite the higher net charge offs because the overall risk profile of the loan portfolio improved  in part due to a higher proportion of relatively low risk consumer mortgages being added through organic growth and acquisitions 
the improved asset quality position in was evident in standard metrics such as non performing loans as a percentage of total loans down two basis points  non performing assets as a percentage of loans and other real estate owned down two basis points and delinquent loans days through non accruing as a percentage of total loans down basis points 
additional information on trends and policy related to asset quality is provided in the asset quality section on pages through o non interest income excluding net gains and losses on investment security transactions and debt prepayment for of million increased by million from s level  the tenth consecutive year of growth 
banking services accounted for million of the improvement  as overdraft volume increased significantly and income related to secondary market mortgage activity rose 
overdraft fee income benefited from the implementation of the overdraft freedom tm program described in non interest income section on pages through in december  an increase of the fee charged for overdrafts in mid and a larger number of customer accounts due primarily to the two bank acquisitions 
financial services revenue was million higher mostly as a result of the acquisition of pricewaterhousecoopers upstate new york global human resource solutions consulting group renamed harbridge consulting group at the end of july and strong growth at the company s retirement plan administration business  benefits plans administrative services 
as previously noted  included million of debt prepayment charges and million of net losses on investment security sales versus million of gains on the sale of securities and a  charge for the early retirement of debt in the million negative variance from security and debt transactions caused total non interest income of million in to rise by a lesser million amount 
o total operating expenses rose million or in to million 
excluding acquisition expenses in both years  operating expenses rose million or 
a majority of the increase was due to increased personnel expenses  as merit increases  new hires  higher pension and medical expense rates and employees added through the three acquisitions drove these expenses higher 
in addition  volume related expenses such as checking charges write off of overdraft balances and fees and customer processing expenses for the consumer mortgage business rose significantly in due to record levels of activity 
net occupancy expenses also increased because of a larger number of facilities due to acquisitions  current and prior year renovations  higher property tax and utility rates and a rise in various weather related costs 
o the company s combined effective federal and state tax rate decreased percentage points in to  primarily as a result of an increased proportion of pre tax income from tax exempt investments and loans 
selected profitability and other measures return on average assets  return on average equity  dividend payout and equity to asset ratios for the years indicated are as follows table selected ratios return on assets return on assets operating return on equity return on equity operating dividend payout ratio average equity to average assets as displayed in table above  the return on average assets improved in in comparison to both and this was primarily a result of higher net interest margins  a greater proportion of earnings generated from non interest income and improved operational efficiencies 
based on operating earnings  the return on assets was up basis points in reported return on equity in was down from s level 
this was mainly a result of the build up of equity capital this year from the retention of net profits and the common shares issued in conjunction with the acquisition of grange national banc corp  and the million swing in net gains and losses from security and debt transactions 
consequently  average shareholders equity increased this year  well above the increase in reported gaap net income 
based on operating earnings  the return on equity in fell by a lesser basis points 
the return on equity improved in versus despite significantly higher equity levels stock issuance and market value appreciation in the investment portfolio because of much higher profits 
the strengthening of the company s equity capital position over the past two years is reflected in the and basis point increases in the average equity to average total assets ratios in and  respectively 
the dividend payout ratio for was above s level based on reported net income mostly due to the security and debt transactions previously mentioned 
on an operating basis  the dividend payout ratio for was essentially equal to the prior year vs 
 as operating net income grew at approximately the same rate as dividends declared 
the dividend payout ratio spiked temporarily in due to a short term drop in earnings as the company worked through the integration of three major acquisitions  and the related million increase in the number of shares outstanding that caused the dollar amount of declared dividends to rise significantly 
net interest income net interest income is the amount that interest and fees on earning assets loans and investments exceeds the cost of funds  primarily interest paid to the company s depositors and interest on external borrowings 
net interest margin is the difference between the gross yield on earning assets and the cost of interest bearing funds as a percentage of earning assets 
as disclosed in table  net interest income with non taxable income converted to a fully tax equivalent basis totaled million in  up million or over the prior year 
the increase was due to a favorable shift in the mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing balances and improved margins  which had positive impacts of million and million on net interest income  respectively see table on page 
cbsi s net interest margin increased seven basis points from in to this year 
the basis point decrease in the rate on average interest bearing funds and a greater proportion of funding from non interest bearing deposits had a greater impact than the basis point decline in the yield on interest earning assets 
downward re pricing of the company s interest bearing deposits  a shift in deposit mix from higher rate accounts to low and non interest bearing accounts and greater utilization of low rate  short term borrowings  combined with a relatively stable yield on the investment portfolio led to the improvement in the margin 
the company s net interest margin ranked in the very favorable th peer bank percentile for the nine months ending september  the net interest margin declined in each of the quarters of  ending with a margin for the fourth quarter 
this trend was mostly attributable to the level and changes in market interest rates during falling market rates early in the year allowed the company to reduce rates on non time deposit interest bearing accounts in the first two quarters that were not reproduced in the second half of the overall low level of interest rates resulted in loan yields and time deposit rates declining throughout the year 
however  due to the larger size and substantial growth of the loan portfolio in versus a decline in average time deposit balances  the decline in loan yields had a greater negative impact on the margin in million than the benefit derived from time deposit rate reductions million 
another reason the net interest margin declined later in the year was that the de leveraging of the investment portfolio in the first half of allowed the company to avoid adding low yielding securities during that time period 
however  investment purchases were made in the second half of that will provide incremental net interest income in the coming years and help protect the company from falling interest rates  but also contributed somewhat to the contraction of the net interest margin later in as shown in table  total interest income decreased by million or in table shows that lower rates contributed a negative variance of million  partially offset by a positive impact of million from million higher average earning assets and changes in the mix of funding sources 
average loans grew a total of million in  with the vast majority coming from organic consumer mortgage and consumer indirect loan growth 
the addition of million of loans through the acquisition of peoples in early september and million from the late november acquisition of grange had a positive  but less substantial impact on average loan growth due to the timing of the transactions 
interest and fees on loans decreased million or 
an basis point drop in loan yields due to falling capital market rates had more of an impact negative million than growth in average loans positive million 
in early fourth quarter  management instituted an investment de leveraging strategy  allowing the portfolio to run down and using the proceeds to pay down borrowings due to the lack of investment opportunities offering acceptable yields 
this approach was in effect through june  when it was decided that investment purchases should be reinitiated to take advantage of more attractive medium and long term rates and a steep yield curve  as well as protect the company from its interest rate exposure to falling rates 
due to the de leveraging strategy being in place for approximately half of versus less than a quarter of  average investment balances for were down million versus the year earlier period  primarily in the mortgage backed securities mbs and collateralized mortgage obligations cmos segments of the portfolio refer to the investments section of the md a on pages through for further information 
investment interest income in of million was million or lower than the prior year as a result of the smaller portfolio negative million impact and a decrease in the average investment yield from to negative million impact 
the decrease in the yield was principally driven by significant declines in market interest rates from early through mid consequently  the company was unable to replace the run off of longer held  higher yielding securities with equivalent rate investments  and the purchase of securities in the relatively low interest rate conditions in the second half of led to yield declines 
however  the net spread on these medium term investment purchases were comparable because they were funded by very low rate  short term borrowings 
in addition  the performance of the investment portfolio in was strong given the interest rate environment 
the company was able to maintain its yields to a great extent primarily because of two important strategies the addition of a substantial amount of call protected securities in and first half of when rates were higher  and foregoing security purchases in the late to mid period as rates were falling significantly 
the success of these actions was evident in cbsi s exceptional th percentile ranking within its peer group for tax equivalent investment yield for the nine months ended september the average earning asset yield fell basis points to in because of the previously mentioned decrease in investment and loan yields and the fact that the yields on the overall loan portfolio have converged with those of the investment portfolio 
in the yield on the loan portfolio was basis points higher than the yield on investments 
loan yields were only basis points above those produced by investments in consequently  the shift in the mix of average earning assets towards a higher proportion of loans in vs 
due to significant consumer mortgage growth  acquired loans and the reduced size of the investment portfolio  did not provide the usual yield advantage it would have under more normalized interest rate conditions 
total average fundings deposits and borrowings grew by million in  with million of the increase coming from deposits  mostly attributable to the acquisitions of grange and peoples  and million from additional external borrowings 
all of the increase in external funding came from short term borrowings 
long term debt was reduced through normal pay downs and the pre payment of million of medium term fhlb borrowings in the fourth quarter of  which was replaced with much lower rate  short term funding from the federal home loan bank 
total interest expense decreased by million to million in as shown in table  lower rates on deposits and external borrowings accounted for million  or almost all of the decrease 
interest expense as a percentage of earning assets fell by basis points to 
the rate on interest bearing deposits fell basis points to  due largely to steady declines in time deposit rates throughout and periodic reduction of rates on other interest bearing deposit products 
the rate on external borrowings declined basis points to because of substantially lower market rates and the previously mentioned shift in funding mix towards short term borrowings 
as shown in table  net interest income for was million higher than s level due to a number of factors 
interest earning assets have grown by million through a combination of acquired loans  organic loan growth and effective management of a larger investment portfolio 
the net interest margin in was basis points higher than two years ago in most part due to earning asset yields declining basis points versus a basis point decline in interest bearing liabilities and an basis point decrease in the cost of funds includes demand deposits 
the yield on earning assets benefited greatly over the last two years by the relative stability of the investment portfolio yield  which declined only basis points over this period despite a significant drop in market interest rates 
the cost of funding was aided by the change in the make up of both the deposit base and external borrowings 
the fall of market interest rates over the last two years not only enabled a significant reduction of interest bearing deposit rates  but also caused many customers to shift their funds from time deposits to less restrictive accounts such as savings and demand deposits due to the greatly diminished rate spread between the two groups of accounts 
this is demonstrated by the percentage of average deposits that were in time deposit accounts dropping from in to in  accounting for a portion of the reduced funding costs beyond the absolute drop in rates 
the company also changed the proportion of long term funding in average external borrowings from in to in to take advantage of historically low short term rates  providing further funding cost savings

non interest income the company s sources of non interest income are of three primary types general banking services related to loans  deposits and other core customer activities typically provided through the branch network  financial services  comprised of retirement plan administration and employee benefit trusts benefit plans administrative services or bpa  employee benefit actuarial and consulting services harbridge consulting group or harbridge  personal trust  investment and insurance products community investment services  inc or cisi and investment management elias asset management or eam  and periodic transactions  most often net gains losses from the sale of investments and prepayment of term debt 
table non interest income years ended december  s omitted banking services electronic banking    mortgage banking deposit service charges    overdraft fees    credit life and disability insurance  commissions and other fees    miscellaneous total banking services    financial services retirement plan administration and trust fees    benefit plan actuarial and consulting fees  asset advisory and management fees    investment and insurance product commissions    personal trust    total financial services    sub total    loss gain on investment securities debt extinguishment   total non interest income    non interest income operating income fte as displayed in table  total non interest income in increased by to million  largely as a result of significantly higher overdraft volume  the acquisition of harbridge and growth at bpa 
these improvements were offset by substantially higher losses on the early retirement of long term borrowings  the absence of gains on the sale of securities and weakness in the other financial services group businesses 
non interest income  excluding transactions related to investment securities and debt obligations  rose for the tenth consecutive year to million in  a million or improvement over non interest income  excluding net gains losses from the sale of securities and early retirement of debt  as a percent of operating income fte basis was in  up percentage points from the prior year  and an all time high for the company 
this increase was primarily driven by the aforementioned strong growth in overdraft fees and bpa revenue  as well as the acquisition of harbridge 
this ratio is considered an important measure for determining the progress the company is making on one of its primary long term strategies  expansion of non interest income in order to diversify its revenue sources and reduce reliance on net interest margins that may be strongly impacted by general interest rate and other market conditions 
the largest segment of the company s recurring non interest income is the wide variety of fees earned from general banking services  which reached million in  up from the prior year 
this segment contributed of non interest income  excluding net gains and losses from security sales and debt extinguishment 
a large portion of the income growth was attributable to overdraft fees  up million over s level  which benefited from the implementation of the company s overdraft freedom tm program in december  additional accounts added through acquisitions and the full year impact of a fee increase implemented in june overdraft freedom tm is a program currently offered to retail customers whereby the company may pay overdrawn amounts for qualified customers up to a certain predetermined limit  for which they are charged a standard overdraft fee 
this program is a courtesy service to customers in good standing that may allow them to avoid late and non payment penalties from creditors and vendors and help them in their effort to avoid the negative consequences of returned checks 
this type of deposit account service has become prevalent throughout much of the banking industry 
income derived from activity associated with the secondary market mortgage portfolio rose to  in  up  from the prior year 
one of the main reasons for the increase was that million of consumer mortgages were sold on the secondary market in versus million in the selling of secondary mortgages was resumed in october after a one year suspension  and continued through september the combination of increased sales and fluctuations in interest rates was the primary driver of gains of  on loans sold and  from the establishment of and valuation of mortgage servicing rights 
this compares to  of gains on loans sold and a  write down of mortgage servicing rights in these income improvements were offset by a  unrealized loss on mortgage loan commitments 
certain loan commitments that had been categorized as held for sale were reclassified as portfolio loans commitments after the decision was made to discontinue the sale of twenty year and longer mortgages 
market loss on these commitments was recognized in earnings concurrent with the reclassification 
higher secondary sales partially offset by increased levels of mortgage prepayments resulted in the loan servicing portfolio rising from million at the end of to million at year end this growth was the primary reason why a fourth component of secondary market activity  loan servicing fees  rose to  in as disclosed in table  non interest income from the financial services segment rose million or in to million 
financial services revenue now comprises of total non interest income  excluding net gains losses on the sale of investment securities and retirement of debt 
this compares to in  with the decline primarily due to the tremendous success of the company s new overdraft program this year 
the acquisition of harbridge at the end of july resulted in million of incremental revenue for the financial services group in the current year 
another impressive year of revenue growth at bpa up  or was driven by a significant number of new plans and growth in the market value of client assets 
these two businesses are part of the company s benefits plan administrative services  inc bpas subsidiary  and operate collaboratively to offer clients a full array of employee benefits  recordkeeping and consulting services throughout much of the country 
bpas revenue of million was million higher than prior year results 
the other financial services businesses  cisi  elias asset management and personal trust were all negatively impacted by the challenging retail investment market conditions of the past few years 
a significant drop in interest rates this year resulted in much lower annuity volume and commission rates for cisi  accounting for most of the  decline in their revenue to million 
an extended period of weak performance by us equities from late through early had an adverse impact on eam s assets under management  as lower valuations and the loss of assets reduced their main driver of revenue generation 
consequently  eam s revenue was down  to million in however  significantly improved market conditions and investor confidence in the latter part of directly benefited eam s performance  as higher equity valuations and new client acquisition resulted in higher revenues in the second half of the year versus the first half 
lastly  the personal trust business experienced a  decline in revenue to million  primarily due to the timing of estate settlements 
assets under management from the company s financial services businesses rose considerably to billion at the end of compared to billion at year end market driven gains in equity based assets were augmented by attraction of new client assets 
bpa in particular was very successful at growing its asset base  as demonstrated by the million or increase in its assets under administration 
the total financial services group contributed million excluding allocation of indirect corporate expense or of the company s pretax income this year  reflecting nearly a margin 
in  financial services contribution was million or of total pretax income  with a margin of 
the lower earnings and margin were the result of up front  transaction related expenses absorbed by harbridge and cost cutting efforts at eam and cisi not keeping pace with revenue shortfalls 
in addition  most of the expenses for the personal trust unit are fixed in nature and therefore its margins and pre tax contribution tend to fluctuate to a large degree with variability of their traditionally uneven revenue stream 
the decline in percentage contribution was primarily due to the banking business s success at growing net interest income  non interest income and reducing the loan loss provision in in addition  the near term profitability challenges faced by the financial services group due to market conditions  amortization of intangible assets and unusual expenses are expected to diminish over time and be more than offset by top line growth 
there was a total net loss on security and debt transactions of million this year compared to million of net gains in the loss in was primarily composed of million of charges associated with the early retirement of million of longer term fhlb borrowings that were replaced with lower rate  short term borrowings  which is expected to provide a long term earnings benefit as well as reduce interest rate risk 
current year results also included million of losses from a variety of smaller security and debt transactions 
the net gain in included million of gains on million of investment sales  and a million prepayment penalty on the retirement of approximately million of intermediate term fhlb borrowings in the fourth quarter 
the security and debt gains and losses taken over the last two years are illustrative of the company s active management of its investment portfolio and external borrowings to achieve a desirable total return through the combination of net interest income  transaction gains losses and changes in market value across financial market cycles 
excluding gains and losses from security sales and debt retirement  non interest income for was up million or from s level  driven by strong growth of and in and  respectively 
the increase in came from both the banking and financial services segments 
the acquisition of fleetboston branches in november contributed a significant amount of incremental banking fees in prior year non interest income also benefited greatly from substantial business expansion at bpa  which has provided consistent revenue growth since it was acquired in july  and cisi which successfully shifted it focus to annuity sales in to provide growth in a very difficult year for equity based products 
as previously noted  the impressive increase in recurring non interest income in was driven by deposit service fees  income related to the secondary mortgage market  the acquisition of harbridge and another year of robust growth at bpa 
total non interest income for was up a lesser million from s level  due primarily to debt repayment penalties that will provide future benefits and very limited security sales in comparison to the earlier periods 
operating expenses as shown in table  operating expenses rose million or in to million 
excluding acquisition expenses related to harbridge  peoples and grange in and the fleetboston branches in  operating expenses were up million or in  reflective mostly of incremental expenses from the operations of the acquired businesses listed above  as well as increases in pension  medical and volume driven costs 
this year s operating expenses as a percent of average assets were  up from in and lower than the in the increase in this ratio for was principally due to the acquisition of a financial services unit whose revenue is not driven by earning assets harbridge  and the charge offs resulting from higher overdraft volume  another significant revenue generating tool with a limited underlying asset base 
this ratio was elevated in primarily as a result of the high level of acquisition expenses in that year 
cbsi s operating expenses to average asset ratio of annualized for the nine months ended september was slightly below the median of for peer banks 
the efficiency ratio  a performance measurement tool widely used by banks  is defined by the company as operating expenses excluding acquisition expenses and intangible amortization divided by operating income fully tax equivalent net interest income plus non interest income  excluding net securities and debt gains and losses 
lower ratios correspond to higher efficiency 
in the efficiency ratio increased by percentage points to 
this was primarily a result of net interest income being tempered for much of the year due to the investment de leveraging strategy  rising pension and medical expenses and the impact from reduced pre tax margins in the financial services segment in  as discussed earlier 
the efficiency ratio for was significantly lower than the ratio of for  as initiatives undertaken in  such as the consolidation of the company s loan and deposit operations centers and cost take outs at first liberty  have provided ongoing efficiency improvements

the remainder of the increases in personnel expense reflect higher pension discussed in further detail below and medical rates  merit increases and new hiring activity 
total full time equivalent staff at the end of was  compared to  at year end medical expenses were up in due to a general rise in the cost of medical care  administration and insurance  as well as a greater number of insured employees 
qualified and non qualified pension expenses increased significantly in principally due to a reduction of the discount rate applied to future payments to from increases current expenses in present value terms and additional obligations for employees added through acquisition and organic growth 
in addition  a million adjustment was recorded in the fourth quarter of to reflect the proper actuarial impact of indexing salary levels associated with certain benefits frozen in the three assumptions that have the largest impact on the calculation of annual pension expense are the aforementioned discount rate  the rate applied to future compensation increases and the expected rate of return on plan assets

as displayed in table  this was largely caused by higher occupancy expense up million and other expenses up million  and partially offset by lower intangible amortization down million  office supplies down million and foreclosed property expenses down million 
the increase in occupancy expense in was mainly due to incremental costs from recently acquired facilities  expenses arising from renovations and repairs  the effect of higher rates and severe weather on maintenance and utilities expenses and the general increase in property taxes in many of the municipalities we do business in 
other expenses include two volume driven expense items that were up considerably due to record levels of business activity  mortgage processing expenses and checking charges related to overdraft activity 
in non recurring expenses associated with the retirement of a senior executive also impacted other expenses 
intangible amortization in was down versus the prior year because the drop in accelerated amortization of core deposit intangibles from the fleetboston branch acquisition had a greater impact than the amortization of intangibles added as a result of the three acquisitions completed this year 
office supply expenses declined primarily because of improved purchasing cost controls in and escalated expense levels in early arising from the integration of the acquired fleetboston branches 
acquisition and unusual expenses totaled  in  down from  in these expenditures were primarily comprised of legal and consulting fees of   of system conversion costs and  of other general administrative expenses 
the majority of these expenses was incurred in conjunction with the company s largest acquisition of  grange national banc corp  in november as displayed in table above  recurring operating expenses in increased million or in comparison to as was the case in  the rise in was predominately caused by incremental expenses from acquired operations 
the increase in was substantially higher than the rise this year primarily due to including ten and a half months of additional expenses from a large scale acquisition fleetboston branches  versus having only one and half months of incremental expenses from a relatively large acquisition  grange 
in addition  the two acquisitions made under the purchase method of accounting in citizens and the fleetboston branches were larger than the three acquisitions made this year million of assets and deposits vs 
million 
the cumulative effect of these six acquisitions was the major contributor to the million of increased recurring operating expenses in in comparison to  a modest increase in light of the million growth in recurring operating income over the same time period 
income taxes the company estimates its tax expense based on the amount it expects to owe the respective tax authorities  plus the impact of deferred tax items 
taxes are discussed in more detail in note i of the consolidated financial statements on page accrued taxes represent the net estimated amount due or to be received from taxing authorities 
in estimating accrued taxes  management assesses the relative merits and risks of the appropriate tax treatment of transactions taking into account statutory  judicial and regulatory guidance in the context of the company s tax position 
if the final resolution of taxes payable differs from our estimates due to regulatory determination or legislative or judicial actions  adjustments to tax expense may be required 
the effective tax rate for declined by percentage points to 
this decline was primarily due to the benefits realized on a larger proportion of income from tax exempt investment securities 
in addition  the amount of nondeductible merger expenses declined in the effective tax rate for of was down from the rate in this decline was primarily due to the benefits realized on a larger proportion of income from tax exempt investment securities  which mitigated the effect of the near doubling of income before tax 
in addition  the adoption of sfas and  the reduced level of nondeductible merger expenses in compared with  and a federal low income housing tax credit claimed in  all contributed to the decline in the effective tax rate last year 
capital shareholders equity ended at million  up million or from one year earlier 
this increase reflects of common stock issued in conjunction with the acquisition of grange  net income of and million from the issuance of shares through employee stock plans 
these factors were partially offset by common dividends declared of million  treasury share purchases of million and a million decline in the market value adjustment mva  represents the after tax  unrealized change in value of available for sale securities in the company s investment portfolio 
excluding the mva in both and  capital rose by million or

the company s ratio of tier i capital to assets or tier i leverage ratio  the basic measure for which regulators have established a minimum to be considered well capitalized  increased basis points in to 
this was due to the net issuance of common stock and the capital building contribution from retained earnings net income less dividends declared more than offsetting both the organic and acquired growth of the investment and loan portfolios 
the tangible equity tangible assets ratio was at the end of versus one year earlier  with the decline in mva having a negative basis point impact on this ratio mva is excluded from tier i ratios 
cbsi manages organic and acquired growth in a manner that enables it to continue to build upon its strong capital base  and maintain the company s ability to take advantage of future strategic growth opportunities 
cash dividends declared on common stock in of million represented an increase of over the prior year 
this growth was mostly a result of dividends per share of for increasing from in due to quarterly dividends per share being raised from to in the third quarter of and from to in the third quarter of the increase in dollar amount of dividends declared also reflects an increase in the number of shares outstanding at the end of this year  primarily a result of the million shares issued in november to grange shareholders 
the dividend payout ratio for this year was compared to in and in  and near the top of cbsi s targeted payout range for dividends on common stock of 
the company s payout ratio has historically been high relative to peers  and for first nine months of the ratio of was well above the peer median of 
as previously noted  the primary reason for the higher payout ratio in versus was the charges for early retirement of debt in and the significant increases in the dividends per share in the third quarters of both years 
the payout ratio was substantially lower in than in despite higher dividends per share vs 

this was a result of the increase in net income in  which was largely due to higher interest earning assets  an improved net interest margin in  and considerably more acquisition related expenses in liquidity due to the potential for unexpected fluctuations in deposits and loans  active management of the company s liquidity is critical 
in order to respond to these circumstances  adequate sources of both on and off balance sheet funding are in place 
the bank s primary approach to measuring liquidity is known as the basic surplus deficit model 
it is used to calculate liquidity over two time periods first  the amount of cash that could be made available within days calculated as liquid assets less short term liabilities  and second  a projection of subsequent cash availability over an additional days 
the minimum policy level of liquidity under the basic surplus deficit approach is of total assets for both the and day time horizons 
as of december   this ratio was and for the respective time periods  excluding the company s capacity to borrow additional funds from the federal home loan bank and other sources 
there is currently million in additional federal home loan bank borrowing capacity based on the bank s year end collateral levels 
additionally  the bank has million in unused capacity at the federal reserve bank and million in unused capacity from an unsecured line of credit with first tennessee bank  na to measure longer term liquidity  a baseline projection of loan and deposit growth for five years is made to reflect how liquidity levels could change over time 
this five year measure reflects ample liquidity for loan growth over the next five years 
intangible assets intangible assets at the end of of million were up million from the prior year end due to the additional intangible assets arising from the acquisitions from peoples  harbridge and grange  offset by million of amortization during the year 
intangible assets consist of goodwill  core deposit value and customer relationships arising from acquisitions 
goodwill represents the excess cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired 
goodwill at december  equaled million  comprised of million related to banking acquisitions and million arising from the acquisition of financial services businesses 
goodwill is subjected to an annual impairment analysis to determine whether the carrying value of the acquired net assets exceeds their fair value  which would necessitate a write down of the goodwill 
the company completed its goodwill impairment analyses during and and no adjustments were necessary 
the impairment analysis was based upon discounted cash flow modeling techniques that require management to make estimates regarding the amount and timing of expected future cash flows 
it also requires them to select a discount rate that reflects the current return requirements of the market in relation to present risk free interest rates  required equity market premiums and company specific risk indicators 
management believes that there is very low probability of future impairment with regard to the goodwill associated with whole bank acquisitions 
the performance of elias asset management weakened subsequent to its acquisition in as a result of adverse market conditions in and continued declines in eam s operating results may result in impairment to its recorded goodwill of million 
core deposit intangibles represent the premium the company has paid for deposits acquired in excess of the cost incurred had the funds been purchased in the capital markets 
core deposit intangibles are amortized on either an accelerated or straight line basis over periods ranging from seven to nineteen years 
the recognition of a customer relationship intangible arose due to the acquisition of harbridge 
this asset was determined based on a methodology that calculates the present value of the projected future revenue derived from the acquired customer base 
this asset is being amortized over eleven years on an accelerated basis

the acquisitions of grange and peoples accounted for million of that growth 
excluding the impact of these acquisitions at time of completion  total loans rose million or 
this growth was attributable to the new york market  with the pennsylvania market experiencing a net decline in loans outstanding 
based on overall asset liability analysis  the decision was made to discontinue selling secondary market eligible mortgages with terms greater than years in the third quarter of mortgages with shorter terms were already being held in portfolio 
the secondary market activity in the first half of resulted in million of sales versus million in the latter part of last year 
had these loans not been sold in  loan growth excluding acquisitions would have been million or 
the compounded annual growth rate cagr for cbsi s total loan portfolio between and was  with approximately of the growth coming from whole bank and branch acquisitions and the balance from organic growth 
the greatest overall expansion occurred in the consumer mortgage segment  which grew at an cagr including the impact of acquisitions over that time frame 
the consumer mortgage growth was primarily driven by record mortgage refinancing volumes over the last two years  as well as the acquisition of consumer oriented banks in the intervening period 
the other loan categories grew at compounded annual growth rates of between and from to as a consequence  the consumer mortgages segment accounted for of the total loan portfolio at year end versus at the end of the weighting of retail lending in the company s loan portfolio enables it to be highly diversified 
approximately of loans outstanding at the end of were made to consumers borrowing on an installment and residential mortgage loan basis 
this proportion increased from at year end and at the end of this was principally due to the strong growth of residential mortgages in and  the addition of people s loan portfolio consumer and the tempered organic growth in the business lending segment over the last few years due to soft economic conditions in our primary markets 
there is also a high degree of diversification within the business lending segment of the portfolio 
the company s business loans are typically for amounts under  which account for about of the number of business loans and approximately of business loan balances as of december  approximately of the business portfolio is comprised of loans between  and  about of the number of loans  while loans over  account for the remaining of ending balances of the number of loans 
the commercial portfolio is also broadly diversified by industry type as demonstrated by the following distributions at year end real estate development  healthcare  general services  motor vehicle and parts dealers  agriculture  restaurant lodging  retail trade  construction  manufacturing and wholesale trade 
a variety of other industries with less than a share of the total portfolio comprise the remaining 
table breaks down the company s loan portfolio into four major lines of business 
including loans added through acquisitions  million of loan growth in was comprised of increases of million in consumer mortgages  million in business loans and million in consumer indirect loans  offset by a million decrease in consumer direct loans outstanding 
excluding the impact of acquisitions  the increase in consumer mortgages contributed million of the million in total loan growth in  and consumer indirect loans accounted for million 
conversely  consumer direct and business loan balances were down million and million from year end levels  respectively 
the consumer mortgage segment of the company s loan portfolio is comprised of fixed and adjustable rate residential lending 
approximately million of the million growth in consumer mortgages was attributable to the acquisition of grange and peoples 
excluding the impact of these acquisitions  this segment was up million or in due to record mortgage volumes driven by this year s historically low interest rate environment 
all of the organic growth was generated in the new york market  as pennsylvania experienced net run off in despite a significant volume of new originations 
growth in the consumer mortgage portfolio would have been if the sale of longer term  fixed rate mortgages in the secondary market had not been conducted in the first three quarters of these mortgages were sold in the secondary market to improve the company s interest rate risk position 
the combined total of general purpose business lending  dealer floor plans  mortgages on commercial property  and farm loans is characterized as the company s business lending activity 
approximately million in business loans added through the grange acquisition offset the million decrease from ongoing operations in all of this decrease was attributable to the pennsylvania market before the acquisition of grange  with the new york market generating marginal increases 
lending efforts in first liberty s traditional markets excluding grange s coverage continue to be challenged by a slow economic recovery  diminished capital spending levels in the commercial sector and an extremely competitive pricing environment 
management has worked aggressively to address the loan generation challenges in pennsylvania by adding lending talent  resources  and strong business relationships via completed grange and pending first heritage acquisitions 
the enhanced scale and coverage of the pennsylvania business combined with the new management team s re focused commitment to business development efforts  should position them to fully take advantage of growth opportunities in this key market as economic conditions improve and increased capital spending leads to expanded borrowing activity in the commercial sector 
installment loans indirectly originated through automobile and recreational vehicle dealers increased by or million in all of the consumer indirect loan growth was organic in nature acquired banks did not provide these loans  primarily reflecting successful business development efforts that have increased both the number and strength of the company s dealer relationships and ability to deliver attractive financing rates 
ninety two percent of this loan segment is comprised of automobile loans of the vehicles are used and are new 
consumer indirect loan growth was generated in both the new york and pennsylvania markets 
consumer direct loans are comprised of conventional installment loans  personal loans  student loans which are sold once principal repayment begins  and variable and fixed rate home equity loans and lines of credit 
this loan segment decreased or million in excluding the addition of million of consumer direct loans through the acquisition of grange and peoples  this segment was down or million 
loan balances fell in both the new york and pennsylvania markets  as installment loans were paid off during the year through the use of funds made available through mortgage refinancing 
competitive conditions are quite intense in this loan category  particularly with regard to home equity lending 
management is dedicated to developing new marketing and pricing strategies in order to generate significant new business in this attractive segment of the market

this is consistent with the  and mix for the equivalent maturity categories at year end  respectively 
the proportional increase in loans maturing after five years was due to the growth in the consumer mortgage segment of the portfolio  which generally carry longer weighted average maturities 
the following table sets forth the profile of the loan portfolio with regard to maturity and the type of interest rate table loan sensitivity at december  s omitted fixed rate variable rate total due in one year or less    due after one year but within five years    due after five years but within fifteen years    due after fifteen years    total loans    table above reflects the nature of the company s loan portfolio in relation to the mix of maturities and interest rate characteristics 
at year end of loans had fixed interest rates  and the that have variable rates consist primarily of home equity and commercial loans 
this is very close to the mix profile of the loan portfolio at the end of there was relatively even distribution of the portfolio between loans with maturities below and above years at and at december   respectively

as shown in table above  non performing loans  defined as non accruing loans plus accruing loans days or more past due  ended at million  up approximately million or from one year earlier 
this was primarily due to the addition of acquired loans as well as increases in existing commercial loan non accruals 
the ratio of non performing loans to total loans declined two basis points from twelve months earlier to 
as of september   when the non performing loan ratio stood at  the company s position was favorable to the peer level of 
the ratio of non performing assets which includes troubled debt restructuring and other real estate  or oreo  in addition to non performing loans to total loans plus oreo decreased to at year end  down two basis points from one year earlier 
the improvement in both ratios was driven by improvements in the economy  enhanced collection and recovery efforts  the charge off of problem loans over the last two years  a reduced proportion of commercial loans  and the acquisition of grange  which had a lower level of non performing assets than the overall portfolio 
had nonaccrual loans as of december  been current in accordance with their original terms  interest income of approximately  would have been recorded

these measures were  and as of september   and compared to median peer levels of   and  respectively 
the total delinquency ratio of was slightly favorable to the peer ratio of at september  delinquency levels  particularly in the to days category tend to be somewhat volatile due to them being measured at a point in time  and therefore it is useful to look at this ratio over a longer period 
the total average delinquency ratio for the company for the end of the last three months of was  five basis points below the previous three month period  and the average ratio for the four quarters of end of period basis was versus in the prior year 
the changes in the allowance for loan losses for the last five years is as follows table allowance for loan loss activity years ended december  s omitted amount of loans outstanding at end of period      daily average amount of loans net of unearned discount      allowance for loan losses at beginning of year      charge offs business lending     consumer mortgage consumer direct      consumer indirect      total charge offs      recoveries business lending consumer mortgage consumer direct consumer indirect    total recoveries      net charge offs      provision for loan losses      allowance on acquired loans   allowance for loan losses at end of year      net charge offs to average loans outstanding this reserve addition is attributable to loans purchased from peoples bankcorp inc and grange national banc corp in and citizens national bank of malone and fleetboston financial corporation in as displayed in table above  total net charge offs in were million  up million from the prior year 
this increase was primarily driven by the significantly higher average loan balances resulting from both organic and acquired loan growth in  as well as business loans reserved for in prior periods being charged off during the year 
net charge offs in were million above s level  and were also impacted by the vastly increased size of the average loan portfolio  due mostly to the acquisition of fleetboston branches in november in addition  a prolonged period of economic weakness from late through early impacted the net charge off levels in both and  with the greatest impact being realized in the business loan segment 
due to the significant increase in average loan balances in and as a result of the factors mentioned above  net charge offs as a percent of average loans net charge off ratio offers a clearer representation of asset quality trends 
the net charge off ratio for was down two basis points from last year to 
this year s ratio benefited from improved recovery performance  as evidenced by the million increase in recoveries to million  representing of average gross charge offs for the latest two years  compared to in the net charge off ratio for the current year was also positively impacted by a higher proportion of low risk consumer mortgages in the portfolio  primarily due to the exceptionally strong growth of this segment of the portfolio in consumer mortgages accounted for of total average loans in versus in for the nine months ended september   the company s total net charge off ratio of was in the th percentile of the distribution surrounding a peer median of 
business loan net charge offs increased in  totaling million or of average business loans outstanding versus million and in the primary reason for the increased net charge off ratio for business loans was the lagged effect of an extended period of soft economic conditions in the markets served by the company  and the charge off of a number of large business loans that had been identified as weak and had been specifically reserved for in previous periods 
consumer direct loan net charge offs declined to million this year from million in  resulting in a five basis point drop in the net charge off ratio to 
net charge offs in the consumer indirect segment were up million to million in  but this was primarily due to loan growth as supported by the net charge off ratio rising only one basis point to 
the risk profile of new installment loans booked in was consistent with in relation to the credit quality of the borrowers 
seventy five percent of new installment lending volume in was rated as a and b paper  the two highest rankings in the standard a to d credit categories of fico scores considered by regulators to be prime borrowers 
this is comparable to the of installment loan originations rated as a and b in  and well above the of new loan volume in consumer mortgage net charge offs rose  to  due to the much larger size of the portfolio  and consequently the extremely low net charge off ratio of was essentially flat with the prior year 
all the primary asset quality metrics deteriorated in in comparison to the to period 
this was principally due to the weakened economic conditions in our markets  and was manifested most strongly in the business loan portfolio 
based on almost all measurements  the asset quality profile of the company improved in in conjunction with gradually improving economic conditions and strengthened credit administration and loan review resources 
significant changes and enhancements were made to these functions and related processes in  and these improvements began to have a positive impact on credit management performance over the course of the year 
management continually evaluates the credit quality of the company s loan portfolio and conducts a formal review of the allowance for loan loss adequacy on a quarterly basis 
the two primary components of the loan review process that are used to determine proper allowance levels are specific and general loan loss allocations 
measurement of specific loan loss allocations is typically based on expected future cash flows  collateral values and other factors that may impact the borrower s ability to pay 
impaired loans greater than  are evaluated for specific loan loss allocations  as defined in sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  as amended 
consumer mortgages and consumer direct and indirect loans are considered smaller balance homogeneous loans and are evaluated collectively 
the company considers a loan to be impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that the company will be unable to collect all amounts according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement or the loan is delinquent days or more 
the second component of the allowance establishment process  general loan loss allocations  is composed of two calculations that are computed on the four main loan segments commercial  consumer direct  consumer indirect and residential real estate 
the first calculation determines an allowance level based on the latest three years of historical net charge off data for each loan category 
the second calculation is qualitative and takes into consideration five major factors affecting the level of loan loss risk portfolio risk migration patterns internal credit quality trends  the growth of the segments of the loan portfolio  economic and business environment trends in the bank s markets includes review of bankruptcy  unemployment  population  consumer spending and regulatory trends  industry  geographical and product concentrations in the portfolio  and the perceived effectiveness of managerial resources and lending practices and policies 
these two allowance calculations are added together to determine the general allocation ratio  which is applied to the four homogenous loan pools excluding commercial loan balances with specific loan loss allocations 
the allowance levels computed from the specific and general loan loss allocation methods are combined to derive the necessary allowance for loan loss to be reflected on the consolidated statement of condition 
the loan loss provision is calculated by subtracting the previous period allowance for loan loss  net of the interim period net charge offs  from the current required allowance level 
this provision is then booked as an expense in the income statement for that period 
the loan review department  senior credit officers  executive management and the loan committee of the board of directors all examine the results of the allowance for loan loss process in detail and determine if it is adequate each quarter 
management is committed to continually improving the credit assessment and risk management capabilities of the bank and will dedicate the resources necessary to ensure advancement in this critical area of operations 
the allowance for loan loss was increased to million at year end from million at the end of the million increase was mostly due to million more loans outstanding  offset by less risk in the loan portfolio due to a higher mix of consumer mortgages and an overall improvement in the company s asset quality position 
this change in the risk profile is reflected in the ratio of the allowance for loan loss to total loans  which decreased to for year end versus at the end of last year 
as of september   the company s reserve ratio of was basis points below the peer median  while the coverage of non performing loans allowance for loan loss non performing loans at was in the rd percentile 
management believes the year end allowance for loan losses to be adequate in light of the probable losses inherent in the company s loan portfolio 
the loan loss provision decreased by million or in as a result of management s assessment of the probable losses in the loan portfolio as discussed above 
the loan loss provision as a percentage of average loans decreased from in to this year in most part due to the provision last year being elevated to cover higher risk levels in the business loan segment of the portfolio 
the loan loss provision covered net charge offs by this year versus in  reflective of the shift in loan mix and asset quality trends during the year 
the net charge off ratios of the last two years were above the company s long term historical levels  which were more consistent with the ratios of the to period  as shown in table above 
as previously noted  there is a strong correlation between the increased level of net charge offs in and and the performance of the overall economy 
the company s net charge off ratio was also above basis points during the to period  when the ratio fluctuated between and basis points 
not surprisingly  similar to the last three years  that time frame included a recession and the first stage of an economic recovery 
the net charge off ratio dropped significantly in the years immediately following that period 
one of management s primary goals is to steadily bring the net charge off ratio back to a range that is consistent with historical performance 
the following table shows management s allocation of the allowance for loan losses by loan type as of december table allowance for loan losses by loan type amount of loan amount of loan amount of loan s omitted allowance mix allowance mix allowance mix consumer mortgage  business lending    consumer direct and indirect    unallocated total    amount of loan amount of loan s omitted allowance mix allowance mix consumer mortgage   business lending   consumer direct and indirect   unallocated   total   as demonstrated in table above and discussed previously  the risk inherit in the consumer mortgage portfolio is much lower than that of the other segments of the loan portfolio 
the risk differential is illustrated by the average net charge off ratio of over the last three years for consumer mortgages compared to the average for the rest of the portfolio over the same time frame 
this is manifested in the comparatively small  allowance attributable to consumer mortgages  representing only of the their ending balance versus for the remaining portion of the loan portfolio 
table also shows that the weighting of consumer mortgages has increased from an average of of total loans in and to in average balance basis due to strong organic growth in this segment in and as demonstrated by the factors noted above  this shift in the mix of loans toward low risk mortgages has been beneficial to the company s credit risk profile and has helped offset some of the weakness that developed in the business portion of the portfolio  primarily due to difficult economic conditions 
funding sources the company utilizes a variety of funding sources to support the earning asset base as well as to achieve targeted growth objectives 
cbsi s overall funding is comprised of three primary sources that possess a variety of maturity  stability  and price characteristics deposits of individuals  partnerships and corporations ipc deposits  collateralized municipal deposits public funds  and external borrowings 
the average daily amount of deposits and the average rate paid on each of the following deposit categories is summarized below for the years indicated table average deposits average average average average average average s omitted  except rates balance rate paid balance rate paid balance rate paid non interest bearing demand deposits    interest bearing demand deposits    regular savings deposits    money market deposits    time deposits    total deposits    as displayed in table above  total average deposits for equaled billion  up million or from the prior year 
the acquisitions of people and grange did not have a significant impact on full year average deposit levels because they were completed relatively late in the year 
average deposits in were up significantly versus million or primarily as a result of the acquisition of fleetboston branches in november that added million of deposits 
the company s funding composition continues to benefit from a high level of ipc deposits  which reached an all time high in with a fourth quarter average of billion  an increase of million or over the comparable period 
this was largely due to the million in ipc deposits added in conjunction with the acquisitions of peoples and grange in september and november  respectively 
ipc deposits are frequently considered to be a bank s most attractive source of funding because they are generally stable  do not need to be collateralized  have a relatively low cost  and provide a strong customer base for which a variety of loan  deposit and other financial service related products can be sold 
full year average deposits of local municipalities decreased million or during  despite the additional public funds acquired through the grange transaction 
under new york state municipal law  the company is required to collateralize all local government deposits with marketable securities from its investment portfolio 
because of this stipulation  management considers this source of funding to be equivalent to external borrowings 
as such  cbsi endeavors to price these deposits at or below alternative external borrowing rates 
municipal deposits decreased due to the favorability of the aforementioned external borrowing rates in comparison to competitive pricing of the public fund deposits 
it should be noted that utilization of municipal deposits has generally been flat to down over the last few years as a percent of total funding sources 
the mix of cbsi s average deposits in changed slightly in comparison to the weightings of demand deposit  interest checking and savings account balances all increased from their levels  while money market and time deposit weightings decreased 
this change in mix largely reflects less willingness by certain customers to being locked into low cd rates and accounts with higher minimum balance requirements money market given the market driven contraction of interest rate spreads between these accounts and less restrictive ones  such as demand deposits and savings 
this shift in the deposit mix resulted in a greater drop in the overall cost of funds on deposits than would have been achieved through the reduction of interest rates alone 
as a result of market interest rates remaining at historically low levels for an extended period of time  spreads between these groups of accounts have stabilized and customers appear to be more willing to hold term deposits given the lack of viable alternatives with similar risk return characteristics 
this factor combined with the company s ongoing commitment to continually expand its advantageous ipc deposit base to fund earning asset growth  prompted the development of a new cd product in september that has been an effective tool for attracting new time deposits 
the remaining maturities of time deposits in amounts of  or more outstanding as of december are as follows table time deposit  maturities s omitted less than three months   three months to six months   six months to one year   over one years   total   external borrowings are defined as funding sources available on a national market basis  generally requiring some form of collateralization 
borrowing sources for the company include the federal home loan bank of new york and federal reserve bank of new york  as well as access to the national repurchase agreement market through established relationships with primary market security dealers 
the company also had approximately million in fixed and floating rate subordinated debt outstanding at the end of that is held by unconsolidated subsidiary trusts 
external borrowings averaged million or of total funding sources for all of  essentially equivalent to levels 
as shown in table below  at year end  million or of external borrowings had remaining terms of one year or less  up considerably from million and at the end of this change in external funding mix was undertaken to take advantage of an extremely steep yield curve and protect the company from falling interest rates  its greatest interest rate risk exposure 
during fourth quarter  million in longer term federal home loan bank borrowings were retired early and replaced with significantly lower rate  short term debt  resulting in an earnings charge of million 
a similar strategy was executed in fourth quarter when approximately million of intermediate term fhlb borrowings were prepaid  resulting in a prepayment penalty of  both of these strategies were implemented because the projected cost of the replacement debt  including prepayment charges  was favorable on a long term  economic basis in comparison to holding the existing borrowings 
as displayed in table on page  the overall mix of funding has shifted somewhat over the past two years as a result of two major factors 
first  the acquisitions completed during the to period supplied a substantial amount of deposits  but added insignificant levels of external borrowings  enabling the company to fund the majority of its earning asset growth with this favorable funding source 
consequently  the percentage of funding derived from deposits was in on a full year average balance basis  percentage points higher than it was in this was despite the fact that the most recent acquisition  grange did not close until late november  and therefore its impact on the average funding mix was less pronounced in than it will be in a second major development was that from january through mid market interest rates declined significantly  largely influenced by the federal reserve actions designed to stimulate a weakened us economy 
in addition  short term interest rates declined by a much greater degree than long rates  resulting in a much steeper yield curve 
management effectively responded to the changes in the interest rate environment by reducing deposit rates in a timely manner and greatly increasing the weighting of short term borrowings in the external funding portion of the balance sheet 
these moves contributed significantly to the percentage point drop in external borrowing costs and percentage point decline in the cost of total interest bearing liabilities from to the following table summarizes the outstanding balance of short term borrowings of the company as of december table short term borrowings s omitted  except rates federal funds purchased    term borrowings at banks original term days or less    over days  capital lease obligations balance at end of period    daily average during the year    maximum month end balance    weighted average rate during the year year end average rate the following table shows the maturities of various contractual obligations as of december  table maturities of contractual obligations amount amount maturing maturing after after three amount one years amount maturing year but but maturing within within within after one year three five five s omitted or less years years years total time deposits     federal funds purchased   federal home loan bank advances     subordinated debt held by unconsolidated subsidiary trusts   other borrowings operating leases      total      financial instruments with off balance sheet risk the company is a party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers 
these financial instruments consist primarily of commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit 
commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to customers  generally having fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses that may require payment of a fee 
these commitments consist principally of unused commercial and consumer credit lines 
standby letters of credit generally are contingent upon the failure of the customer to perform according to the terms of the underlying contract with the third party 
the credit risk associated with commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved with the extending loans to customers and is subject to normal credit policies 
collateral may be obtained based on management s assessment of the customer s creditworthiness 
the contract amount of these off balance sheet financial instruments as of december is as follows table off balance sheet financial instruments s omitted standby letters of credit   commitments to extend credit   total   investments the objective of cbsi s investment portfolio is to hold low risk  high quality earning assets that provide favorable returns and another effective tool to actively manage its asset liability position to maximize future net interest income production 
this must be accomplished within the following constraints a implementing certain interest rate risk management strategies which achieve a relatively stable level of net interest income  b providing both the regulatory and operational liquidity necessary to conduct day to day business activities  c considering investment risk weights as determined by the regulatory risk based capital guidelines  and d generating a favorable return without undue compromise of the other requirements 
as displayed in table below  the book value of cbsi s investment portfolio increased million or during the year to billion as a result of million of strategic capital market purchases made primarily in the second half of  offset by planned investment run off and very limited sales 
average investment balances book value basis for were down million or versus the prior year 
this decline was primarily a result of the de leveraging policy that was in place in the first half of  whereby investments were allowed to run off and the proceeds were used to pay down external borrowing until investments opportunities became more attractive 
this approach enabled the company to avoid adding investments at unfavorable spreads while also building its capital position in order to improve its ability to make future strategic investments 
investment interest income in was million or lower than the prior year as a result of the reduced average balances in the portfolio  and the drop in the average investment yield from to 
the decline in the yield was primarily due to the general run off of securities from the portfolio that been issued in the higher interest rate environments of previous periods and were partially replaced in the second half of the year with investments that carry comparatively lower yields 
this was inevitable given the fact that longer term market interest rates  despite modest increases in the third quarter of  were still at historically low levels 
however  the impact of lower investment yields was mostly offset by the funding of the purchases with very low rate short term borrowings  resulting in similar net spreads 
in an annual study conducted by investment performance digest ipd on banking results nationwide  cbsi ranked in the th percentile for one year total returns yield plus change in market value on its investment portfolio 
in order to protect the company against its exposure to falling interest rates  the vast majority of the investment purchases in were in intermediate term us agency securities with average call protection in excess of six years 
investments sales in the current year totaled less than million and were all related to securities inherited from acquired companies  and resulted in an immaterial amount of net losses 
the sales were based on the company s total return strategy see below or to remove securities that no longer adhere to investment policy guidelines 
those proceeds that were reinvested resulted in an improved interest rate risk position 
as of december  the investment portfolio had a weighted average life of years 
the investment portfolio has very limited credit risk due to the composition continuing to heavily favor us agency debentures  us agency mortgage backed pass throughs  us agency cmos and municipal bonds insured by third parties 
as of year end  these four aaa rated highest possible rating security types accounted for of the portfolio s total book value  excluding federal home loan bank stock and federal reserve bank stock  or   and respectively 
these four security types also comprised of total investments as of december  at   and  respectively 
the change in the investment mix reflects management s strategy over the last two years of primarily purchasing medium term  call protected us agency and municipal bonds that offer both attractive yields and are free from short term reinvestment risk 
mbs and cmo securities typically possess a high level of this latter risk  particularly in periods with high levels of mortgage refinancing such as have existed over the last few years in the extremely low interest rate environment 
as a consequence  the company has avoided investing in these types of securities during this period  and this fact combined with high run off rates explains the significant drop in their weighting in the total investment portfolio 
since  the company has utilized total return as its primary methodology for managing investment portfolio assets 
under this analytical method  shareholder value is maximized through both interest income and market value appreciation 
the commitment to this approach is reflected in the fact that no security sales were conducted in outside of minor transactions associated with the investments of acquired banks  despite the significant level of market gains in the portfolio see mva discussion in the following paragraph 
management chose not to take gains in the current year to increase short term earnings at the expense of profitability in future periods 
the effectiveness of the company s strategic long term planning focus is evidenced by its total return of for the five year period ending september   which placed it in the extremely favorable th peer percentile of the ipd study referenced above 
in recent years nearly all of the company s investments were classified as available for sale  but in a majority of the purchases made in the second half of the year were categorized as held to maturity investments 
eighty nine percent of the investment portfolio was classified as available for sale at year end versus at the end of the two previous years

impact of inflation and changing prices the company s financial statements have been prepared in terms of historical dollars  without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on a financial institution s performance than the effect of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services 
notwithstanding this  inflation can directly affect the value of loan collateral  in particular real estate

item a 
quanitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss in a financial instrument arising from adverse changes in market rates  prices or credit risk 
credit risk associated with the company s loan portfolio has been previously discussed in the asset quality section of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
although more than a third of the securities portfolio at year end was invested in municipal bonds  management believes that the tax risk of the company s municipal investments associated with potential future changes in statutory  judicial and regulatory actions is minimal 
the company has an insignificant amount of credit risk in its investment portfolio because essentially all of the fixed income securities in the portfolio are aaa rated highest possible rating 
therefore  almost all the market risk in the investment portfolio is related to interest rates 
the ongoing monitoring and management of both interest rate risk and liquidity  in the short and long term time horizons is an important component of the company s asset liability management process  which is governed by limits established in the policies reviewed and approved annually by the board of directors 
the board of directors delegates responsibility for carrying out the policies to the asset liability committee alco which meets each month and is made up of the company s senior management as well as regional and line of business managers who oversee specific earning asset classes and various funding sources 
as the company does not believe it is possible to reliably predict future interest rate movements  it has maintained an appropriate process and set of measurement tools which enable it to identify and quantify sources of interest rate risk in varying rate environments 
the primary tool used by the company in managing interest rate risk is income simulation 
while a wide variety of strategic balance sheet and treasury yield curve scenarios are tested on an ongoing basis  the following reflects the company s one year net interest income sensitivity based on o asset and liability levels using december  as a starting point 
o there are assumed to be conservative levels of balance sheet growth low to mid single digit growth in loans  investments and deposits  augmented by necessary changes in borrowings and retained earnings  with no growth in other major portions of the balance sheet 
o the prime rate and federal funds rates are assumed to move up basis points and down basis points over a month period while flattening the long end of the treasury curve to spreads over federal funds that are more consistent with historical norms 
deposit rates are assumed to move in a manner that reflects the historical relationship between deposit rate movement and changes in the federal funds rate  generally reflecting of the movement of the federal funds rate 
o cash flows are based on contractual maturity  optionality and amortization schedules along with applicable prepayments derived from internal historical data and external sources 
net interest income sensitivity model calculated increase decrease in projected net interest income at december change in interest rates basis points   basis points   the change from largely reflects the increase in intermediate term us agency investments with an average call protection of greater than years 
the addition of these investments which were funded relatively short reduced the net interest income as rates rise but improves the net interest income if rates were unchanged or decline 
in the model  both the rising and falling rate environments reflect a reduction in net interest income nii from a flat rate environment due to the assumed flattening of the yield curve 
the modeled nii in a falling rate environment is initially more favorable than if rates were to rise due to a faster initial reaction from core deposit pricing and short term capital market borrowing rates 
over a longer time period  however  the growth in nii improves significantly in a rising rate environment as a result of lower yielding earning assets running off and being replaced at increased rates 
the analysis does not represent a company forecast and should not be relied upon as being indicative of expected operating results 
these hypothetical estimates are based upon numerous assumptions the nature and timing of interest rate levels including yield curve shape  prepayments on loans and securities  deposit decay rates  pricing decisions on loans and deposits  reinvestment replacement of asset and liability cash flows  and other factors 
while the assumptions are developed based upon current economic and local market conditions  the company cannot make any assurances as to the predictive nature of these assumptions  including how customer preferences or competitor influences might change 
furthermore  the sensitivity analysis does not reflect actions that alco might take in responding to or anticipating changes in interest rates
