general adic is a leading provider of intelligent storage solutions for the open systems marketplace 
we design  market  sell and support hardware and software products that help a broad range of business and governmental organizations manage  access and protect their large scale data more effectively 
currently  we derive substantially all of our revenue from the sale of storage libraries  connectivity and management products and related services and support 
we distribute our products primarily through value added resellers vars  distributors and oems  and also sell directly to certain end users 
our general fiscal trends include record revenues during each quarter  increased sales of software and other higher margin enterprise level products  which increased gross profit to in fiscal from in fiscal  and the introduction of new intelligent storage solutions like the scalar i tape library 
during the same period  we increased our investments in research and development and sales and marketing  which has resulted in growth in our connectivity and software product offerings along with increasing our market penetration 
our general and administrative expenses increased only in fiscal even as we experienced much higher revenue growth 
we will continue to grow our product offerings with a focus on elements that both differentiate our products from competitors and meet increasing customer demands in a constantly evolving and competitive industry 
our ability to serve broader markets with enterprise level products and software will be key to our future success 
we believe continued investment in sales and marketing and research and development is required in order to successfully penetrate new markets and customers and expand our offerings 
the competition in our industry is strong and we must constantly work to reduce the cost of our existing products while retaining high quality standards and reliability 
certain entry level products have been outsourced to third party manufacturers to allow us to take advantage of our suppliers economies of scale for our higher volume  lower margin products 
since  in addition to our increased investment in internal research and development  we have made four acquisitions that enabled us to acquire new technologies 
these technologies include storage area network san software  other proprietary hardware and software technology that allow users to deploy sans  and disk based data protection products for the open systems market 
in addition to acquiring new technologies 
the acquisitions allowed us to expand our operations in europe  gained a global services organization  and added large libraries and proprietary software to our product offerings 
in october  we announced the signing of a letter of intent to expand an existing outsource manufacturing relationship with benchmark electronics  inc to include a significant portion of our entry level and workgroup tape automation product line 
in connection with this expansion  which was completed in november  we transferred to benchmark approximately team members associated with manufacturing  test and supply chain management for the transferred operations 
benchmark assumed the lease on our redmond  washington manufacturing facility and purchased inventory associated with the product line and property  plant and equipment related to the operation 
in november  these assets were transferred to benchmark for million in cash 
there was no gain or loss recorded on this transaction 
foreign currency gains or losses arise as a result of our operation of european subsidiaries  the functional currencies of which are the euro and british pound sterling 
all assets are recorded in the functional currencies on the financial statements of these subsidiaries 
some us dollar denominated receivables and payables in these subsidiaries offset each other to reduce our exposure to transaction gains and losses 
to the extent that these monetary assets and liabilities do not fully offset each other and the us dollar exchange rate changes with respect to these currencies  transaction gains or losses may result 
for large sales denominated in other currencies  we attempt to implement appropriate hedging strategies 
fiscal year compared to net sales 
net sales increased during fiscal to million from million in fiscal the increase is due to higher sales to both oem and branded customers 
annual growth rates of oem and branded sales during fiscal were and  respectively 
revenue from oem customers comprised of sales in fiscal compared to in fiscal adic branded revenues represented of sales in fiscal compared to in fiscal the growth in oem sales is due to a combination of increasing penetration with existing products and the addition of new products 
branded sales have increased in all major geographical markets in fiscal compared to fiscal the majority of this growth came in sales of enterprise level products and revenues from global services 
two customers accounted for fiscal revenues of million and million 
these same two customers accounted for fiscal revenues of million and million 
intelligent storage solutions iss products  which include elements of our software and connectivity technology and are sold through both branded and oem sales channels  represented of sales in fiscal compared to of sales in fiscal we believe that an increasing proportion of iss sales  whether sold on a branded or oem basis  will generally result in the likelihood of increasing gross margins as a percentage of sales  although this expected correlation may be overshadowed in any particular period by the specific mix of iss products or other factors 
net sales outside the united states accounted for of our net sales in fiscal and of our net sales in fiscal in fiscal  a portion of our net sales outside the united states was due to an oem customer for whom we maintained a revolver warehouse outside the united states 
during fiscal  all of the sales to this oem customer shifted to a revolver warehouse within the united states  which caused a decline in the reported percentage of non us sales 
this decline was partially offset by an increase in sales to european and asian customers 
cost of sales 
cost of sales was million or of net sales for fiscal compared to million or of net sales for fiscal gross profit margins depend on a number of factors  including customer and product mix  fixed infrastructure costs  price competition and tape drive costs 
for fiscal  gross profit was million or of net sales compared to million or of net sales for fiscal  an increase of on a net sales increase of 
the increase in gross profit in fiscal compared to fiscal is primarily a result of the absolute dollar increase in branded sales  including revenue from higher margin enterprise level products and software 
this increase was partially offset by the increase in the proportion of oem sales  which typically carry a lower gross margin than branded sales 
we believe gross margin will continue to improve as our product mix continues to become more heavily weighted toward higher margin products that include elements of our proprietary storage management software and connectivity technology and as we leverage our outsourced manufacturing relationships to achieve reductions in product costs 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses were million or of net sales for fiscal compared to million or of net sales for fiscal the absolute dollar increase is due to continued efforts to expand our sales and services channels in order to enter new markets and new customers and to support new product offerings 
during fiscal  we expect sales and marketing expenses to increase both domestically and in our european and other international markets as we focus on increased penetration of markets and customers and maintain our strategy of continuing to increase our sales of enterprise level products and software 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses were million or of net sales for fiscal compared to million or of net sales for fiscal the absolute dollar increase is attributable to an increase in overall compensation as a result of the company meeting certain incentive compensation targets and continued investments in our infrastructure  partially offset by decreases in bad debt expense 
in fiscal  bad debt expense was million  the majority of which was attributed to a single customer 
we expect very modest growth in general and administrative expenses during fiscal research and development expenses 
research and development expenses were million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal this represents a increase in our investment in research and development over our prior fiscal year 
in both years  research and development expenses were of net sales 
the increase in absolute dollars in fiscal reflects our strategy to maintain heavy investments in software and connectivity product development and relates to added personnel resources and additional spending related to new products 
additionally  in fiscal we recorded an increase in overall compensation as a result of incentive compensation 
we believe that significant investments in research and development are required to remain competitive and to solidify our market position in intelligent storage solutions 
we anticipate research and development spending to increase modestly in absolute dollars during fiscal as we continue to invest in new product development and enhancements to our current product lines 
further  we believe the potential for growth in the market for storage solutions is sufficient to justify continued growth in our investment in research and development 
acquisition expenses 
expenses related to our acquisition of v stor were million during fiscal these one time acquisition charges related to acquired in process research and development and compensation to v stor personnel 
other income 
other income primarily consists of net gain on securities transactions  interest income and net foreign currency transaction gains 
other income was million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal other income in fiscal includes a gain on securities transactions of million  which primarily relates to conversion of one of our investments in a private company to cash and marketable equity securities  and the subsequent sale of the majority of those securities 
in fiscal  other income included a gain on marketable securities transactions of million  which was offset by a  charge for impairment of an investment we held in a private technology company 
the gains realized in fiscal consisted of gains from the sale of derivative financial instruments on securities we held for investment as well as the sale of marketable securities 
interest income for fiscal was million compared to million for fiscal the decrease in interest income in fiscal is the result of lower returns on cash and investment balances during the year 
this decrease in interest income is partially offset by an increase in foreign currency transaction gains resulting from stronger european currencies 
we expect a decline in other income in fiscal  as we do not believe that we will experience the same level of gains on securities transactions as in fiscal additionally  our net foreign currency transaction gains losses are impacted by fluctuations in the currency markets  and there is no assurance that we will experience the same types of gains on these transactions as in fiscal provision benefit for income taxes 
we had income tax expense of million in fiscal compared to income tax benefit of million in fiscal in fiscal we had an effective tax expense of and in fiscal we had an effective tax benefit of 
the relatively low tax rate in fiscal reflects the tax benefits of our credit for research and development spending  our extraterritorial income exclusion and non taxable interest income  and such rate is not expected to be sustainable as profitability increases 
it is reasonable to anticipate that our long term tax rate will be closer to statutory rates 
as a result of our near breakeven taxable income in  taxes paid in various federal  state and international jurisdictions were exceeded by the tax benefits related to the three items described above 
fiscal year compared to net sales 
net sales decreased during fiscal to million from million in fiscal the decrease was primarily attributable to reduced sales of entry level products 
revenue from oems was million or of total revenue for fiscal and million or of total revenue for fiscal oem sales remained relatively flat in fiscal as the decrease in revenue from entry level products was offset by an increase in revenue from our scalar product family 
sales to branded customers decreased in fiscal to million from million in fiscal this decline in branded revenue was primarily due to the shift in sales of small and mid size libraries to oems and weak market conditions 
this decline was partially offset by an increase in revenue from global services 
two customers accounted for fiscal revenues of million and million 
these same two customers accounted for fiscal revenues of million and million 
iss represented of sales in fiscal compared to of sales in fiscal net sales outside the united states accounted for of our net sales in fiscal and of our net sales in fiscal in fiscal  a significant portion of our net sales outside the united states was due to an oem customer for whom we maintained a revolver warehouse outside the united states 
during fiscal  a significant amount of sales to this oem customer shifted to a revolver warehouse within the united states  which caused a decline in the reported percentage of non us sales 
cost of sales 
cost of sales was million or of net sales for fiscal compared to million or of net sales for fiscal our quarterly gross profit margins increased sequentially throughout fiscal year our gross margin in the fourth quarter of fiscal was million on million of net sales compared to a gross margin of million on million of net sales in the first quarter of fiscal this increase in margin in the fourth quarter was primarily due to a decrease in the percentage of total sales attributable to oems 
oem sales in the fourth quarter were versus of total sales in the first quarter of fiscal additionally  margins increased as our sales mix shifted towards iss related revenue 
an increase in fixed costs associated with our investment in our infrastructure  including our global information system and our facilities  had an offsetting impact to the trend in margin improvement 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses were million or of net sales for fiscal compared to million or of net sales for fiscal the dollar and percentage increases were due to continued efforts to expand our sales and services channels to support new product offerings and improve market penetration with our more complex enterprise level products 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses were million or of net sales for fiscal compared to million or of net sales for fiscal the dollar and percentage increases were due to continued investment in our infrastructure  including our global information system  as well as increases in recession related costs such as bad debt and severance expense 
in fiscal  bad debt expense was million  the majority of which was attributed to a single customer 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses were million or of net sales for fiscal compared to million or of net sales for fiscal the increase in percentage and absolute dollars in fiscal reflected our strategy to maintain heavy investments in software and connectivity product development and related to added personnel resources and additional spending related to new products 
acquisition expenses 
in fiscal  we incurred charges of million for acquired in process research and development and compensation to personnel in connection with our acquisition of v stor 
in fiscal  we incurred a charge reducing gross profit by million for the write off of certain inventory deemed non salable due to the pathlight merger and an accrual for contractual liability to a third party 
in addition  we incurred charges of million for investment banker and financial advisory fees  other professional fees  team member costs which related to termination of certain team members with redundant job functions and relocation costs  and other merger related expenses 
other income 
other income primarily consisted of interest income  gain loss on securities transactions and net foreign currency transaction gains 
other income was million for fiscal compared to  for fiscal other income in fiscal included a gain on marketable securities transactions of million  which was offset by a  charge for impairment of an investment we held in a private technology company 
in fiscal  other income included an million write down of our strategic investment portfolio  offset by a gain on marketable securities transactions of million 
interest income for fiscal was million compared to million for fiscal the decrease in interest income was the result of lower returns on cash and investment balances during fiscal this decrease in interest income was partially offset by an increase in foreign currency transaction gains resulting from stronger european currencies 
benefit for income taxes 
we had a benefit for income taxes of million in fiscal compared to million for fiscal as a result of our near breakeven taxable income in  taxes paid in various federal  state and international jurisdictions were exceeded by the tax benefits of our credit for research and development spending  our extraterritorial income exclusion and non taxable interest income 
during fiscal  we did not get the full tax rate benefit relating to our loss because our effective income tax rate was negatively affected by certain non deductible expenses associated with the acquisition of pathlight 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows provided by operating activities were million for fiscal and million for fiscal cash flows used in operating activities were million for fiscal in fiscal  operating cash was provided by net income  depreciation and amortization and increases in accounts payable  accrued liabilities and advance payments from customers 
in fiscal  operating cash was used to fund increases in accounts receivable  inventories and service parts for maintenance 
accounts payable and accrued liabilities have increased primarily due to the timing of payments 
accounts receivable has increased primarily due to increased sales and the timing of such sales  and inventories and service parts for maintenance have increased as we ve launched both new products and existing products into new channels 
the increase in advance payments from customers is due to increased sales of service contracts  which are typically billed at the beginning of the contract term and recognized as revenue over the service period  and certain software licenses that require deferral under generally accepted accounting principles 
in fiscal  operating cash was provided by depreciation and amortization  decreases in accounts receivable and inventories  an increase in advance payments from customers  and income tax refunds 
in fiscal  cash from operations was used to invest in additional service parts for maintenance 
in addition  gains on securities transactions in fiscal were included as a component of cash flow provided by operating activities 
in fiscal  operating cash was used for payment of charges related to the crossroads settlement costs and acquisition expenses of million and million  respectively 
additionally  in fiscal  operating cash was used to fund increases in accounts receivable  inventories  and service parts for maintenance and was offset by depreciation and amortization and other allowances 
inventories decreased in fiscal as we entered into certain vendor managed inventory programs  under which ownership transfers at the time we take possession of inventory in the manufacturing process 
in fiscal  inventories increased to support both new products and new channels 
as in fiscal  the increases in service parts for maintenance during fiscal and related to new product offerings as well as maintenance of our increasing installed base of existing solutions 
the increase in advance payments from customers during fiscal was  like fiscal  due to increased sales of service contracts 
cash flows provided by investing activities were million for fiscal cash flows used in investing activities were million for fiscal and million for fiscal during fiscal  we received proceeds of million from certain securities transactions  primarily the sale of marketable equity securities and maturities of marketable debt securities 
these proceeds were offset by purchases of marketable securities of million during fiscal capital expenditures were million during fiscal and were comprised primarily of computer hardware and software for our global information technology infrastructure and tooling and equipment related to new product introductions 
during fiscal  proceeds of million were received on sales of marketable securities and covered calls on shares owned by us and were offset by purchases of marketable securities of million 
fiscal capital expenditures were million and consisted primarily of computer hardware and software associated with the global implementation of a customer relationship management information system and the worldwide rollout of our north american enterprise resource planning information system  leasehold improvements purchased for our new englewood  colorado facility and tooling and equipment related to new product introductions 
during fiscal  proceeds of million were received on sales of certain marketable securities and covered calls on shares owned by us 
capital expenditures were million during fiscal and were comprised primarily of manufacturing and engineering equipment along with purchases of computer hardware and software 
fiscal  and investing activities include purchases of non marketable investments in non public technology businesses of  million and  respectively 
cash flows provided by financing activities were million for fiscal and million for fiscal cash flows used in financing activities were million for fiscal in fiscal we borrowed  on a credit line from a german bank  which we repaid in full during the same year 
we repurchased  million and  of our common stock in fiscal  and  respectively 
proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our stock purchase plan and the exercise of stock options and warrants were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
offsetting the above proceeds in all three years were certain payments on bank credit lines and long term debt  which were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
as of october   our debt primarily consists of a loan payable to a german bank that we intend to repay in full no later than the june due date 
at october   our cash and cash equivalents totaled million  up from million at october  our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled million and million at october  and  respectively 
our working capital  the difference between current assets and current liabilities  was million at october  compared to million at october  the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was to and to at october  and  respectively 
the following table summarizes our contractual cash commitments as of october  payments due during fiscal years ended october  total thereafter in thousands operating leases long term debt total contractual cash obligations the amounts above exclude rents for a manufacturing facility in redmond  washington 
we terminated this lease in november in connection with the benchmark transaction described in the general section above 
included in the operating lease amounts above are the cash commitments related to a liability recorded in fiscal to reflect the anticipated costs to exit a facility 
during fiscal and  we incurred exit costs of  and  respectively 
these costs reduced the liability to  and  at october  and  respectively 
other commitments not included in the contractual cash commitments summary above include funding of an investment in a venture capital fund  a potential payment that could be due upon terminating a contract with a certain supplier  and relocation costs associated with the benchmark transaction 
these commitments are discussed in detail in note to the consolidated financial statements 
our october  balance sheet includes liabilities for our long term debt and the anticipated exit costs accrued during fiscal none of the other commitments mentioned above require accrual at october  we had no other material or unusual commitments as of october  based on our strong cash position  anticipated profitable operations and planned expenditures  we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities  debt capacity and anticipated cash flow from our operating activities will be sufficient to fund our working capital and capital expenditure needs for at least the next months 
we will continue to evaluate possible acquisitions of  or investments in businesses  products  or technologies that we believe are strategic  which may require the use of cash 
in addition  we have made and expect to continue to make investments in companies with whom we have identified potential synergies 
critical accounting estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to customer agreements  sales returns  bad debts  inventories  service parts for maintenance  warranty costs  investments  intangible assets  acquired in process technology and deferred income taxes 
we base our estimates on a combination of specifically identified items we are aware of  historical trends  our expectations of the future and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies involve significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for a detailed summary of all our significant accounting policies and recent accounting pronouncements that apply to us 
we record estimated reductions to revenue for specifically identified customer agreements  such as special pricing  price protection  stock rotation and volume based incentives  at the time of shipment based upon the expected rate of occurrence 
if market conditions were to decline  we may take actions to enter into more of these agreements  possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time the incentive is offered 
we also record an allowance for sales returns for our estimates of expected customer product returns 
should actual return rates differ from our estimates  revisions to our sales return allowance may be necessary 
since we have historically been able to reliably estimate the amount of allowances required for future price adjustments and product returns  we recognize revenue  net of projected allowances  upon shipment to our customers 
if we were unable to reliably estimate the amount of future price adjustments and product returns in any specific reporting period  then we would be required to defer recognition of the revenue until the right to future price adjustments and product returns were to lapse and we were no longer under any obligation to reduce the price or take back the product 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required  and our ability to recognize sales to certain customers may be affected 
we evaluate our inventory and record a provision for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if technology rapidly changes or actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
we value our service parts for maintenance at the lower of amortized cost or market 
amortization of the aggregate service parts is computed on the straight line method over the estimated useful life of three to seven years 
should the technology or our customers service needs change and cause a decrease in the estimated useful lives of such service parts  additional write downs would be required 
we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our suppliers  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
we hold equity interests in both publicly traded and private companies having operations or technology in areas within our strategic focus 
the publicly traded companies may have highly volatile share prices 
we also hold investment grade marketable debt securities in government and commercial entities 
we record an investment impairment charge when we obtain specific information that causes us to believe an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
upon our adoption of sfas in the first quarter of fiscal  we ceased amortizing goodwill and performed an initial review for impairment 
goodwill impairment will be reviewed annually thereafter  or more frequently when indicators of impairment are present 
we did not record an impairment charge based on this initial review or our annual review performed during the third quarter of fiscal other intangible assets are carried and reported at acquisition cost  net of accumulated amortization subsequent to acquisition 
the acquisition cost is amortized over the estimated useful lives of the assets  which range from months to seven years 
intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate impairment might exist  or at least annually 
the determination of the net carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets and the extent to which  if any  there is impairment are dependent on material estimates and judgments on our part  including the useful life over which the intangible assets are to be amortized  and the estimates of the value of future net cash flows  which are based upon further estimates of future revenues  expenses and operating margins 
when we enter into a business combination  we record an expense for the value of acquired in process technology that has not reached technological feasibility and has no alternative future use as of the date of acquisition 
the valuation of acquired in process technology is typically based upon our estimates and valuations by a third party appraiser 
we do not currently record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets because we believe that the assets are more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to various market risks  including changes in foreign currency rates and interest rates 
we may enter into various derivative transactions to manage certain of these exposures 
currently  approximately two thirds of our total international sales are denominated in us dollars 
the assets and liabilities of our us subsidiaries have functional currencies other than the us dollar and are translated into us dollars at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date 
income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates prevailing during the period 
a appreciation in the us dollar would have resulted in an approximately million and  decrease in income before provision benefit for income taxes during fiscal and  respectively 
such a change in income would have resulted from applying a different exchange rate to translate and revalue the financial statements of our non us subsidiaries 
at october   we had fixed rate debt of million at from a german bank 
the fair value of such debt approximates the carrying amount on the consolidated balance sheet at october
