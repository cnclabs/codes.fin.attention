item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis supplements and is provided to facilitate increased understanding of our  and consolidated financial statements and our accompanying notes included with this report 
overview for  swift energy experienced record revenues of million and record production of bcfe 
our revenues were bolstered by oil and gas prices remaining strong last year 
although domestic production decreased by to bcfe from levels we continued to focus our efforts and capital throughout the year on better infrastructure  increased production and the development of longer life oil reserves in the lake washington area 
in january  we produced more than approximately  gross barrels of oil equivalent per day approximately  net barrels of oil equivalent per day in lake washington  compared to approximately  gross barrels of oil equivalent per day approximately  net barrels of oil equivalent per day in january during  we also began allocating capital to natural gas development in our three other domestic core areas 
new zealand accounted for bcfe of production  a increase from levels 
new zealand natural gas and ngl contracts are denominated in new zealand dollars  which have significantly strengthened during against the us dollar 
the currency exchange rate increased from approximately to approximately us per new zealand during the year 
our production costs were up in predominately due to some of the facility enhancement costs and increased activity and production in lake washington  increased severance taxes  and also due to currency exchange rates in new zealand 
our average reserve replacement cost for was per mcfe  and we replaced of our production 
our general and administrative expenses increased in predominantly due to our increased activities in new zealand  a reduction in reimbursement from partnerships we managed  an increase in franchise tax expense  and increased costs related to our corporate governance activities and compliance with the sarbanes oxley act 
we are working to reduce our production costs for we again made significant strides in in improving the quality and quantity of our reserve base in accordance with our strategic plan 
year end proved reserves of bcfe  representing growth for the year  were crude oil  natural gas and ngls  compared to year end proved reserves of bcfe  which were crude oil  natural gas and ngls 
proved developed reserves remained essentially the same at of total reserves at year end  compared to the previous year 
domestic proved reserves increased at year end to bcfe  driven mainly by the reserve increase in the lake washington field 
proved reserves in new zealand increased to bcfe at year end  primarily attributable to drilling additions in the kauri and manutahi sands 
for  our proved undeveloped reserves  of total reserves  were slightly higher than the to range we had targeted 
most of these proved undeveloped reserves were in the lake washington area of total reserves and in the awp olmos area of total reserves  and both areas are characterized as long reserve life fields 
the to range is again our target for as we work to convert proved undeveloped reserves into proved producing reserves 
our debt to pv ratio has decreased from in to in  and further decreased to for our debt to capitalization ratio was at december   which is essentially the same as at year end  and management continues to believe that our current cash flow is best utilized on capital projects rather than reducing debt 
however  we will continue to look for opportunities in to improve our balance sheet and liquidity but expect our capital expenditures to continue to equal or modestly exceed our cash flow for the near term 
our capital expenditure budget assumes increased drilling activity in all domestic core areas except lake washington 
for lake washington  the budget assumes reduced drilling activity  to wells  accompanied by an extensive three dimensional seismic survey  together with the analysis of the resulting data  to enhance our drilling program in the area for years to come 
we plan to drill to wells in awp olmos  with the objective of again maintaining production levels in that area 
additionally  we expect to have ongoing exploratory efforts in our south texas garcia ranch properties 
in new zealand  we plan to drill to wells  primarily in the areas in which we had success in we continue to see a tightening natural gas market with strengthening gas prices in new zealand 
for  we believe we are positioned for production growth of to and reserve growth of to  and expect commodity prices to remain strong 
results of operations revenues 
our revenues in increased by compared to revenues in  due primarily to increases in oil and gas prices and production from our new zealand and lake washington areas 
revenues in decreased by compared to revenues primarily due to the drop in domestic natural gas prices in revenues from our oil and gas sales comprised substantially all of net revenues for  of total revenues for  and for natural gas production made up of our production volumes in  in  and in domestic natural gas production made up of our total natural gas production volumes in  in  and in oil and gas sales in increased by  or million  from the level of those revenues for  and our net sales volumes in increased by  or bcfe  over net sales volumes in average prices received for oil increased to per bbl in from per bbl in average gas prices received increased to per mcf in from per mcf in average ngl prices received increased to per bbl in from per bbl in the increase in production during the period was primarily from our new zealand and lake washington areas 
in  our million increase in oil  ngl  and gas sales resulted from oprice variances that had a million favorable impact on sales  of which million was attributable to the increase in average gas prices received and million was attributable to the increase in average combined oil and ngl prices received  and ovolume variances that had a million favorable impact on sales  with million of increases coming from the  bbl increase in oil and ngl sales volumes  and million of the increases from the bcf increase in gas sales volumes 
in  oil and gas sales decreased by  or million  from the level of those revenues in even though our net sales volumes in increased by  or bcfe  over net sales volumes in average combined prices received for oil and ngls decreased to per bbl in from per bbl in average gas prices received decreased to per mcf in from per mcf in the increase in production during the period was primarily from our new zealand and lake washington areas 
in  our million decrease in oil  ngl  and gas sales resulted from oprice variances that had a million unfavorable impact on sales  of which million was attributable to the decrease in average combined oil and ngl prices received and million was attributable to the decrease in average gas prices received  and ovolume variances that had a million favorable impact on sales  with million of increases coming from the  bbl increase in oil and ngl sales volumes  and million of the increases from the bcf increase in gas sales volumes

natural gas liquids production for was  mbbls  at an average price of per barrel  and for  was mbbls  at an average price of per barrel 
costs and expenses 
our expenses in increased million  or  compared to expenses 
the majority of the increase was due to the million increase in oil and gas production costs and the million increase in depreciation  depletion and amortization  both of which increased as our production volumes increased in our expenses in decreased by million  or  compared to expenses 
this decrease was due primarily to the million non cash write down of domestic oil and gas properties in as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  we adopted sfas no 
on january  our adoption of sfas no 
resulted in a one time net of taxes charge of million  which is recorded as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in the consolidated statement of income 
we adopted sfas no 
 amended by sfas no 
and sfas no 
 on january  our adoption of sfas no 
resulted in a one time net of taxes charge of million  which is recorded as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in the consolidated statement of income 
our general and administrative expenses  net increased million  or  from the level of such expenses in  while general and administrative expenses increased million  or  over levels 
these increases in and are due primarily to our increased activities in new zealand and a reduction in reimbursement from partnerships we managed as almost all of these partnerships have liquidated 
in addition  our expense increased due to an increase in franchise tax expense and increased costs related to our corporate governance activities and compliance with the sarbanes oxley act 
our general and administrative expenses per mcfe produced increased to per mcfe in from per mcfe in and per mcfe in the portion of supervision fees recorded as a reduction to general and administrative expenses was million for  million for  and million for depreciation  depletion  and amortization of our oil and gas properties  or dd a  increased million  or  in from levels  while dd a decreased million  or  from levels 
domestically  dd a increased million in due to increases in the depletable oil and gas property base  offset by slightly lower production in the period and higher reserve volumes that were added primarily through our lake washington activities 
in new zealand  dd a increased by million in due to increased production in the period 
in  our domestic dd a decreased by million due to lower production in the period and the domestic non cash write down of oil and gas properties in the fourth quarter of that decreased our depletable base  along with higher reserve volumes that were added primarily through our lake washington activities 
in new zealand  our dd a increased million as our production and the depletable oil and gas property base both increased in the period due primarily to the tawn acquisition 
our dd a rate per mcfe of production was in  in  and in  reflecting variations in per unit cost of reserves additions 
we recorded million of accretion on our asset retirement obligation in associated with the adoption of sfas no 
implemented on january  our production costs per mcfe produced were in  in  and in the portion of supervision fees recorded as a reduction to production costs was million for  million for  and million for our production costs in increased million  or  over such expenses in  while those expenses in increased million  or  over such expenses in approximately million of the increase in production costs during was related to domestic severance taxes  which increased along with commodity prices and higher production from our lake washington area in that period 
in new zealand  production costs increased by million in mainly due to royalty payments made on higher production in the period 
in production costs increased as our new zealand activities increased  partially offsetting the domestic production costs decrease  which mainly was due to a decrease in production volumes 
interest expense on our senior notes issued in april  including amortization of debt issuance costs  totaled million in and million in interest expense on our senior notes issued in july  including amortization of debt issuance costs  totaled million in both and and million in interest expense on the credit facility  including commitment fees and amortization of debt issuance costs  totaled million in  million in  and million in other interest cost was million in the total interest cost in was million  of which million was capitalized 
the total interest cost in was million  of which million was capitalized 
the total interest cost was million  of which million was capitalized 
we capitalize that portion of interest related to unproved properties 
the increase in interest expense in and was attributed to the replacement of our bank borrowings in april with the senior notes issued in that carry a higher interest rate 
in the fourth quarter of  we recognized a domestic non cash write down of oil and gas properties  as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
lower prices for both oil and natural gas at december   necessitated a pre tax domestic full cost ceiling write down of million  or million after tax 
in addition to this domestic ceiling write down  we also expensed million of charges in the fourth quarter of for certain delinquent accounts receivable  the majority of which were related to gas sold to enron  and a write off of debt issuance costs for a planned offering that was cancelled based upon market conditions following the events of september  income tax expense in includes a reduction of approximately million from the us statutory rate  primarily from the result of the currency exchange rate effect on the new zealand deferred tax 
this amount is partially offset by higher deferred state taxes and other items 
net income loss 
our net income in of million was higher and basic earnings per share basic eps of were higher than our net income of million and basic eps of 
our earnings per diluted share diluted eps in of were higher than our diluted eps of 
these amounts increased in the period as oil and gas sales increased due to higher commodity prices and increased production 
our net income in of million was higher and basic eps of was higher than our net loss of million and basic eps of 
our diluted eps in of was higher than our diluted eps of 
these amounts increased in due to overall lower costs  as a non cash write down of oil and gas properties occurred in and not in  offset somewhat by lower revenue in due to lower commodity prices 
proved oil and gas reserves 
at year end  our total proved reserves were bcfe with a pv value of billion 
in  our proved natural gas reserves increased bcf  or  while our proved oil reserves increased mmbbl  or  for a total equivalent increase of bcfe  or 
in  our proved natural gas reserves increased by bcf  or  while our proved oil reserves increased by mmbbl  or  for a total equivalent increase of bcfe  or 
we added reserves over the past three years through both our drilling activity and purchases of minerals in place 
through drilling we added bcfe bcfe of which came from new zealand of proved reserves in  bcfe bcfe of which came from new zealand in  and bcfe bcfe of which came from new zealand in through acquisitions we added bcfe of proved reserves in  bcfe in  and bcfe in at year end  of our total proved reserves were proved developed  compared with at year end and at year end the pv value of our total proved reserves increased from the pv value at year end gas prices increased in to per mcf from per mcf at year end  compared to per mcf at year end oil prices increased in to per barrel from per bbl at year end  compared to in under sec guidelines  estimates of proved reserves must be made using year end oil and gas sales prices and are held constant throughout the life of the properties 
subsequent changes to such year end oil and gas prices could have a significant impact on the calculated pv value 
while our total proved reserves quantities increased by during  the pv value of those reserves decreased  due to much lower prices at year end than at year end between those two year ends  there was a decrease in natural gas prices and a decrease in oil prices 
this decrease in prices resulted in bcfe of downward reserves revisions  solely attributed to the decrease in prices at year end the year end gas price of was significantly lower than the average gas price of we received during the year end oil price of per barrel was also lower than the average oil price of we received in contractual commitments and obligations our contractual commitments for the next five years and thereafter as of december  are as follows thereafter total non cancelable operating lease commitments        capital commitments due to pipeline   operators asset retirement obligation       drilling rig and seismic commitments   senior notes due   senior notes due   credit facility which expires in october   amounts shown by year are the fair values at december  these amounts do not include the interest obligation  which is paid semiannually 
these amounts exclude a million standby letter of credit outstanding under this facility 
commodity price trends and uncertainties oil and natural gas prices historically have been volatile and are expected to continue to be volatile in the future 
worldwide supply disruptions  such as the reduction in crude oil production from venezuela  together with perceived risks associated with the unrest in iraq  along with other factors  have caused the price of oil to increase significantly in when compared to historical prices 
other factors such as actions taken by opec  worldwide economic conditions  weather conditions  and fluctuating currency exchange rates can cause wide fluctuations in the price of oil 
domestic natural gas prices increased significantly in the first quarter of when compared to historical prices and have since declined somewhat 
north american weather conditions  the industrial and consumer demand for natural gas  storage levels of natural gas  and the availability and accessibility of natural gas deposits in north america can cause significant fluctuations in the price of natural gas 
such factors are beyond our control 
liquidity and capital resources during  we largely relied upon cash provided by operating activities of million  proceeds from bank borrowings of million  and proceeds from the sale of property and equipment of million to fund capital expenditures of million 
during  we principally relied upon cash provided by operating activities of million  net proceeds from the issuance of long term debt of million  and net proceeds from our public stock offering of million  less the repayment of bank borrowings of million  to fund capital expenditures of million 
for  we believe that our credit facility and cash flow will be sufficient to fund our planned capital expenditures 
net cash provided by operating activities 
in  net cash provided by our operating activities increased by to million  as compared to million in and million in the increase of million was primarily due to an increase of oil and gas sales of million due to higher commodity prices and production 
the decrease of million was primarily due to a reduction of oil and gas sales of million due to lower commodity prices and to an increase in interest of million due to higher debt balances and interest rates in existing credit facilities 
at december   we had million in outstanding borrowings under our credit facility 
at december   we had no outstanding borrowings under this facility 
our credit facility at year end consisted of a million revolving line of credit with a million borrowing base 
the borrowing base is re determined at least every six months and was reconfirmed by our bank group and increased to million  effective november  we requested that the commitment amount with our bank group be reduced to million effective may  under the terms of the credit facility  we can increase this commitment amount back to the total amount of the borrowing base at our discretion  subject to the terms of the credit agreement 
our revolving credit facility includes  among other restrictions  requirements as to maintenance of certain minimum financial ratios principally pertaining to working capital  debt  and equity ratios and limitations on incurring other debt 
we are in compliance with the provisions of this agreement 
the credit facility extends until october our million senior notes mature on august  and are callable august  our million senior notes mature on may  the indentures underlying our senior notes contain covenants that impose restrictions on us 
under the indentures  we are limited to the amount of debt that we can incur such that in general  after giving pro forma effect to such new debt  the consolidated interest coverage ratio would not exceed to  or our indebtedness under our bank credit facility does not exceed the greater of million or million plus of adjusted consolidated net tangible assets as defined under the indentures 
the aggregate amount of our common stock that we can repurchase is limited to million under the indenture governing our senior notes due and million under the indenture governing our senior notes due we believe that these restrictions will not have any material effect upon our business for the foreseeable future 
in january  we filed a universal shelf registration statement with the sec to allow us to offer up to million of our securities in the future 
upon effectiveness of the registration statement  for a period of two years we may periodically offer one or more of these securities in amounts  prices and on terms to be announced when and if the securities are offered 
the specifics of any future offerings  along with the use of proceeds of any securities offered  will be described in detail in a prospectus supplement at the time of any such offering 
working capital 
our working capital declined from a negative million at december   to a negative million at december  the decrease was primarily due to an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities due to our year end drilling activities 
consistent with prior years  we can draw on our available credit facility to remedy our working capital deficit if needed 
capital expenditures 
in  our capital expenditures of approximately million included domestic activities of million  or of total expenditures  as follows o million  or  on developmental drilling  primarily in our lake washington area  o million  or  for the construction of production and surface facilities  mainly in our lake washington area  o million  or  on exploratory drilling  primarily in our lake washington area  o million  or  on domestic prospect costs  principally leasehold  seismic  and geological costs  o million  or  on field compression facilities  o million  or  for producing property acquisitions  including the purchase of property interests from partnerships managed by us  o million  or less than  for fixed assets  and o million  or less than  on gas processing plants in the brookeland and masters creek areas 
new zealand activities of million  or of total expenditures  as follows o million  or  on developmental activities primarily to further delineate the rimu and kauri areas  o million  or  on prospect costs  o million  or  on gas processing plants  o million  or  for exploratory drilling mainly for the tuihu exploratory well  o million  or less than  on producing properties acquisitions  and o million  or less than  for fixed assets 
in  we participated in drilling domestic development wells and eight domestic exploratory wells  of which development wells and five exploratory wells were completed 
in new zealand we drilled three development wells and one exploratory well 
only one of these four wells  the exploratory well  was unsuccessful 
we currently plan to spend to million in total capital expenditures in  excluding acquisition costs and net of approximately million to million in non core property dispositions 
the budget for  as always  is dependent upon operational performance and commodity pricing levels during the year 
domestic activities account for of budgeted spending  with the largest allocation going to the lake washington area 
we believe that the anticipated internally generated cash flows for  together with bank borrowings under our credit facility  will be sufficient to finance the costs associated with our currently budgeted capital expenditures 
if producing property acquisitions become attractive during  we will explore the use of debt and or equity offerings to fund such activity 
our capital expenditures were approximately million in and million in during  we relied both upon internally generated cash flows of million and upon additional borrowings of million from our bank credit facility to fund capital expenditures of million 
during  we principally relied upon cash provided by operating activities of million  net proceeds from the issuance of long term debt of million  and net proceeds from our public stock offering of million  less the repayment of bank borrowings of million  to fund capital expenditures of million 
our capital expenditures in included new zealand activities of million  or of total expenditures  as follows o million  or  on property acquisitions  with approximately million spent on the tawn acquisition and the remainder for the cash portion of our bligh and antrim acquisitions  o million  or  on developmental drilling to further delineate the rimu and kauri areas  o million  or  on gas processing plants  principally the rimu production station  o million  or  for exploratory drilling in the rimu and kauri areas  o million  or  on prospect costs  principally seismic and geological costs  and o million  or less than  for fixed assets  principally computers and office furniture and fixtures 
domestic activities of million  or of total expenditures  as follows o million  or  on developmental drilling  o million  or  on domestic prospect costs  principally leasehold  seismic  and geological costs  o million  or  on exploratory drilling  o million  or  for producing property acquisitions  including the purchase of property interests from partnerships managed by us  o million  or  on gas processing plants in the brookeland and masters creek areas  o million  or less than  on field compression facilities  and o million  or less than  for fixed assets 
in  we participated in drilling domestic development wells and seven domestic exploratory wells  of which development wells and three exploratory wells were completed 
in new zealand we drilled three development wells and three exploratory wells 
one of the development wells and one of the exploratory wells were unsuccessful 
critical accounting policies the following summarizes several of our critical accounting policies 
see a complete list of significant accounting policies in note to the consolidated financial statements 
use of estimates 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities  if any  at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from estimates 
significant estimates include proved reserve volumes  dd a  and deferred income taxes 
property and equipment 
we follow the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas property and equipment costs as described in detail in note to our consolidated financial statements 
under this method of accounting  all productive and nonproductive costs incurred in the exploration  development  and acquisition of oil and gas reserves are capitalized and amortized on an aggregate basis over the estimated lives of the properties using the units of production method 
for the years   and  internal costs capitalized totaled million  million  and million  respectively 
interest costs related to unproved properties are also capitalized to unproved oil and gas properties 
for the years   and  capitalized interest on unproved properties totaled million  million  and million  respectively 
interest not capitalized and general and administrative costs related to production and general overhead are expensed as incurred 
full cost ceiling test 
these capitalized costs are subject to a ceiling test  however  which limits the unamortized cost of oil and gas properties  including deferred income taxes  to the sum of the estimated future net revenues from proved properties  excluding cash outflows from asset retirement obligations  using hedge adjusted period end prices  discounted at  and the lower of cost or fair value of unproved properties  adjusted for related income tax effects ceiling test 
our hedges at year end consisted of natural gas price floors with strike prices lower than the period end price and thus did not affect prices used in this calculation 
at december  and  our unamortized costs of natural gas and oil properties did not exceed the ceiling amount 
at december   our pv value was calculated based upon quoted market prices of per mcf for gas and per barrel for oil  adjusted for market differentials 
in the fourth quarter of  as a result of low oil and gas prices at december   we reported a non cash write down on a before tax basis of million million after tax on our domestic properties 
we had no write down on our new zealand properties 
a decline in natural gas and oil prices from year end levels or other factors  without mitigating circumstances  could cause a future non cash write down of capitalized costs and a non cash charge against future earnings 
accounts receivable 
included in the total accounts receivable balance  which totaled million and million at december  and  respectively  on the accompanying balance sheet  was approximately million of receivables related to volumes produced from and that we were notified were disputed in early accordingly  we did not record a receivable to date with regard to volumes 
we assess the collectibility of trade and other receivables 
based on our judgment  we would accrue a reserve when we believe a receivable may not be collected 
at december  and  we had an allowance for doubtful accounts of million and million  respectively 
these allowance for doubtful accounts balances have been deducted from the total accounts receivable balances on the balance sheet included in our consolidated financial statements 
price risk management activities 
we have a price risk management policy to use derivative instruments to protect against declines in oil and gas prices  mainly through the purchase of price floors and collars 
we adopted sfas no 
effective january   which requires that changes in the derivative s fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met as further described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
accordingly  we marked our open contracts at december   to fair value at that date  resulting in a one time net of taxes charge of million  which was recorded as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
during  and  we recognized net losses gains of million  million and million  respectively  relating to our derivative activities 
this activity is recorded in price risk management and other  net on the accompanying statements of income 
at december   we had recorded million  net of taxes of million  of derivative losses in other comprehensive loss on the accompanying balance sheet 
this amount represents the change in fair value for the effective portion of our transactions that qualified as cash flow hedges 
the ineffectiveness reported in price risk management and other  net for and was not material 
we expect to reclassify all amounts held in other comprehensive loss into the statement of income within the next six months when the forecasted sale of hedge products occurs 
as of december   we had in place natural gas price floors in effect for the january contract month through the june contract month that cover our domestic natural gas production for january to june the natural gas price floors cover notional volumes of  mmbtu with a weighted average floor price of 
when we entered into these transactions they were designated as a hedge of the variability in cash flows associated with the forecasted sale of natural gas production 
changes in the fair value of a hedge that is highly effective and is designated and qualifies as a cash flow hedge  to the extent that the hedge is effective  are initially recorded in other comprehensive income loss 
when the hedged transactions are recorded upon the actual sale of oil and natural gas  these gains or losses are reclassified from other comprehensive income loss and recorded in price risk management and other  net on the statement of income 
the fair value of our derivatives are computed using the black scholes option pricing model and are periodically verified against quotes from brokers 
the fair value of these instruments at december   was million and is recognized on the balance sheet in other current assets 
in january  we entered into additional natural gas floors covering contract periods april to june  which cover our natural gas production for january to june notional volumes are  mmbtu per month at a weighted average floor price of per mmbtu 
see item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for additional discussion of commodity risk 
stock based compensation 
we have three stock based compensation plans  which are described more fully in note to our consolidated financial statements 
we account for those plans under the recognition and measurement principles of apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
no stock based employee compensation cost is reflected in net income  as all options granted under those plans had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of the grant  or in the case of the employee stock purchase plan  the purchase price is of the lower of the closing price of our common stock as quoted on the new york stock exchange at the beginning or end of the plan year or a date during the year chosen by the participant 
foreign currency 
we use the us dollar as our functional currency in new zealand 
the functional currency is determined by examining the entities cash flows  commodity pricing environment and financing arrangements 
we have both assets and liabilities denominated in new zealand dollars  predominantly our portion of our deferred income taxes and a portion of our asset retirement obligation on the accompanying balance sheet 
for accounts other than deferred income taxes  as the currency rate changes between the us dollar and the new zealand dollar  we recognize transaction gains and losses in price risk management and other  net on the accompanying statements of income 
we recognize transaction gains and losses on deferred income taxes in provision for income taxes on the accompanying statement of income 
new accounting pronouncements 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
goodwill and intangible assets 
we adopted these statements on july   and january   respectively 
an issue has arisen for companies engaged in oil and gas exploration and production regarding the application of sfas no 
and sfas no 
as they relate to mineral rights held under lease or other contractual arrangements and as to whether costs associated with these rights should be classified as intangible assets on the balance sheet  apart from other capitalized oil and gas property costs 
we understand that the emerging issues task force of the fasb has placed this issue on its agenda  although the date and the outcome of the resolution of the issue is unknown 
historically we have classified our oil and gas mineral rights held under lease as tangible assets along with our other oil and gas properties  which is in accordance with the securities and exchange commission s sec full cost accounting rules  and we intend to continue to do so until further guidance is provided 
we have estimated the amount associated with these mineral rights using historical depletion rates  estimates of the timing of impairment of unproved properties and assuming the cost for the mineral rights was unaffected by the ceiling test write down recorded in december because we cannot associate the ceiling test write down with particular types of costs 
based on these limitations and assumptions  we estimate the net cost of mineral rights that would be reclassified from oil and gas properties to intangible assets to be approximately million at december  and approximately million at december  these amounts are from july  the date we adopted sfas no 
to december  as we are not able to calculate amounts to reclassify before that period as our property records did not break out that information 
only our balance sheet accounts would be affected by the reclassification  and our results of operations and cash flows would not be materially impacted by any such reclassification 
related party transactions we have been the operator of a number of properties owned by our affiliated limited partnerships and  accordingly  charge these entities operating fees 
the operating fees charged to the partnerships in   and totaled approximately million  million  and million  respectively  and are recorded as reductions of general and administrative expense and oil and gas production expense 
we also have been reimbursed for direct  administrative  and overhead costs incurred in conducting the business of the limited partnerships  which totaled approximately million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
in partnerships in which the limited partners voted to sell their remaining properties and liquidate their limited partnerships  we also have been reimbursed for direct  administrative  and overhead costs incurred in the disposition of such properties  which costs totaled approximately million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
forward looking statements the statements contained in this report that are not historical facts are forward looking statements as that term is defined in section e of the securities and exchange act of  as amended 
such forward looking statements may pertain to  among other things  financial results  capital expenditures  drilling activity  development activities  cost savings  production efforts and volumes  hydrocarbon reserves  hydrocarbon prices  liquidity  regulatory matters  and competition 
such forward looking statements generally are accompanied by words such as plan  future  estimate  expect  budget  predict  anticipate  projected  should  believe  or other words that convey the uncertainty of future events or outcomes 
such forward looking information is based upon management s current plans  expectations  estimates  and assumptions  upon current market conditions  and upon engineering and geologic information available at this time  and is subject to change and to a number of risks and uncertainties  and  therefore  actual results may differ materially 
among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are volatility in oil and natural gas prices  internationally or in the united states  availability of services and supplies  fluctuations of the prices received or demand for our oil and natural gas  the uncertainty of drilling results and reserve estimates  operating hazards  requirements for capital  general economic conditions  changes in geologic or engineering information  changes in market conditions  competition and government regulations  as well as the risks and uncertainties discussed herein and set forth from time to time in our other public reports  filings  and public statements 
also  because of the volatility in oil and gas prices and other factors  interim results are not necessarily indicative of those for a full year 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity risk 
our major market risk exposure is the commodity pricing applicable to our oil and natural gas production 
realized commodity prices received for such production are primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price for crude oil and spot prices applicable to natural gas 
the effects of such pricing volatility are expected to continue 
our price risk management policy permits the utilization of agreements and financial instruments such as futures  forward and options contracts  and swaps to mitigate price risk associated with fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices 
below is a description of the financial instruments we have utilized to hedge our exposure to price risk 
oprice floors at march   we had in place price floors in effect through the june contract month for natural gas  these cover our domestic natural gas production for march to june the natural gas price floors cover notional volumes of  mmbtu  with a weighted average floor price of per mmbtu 
our hedges in place at march  are expected to cover approximately to of our domestic natural gas production from march to june onew zealand gas contracts all of our gas production in new zealand is sold under long term  fixed price contracts denominated in new zealand dollars 
these contracts protect against price volatility  and our revenue from these contracts will vary only due to production fluctuations and foreign exchange rates 
interest rate risk 
our senior notes have a fixed interest rate  so consequently we are not exposed to cash flow risk from market interest rate changes on our senior notes 
at december   we had million in outstanding borrowings under our credit facility  which bears a floating rate of interest and therefore susceptible to interest rate fluctuations 
the result of a fluctuation in the bank s base rate would constitute basis points and would reduce cash flows by million based on the december  level of borrowing 
income tax carryforwards 
we have significant federal and state net operating loss and capital loss carryforwards at december  the company has not recorded a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets attributable to these carryovers at december   as management estimates that it is more likely than not that these assets will be fully utilized before they expire 
significant changes in estimates caused by changes in oil and gas prices  production levels  capital expenditures  and other variables could impact the company s ability to utilize the carryover amounts 
if we are not able to use our carryforwards  our results of operations and cash flows will be negatively impacted 
financial instruments and debt maturities 
our financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable  accounts payable  bank borrowings  and notes 
the carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable  and accounts payable approximate fair value due to the short term nature of these instruments 
the fair values of the bank borrowings approximate the carrying amounts as of december  and  and were determined based upon interest rates currently available to us for borrowings with similar terms 
based on quoted market prices as of the respective dates  the fair value of our senior notes due was million at december   and million at december  based upon quoted market prices as of the respective dates  the fair value of our senior notes due was million at december   and million at december  our credit facility with the banks expires october  foreign currency risk 
we are exposed to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currencies  most notably the new zealand dollar 
fluctuations in rates between the new zealand dollar and us dollar may impact our financial results from our new zealand subsidiaries since we have receivables and liabilities denominated in new zealand dollars 
we use the us dollar as our functional currency in new zealand  because of this our results of operations  cash flows and effective tax rate are impacted from fluctuations between the us dollar the new zealand dollar 
customer credit risk 
we are exposed to the risk of financial non performance by customers  who are mainly in the energy industry 
our ability to collect on sales to our customers is dependent on the liquidity of our customer base 
to manage customer credit risk  we monitor credit ratings of customers and seek to minimize exposure to any one customer where other customers are readily available 
due to availability of other purchasers  we do not believe the loss of any single oil or gas customer would materially affect our revenues
