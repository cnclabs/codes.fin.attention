item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview memry provides design  engineering  development and manufacturing services to the medical device and other industries using the company s proprietary shape memory alloy technologies 
shape memory alloys are advanced materials which possess the ability to change their shape in response to thermal and mechanical changes  and the ability to return to their original shape following deformations from which conventional materials cannot recover 
the company provides these products and services from facilities located in bethel  connecticut and menlo park  california 
memry processes raw material usually nitinol  an alloy of nickel and titanium into semi finished products such as wire  strip or tube 
products in these forms are referred to as semi finished materials and are marketed directly  primarily to medical device companies  for use in products such as guidewires  endodontic files  stents  and catheters 
the company also further processes its semi finished materials into formed components and sub assemblies 
formed components are made by taking the semi finished material and further processing them by bending  kinking  stamping  crimping  laser cutting  etc 
into specific forms specified by customers 
sub assemblies involve taking the semi finished materials or formed component produced by memry and combining or assembling them with other products that have been outsourced by memry to form a larger component or sub assembly required by an oem  usually in the medical device field 
examples are sub assemblies sold for use in endoscopic instruments and finished stent rings utilized in stent graft products 
the company believes that the medical device market for shape memory alloys is growing 
early applications were for general surgical instruments and for various vascular procedures 
recently  new opportunities have appeared in orthopedic  urological  electrophysiology  and embolic protection devices 
approximately of the company s products and services are sold to medical device companies  with the balance being utilized in a variety of industrial and commercial applications 
memry sells primarily through a direct sales force  with sales representatives located in the us and europe 
the medical device industry has very strict quality requirements  and the ability to meet these requirements and the requested shipment schedules is a key determinant of success 
price competition has historically been a key competitive variable in products that are not technically difficult to manufacture  such as basic wire for use in applications such as cell phone antennas 
recently  as awareness of potential applications has increased and the industry has grown  the company has noted increased competition for tube products and sub assemblies  with commensurate pressure on prices and margins 
two key areas where management focuses its attention are to reduce the company s dependence on a small number of products procedures and to improve manufacturing efficiency 
memry has expanded the number of products and customers over the past several years and reduced its dependence on a few key products  notably aaa stent graft components 
product and customer diversification continues to be a major strategic initiative for the company 
in addition to providing additional products and services through its core business operations  the company is beginning to explore diversification through acquisitions  joint ventures  and investments 
much of the variability in the company s margins over the past several years can be explained by variations in manufacturing efficiency 
considerable effort has been made to properly document and control the company s manufacturing processes and improve process yields  which reduces material losses and improves margins 
recent developments on july   memry announced that it has signed a letter of intent to acquire substantially all of the assets and selected liabilities of putnam plastics corporation putnam 
the transaction  which is subject to the signing of definitive agreements and customary closing conditions  is expected to close by october  putnam  a privately held corporation  is one of the nation s leading specialty polymer extrusion companies serving the medical device and other high technology industries 
its primary products are complex multi lumen  multi layer extrusions used for guidewires  catheter shafts  delivery systems and various other interventional medical procedures 
putnam is a major supplier of co extruded polyimide  multi lumen  braided and extremely thin wall  multi layer tubing as well as sheathing for fiber optic tubing 
putnam products are known for their complex configurations  multiple material construction and innovative designs 
putnam also is well known for its ability to manufacture to tight tolerances 
on august   the company announced that it will finance a  joint development program with and has made a  initial investment in biomer technology ltd  a privately owned company specializing in the development and manufacture of state of the art polymers and biocompatible coatings for stents and other medical devices 
based in runcorn  england  biomer technology ltd is a biomaterials company that has developed a range of high performance polyurethanes  process technology  components and products for medical device manufacturing 
accounting policies and critical accounting estimates we have adopted various accounting policies to prepare the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us our significant accounting policies are disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements  in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us  requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
our estimates and assumptions  including those related to accounts receivable  inventories  goodwill and intangible assets and income taxes  are updated as appropriate  which in most cases is at least quarterly 
we base our estimates on historical experience or various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  and the results form the basis for making judgments about the reported values of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
actual results may materially differ from these estimates 
estimates are considered to be critical if they meet both of the following criteria the estimate requires assumptions about material matters that are uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made  and other materially different estimates could have been reasonably made or material changes in the estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period 
our critical accounting estimates include the following accounts receivable 
we provide allowances for doubtful accounts on our accounts receivable for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  which may result in the impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
on a regular basis  we review and evaluate the customers financial condition  which generally includes a review of the customers financial statements  trade references and past payment history with us 
we specifically evaluate identified customer risks that may be present and collateral requirements  if any  from the customer  which may include  among other things  deposits  prepayments or letters of credit 
inventories 
we state our inventories at the lower of cost or market 
we maintain inventory levels based on our projections of future demand and market conditions 
any sudden decline in demand or technological change can cause us to have excess or obsolete inventories 
on an ongoing basis  we review for estimated obsolete or unmarketable inventories and write down our inventories to their estimated net realizable value based upon our forecasts of future demand and market conditions 
these write downs are reflected in cost of goods sold 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than our forecasts  additional inventory write downs may be required 
our estimates are primarily influenced by a sudden decline in demand due to economic downturn  rapid product improvements and technological changes 
goodwill and intangible assets 
goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of net assets of the acquired business 
goodwill is tested for impairment annually  or more frequently if changes in circumstance or the occurrence of events suggest an impairment exists 
the test for impairment requires us to make several estimates about fair value 
goodwill was  at june  and june  other intangible assets consist primarily of acquired patents and patent rights and are amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives  ranging from to years 
we review these intangible assets for impairment annually or as changes in circumstance or the occurrence of events suggest the remaining value is not recoverable 
other intangible assets  net of accumulated amortization  were  and  as of june  and  respectively 
income taxes 
deferred taxes are provided on a liability method whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences 
temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when  in the opinion of management  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the recognition of a valuation allowance for deferred taxes requires management to make estimates about the company s future profitability 
the estimates associated with the valuation of deferred taxes are considered critical due to the amount of deferred taxes recorded on the consolidated balance sheet and the judgment required in determining the company s future profitability 
deferred tax assets were  and  at june  and  respectively 
results of operations the following table sets forth the percent of consolidated revenues represented by items in our consolidated statements of income for the years presented 
years ended june  product sales research and development revenues total revenues cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses research and development selling  general and administration total operating expenses operating income interest expense income interest net income before income taxes provision benefit for income taxes net income years ended june  and june  revenues 
in the past several years  the company has focused on increasing the amount of value added products it provides to the marketplace  ie  products where additional processing is performed on basic nitinol wire  strip  or tube before it is shipped to the customer 
currently  medical device applications represent some of the best opportunities for increasing the amount of value added business 
the kink resistant and self expanding properties of nitinol have made peripheral stenting an area of special interest  and stent components manufactured for abdominal aortic aneurysms aaa in particular have become a significant driver of the company s revenue 
however  because the market for stent components is very dynamic and rapidly changing  the company has found it difficult to accurately forecast demand for its stent components 
delays in product launches  uncertain timing on regulatory approvals  inventory adjustments by our customers  market share shifts between competing stent platforms and the introduction of next generation products have all contributed to the variability in revenue generated by shipments of medical stent components 
revenues increased in fiscal  to  from  in fiscal  a net increase of  shipments of wire based medical stent components decreased approximately  between fiscal and fiscal the decrease in the wire based medical stent components is a result of inventory adjustments and delays in product launch by a large medical device customer of the company 
tube based medical stent components increased approximately  during the same period 
looking forward  memry anticipates that overall stent component activity in fiscal will be basically flat with the activity level of fiscal this forecast anticipates the beginning of several new programs with peripheral stent customers and the continued slow erosion of some existing programs 
other medical device component shipments  including products utilized in minimally invasive surgery  decreased approximately  between fiscal and fiscal this decrease relates almost entirely to a customer of the company facing new competition which has led to a decrease in unit shipments to that customer and a reduction in unit prices charged by the company 
microcoil and guidewire products  where the company has placed increasing marketing and sales emphasis  increased approximately  between fiscal and fiscal a new orthopedic product for bone tamps provided approximately  of revenues in fiscal revenues from sales of high pressure sealing plugs  arch wire and other wire products increased approximately  during fiscal compared to fiscal  and revenues from prototype development and r d activities increased approximately  during fiscal as compared to fiscal revenues from super elastic tube shipments increased  in fiscal versus fiscal  due primarily to increasing useage in neurological applications and for embolic protection procedures 
the company anticipates that during fiscal competition will continue to exert pressure on pricing for super elastic tube 
shipments of martinsitic wire and rod  utilized in various industrial applications  decreased approximately  shipments of tinel lock decreased approximately  in fiscal versus fiscal costs and expenses 
manufacturing costs including costs associated with research and development revenues decreased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal  a decrease of  or 
this decrease is due mainly to productivity improvements in the form of higher yields and the resultant reduction in scrap  primarily in tube manufacturing and processing in the company s west coast facility 
the company s east coast manufacturing facility also experienced productivity improvements in fiscal compared to fiscal  reflecting improved manufacturing yields and rapid adjustment of staffing to levels of business 
due to the reduction in manufacturing costs  the company s gross profit from product sales increased to in fiscal from in fiscal this improvement was due primarily to efficiencies gained by process improvements in tube and stent production 
the company s ability to maintain these improved levels of gross profit will depend primarily on its success in securing sufficient business to absorb plant overhead  maintaining product pricing in the face of increasing competitive pressure  and maintaining manufacturing yields at acceptable levels 
operating expenses  including general  selling and administration expenses and research and development costs increased  or  to  in fiscal  as compared to  in fiscal general  selling and administration expenses increased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal  an increase of  this increase is primarily due to the bonus accrual of  in fiscal  which is based on a plan approved by the company s compensation committee that accrues bonuses based on a combination of pre tax profit and individual performance 
there was no bonus expense in fiscal another factor that contributed to the increase in general  selling and administration expenses was the increase in investment banking fees which reflects the company s increased efforts in the areas of business development and mergers and acquisitions 
the company has maintained its current levels of expenditures on selling and marketing in order to support future growth in revenues 
the company incurred research and development expenses of  relating to its own internal products as well as the development of future products in fiscal compared to  during fiscal this increase is primarily due to an increase in engineering expense resulting from a shift in focus of staff engineers from manufacturing support to new process development and prototype support 
net interest changed to income of  in fiscal from an expense of  in fiscal  due primarily to an increase in interest income associated with a higher average cash balance and a reduction in interest expense associated with a reduced level of borrowing 
income taxes 
the company recorded a provision for income taxes of  for fiscal versus a tax benefit of  for fiscal this change is due primarily to the elimination of the deferred tax valuation allowance of  in fiscal to recognize deferred tax assets at amounts considered by management more likely than not to be realized and the recording of state research and development r d tax credits of  in fiscal prior to the elimination of the deferred tax valuation allowance in fiscal and state r d tax credits in fiscal  the effective rate was for both years 
net income 
due to the items noted above  the company s net income decreased by  to  in fiscal compared to net income of  in fiscal years ended june  and june  revenues 
revenues increased in fiscal  to  from  in fiscal  a net increase of  shipments of wire based medical stent components increased approximately  between fiscal and fiscal and tube based medical stent components increased approximately  during the same period 
other medical device component shipments  including products utilized in minimally invasive surgery and guidewire applications  increased approximately  between fiscal and fiscal revenues from sales of arch wire  high pressure sealing plugs  and locking devices increased approximately  during fiscal compared to fiscal  and revenues from prototype development and r d activities increased  during fiscal as compared to fiscal these revenue increases were partially offset by a decrease of approximately  in shipments of super elastic tube  utilized in coronary applications and for other peripheral stenting  and a decrease of  in other super elastic semi finished materials utilized in various industrial applications 
costs and expenses 
manufacturing costs including costs associated with research and development revenue increased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal  an increase of  or 
the company s gross margin from sales decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal this cost increase and margin deterioration in fiscal compared to fiscal is the result of poor manufacturing yields in both the company s wire and tube based aaa stent component businesses and a significant reduction in the percentage of high margin super elastic tube in the product mix and a significant reduction in the percentage of high margin super elastic tube in the product mix 
super elastic tube shipments declined because a major customer of the company that was a significant user of super elastic tube ceased production of a product 
operating expenses  including general  selling and administration expenses and research and development costs decreased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal  a decrease of  or 
general  selling and administration expenses decreased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal  a decrease of  this decrease is primarily due to a reduction in consulting  bonuses and legal costs 
the company incurred research and development expenses of  relating to its own internal products as well as the development of future products in fiscal compared to  during fiscal net interest expense decreased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal  due primarily to an increase in interest income associated with a higher cash balance along with a reduction in interest expense associated with a reduced level of borrowing 
income taxes 
the company recorded a tax benefit of  for fiscal versus a provision of  for fiscal this change is due primarily to the elimination of the deferred tax valuation allowance during the second quarter of fiscal to recognize deferred tax assets at amounts considered by management more likely than not to be realized 
net income 
due to the items noted above  the company s net income increased by  to  in fiscal compared to net income of  in fiscal liquidity and capital resources at june   the company s cash and cash equivalents was  an increase of  from  at the start of fiscal net cash provided by operations was  in fiscal  a decrease of  from  provided during fiscal this decrease was primarily due to an increase in cash generated from income of  combined with a reduction in the rate of accounts receivable collections  the reduction in inventory usage and the reduction in the rate of accounts payable payments 
in fiscal  we expect to continue positive cash flows from operations 
net cash used in investing activities was  in fiscal  a decrease of  from  during fiscal this decrease was due to a reduction in capital expenditures in fiscal during fiscal  net cash used in financing activities was  reflecting the pay down of notes payable of  and financing costs of  incurred in connection with the amended webster facility described below 
working capital at june   was  an increase of  from  at june  the increase in working capital was due to the  net cash provided by operations offset by the  of capital expenditures and  net debt repayments 
in fiscal and fiscal  the primary capital requirements were to fund additions to property  plant  and equipment 
to meet growing demand  particularly in the medical device market for the production of nitinol stents and other components  the company has committed to optimizing the manufacturing efficiency of its current facilities and expects to invest between million and million in capital equipment and facility improvements in fiscal on june   the company and webster bank entered into a commercial revolving loan  term loan  line of credit and security agreement and related financing documents and agreements  with amendments to certain of such documents entered into on each of november   june  and december  the webster facility 
on january   the company and webster bank entered into a second amended and restated commercial revolving loan  term loan  line of credit and security agreement  which amended and restated the webster facility  and expires on january  the amended webster facility 
the amended webster facility includes a revolving line of credit for borrowings up to the lesser of a  or b an amount equal to the aggregate of of the eligible accounts receivable plus the lesser of  or of eligible inventories 
in connection with the amended webster facility  several existing term loans and equipment line advances totaling  plus additional proceeds of  totaling  were refinanced into a single term loan  payable in equal monthly installments over a five year period ending january  the amended webster facility includes an equipment line of credit that provides for equipment financing up to the lesser of  or of the hard cost for eligible equipment through january  the amended webster facility also provides for an acquisition line of credit of up to  providing certain terms and conditions are met 
as of june   no amounts were outstanding under the revolving line of credit  equipment line of credit or acquisition line of credit 
interest on the term note payable  revolving line of credit  equipment line of credit  and acquisition line of credit is variable based on libor plus a spread adjusted quarterly based upon the company s fixed charge coverage ratio  as defined 
the new facility is collateralized by substantially all of the company s assets 
at june   a note payable of  was outstanding under the amended webster facility 
no amount was outstanding under the revolving line of credit 
in addition  the amended webster facility contains various restrictive covenants  including  among others  limitations on encumbrances and additional debt  the payment of dividends or redemption of stock above a certain maximum amount and compliance with the company s fixed charge coverage ratio  as defined 
under the amended webster facility the company has limitations on indebtedness 
the company may not create  incur or guarantee any indebtedness or obligation for borrowed money or issue or sell any of its obligations to any lender with out a waiver from webster 
the exception are for equipment financing currently in place at the time the agreement was signed  capital lease for future equipment needs not to be greater than  in any fiscal year and indebtedness in respect of hedging agreements 
if the company was in violation of this limitation and was unable to obtain a waiver  this action would potentially have a negative impact on the company s ability to conduct merger and acquisition activities 
the company has in the past grown through acquisitions including the acquisition of wire solutions and raychem corporation s nickel titanium product line 
as part of its continuing growth strategy  the company expects to continue to evaluate and pursue opportunities to acquire other companies  assets and product lines that either complement or expand the company s existing businesses 
the company intends to use available cash from operations  debt  and authorized but unissued common stock to finance any such acquisitions 
on july   memry announced that it signed a letter of intent to acquire substantially all of the assets and selected liabilities of putnam plastics corporation putnam 
the transaction  which is subject to the signing of definitive agreements and customary closing conditions  is expected to close by october  putnam  a privately held corporation  is one of the nation s leading specialty polymer extrusion companies serving the medical device and other high technology industries

putnam is a major supplier of co extruded polyimide  multi lumen  braided and extremely thin wall  multi layer tubing as well as sheathing for fiber optic tubing 
putnam s products are known for their complex configurations  multiple material construction and innovative designs 
putnam also is well known for its ability to manufacture to tight tolerances 
on august   the company announced that it will finance a  joint development program with and has made a  initial investment  in the form of a unsecured convertible loan  in biomer technology ltd  a privately owned company specializing in the development and manufacture of state of the art polymers and biocompatible coatings for stents and other medical devices 
based in runcorn  england  biomer technology ltd is a biomaterials company that has developed a range of high performance polyurethanes  process technology  components and products for medical device manufacturing 
the company has requirements to fund plant and equipment projects to support the expected increased sales volume of smas and super elastic materials during the fiscal year ending june  and beyond 
the company expects that it will be able to finance these expenditures through a combination of existing working capital  cash flows generated through operations and increased borrowings 
the largest risk to the liquidity of the company would be an event that caused an interruption of cash flow generated through operations  because such an event could also have a negative impact on the company s ability to access credit 
the company s current dependence on a limited number of products and customers represents the greatest risk to operations 
on july   the company signed a second amendment for its manufacturing and office facility located at campbell avenue  menlo park  ca extending the lease to june  the monthly rent amount was adjusted to approximately  subsequent rent adjustments of per year are also set forth in the second amendment
