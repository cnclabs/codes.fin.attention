we design and or manufacture printed circuit board assemblies  radio frequency  or rf  modules  display modules and systems  and complete systems for customers in the automotive  computing  consumer  industrial  medical  and telecommunications industries 
our services include advanced engineering support  designed for services  automated printed circuit board assembly  in circuit and functional testing  systems level integration and box build  turnkey packaging  fulfillment services  and turnkey supply chain management services  all of which enable our customers the ability to outsource all stages of product engineering  design  development  materials procurement and management  manufacturing  and testing 
unlike most ems companies  our design and manufacturing services include a distinctive competence in display modules and systems and the integration of display modules and systems into other products 
these display module and systems include monochrome and color liquid crystal display  or lcd  components  organic light emitting diodes  or oleds  and flat panel monitors 
the products we manufacture for customers are of varying sizes and have varying levels of integration 
the typical design program life cycle of a custom designed product is three to months and includes technical design  prototyping  pilot manufacturing  and high volume manufacturing 
the cycle is shorter in products where no display is involved and or where the customer has already completed the design 
several factors impact our gross margins  including manufacturing efficiencies  product mix  product differentiation  product uniqueness  inventory management  and volume pricing 
we have factories in washington and massachusetts in the united states and in the philippines  malaysia  and china 
in washington and in malaysia  we provide engineering support  automated printed circuit board assembly  in circuit and functional testing  systems integration and box build  complete supply chain management  and turnkey packaging and fulfillment services 
in massachusetts  we provide aftermarket customization of flat panel displays 
in the philippines and china  we assemble displays into modules and are adding some of the manufacturing services 
table of contents offered in washington and malaysia 
we also assemble rf modules in the philippines 
in the first quarter of  we announced that we are consolidating our overseas lcd module operations in china 
we estimated the cost of that reorganization at million  most of which will occur in the first quarter of once that consolidation has occurred  the philippines facility will focus only on rf modules 
selling  general  and administrative expense consists principally of administrative and selling costs  salaries  commissions  and benefits to personnel  and related facility costs 
in general  these costs have risen as a result of the acquisitions we have completed in the last fifteen months 
we make substantially all of our sales directly to oems through a sales force that consists mainly of direct technical sales persons but also includes a small representative network 
as a result  there is no material cost of distribution in our selling  general  and administrative expense 
research  development  and engineering expense consists principally of salaries and benefits to design engineers and other technical personnel  related facility costs  process development costs  and various expenses for projects  including new product development 
in general  these costs have declined in the last few years because we no longer do any pure research work 
thus  most of our expense relates to the development engineering costs associated with preproduction design and prototyping of custom products and the conceptual formulation and design of potential standard display products 
we also have expenses relating to the amortization of intangibles 
those expenses relate to amortizable intangibles acquired in acquisitions as described below 
future operations our long term model is to have gross margins of percent to percent and operating costs of between percent and percent of revenue 
our goal is to achieve an interim model within months of percent to percent gross margins with operating costs of between percent and percent of revenue 
the drivers to achieving our long term and interim models are improving the utilization of our off shore factories through increased revenue and improving our gross margins by focusing on markets  like gaming and medical  which value our unique combination of global ems capabilities and display expertise 
historic operations prior to  our business strategy was to seek large volume display programs from major original equipment manufacturers  or oems  typically  units per year or higher  with selling prices of approximately per unit 
from to  substantially all of our large volume business was in providing display modules for motorola handsets 
in  new monochrome design wins in that business became unprofitable  thus  we began to refocus our strategy to expand our customer base and our product and service offering 
as a result of our change in strategy  none of our design wins in the last several years have been with the handset group at motorola 
consequently  motorola business declined sharply  accounting for of our revenue in and less than of our revenue in we further modified our strategy in late to also begin focusing on providing manufacturing services for products that do not need displays 
the substantial shift in our business strategy has resulted in increased selling and administrative costs 
by previously focusing on one market and one customer  we were able to be very efficient in the utilization of our selling and administrative groups 
by contrast  we now have many more customers requiring more sales interface 
in addition  administrative costs have increased as we have increased the number of satellite operations in the united states and around the world 
in addition  the shift in sales strategy from a high volume focus to a more value add focus has resulted in reduced volumes at higher selling prices 
the reduced volumes have resulted in some excess capacity at our factories overseas 
prior to  we used our own front end lcd production line in the phoenix area for the manufacture of more technologically complex and custom high volume lcds 
we also purchased lcds from third parties to provide us an alternate source and to ensure available capacity 
in order to take advantage of lower labor costs  we traditionally shipped lcds to our facilities in the philippines and china for assembly into modules 
during  we decided to move our front end lcd manufacturing line to asia 
during  we signed a cooperative agreement with a chinese company under which we agreed to sell the equipment used in our front end lcd line 
table of contents and establish a supply agreement 
under the terms of the cooperative agreement  in exchange for our front end lcd equipment  we received a total of million in cash 
in the second quarter of  as a result of signing the cooperative agreement  we realized a charge of million for the write down on the lcd equipment sold to the chinese company 
this charge was reported as a separate line item in operating expense 
in connection with the cooperative agreement  we received million in  all of which was applied against the million sales price and recorded as a reduction in the carrying value of the lcd equipment held for sale 
the sale of the equipment is now complete  and we received the remaining  payment in as a result of the foregoing  we have substantially changed our business since late in we have reduced our concentration in motorola revenue 
the selling price of the products we manufacture and sell now range up to  per unit 
we have numerous customers in six principal markets 
we have expanded our business both through organic growth and through the acquisitions of avt  etma  unico  and integrex 
we have also expanded through the license arrangement with data international and through our manufacturing agreement with microtune 
acquisitions and strategic transactions in september  we purchased the assets and ongoing business of avt  located in marlborough  massachusetts  a privately held company that specializes in the design and integration of complex  high resolution display systems 
as a result  we now design and provide customized and ruggedized flat panel  touchscreen  and rackmount systems for oems in the industrial and medical markets 
we outsource display components from a variety of companies  including sony  sharp  nec  lg  and samsung 
the purchase price of the acquisition was million  which we paid entirely in cash 
in december  we purchased the stock of etma corporation  located in redmond  washington  a privately held electronic manufacturer for oem customers in the computer peripheral  medical monitoring  and internet security industries 
as a result  we now offer the manufacturing capabilities of five surface mount manufacturing lines  including one dedicated to new product introduction and prototyping activity 
we also provide engineering support  automated printed circuit board assembly  in circuit and functional testing  systems integration and box build  complete supply chain management  and turnkey packaging and fulfillment services 
the purchase price of the etma acquisition was million  which we paid entirely in cash 
in january  we signed licensing and manufacturing agreements with data international co  ltd 
of taiwan 
under those agreements  we became the exclusive channel in the americas for standard and custom lcd products manufactured by data international 
we also have the right to sell those products through our worldwide channels 
the agreements provide us with access to a full suite of standard display products that round out our existing standard product portfolio 
in conjunction with the agreement  we established a sales office in orlando  florida  and hired sales and applications engineering personnel from a distributor that had previously supported data international s products 
the cost of the license was million  of which million was paid upon signing and approximately million was paid in the first quarter of the remaining million is due in january the remaining balance due is subject to reduction if certain margin targets are not met 
in march  we signed an agreement with microtune  inc in which we agreed to manufacture  assemble  and test microtune s radio frequency  or rf  tuner modules and wireless module products in our manufacturing facility in manila  the philippines 
as part of the agreement  microtune sold to us certain of its own equipment and inventory for million  of which million was a note payable due in september  and contracted with us to provide of microtune s current demand for fully assembled rf subsystems 
we also hired approximately microtune employees in manila 
in october  we paid off approximately  of the million note payable to microtune and entered into an agreement to cancel the remaining million balance on that note in exchange for the return of certain excess inventory to microtune 
as a result of this transaction  we now provide of the manufacturing outsourcing for microtune s rf module products 
in april  we acquired the business and certain assets of unico technology bhd  a privately held malaysian company located in penang 
unico was an electronic manufacturer for oem customers in the computer  computer peripheral  and communications industries 
the unico business was acquired by tfs electronics manufacturing services sdn 
bhd  or tfs malaysia  a joint venture owned by an overseas tfs subsidiary and by unico holdings bhd  the former parent of unico 
unico holdings is the investment arm of the chinese chamber of commerce of malaysia 
our share of the initial cost of capitalizing tfs malaysia was million and 
table of contents unico holdings share was million  most of which will be used for working capital 
tfs malaysia purchased million in inventory from unico  of which million was paid at the time of the purchase and million was subsequently paid 
no advance payment was required for the acquisition of the property  plant  and equipment of unico  all of which is leased from the seller 
the equipment lease is accounted for as a capital lease payable by tfs malaysia 
the principal balance on that lease was million as of december  in february  we entered into a transaction with integrex  a seattle based electronics manufacturing services company liquidating its business 
under that transaction  we bought the raw materials inventory of integrex and hired certain of its employees 
we also obtained the rights to most of its customers and agreed with those customers that we would manufacture those customers products in our redmond manufacturing facility 
in exchange for those customer rights  we agreed to pay a license fee for between and months based on revenue actually received by us from the sale of products to the former integrex customers 
a portion of that license fee was paid in advance at closing 
discontinued operations on september   we transferred all of the net assets of our microdisplay division  plus approximately million in cash  into a newly created delaware corporation called brillian corporation 
on september   we spun off brillian by distributing all of the outstanding common stock of brillian to our stockholders on a pro rata basis  with each of our stockholder receiving one share of brillian common stock for each four shares of our common stock held 
brillian is now traded on the nasdaq national market under the symbol brlc 
brillian had million of net assets on the spin off date 
for more information on the reason for the spin off  as well as the description of business and risks associated with the spin off  please refer to the form and other filings by brillian with the securities and exchange commission 
the microdisplay business that we transferred to brillian is now reported in our consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap in the united states 
during preparation of these financial statements  we are required to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to sales returns  bad debts  inventories  fixed assets  intangible assets  income taxes  and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
the results form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
we recognize revenue from product sales when persuasive evidence of a sale exists  that is  a product is shipped under an agreement with a customer  risk of loss and title has passed to the customer  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
this means that when a product is shipped from one of our factories under the terms fob factory then the risk of loss passes to the customer when the product leaves our factory and we recognize revenue at that time 
on the other hand  when a product is shipped fob destination then the risk of loss during transit is maintained by us 
thus  we recognize revenue when the product is accepted by the customer 
shipping terms with one of our major customers is fob destination  and many of those products are shipped by water taking four to six weeks to reach their destination 
as a result  we had million of product in transit at the end of the year and in our finished goods inventory 
sales allowances are estimated based upon historical experience of sales returns 
to establish our allowance for doubtful accounts  we perform credit evaluations of our customers financial condition  along with analyzing past experience  and make provisions for doubtful accounts based on the outcome of our credit valuations and analysis 
we evaluate the collectability of our accounts receivable based on specific customer circumstances  
table of contents current economic trends  historical experience with collections and the age of past due receivables 
we believe the allowances that we have established are adequate under the circumstances  however  a change in the economic environment or a customer s financial condition could cause our estimates of allowances  and consequently the provision for doubtful accounts to change 
we recognize revenue related to engineering and tooling services after service has been rendered  which is determined based upon completion of agreed upon milestones or deliverables 
we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory 
we write down our inventory to estimated market value based upon assumptions and estimates about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by us  additional inventory write downs may be required 
we made two significant estimates regarding inventory at the end of first  we are holding approximately  of inventory relating to a program cancelled by a customer 
approximately of that inventory related to material that we had purchased to fulfill purchase orders issued to us by that customer and of that inventory related to material that we purchased in connection with a general business agreement entered into with respect to that customer regarding long lead time parts 
as a result of initial discussions with the customer  we have not established a reserve for any of this inventory 
second  we learned from another customer prior to the end of the year that a product shipped by us to them contained potentially defective parts 
those potentially defective parts came from a component supplied to us by a vendor specified by our customer 
we are investigating whether those parts can be repaired or whether they are unrepairable 
if they are unrepairable  then approximately million of inventory that we are holding would be worthless 
it is our belief that such parts can be repaired 
it is also our belief that if such parts cannot be repaired  then the liability for such worthless inventory would lie with the vendor of the defective component 
as a result  we did not record a reserve for any potentially bad inventory relating to this second issue 
pursuant to financial accounting standards board fasb statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  income taxes are recorded based on current year amounts payable or refundable  as well as the consequences of events that give rise to deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we base our estimate of current and deferred taxes on the tax laws and rates that are currently in effect in the appropriate jurisdiction 
changes in tax laws or rates may affect the current amounts payable or refundable as well as the amount of deferred tax assets or liabilities 
at the end of the second quarter of  we had million of net deferred tax assets  resulting primarily from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
sfas no 
requires that a valuation allowance be established when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
in determining whether a valuation allowance is required  we are required to take into account all positive and negative evidence with regard to the utilization of a deferred tax asset  including our past earnings history  market conditions  management forecasts of future profitability  the character and jurisdiction of such earnings  unsettled circumstances that  if unfavorably resolved  would adversely affect utilization of a deferred tax asset  carryback and carryforward periods  and tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of realization of a deferred tax asset 
sfas no 
further states that it is difficult to conclude that a valuation allowance is not needed when there is negative evidence such as cumulative losses in recent years 
therefore  despite the fact that a major portion of the losses came from our spun off microdisplay division  the expectation in the third quarter of was that we would have three years of cumulative losses 
those cumulative losses weighed heavily in the overall required assessment and outweighed our forecasted future profitability and expectation that we will be able to utilize all of our net operating loss carryforwards 
as a result  in the third quarter of  we recorded a charge to establish a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset 
we expect to continue to record a full valuation allowance on future tax benefits until we return to sustained profitability 
during  our income tax expense was million as a result of our full valuation allowance 
long term assets  such as property  plant  and equipment  intangibles  goodwill  and other investments  are originally recorded at cost 
on an on going basis  we assess these assets to determine if their current recorded value is impaired 
when assessing these assets  we consider projected future cash flows to determine if impairment is applicable 
these cash flows are evaluated for objectivity by using weighted probability techniques and also comparisons of past performance against projections 
assets may also be evaluated by identifying independent market values of assets that we believe to be comparable 
if we believe that an asset s value was impaired  we would 
table of contents write down the carrying value of the identified asset and charge the impairment as an expense in the period in which the determination was made 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentage of net sales of certain items in our consolidated financial statements 
years ended december  net sales costs and expenses cost of sales selling  general  and administrative research  development and engineering loss gain on sale of assets amortization of customer lists operating loss other income  net minority interest in loss of consolidated subsidiary loss from continuing operations before income taxes provision for benefit from income taxes loss from continuing operations loss from discontinued operations net loss year ended december  compared to year ended december  overview of this was a year of transition for us 
prior to late  we were a monochrome custom lcd module supplier servicing primarily motorola in the handset market 
beginning in the second half of  we expanded our capabilities to include standard  color and large format display products 
more importantly  as a result of several acquisitions  we became a broad based electronics manufacturing services company offering services such as advanced printed circuit board assembly  rf module assembly  and box build 
in addition  we made the decision in to spin off our research intensive microdisplay business to brillian 
finally  we ceased manufacturing display modules for motorola s handset business in the second half of this rapid change resulted in several issues during the year  including integration issues with the rf module business  excess capacity at the display module factories  and negative margins on new color display products 
in the fourth quarter of  we remedied the initial negative margin issues on the color display products 
we also made improvements in the manufacturing issues we had with the rf modules 
in addition  in the first quarter of  we announced that we are consolidating our display module operations in china by closing the display module operations in the philippines 
it is anticipated that the consolidation will help  but not completely remedy  our excess capacity issue in display modules 
among our principal focuses in is successfully transitioning the lcd display operations to china  increasing the utilization of our asian factories  and increasing our gross margins 
net sales 
net sales increased to million in from million in the increase in revenue was primarily as a result of additional manufacturing business in redmond and malaysia of million  growth of our rf module business of million  the addition of our standard product displays from data international of million  and sales of color display modules of million 
conversely  our sales to motorola declined  both in dollars and as a percentage of our net sales 
motorola accounted for less than of our net sales in compared to in we had two customers that each exceeded more than of our net sales in avocent  which is in the computer peripherals business  accounted for of our net sales  and vitelcom  a european telecom company  accounted for of our net sales 

table of contents in  our sales were distributed over six major markets automotive  computing  consumer  industrial  medical instrumentation  and telecommunications 
by contrast  in  we were highly concentrated with of our sales coming from a single market  telecommunications 
our net sales distributed by industry were as follows industry computing telecom medical industrial consumer automotive geographically  in  of our sales were in the united states  of our sales were in asia  and of our sales were in europe 
our recent trend has shown increased sales in the united states and europe 
our increased sales in the united states were primarily a result of several recently acquired businesses and because of increased display oriented manufacturing business 
our increased sales in europe were primarily as a result of the increased sales of color lcd modules to a european handset manufacturing company 
asia sales have declined because of the reduced sales to motorola  most of which were in china 
not including motorola  however  the trend has been that our sales in asia are increasing 
most of our asian sales are to us based  multinational companies with factories located in asia 
cost of sales 
cost of sales increased to of net sales in from in our gross margin is equal to the difference between our revenue and our cost of sales 
consequently  our company wide gross margin in was million  or of net sales 
for products manufactured in redmond  marlborough  and penang  our gross margin was higher than this aggregate gross margin 
for products manufactured in beijing and manila  the gross margins were lower than the aggregate gross margin for three reasons 
first  the unit volume of our sales in beijing and manila was lower because of the reduced sales to motorola and because the replacement sales to other customers have lower volumes but higher selling prices 
these reduced manufacturing volumes resulted in under absorption of our fixed manufacturing costs 
second  in manila the gross margins on our color display products were negative because of introductory pricing on new products and because we had not obtained expected pricing reductions from vendors of color panels 
third  we were still in the process of ramping up our rf module manufacturing in manila and moving those processes from microtune s factory to ours 
as a result  those products sold at below breakeven during the ramp up phase 
we expect over capacity to continue in the next year at some of our asian factories 
we are partially addressing this under utilization by consolidating our display module assembly operations in beijing  which will result in reorganization costs in manila as we right size that organization to focus on rf 
selling  general  and administrative expense 
selling  general  and administrative expense increased to million in from million in as a percentage of net sales  however  sg a expense decreased from of net sales in to of net sales in this change in sg a expense occurred primarily because of four factors the additional sg a costs associated with the acquired ems business in redmond of million  the additional sg a costs associated with the acquired ems business in penang of million  increased sales expenses as a result of increased display sales of million  and the recording of expenses of approximately million associated with an arbitration claim we pursued against jd edwards  which has been settled 
research  development  and engineering expense 
research  development  and engineering expense decreased slightly to million in from million in research  development  and engineering expense decreased as a percentage of net sales  declining to of net sales in from of net sales in loss gain on sale of assets 
in  we realized a gain of  for the sale of certain assets compared to a loss of million in the loss in related to the sale of our front end manufacturing lcd equipment  described above in overview 

table of contents amortization of intangibles 
during  we had million of amortization relating to customer lists and distribution rights compared to  amortization expense during the amortization in relates to the acquisitions of avt and etma and to the license agreement with data international  all described above in overview 
the amortizable asset associated with avt is million and is being amortized over five years 
the amortizable asset associated with etma is million and is being amortized over three years 
the amortizable asset associated with data international is million and is being amortized over five years 
other income expense  net 
other income in was  compared to million in the primary difference was that interest income decreased million because of decreased cash and investments balances and because the interest rate earned on investments was lower in than the interest expense increased  and was primarily associated with the capital leases for our equipment acquired in malaysia and redmond in the unico and etma acquisitions described above in overview 
in  we reached a settlement of our legal claim against jd edwards and recorded the settlement as other income of approximately minority interest 
we control and own of the business in malaysia 
since that business had losses in  we recorded a benefit of  to account for the losses allocated to the minority interest holder compared to a charge of  in relating to the winding up of another investment with a different minority partner 
provision for benefit from income taxes 
we recorded a provision for income taxes of million in compared to a benefit for income taxes of million for we recorded a charge in to establish a valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset  which consists primarily of net operating loss carryforwards  or nols 
a further description of that allowance in described above in critical accounting policies and estimates 
the loss from discontinued operation was net of a tax benefit of million for the year ended december  there was no tax benefit in for discontinued operations 
net loss 
we had a net loss of million  or per diluted share  in compared to a net loss of million  or per diluted share  in the net loss in included million  or per share  from discontinued operations relating to our former microdisplay business 
as described above in discontinued operations  our microdisplay division was spun off as a separate public company as of september   as brillian corporation 
the net loss for the brillian discontinued operations in was million  or per share 
although we are forecasting a per share loss of between and in  we do expect a return to profitability in the fourth quarter of as we increase our production volume and mitigate our excess capacity 
we anticipate we will realize the benefit of consolidating our display module assembly operations from manila to beijing in the third quarter of year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales 
net sales decreased to million in from million in the reduction was primarily because of our reduced volume of business with our major customer  motorola 
we shipped million units to motorola in compared to million units in in addition  the average selling price of those motorola units shipped in was substantially lower than in because of pricing pressures in the high volume  monochrome lcd market 
shipments were lower to motorola because of our strategic decision not to seek business from customers that would produce very low or negative gross margins 
cost of sales 
cost of sales decreased to of net sales in from in this percentage decrease resulted primarily from cost reduction efforts undertaken throughout the cost of sales continued to be higher than our long range expectations because our fixed costs were under absorbed at our overseas factories as a result of excess capacity 
selling  general  and administrative expense 
selling  general  and administrative expense increased to million in from million in in  sg a consisted primarily of fixed costs because we had no distribution costs and a small sales force that focused on custom products 
thus  sg a increased in  primarily as a result of our acquisitions of avt and etma 
research  development  and engineering expense 
research  development  and engineering expense decreased to million in from million in as we shifted resources into our microdisplay division  which is now reported as discontinued operations 

table of contents loss gain on sale of assets 
during the second quarter of  we signed a cooperative agreement with a chinese company under which we agreed to sell the equipment of our front end manufacturing lcd line and establish a supply agreement 
we realized a charge of million for the write down on the lcd equipment 
this charge was reported as a separate line item in operating expense 
during  we wrote off million of costs relating to the cancellation of our jd edwards enterprise resource planning system implementation 
amortization of intangibles 
as a result of the acquisitions of avt and etma  we added a new line item in for operating costs related to the amortization of intangible assets of customer lists that have definable lives 
we had no such expense in and  for most of that expense related to the acquisition of avt 
the initial total amount of amortizable assets associated with avt was million 
we also acquired etma corporation in the fourth quarter of  and the initial total amount of amortizable assets associated with etma was million 
the avt related assets will be amortized over five years while the etma assets will be amortized over three years 
other income expense  net 
other income in was  slightly higher than other income of  in net interest income in was million compared to million in benefit from income taxes 
we recorded a benefit from income taxes of million in compared to a benefit for income taxes of million in the company had an effective tax rate of in compared to an effective tax rate of in the difference was primarily a change in relative operational results between us and foreign jurisdictions and the impact of recording a valuation allowance on foreign tax credits carry forwards in in other words  a greater portion of our net loss in related to higher tax rate jurisdictions  thereby causing the accrued tax benefit to be a greater percentage of our net loss 
net loss 
in  we recorded a net loss of million  or per diluted share  compared to a net loss of million  or per diluted share  in continuing operations recorded a loss of million  or per share  in compared to a loss of million  or per share  in discontinued operations recorded a net loss of million  or per diluted share  in compared to a net loss of million  or per diluted share  in liquidity and capital resources at december   we had cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments of million compared to million at december  the primary components of reduced cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments balances can be summarized for as follows operating cash flow capital expenditures and acquisitions a debt and capital lease repayments cash used in and contributed to discontinued operations a includes the following lines from the cash flows purchases of property  plant  and equipment  proceeds from sale of assets  purchase of intangibles  and acquisitions in  we had million in net cash outflow from operations compared to million in net cash inflow from operations in our inventory turns were and day sales outstanding  or dsos  were days in compared with inventory turns and dsos in our depreciation and amortization expense was million in and million in our working capital was million at december   down from million at december  our current ratio at december  was to compared to to at december  the decrease in working capital was primarily because of reduced cash balances 
while we transact business predominantly in us dollars and bill and collect most of our sales in us dollars  we collect a portion of our revenue in non us currencies  such as the chinese renminbi 
in the future  customers increasingly may make payments in non us currencies  such as the euro 
in addition  we account for a 
table of contents portion of our costs  such as payroll  rent  and indirect operating costs  in non us currencies  including philippine pesos  british pounds sterling  malaysian ringgit  and chinese renminbi 
thus  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could affect our cost of goods and operating margins and could result in exchange losses 
in addition  currency devaluation can result in a loss to us if we hold deposits of that currency 
hedging foreign currencies can be difficult  especially if the currency is not freely traded 
we cannot predict the impact of future exchange rate fluctuations on our operating results 
these currency risks are particularly important since sales outside north america represented of our net sales in and of our net sales in sales in foreign markets  primarily europe and asia  to oems based in the united states accounted for almost all of our international sales in both of these periods 
we currently have no credit facility outstanding in the united states 
we expect to negotiate one or more credit facilities in  although we do not expect to need any such facility in the near future 
any such facility would likely be secured by our working capital assets  our unencumbered building in tempe  arizona  or both 
in september  we paid off our unsecured million term loan to the bank of china  but we have initiated discussions to re open that credit facility 
the following tables list our contractual obligations and commercial commitments payments due by period contractual obligations total less years in thousands obligations than year years years and over notes payable operating leases capital leases total contractual cash obligations amount of commitment expiration per period other commercial commitments total less years in thousands commitments than year years years and over guarantee the operating leases include leases for our factories in manila  penang  washington  massachusetts  our ground lease in arizona  and our sales office in florida 
these leases are described in detail in item of this report 
the capital leases are for our equipment in malaysia and washington 
the guarantee relates to our guarantee in connection with a small business administration loan to voiceviewer technology  inc  a privately held company developing microdisplay products 
brillian assumed this guarantee on the spin off 
if the lending institution were to declare voiceviewer to be in default under the loan  however  and if brillian corporation were unable to satisfy its obligation as primary guarantor  then we would be required to pay the guaranteed amount 
as previously noted  the microdisplay division of our company  now reported as discontinued operations  was spun off as a separate public company  brillian corporation  as of september  we distributed approximately million in cash in connection with the spin off of brillian corporation 
we have no other long term debt  capital lease obligations  unconditional purchase obligations  or other long term obligations  and we do not have any other commercial commitments or other off balance sheet arrangements 
we believe that our existing balances of cash  cash equivalents  and investments will provide adequate sources to fund our operations and planned expenditures through  as well as to meet our contractual obligations 
specifically  we have over million in cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments 
our currently planned cash outflows for include capital expenditures of less than million  the potential purchase of our manila facility for million  and an estimated million for inventory and prepaid amounts in the integrex transaction 
we expect operating cash outflow to consume only a small portion of our cash reserves  but based on our revenue forecast  we will need substantial working capital in the second half of we expect to 
table of contents close on one or more credit facilities in to fund those working capital needs  although we expect that such a facility will not be required because the expected total cash outflows for are substantially less than our existing cash balances 
we expect to continue our acquisition strategy 
new acquisitions or alliances may result in our needing to expand our loan commitments or pursue alternate methods of financing or raise capital 
we cannot provide assurance that adequate additional loan commitments or alternative methods of financing will be available or  if available  that they will be on terms acceptable to us 
impact of recently issued standards 
in november  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
this interpretation addresses the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its financial statements and its obligations under guarantees 
the interpretation also clarifies the requirements related to the recognition of a liability by the guarantor at the inception of a guarantee 
per the interpretation  initial recognition of a liability shall be applied only on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  we adopted the requirements of fin as of january   and there was no impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in january  the emerging issues task force eitf issued eitf  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
eitf addresses the issues of how to determine whether an arrangement involving multiple deliverables contains more than one unit of accounting and how arrangement consideration should be measured and allocated to the separate units of accounting in the arrangement 
eitf does not change otherwise applicable revenue recognition criteria 
eitf is effective for revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june  the application of eitf did not have a material effect on our financial statements 
in november  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  which clarifies the application of accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements  relating to consolidation of certain entities 
this interpretation was subsequently revised by fin revised in december this interpretation states that consolidation of variable interest entities will be required by the primary beneficiary if the entities do not effectively disperse risk among the parties involved 
the requirements are effective for fiscal years ending after december  we have no variable interest entities and do not believe that fin no 
will pact our future financial results 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity sfas no 

sfas no 
requires the classification of certain financial instruments  previously classified within the equity section of the balance sheet  to be included in liabilities 
sfas no 
is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may  and june  for all other instruments 
the adoption of sfas no 
did not have an impact on our financial statements 
rule b trading plans our insider trading policy permits our directors  officers  and other key personnel to establish purchase and sale programs in accordance with rule b adopted by the securities and exchange commission 
the rule permits employees to adopt written plans at a time before becoming aware of material nonpublic information and to sell shares according to a plan on a regular basis for example  weekly or monthly  regardless of any subsequent nonpublic information they receive 
in our view  rule b plans are beneficial because systematic  pre planned sales that take place over an extended period should have a less disruptive influence on the price of our stock 
we also believe plans of this type are beneficial because they inform the marketplace about the nature of the trading activities of our directors and officers 
in the absence of such information  the market could mistakenly attribute transactions as reflecting a lack of confidence in our company or an indication of an impending event involving our company 
we recognize that our directors and officers may have reasons totally apart from the company in determining to effect transactions in our common stock 
these reasons could include the purchase of a home  tax and estate planning  the payment of college tuition  the establishment of a trust  the balancing of assets  or other personal reasons 
the establishment of any trading plan involving our company requires the pre clearance by our chief executive officer or chief financial officer 
an individual adopting a trading plan must comply with all 
table of contents requirements of rule b  including the requirement that the individual not possess any material nonpublic information regarding our company at the time of the establishment of the plan 
in addition  sales under a trading plan may be made no earlier than days after the plan establishment date 
no officers currently maintain trading plans 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk derivative financial instruments  other financial instruments  and derivative commodity instruments at december   we did not participate in any derivative financial instruments  or other financial and commodity instruments for which fair value disclosure would be required under statement of financial accounting standards no 
we hold no investment securities that would require disclosure of market risk 
we have certain receivables denominated in chinese renminbi and certain payables denominated in japanese yen 
to eliminate our exposure to changes in the us dollar exchange rate with chinese renminbi and japanese yen  we may enter into forward contracts to protect future cash flows 
we have designated the forward contracts as cash flow hedges 
accordingly  we account for changes in the fair value of our forward contracts  based on changes in the forward exchange rate  with all changes in fair value reported in other comprehensive income 
amounts in other comprehensive income will be reclassified into earnings upon settlement of the forward contract 
as of december   we had no forward contracts outstanding 
primary market risk exposures our primary market risk exposures are in the areas of interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange rate risk 
we have no credit facility outstanding in the united states 
we generally sell our products and services and negotiate purchase orders with our foreign suppliers in us dollars 
however  we have certain foreign currency exchange exposure as a result of our manufacturing operations in the philippines  malaysia  and china and our sales and distribution facility in the united kingdom 
we have not incurred any material exchange gains or losses to date 
some of the expenses of these foreign operations are denominated in the philippine peso  malaysian ringgit  chinese renminbi  and british pound sterling  respectively 
these expenses include local salaries and wages  utilities  and some operating supplies 
as a result of these sales and expenses  we do have accounts receivable and cash deposits in local currencies 
we believe  however  that the operating expenses currently incurred in foreign currencies other than the chinese renminbi are immaterial  and therefore any associated market risk is unlikely to have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  or financial condition 
although the chinese currency currently is stable  its value in relation to the us dollar is determined by the chinese government 
there is general speculation that china may devalue its currency 
devaluation of the chinese currency could result in translation adjustments to our balance sheet as well as reportable losses depending on our monetary balances and outstanding indebtedness at the time of devaluation 
the government of china historically has made it difficult to convert its local currency into foreign currencies 
although we from time to time may enter into hedging transactions in order to minimize our exposure to currency rate fluctuations  the chinese currency is not freely traded and thus is difficult to hedge 
in addition  the government of china has imposed restrictions on chinese currency loans to foreign operated entities in china 
based on the foregoing  we cannot provide assurance that fluctuations and currency exchange rates in the future will not have an adverse effect on our operations 
we are exposed to risks from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  primarily us dollar japanese yen  us dollar malaysian ringgit and us dollar chinese renminbi 
at december   one us dollar was worth japanese yen 
for the year ended december   the us dollar japanese yen exchange rate fluctuated between and if there were a change in the us dollar japanese yen exchange rate  the foreign currency gain loss would be immaterial 
at december   one us dollar was worth philippine pesos 
for the year ended december   the us dollar philippine pesos exchange rate fluctuated between and if there were a change in the us dollar philippine pesos exchange rate  the foreign currency gain loss would be immaterial 

table of contents both the us dollar malaysian ringgit and us dollar chinese renminbi exchange rates have been pegged by the respective governments  and remained so throughout the year ended december  however  there is the possibility that the respective governments may decide to revalue their exchange rate against the us dollar 
if there were a change in the us dollar malaysian ringgit and us dollar chinese renminbi exchange rates  the foreign currency gain loss would be immaterial
