table of contents critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
these accounting principles require management to make estimates  judgments and assumptions to fairly present results of operations and financial position 
management believes that its estimates  judgments and assumptions are reasonable based upon information available at the time this report was prepared 
to the extent there are material differences between estimates  judgments and assumptions and the actual results  the financial statements will be affected 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is significantly dictated by generally accepted accounting principles and does not require judgment or estimates 
there are also areas in which management s judgments in selecting among available alternatives would not produce a materially different result 
management has reviewed the accounting policies and related disclosures with the audit committee 
the notes to the consolidated financial statements contain a summary of the company s accounting policies 
the accounting policies that management believes are the most important to the financial statements and that require the most difficult  subjective and complex judgments include the following evaluation of the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable hedging activities benefit plans valuation of goodwill a description of each of these follows evaluation of the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable management makes judgments about the company s ability to collect outstanding receivables and provide allowances for the portion of receivables that the company may not be able to collect 
penford estimates the allowance for uncollectible accounts based on historical experience  known troubled accounts  industry trends  economic conditions  how recently payments have been received  and ongoing credit evaluations of its customers 
if the estimates do not reflect the company s future ability to collect outstanding invoices  penford may experience losses in excess of the reserves established 
at august   the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable was  hedging activities penford uses derivative instruments  primarily futures contacts  to reduce exposure to price fluctuations of commodities used in the manufacturing processes in the united states 
penford has elected to designate these activities as hedges 
this election allows the company to defer gains and losses on those derivative instruments until the underlying commodity is used in the production process 
the requirements for the designation of hedges are very complex  and require judgments and analysis to qualify as hedges as defined by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended sfas no 

these judgments and analyses include an assessment that the derivative instruments used are effective hedges of the underlying risks 
if the company were to fail to meet the requirements of sfas no 
 or if these derivative instruments are not designated as hedges  the company would be required to mark these contracts to market at each reporting date 
penford had deferred losses of  at august  and  at august   which are reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in both years 
benefit plans penford has defined benefit plans for its employees providing retirement benefits and coverage for retiree health care 
qualified actuaries determine the estimated cost of these plans annually 
these actuarial estimates are based on assumptions of the discount rate used to calculate the present value of future payments  
table of contents the expected investment return on plan assets  the estimate of future increases in compensation rates and the estimate of increases in the cost of medical care 
the company makes judgments about these assumptions based on historical investment results and experience as well as available historical market data and trends 
however  if these assumptions are wrong  it could materially affect the amounts reported in the financial statements 
disclosure about these estimates and assumptions are included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
see defined benefit plans in this item valuation of goodwill penford is required to assess whether the value of goodwill reported on the balance sheet has been impaired on an annual basis  or more often if conditions exist that indicate that there might be an impairment 
these assessments require extensive and subjective judgments to assess the fair value of goodwill 
while the company engages qualified valuation experts to assist in this process  their work is based on the company s estimates of future operating results and allocation of goodwill to the business units 
if future operating results differ materially from the estimates  the value of goodwill could be adversely impacted

the following table summarizes such contractual commitments after total long term debt obligations operating lease obligations defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans penford maintains defined benefit pension plans and defined benefit postretirement health care plans in the us the most significant assumptions used to determine benefit expense and benefit obligations are the discount rate and the expected return on assets assumption 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for the assumptions used by penford 
the discount rate used by the company in determining benefit expense and benefit obligations reflects the yield of high quality aa or better rating by a recognized rating agency corporate bonds whose cash flows are expected to match the timing and amounts of projected future benefit payments 
benefit obligations and expense increase as the discount rate is reduced 
the discount rates to determine net periodic expense used in  and reflect the decline in bond yields over the past several years 
lowering the discount rate by would increase pension expense by approximately million and other postretirement benefit expense by million 
penford has reduced the discount rate for calculating its benefit obligations at august   as well as net periodic expense for fiscal  to 
the expected long term return on assets assumption for the pension plans represents the average rate of return to be earned on plan assets over the period the benefits included in the benefit obligation are to be paid 
pension expense increases as the expected return on plan assets decreases 
in developing the expected rate of return  the company considers long term historical market rates of return as well as actual returns on the company s plan assets  and adjusts this information to reflect expected capital market trends 
penford also considers forward looking return expectations by asset class  the contribution of active management and management fees paid by the plans 
the plan assets are held in qualified trusts and anticipated rates of return 
table of contents are not reduced for income taxes 
the expected long term return on assets assumption used to calculate net periodic pension expense was reduced by to for fiscal a decrease increase in the expected return on assets assumptions would increase decrease pension expense by approximately million based on plan assets at august  penford has reduced the expected return on plan assets used in calculating fiscal pension expense to 
unrecognized net loss amounts reflect the difference between expected and actual returns on pension plan assets as well as the effects of changes in actuarial assumptions 
unrecognized net losses in excess of certain thresholds are amortized into net periodic pension and postretirement benefit expense over the average remaining service life of active employees 
as of august   unrecognized losses from all sources are million for the pension plans and million for the postretirement health care plan 
amortization of unrecognized net loss amounts is expected to increase net pension expense and net postretirement health care expense by approximately million and million  respectively  in fiscal penford recorded pension expense of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
penford expects pension expense to be approximately million in fiscal the company contributed million and million to the pension plans in fiscal and  respectively

penford expects to recognize approximately million in postretirement health care benefit expense in fiscal the company contributed million in each of fiscal and to the postretirement health care plans and estimates that it will contribute in fiscal future changes in plan asset returns  assumed discount rates and various assumptions related to the participants in the defined benefit plans will impact future benefit expense and liabilities

despite these hedging activities  penford may not be successful in limiting its exposure to market fluctuations in the cost of agricultural raw materials
