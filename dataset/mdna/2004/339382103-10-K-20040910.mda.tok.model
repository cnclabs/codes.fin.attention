item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the following analysis of the results of operations and financial condition of flexsteel industries  inc the company should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this document 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of the company s consolidated financial statements and results of operations are based on consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires the use of estimates and judgments that affect the reported results 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
use of estimates the company uses estimates based on the best information available in recording transactions and balances resulting from business operations 
estimates are used for such items as collectability of trade accounts receivable  inventory valuation  depreciable lives  self insurance programs  restructuring costs  pension benefits  warranty costs  income taxes  and revenue recognition 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts through review of open accounts  and historical collection and allowances amounts 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is intended to reduce trade accounts receivable to the amount that reasonably approximates their fair value due to their short term nature 
the amount ultimately realized from trade accounts receivable may differ from the amount estimated in the consolidated financial statements based on collection experience and actual returns and allowances 
inventories the company values inventory at the lower of cost or market 
raw steel  lumber and wood frame parts are valued on the last in  first out lifo method 
other inventories are valued on the first in  first out fifo method 
changes in the market conditions could require a write down of inventory 
valuation of long lived assets the company periodically reviews the carrying value of long lived assets and estimated depreciable or amortizable lives for continued appropriateness 
this review is based upon projections of anticipated future cash flows and is performed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that asset carrying values may not be recoverable or that the estimated depreciable or amortizable lives may have changed 
these evaluations could result in a change in estimated useful lives in future periods 
self insurance programs the company is self insured for health care and most workers compensation up to predetermined amounts above which third party insurance applies 
the company purchases specific stop loss insurance for individual health care claims in excess of  per plan year  with a million individual lifetime maximum 
for workers compensation the company retains the first  per claim and purchases excess coverage up to the statutory limits for amounts in excess of the retention limit 
the company is contingently liable to insurance carriers under its comprehensive general  product  and vehicle liability policies  as well as some workers compensation 
losses are accrued based upon the company s estimates of the aggregate liability of claims incurred using certain actuarial assumptions followed in the insurance industry and based on company experience 
the actual claims experience could differ from the estimates made by the company 
pension benefits the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements related to pension benefits under the company s defined benefit pension plan are determined based on actuarial assumptions 
a significant assumption used in determining net pension cost is the expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
another significant estimate that affects pension cost is the discount rate used in the annual actuarial valuation of pension benefits 
the discount rate represents the interest rate that is used to determine the present value of future cash flows required to settle the pension obligations 
to the extent the assumed discount rate decreases  the company would have to record additional expense 
warranty the company estimates the amount of warranty claims on sold product that may be incurred based on current and historical data 
the actual warranty expense could differ from the estimates made by the company based on product performance 
revenue recognition is upon delivery of product to our customer 
our ordering process creates persuasive evidence of the sale arrangement and the sales amount is determined 
the delivery of the goods to our customer confirms our reasonable assurance of collectability 
net sales consist of product sales and related delivery charge revenue  net of adjustments for returns and allowances 
the actual amounts for returns and allowances could differ from the estimated amounts 
shipping and handling costs are included in cost of goods sold

outlook the company is finding that the pressures on margins experienced in the second half of fiscal are continuing 
suppliers for steel and petroleum based products  including fuel and poly foam  continue to pass on additional cost increases to the company 
at the same time  many furniture manufacturers  including flexsteel  are dealing with competition and pricing pressures from imported products 
also  preliminary tariffs have been announced on wooden bedroom furniture imported from the people s republic of china 
these tariffs are expected to be finalized by december  and may have a significant impact on margins generated on wooden bedroom furniture and may require realignment of some of the company s suppliers 
as a result of these changes in the marketplace and world economy  the company continues to believe that pursuit and refinement of its blended strategy is fundamentally sound  offering customers fully manufactured goods  products manufactured utilizing imported component parts  and ready to deliver imported products 
the company believes that it best serves customers by offering products from each of these categories to assist customers in reaching specific consumers with varied price points  styles  and product categories 
this blended focus on products allows the company to provide a wide range of options to satisfy customer requirements 
additionally  management believes this strategy offers the company the most financial and operational flexibility with which to respond to ever changing market and regulatory conditions 
the company believes that us consumer confidence has been hampered by several uncertainties in the marketplace  including the upcoming us presidential election  the war in iraq  interest rate changes by the federal reserve board  and record high and unstable oil prices 
the company believes that this situation has caused consumers to postpone purchases of durable goods  including furniture 
the company expects these uncertainties will continue to have a negative impact on its results of operations through at least the end of the second fiscal quarter ending december  in the meantime  the company has initiated several actions in response to these factors  including review and potential adjustment to the company s selling prices and cost control measures for inventories  capital assets  and selling  general  and administrative expenses 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk general market risk represents the risk of changes in the value of a financial instrument  derivative or non derivative  caused by fluctuations in interest rates  foreign exchange rates and equity prices 
as discussed below  management of the company does not believe that changes in these factors could cause material fluctuations in the company s results of operations or cash flows 
the ability to import furniture products can be adversely affected by political issues in the countries where suppliers are located and disruptions associated with shipping distances 
other risks related to furniture product importation include government imposition of regulations and or quotas  duties and taxes on imports  and significant fluctuation in the value of the us dollar against foreign currencies 
any of these factors could interrupt supply  increase costs and decrease earnings 
foreign currency risk during fiscal  and  the company did not have sales  purchases  or other expenses denominated in foreign currencies  nor did it have any active subsidiaries located in foreign countries 
as such  the company is not exposed to market risk associated with currency exchange rates and prices 
interest rate risk the company s primary market risk exposure with regard to financial instruments is changes in interest rates 
at june   a hypothetical basis point increase in short term interest rates would decrease annual pre tax earnings by approximately  assuming no change in the volume or composition of debt 
the company has effectively fixed the interest rates at on approximately million of its long term debt through the use of interest rate swaps  and the above estimated earnings reduction takes these swaps into account 
as of june   the fair value of these swaps is a liability of approximately million and is included in other liabilities 
tariffs the company has exposure to actions by governments  including tariffs 
in june  preliminary tariffs were announced on wooden bedroom furniture produced in the people s republic of china 
tariffs are subject to annual review by the us department of commerce 
tariffs are a possibility on any imported or exported products
