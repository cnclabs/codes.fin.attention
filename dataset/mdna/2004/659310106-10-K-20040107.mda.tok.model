item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general the trust is a passive fixed investment trust which holds overriding royalty rights  receives income under those rights from certain operating companies  pays its expenses and distributes the remaining net funds to its unit owners 
the trust is not involved in any business or extractive operations of any kind in the areas over which it holds royalty rights and is precluded from any such involvement by the trust agreement 
there are no requirements  therefore  for capital resources with which to make capital expenditures or investments in order to continue the receipt of royalty revenues by the trust 
the operating companies  subsidiaries of exxonmobil corp 
and the royal dutch group  pay monthly royalties to the trust based on their sales of natural gas  sulfur and oil 
the oldenburg concession is the primary area from which these products are extracted and provides nearly of all the royalties received by the trust 
of these three products  natural gas provides approximately of the total royalties 
the gas is sold to various distributors under long term contracts which delineate  among other provisions  the timing  manner  volume and price of the gas sold 
the pricing mechanisms contained in these contracts include a delay factor of three to six months and use the price of light heating oil in germany as one of the primary pricing components 
since germany must import a large percentage of its energy requirements  the us dollar price of oil on the international market has a significant  although delayed  impact on the price of gas 
the trust does not conduct any active business operations and has only limited need of funds for its own administrative services 
these funds are used to pay trustees fees computed under the trust agreement and based upon a percentage of royalties and interest income received  the remuneration fixed by the trustees for the managing trustee  the managing director and the audit committee chairman  expenses associated with the trustees meetings  professional fees paid to consultants  legal advisors and auditors  transfer agent fees  and secretarial and other general office expenses 
another requirement for funds by the trust relates to the occasional necessity of making lump sum payments of arrearages of dividends of a corporate predecessor and distributions previously declared by the trust 
the payment of such arrearages would require a reduction in the amount of distributions which otherwise would be made on presently outstanding units 
for further information on this contingent liability and the impact of the delaware court order see note to financial statements in item of this report 
the trust has no means of ensuring continued income from overriding royalty rights at their present level or otherwise 
economic and political factors which are not foreseeable may have an impact on trust income 
the effect of changing economic conditions on the demand for energy throughout the world and future prices of oil and gas cannot be accurately projected 
the relatively small amounts required for administrative expenses of the trust limit the possible effect of inflation on its financial prospects 
continued price inflation would be reflected in sales prices  which with sales volumes form the basis on which the royalties paid to the trust are computed 
in addition  fluctuations in the euro dollar exchange rate have an impact on domestic energy prices within germany and on the amount of dollars received by the trust upon conversion 
the impact of inflation or deflation on energy prices in germany is delayed by the use in certain long term gas sales contracts of a deferred trailing average related to light fuel oil prices 
fiscal versus fiscal for fiscal the trust s gross royalty income increased from  to  the strengthening of world oil prices along with the gradual  albeit minor  improvement in the european economy combined to increase the amount of royalties paid to the trust 
additionally the euro continued its climb through the first three quarters before falling back slightly in the final quarter of fiscal under the higher royalty rate agreement with exxonmobil the average quarterly gas price for the last two fiscal years fell to its low point of euro cents per kilowatt hour ecents kwh during the first quarter of fiscal from that point  the average quarterly price increased on a quarter over quarter basis for the next two quarters before falling back slightly in the final quarter 
for the entire fiscal year the average gas price fell by from ecents kwh for fiscal to ecents kwh for fiscal under the lower royalty rate agreement with beb the average quarterly gas price for the last two fiscal years fell to its low point of ecents kwh during the fourth quarter of fiscal with the exception of the third quarter the average quarterly gas price posted a decline over the gas prices for the prior year s equivalent period 
for the entire fiscal year the average gas price fell by from ecents kwh for fiscal to ecents kwh for fiscal except for a minor drop off during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the value of the euro has increased steadily during the last two years 
using the transfer of royalties from germany to the us to provide an average value for the euro  the value of the euro during fiscal increased from in the first quarter to in the fourth quarter 
during fiscal the value of the euro continued its almost uninterrupted rise posting average values of  and in the first through third quarters before falling back slightly to in the fourth quarter 
when we use the average exchange rates and convert prices measured in ecents kwh into more familiar terms of dollars mcf  we see average yearly gas prices under the higher and lower royalty rate agreements of mcf and mcf  increases of and  respectively for fiscal following the sudden death of the trust s german consultant dr 
wolfgang sohn in march of  the trust began discussions with mr 
alfred stachel  the senior vice president of domestic gas oil exploration and production with rwe dea ag a german energy corporation  about his assuming dr 
sohn s duties 
mr 
stachel s service with rwe dea ag concluded at the end of august and as of october  he assumed the position of the trust s german consultant 
for fiscal the decline in gas production and sales was concentrated in the western half of the oldenburg concession 
in each quarter western gas sales posted a year over year decline 
in total for the year western oldenburg gas sales declined from billion cubic feet bcf in fiscal to bcf in fiscal eastern gas sales increased from bcf in fiscal to bcf in fiscal overall gas sales declined from bcf in fiscal to bcf in fiscal interest income for fiscal was lower due to the historically low interest rates in effect 
trust expenses increased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal the combination of a reduction in trust expenses in fiscal resulting from the reimbursement by the new york stock exchange for expenses associated with the trust s symbol change from net to nrt and higher legal and audit expenses in fiscal that were associated with the additional requirements imposed by the sarbanes oxley act of resulted in the substantial increase in fiscal fiscal versus fiscal for fiscal the trust s gross royalty income decreased from  to  the decline in world oil prices that began in the latter half of fiscal continued into fiscal resulting in a fairly steady decline in gas prices from the high point experienced in the third quarter of fiscal the general economic slowdown in europe contributed to the reduction in royalties paid to the trust by reducing the demand for natural gas thus resulting in lower sales 
after lingering in the range of for the first half of fiscal  the euro staged a rally climbing to an average of over for the second half of fiscal under the higher royalty rate agreement with exxonmobil the average gas price for each quarter of fiscal showed a decline when compared to the prior fiscal year s equivalent quarter 
for fiscal gas sold under this agreement averaged euro cents per kilowatt hour ecents kwh compared to the average sales price of ecents kwh for fiscal  a decline of 
under the lower royalty rate agreement with beb the average gas price for each quarter of fiscal showed a decline when compared to the prior fiscal year s equivalent quarter 
for fiscal gas sold under this agreement averaged ecents kwh compared to the average sales price of ecents kwh for fiscal  a decline of 
when we use the average exchange rates and convert prices measured in ecents kwh into more familiar terms of dollars mcf  we see average gas prices under the higher and lower royalty rate agreements of mcf and mcf  declines of and  respectively 
while the annual maintenance at the grossenkneten desulfurization plant was conducted during a different quarter than the prior fiscal year  the scope and duration of the work was similar 
this fact is significant in that the ratio in the sales of sour gas and sweet gas was similar to the prior fiscal year 
since the majority of gas sold from the higher royalty rate area of western oldenburg is sour gas and must be processed through grossenkneten  any change in the plant s production capacity can have significant consequences to the amount of royalties the trust receives 
in fiscal western gas sales accounted for of overall oldenburg gas sales 
in fiscal western gas sales accounted for of overall oldenburg gas sales 
for fiscal the decline in gas production and sales was fairly evenly divided between the western and eastern halves of the oldenburg concession 
western gas sales declined from billion cubic feet bcf in fiscal to bcf in fiscal overall gas sales declined from bcf in fiscal to bcf in fiscal interest income for was lower for both the fourth quarter and the fiscal year as a whole due to reduced funds available for investment and lower interest rates in effect 
trust expenses declined by from  in fiscal to  in fiscal trust expenses were reduced due to the reimbursement by the new york stock exchange for expenses associated with the trust s symbol change from net to nrt on january  however  the amount of the reduction was substantially offset by additional legal and audit expenses associated with the change in the trust s auditors and additional requirements imposed by the sarbanes oxley act of this report on form k contains forward looking statements concerning business  financial performance and financial condition of the trust 
many of these statements are based on information provided to the trust by the operating companies or by consultants using public information sources 
these statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in any forward looking statements 
these include uncertainties concerning levels of gas production and gas sale prices  general economic conditions and currency exchange rates 
actual results and events may vary significantly from those discussed in the forward looking statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the trust does not engage in any trading activities with respect to possible foreign exchange fluctuations 
the trust does not use any financial instruments to hedge against possible risks related to foreign exchange fluctuations 
the market risk is negligible because standing instructions at its german bank require the bank to process transfers of royalty payments as soon as possible following their receipt
