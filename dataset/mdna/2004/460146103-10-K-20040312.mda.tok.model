forestlands at december   international paper and its subsidiaries controlled about million acres of forestlands in the united states  million acres in brazil   acres in new zealand  and had  through licenses and forest management agreements  harvesting rights on government owned forestlands in canada and russia 
forestlands include owned property as well as certain timber harvesting rights with terms of one or more years  and are stated at cost  less cost of timber harvested coth 
costs attributable to timber are charged against income as trees are cut 
the rate charged is determined annually based on the relationship of incurred costs to estimated current merchantable volume 
effective january   international paper prospectively changed its method of accounting for mid rotation fertilization expenditures to include such expenditures in the capitalized cost of forestlands 
accordingly  these costs have been subsequently included as part of the coth as trees are sold 
prior to this change  these expenditures were capitalized and amortized to expense over a five year period 
the change was made to better match the total costs of fiber to the related income when the trees are sold 
this accounting change had no material effect on earnings for the year ended december   and the effects in future years will not be significant 
due to the cumulative nature of the coth computation  calculation of the cumulative effect of the accounting change on prior periods of including these costs as part of coth  and disclosure of pro forma amounts for prior years  are not determinable

impairment of long lived assets long lived assets are reviewed for impairment upon the occurrence of events or changes in circumstances that indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable  as measured by comparing their net book value to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows generated by their use 
impaired assets are recorded at estimated fair value  determined principally using discounted future cash flows 
income taxes international paper uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes whereby deferred income taxes are recorded for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are revalued to reflect new tax rates in the periods rate changes are enacted

note industry segment information financial information by industry segment and geographic area for  and is presented on pages and note recent accounting developments consolidation of variable interest entities in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
this interpretation changed existing consolidation rules for certain entities  those in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest  or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance the entity s activities without additional subordinated financial support 
the interpretation applied immediately to variable interest entities vie s created after january   and to vie s in which an enterprise obtains an interest after that date 
international paper neither entered into nor obtained an interest in any vie s after january  for vie s created before february   this interpretation was effective for the first reporting period ending after december   although early application of the provisions of this interpretation was allowed 
during december  the fasb issued a revision to fin fin r with varying effective dates 
international paper applied fin r to its variable interest entities as of december  as a result of the application of the provisions of fin r during  four entities that were required to be consolidated under prior accounting rules were deconsolidated  and one previously unconsolidated entity was consolidated  at december  the following paragraphs describe the entities affected by the new fin r consolidation rules and the effects on international paper s december  financial statements a a special purpose leasing entity that was formerly part of an operating lease arrangement between international paper and a third party was determined to be a vie and required to be consolidated by the company 
plants  properties and equipment and long term debt of approximately million that were formerly part of this operating lease arrangement were consolidated and a non cash  after tax charge of million was recorded as the cumulative effect of an accounting change 
b in connection with a forestlands sale in  international paper received notes having a value of approximately million on the date of sale 
during  international paper contributed the notes to an unconsolidated entity in exchange for a preferred interest in that entity valued at approximately million  and accounted for this transfer as a sale of the notes for financial reporting purposes with no associated gain or loss 
also during  the entity acquired approximately million of other international paper debt obligations for cash 
in december  international paper acquired an option to purchase the third party s interest in the unconsolidated entity and modified the terms of the entity s special loss allocation between the third party and international paper 
these actions required the entity to be consolidated by international paper at december   resulting in increases in installment notes receivable included in deferred charges and other assets of million  long term debt of million and minority interest of million 
in the fourth quarter of  international paper determined that it is not the primary beneficiary of the entity under the provisions of fin r and  accordingly  deconsolidated the entity effective december  at december   international paper s million preferred interest in the entity has been offset against million of international paper debt obligations since international paper has  and intends to effect  a legal right to net settle these two amounts 
c in a similar transaction completed in june  approximately million of installment notes received in connection with the sale of forestlands in various states were transferred to a consolidated entity in exchange for a preferred interest in the entity 
in the same period  the entity acquired international paper debt obligations of million for cash 
under the provisions of fin r  international paper is not the primary beneficiary of this entity  resulting in its deconsolidation as of december  the deconsolidation increased investments by million  long term debt by million  and decreased notes receivable by million and minority interest by million 
d in the third quarter of  international paper capital trust and international paper capital trust iii the trusts  were determined to be vie s for which international paper is not the primary beneficiary 
prior to july   the trusts had been consolidated in the company s financial statements  and the preferred securities of the trusts of approximately billion were presented in the consolidated balance sheet as international paper obligated mandatorily redeemable preferred securities of subsidiaries holding international paper debentures 
effective july   the trusts were deconsolidated and the previously consolidated mandatorily redeemable securities were replaced with international paper s obligations to the trusts of approximately billion that were classified as long term debt 
in addition  interest on the international paper debt obligations totaling approximately million was recorded as interest expense in the last half of  replacing preferred dividends on the mandatorily redeemable securities of the trusts that  prior to the deconsolidation  would have been recorded as minority interest expense 
preferred dividends for periods prior to the july  deconsolidation continue to be reported as minority interest expense 
a further discussion of the company s obligations to the trusts is presented in note in december  international paper exercised its option to redeem the securities of one of the trusts effective january   and  consequently  reclassified million to current maturities of debt

financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
it established standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
this standard was effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise was effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  international paper adopted this standard during the third quarter ended september   with no material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
costs associated with exit or disposal activities in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
the statement changed the measurement and timing of recognition for exit costs  including restructuring charges  and was effective for activities initiated after december  it requires that a liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity  such as one time termination benefits  be recognized when the liability is incurred  rather than at the date of a company s commitment to an exit plan 
it had no effect on charges recorded for exit activities begun prior to december  international paper adopted this standard effective january   with no material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
impairment and disposal of long lived assets in october  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
it established a single accounting model for the impairment of long lived assets to be held and used or to be disposed of by sale or abandonment  and broadened the definition of discontinued operations 
international paper adopted sfas no 
in  with no significant change in the accounting for the impairment and disposal of long lived assets 
asset retirement obligations in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
it requires the recording of an asset and a liability equal to the present value of the estimated costs associated with the retirement of long lived assets where a legal or contractual obligation exists 
the asset is required to be depreciated over the life of the related equipment or facility  and the liability accreted each year using a credit adjusted risk free rate 
international paper adopted sfas no 
effective january   recording a discounted liability of million  an increase in property  plant and equipment  net  of million  and a one time cumulative effect of accounting change charge of million net of a deferred tax benefit of million 
the pro forma effects on earnings loss before extraordinary items and cumulative effect of accounting changes  and net earnings  for the years ended december  and  assuming the adoption of sfas no 
as of january   were not material to net earnings or earnings per share 
goodwill in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
it changed the accounting for goodwill by eliminating goodwill amortization beginning in it also requires at least an annual assessment of recorded goodwill for impairment 
the initial test for impairment had to be completed by december   with any impairment charge recorded as the cumulative effect of an accounting change to be retroactively reflected in the first quarter of any subsequent impairment charges are to be recorded in operating results 
the initial test compared the fair value of each of international paper s business reporting units having recorded goodwill balances with the business unit s carrying amount 
fair value was determined using discounted projected future operating cash flows for all business reporting units except chh  where the average quoted market price for chh shares was used 
where the carrying amount exceeded fair value  additional testing was performed for possible goodwill impairment 
the fair value for these business reporting units was then allocated to individual assets and liabilities  using a depreciated replacement cost approach for fixed assets  and appraised values for intangible assets 
any excess of fair value over the allocated amounts was equal to the implied fair value of goodwill 
where this implied goodwill value was less than the goodwill book value of the business reporting unit  an impairment charge was recorded 
based on testing completed in the fourth quarter of  a transitional goodwill impairment loss was recorded for the industrial and consumer packaging  chh and printing papers business segments totaling billion 
this charge had no impact on cash flow 
international paper ceased recording goodwill amortization effective january  this had no effect on cash flow 
the following table shows net earnings loss for the years ended december  and  and pro forma net earnings loss for the year ended december   exclusive of goodwill amortization 
in millions  for the years ended december net earnings loss  add back goodwill amortization adjusted net earnings loss  basic and diluted earnings loss per common share net earnings loss goodwill amortization adjusted net earnings loss derivatives and hedging on january   international paper adopted sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as subsequently amended by sfas nos 
 and the cumulative effect of adopting sfas no 
was a million charge to net earnings before taxes and minority interest million after taxes and minority interest  and a net decrease of million after taxes in oci

international paper entered into an agreement in to guarantee  for a fee  an unsecured contractual credit agreement of an unrelated third party customer 
the guarantee  which expires in  was made in exchange for a ten year contract as the exclusive paper supplier to the customer 
both the loan to the customer and the guarantee are unsecured 
international paper would be required to perform under the guarantee upon default on the loan by the unrelated third party 
the maximum amount of potential future payments is million in principal plus any accrued but unpaid interest 
there is no liability recorded on international paper s books for the guarantee 
in connection with sales of businesses  property  equipment  forestlands  and other assets  international paper commonly makes representations and warranties relating to such businesses or assets  and may enter into standard commercial indemnification arrangements with respect to tax and environmental liabilities and other matters 
where any liabilities for such matters are probable and subject to reasonable estimation  accrued liabilities are recorded at the time of sale as a cost of the transaction 
international paper believes that possible future unrecorded liabilities for these matters  if any  would not have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position or results of operations 
exterior siding and roofing litigation three nationwide class action lawsuits relating to exterior siding and roofing products manufactured by masonite that were filed against international paper have been settled in recent years 
the first suit  entitled judy naef v 
masonite and international paper  was filed in december hardboard lawsuit 
the plaintiffs alleged that hardboard siding manufactured by masonite fails prematurely  allowing moisture intrusion that in turn causes damage to the structure underneath the siding 
the class consisted of all us property owners having masonite hardboard siding installed on and incorporated into buildings between january  and january  the court granted final approval of the settlement on january  the settlement provides for monetary compensation to class members meeting the settlement requirements on a claims made basis  which requires a class member to individually submit proof of damage to  or caused by  masonite product  proof of square footage involved  and proofs of various other matters in order to qualify for payment with respect to a claim 
it also provides for the payment of attorneys fees equaling of the settlement amounts paid to class members  with a non refundable advance of million plus million in costs 
those amounts were paid to class counsel in for siding that was installed between january  and december   claims must be made by january   and for siding installed between january  through january   claims must be made by january  the second suit  entitled cosby  et 
al 
v 
masonite corporation  et 
al  was filed in omniwood lawsuit 
the plaintiffs made allegations with regard to omniwood siding manufactured by masonite which were similar to those alleged in the hardboard lawsuit 
the class consisted of all us property owners having omniwood siding installed on and incorporated into buildings from january  to january  the settlement relating to the omniwood lawsuit provides that qualified claims must be made by january   for omniwood siding that was installed between january  and january  the third suit  entitled smith  et 
al 
v 
masonite corporation  et 
al  was filed in woodruf lawsuit 
the plaintiffs alleged that woodruf roofing manufactured by masonite is defective and causes damage to the structure underneath the roofing 
the class consisted of all us property owners who had incorporated and installed masonite woodruf roofing from january  to january  the settlement relating to the woodruf lawsuit provides that for product installed between january  and december   claims must be made by january   and for product installed between january  and january   claims must be made by january  the court granted final approval of the settlements of the omniwood and woodruf lawsuits on january  the settlements provide for monetary compensation to class members meeting the settlement requirements on a claims made basis  which requires a class member to individually submit proof of damage to  or caused by  masonite product  proof of square footage involved  and proofs of various other matters 
the settlements also provide for payment of attorneys fees equaling of the settlement amounts paid to class members with a non refundable advance of million plus  in costs for each of the two cases 
those amounts were paid in claim filing and determination once a claim is determined to be valid under the respective settlement agreement covering the claim  the amount of the claim is determined by reference to a negotiated compensation formula established under the settlement agreement designed to compensate the homeowner for all damage to the structure 
the compensation formula is based on the average cost per square foot for product replacement  including material and labor as calculated by industry standards  in the area in which the structure is located  adjusted for inflation  or the cost of appropriate refinishing as determined by industry standards in such area  adjusted for inflation 
persons receiving compensation pursuant to this formula also agree to release international paper and masonite from all other property damage claims relating to the product in question 
in connection with the products involved in the lawsuits described above  where there is damage  the process of degradation  once begun  continues until repairs are made 
international paper estimates that approximately four million structures have installed products that are the subject of the hardboard lawsuit   structures have installed products that are subject to the omniwood lawsuit and  structures have installed products that are the subject of the woodruf lawsuit 
masonite stopped selling the products involved in the hardboard lawsuit in may  the products involved in the woodruf lawsuit in may  and the products involved in the omniwood lawsuit in september persons who are class members under the hardboard  omniwood and woodruf lawsuits who do not pursue remedies under the respective settlement agreement pertaining to such suits  may have recourse to warranties  if any  in existence at the expiration of the respective terms established under the settlement agreements for making claims 
the warranty period generally extends for years following the installation of the product in question and  although the warranties vary from product to product  they generally provide for a payment of up to two times the purchase price 
reserve analysis the following table presents an analysis of the net reserve activity related to the hardboard  omniwood and woodruf lawsuits for the years ended december   and hard omni in millions board wood woodruf total balance  december  additional provision payments reimbursement under risk transfer agreement other balance  december  additional provision payments insurance collections balance  december  payments insurance collections balance  december  additional provisions in the third quarter of  a determination was made that an additional provision would be required to cover an expected shortfall in the reserves that had arisen since the third quarter of due to actual claims experience exceeding projections 
an additional million was added to the existing reserve balance at that time 
this increase was based on an independent third party statistical study of future costs  which analyzed trends in the claims experience through august  the amount was based on a statistical outcome that assumed that hardboard claims growth continued through mid  then declined by per year 
omniwood claims growth was assumed to continue through mid  decline by in and thereafter increase at the rate of per year 
woodruf claims were assumed to decline at a rate of per year 
unit costs per claim were assumed to hold at the level 
the statistical model used to develop this outcome also included assumptions on the geographic patterns of claims rates and assumptions related to the cost of claims  including forecasts relating to the rate of inflation 
average claim costs were calculated from historical claims records  taking into consideration structure type  location and source of the claim 
during  tracking of the actual versus projected number of claims filed and average cost per claim indicated that although total claims costs were approximately equal to projected amounts  the number of claims filed was higher than projected  offsetting the effect of lower average claims payment amounts 
accordingly  updated projections were developed by two independent consultants utilizing the most current claims experience data 
principal assumptions used in the development of these projections were that the number of hardboard claims filed  which account for approximately of all claims costs  would average slightly above current levels until january  then would decline by about in and remain flat to the end of the claims period 
average claims costs were assumed to continue to decline at the rate experienced during the last twelve months 
while management believes that the assumptions used in developing these outcomes represent the most probable scenario  factors which could cause actual results to vary from these assumptions include area specific assumptions as to growth in claims rates could be incorrect  locations where previously there had been little or no claims could emerge as significant geographic locations  and the cost per claim could vary materially from that projected 
the first consultant provided two statistical outcomes  with the higher outcome indicating a required provision of approximately million 
the second consultant provided a range of possible outcomes  with the most probable outcome indicating a required provision of approximately million 
the estimate ranged from a low a probability that future charges would exceed this amount of million to a high probability that future charges would exceed this amount of million 
using these projections  management determined that a provision of million should be recorded in the fourth quarter of as an estimate of the most probable outcome based on the consultants projections 
during  claims filed and average costs per claim were in line with projections and no adjustments of reserve balances were required 
reserve balances at december   net reserves for these matters totaled million  including million for the hardboard lawsuit  million for the omniwood lawsuit and million for the woodruf lawsuit 
at december   there were million of costs associated with claims inspected and not paid million for hardboard siding  million for omniwood and million for woodruf and million of costs associated with claims in process and not yet inspected million for claims related to the hardboard lawsuit  million for claims related to the omniwood lawsuit and million for claims related to the woodruf lawsuit 
the reserve at december   was million 
the estimated claims reserve includes million for unasserted claims that are probable of assertion

during the fall of  a trial of masonite s claim that wausau breached its duty to defend the breach of duty lawsuit was conducted in a state court in california 
the jury found that wausau had breached its duty to defend masonite and awarded masonite million for its expense to defend the hardboard lawsuit  an additional million in attorneys fees and interest for masonite s expense to prosecute the breach of duty lawsuit based on a finding that wausau had acted in bad faith in refusing to defend the hardboard lawsuit and an additional million in punitive damages 
in a post trial proceeding  the court awarded an additional million in attorneys fees which masonite had incurred in the trial of the breach of duty lawsuit 
as of july   all post trial motions brought by wausau seeking to upset the jury verdict have been denied  but the court has not yet entered a judgment 
masonite has agreed to pay amounts equal to the proceeds of its bad faith and punitive damage award to international paper and has assigned its breach of contract claim against wausau to international paper 
because of the uncertainties inherent in the breach of duty lawsuit  including the outcome of any appeal that wausau may take  international paper is unable to estimate the amount that may ultimately be recovered in connection with the breach of duty lawsuit 
the trial of the indemnification lawsuit against insurers the defendants began in april to recover million paid to claimants pursuant to the settlement of the hardboard lawsuit through may in july  the jury determined that million of international paper s payments to settle these claims are covered by its insurance policies the phase i verdict 
the next phase of the case will determine how much of the million can be allocated to the policies of the defendants 
the company anticipates that  before a judgment is entered  the california court will also make a determination about indemnification for future claims based on the phase i verdict 
the court will also determine whether amounts paid and to be paid to the plaintiff class counsel pursuant to the settlement of the hardboard lawsuit  and administrative expenses that have been and will be incurred in connection with that settlement  are covered by insurance 
the company is presently engaged in court ordered mediation with several of the defendants 
as noted above  no judgment has yet been entered on the verdicts in either the breach of duty lawsuit or the indemnification lawsuit 
it is difficult to predict when the judgment will be entered 
this judgment will be subject to appeal when entered 
because of the uncertainties inherent in the litigation  including the outcome of any appeal  international paper is unable to estimate the amount that it ultimately may recover against its insurance carriers 
in addition to the foregoing proceedings  the company intends to seek indemnification from other insurance carriers in arbitration proceedings as required by the policies 
as of december   international paper had received an aggregate of million in settlement payments from certain of its insurance carriers which had been named as defendants in the indemnification lawsuit  and received the payment of an additional million in january from one of the settling insurers 
under an alternative risk transfer agreement  international paper contracted with a third party for payment in an amount up to million for certain costs relating to the hardboard lawsuit if payments by international paper with respect thereto exceeded a specified retention that was indexed to account for inflation over a several year period 
the agreement with the third party is in excess of liability insurance recoveries obtained by international paper  which are the subject of the separate litigation referred to above 
accordingly  international paper believes that the obligation of the third party with respect to this agreement does not constitute other valid and collectible insurance that would either eliminate or otherwise affect the company s right to collect insurance coverage available to it and masonite under the insurance policies  which are the subject of this separate litigation 
at december   international paper had received the million from the third party 
a dispute between international paper and the third party  concerning a number of issues  including the relationship of the contract funding obligation to insurance proceeds recovered in the indemnification lawsuit  was the subject of an arbitration commenced in by the third party in london  england and scheduled to begin february  before the hearing started  the parties settled the dispute 
under the settlement  international paper has agreed to pay the third party a portion of insurance proceeds recovered by international paper under its insurance policies  beginning on january  and thereafter  up to a maximum of million 
the precise amount that international paper will pay to the third party under the settlement will depend upon  and will be in proportion to  the amount of insurance recoveries received by international paper in the future 
while international paper believes that the reserve balances established for these matters are adequate  and that additional amounts will be recovered from its insurance carriers in the future relating to these claims  international paper is unable to estimate at this time the amount of additional charges  if any  that may be required for these matters in the future 
antitrust matters on may   and may   two lawsuits were filed in federal court in the eastern district of pennsylvania against international paper  the former union camp corporation acquired by international paper in  and other manufacturers of linerboard the defendants 
these suits allege that the defendants conspired to fix prices for corrugated sheets and containers during the period october   through november  these lawsuits  which seek injunctive relief as well as treble damages and other costs associated with the litigation  were consolidated and  on september   certified as a class action 
on september   international paper  along with weyerhaeuser co

in  purchasers of high pressure laminates filed a number of purported class actions under the federal antitrust laws alleging that international paper s nevamar division which was part of the decorative products division participated in a price fixing conspiracy with competitors between january  and june  these lawsuits seek injunctive relief as well as treble damages and other costs associated with the litigation 
these cases have been consolidated in federal district court in new york 
in and  indirect purchasers of high pressure laminates also filed similar purported class action cases under various state antitrust and consumer protection statutes in arizona  california  florida  maine  michigan  minnesota  new mexico  new york  north carolina  north dakota  south dakota  tennessee  west virginia  wisconsin and the district of columbia 
the case in new york state court and one of the two michigan cases have been dismissed  while all of the other state cases have been stayed 
on june   the federal district court certified the consolidated federal cases as a class action 
thirty one plaintiffs have opted not to participate in the class litigation 
discovery in the federal case regarding liability is complete  and dispositive motions are scheduled for hearing on april  in the third quarter of  international paper completed the sale of the decorative products operations  but retained any liability for these cases 
summary international paper is also involved in various other inquiries  administrative proceedings and litigation relating to contracts  sales of property  environmental protection  tax  antitrust  personal injury and other matters  some of which allege substantial monetary damages 
while any proceeding or litigation has the element of uncertainty  international paper believes that the outcome of any of the other lawsuits or claims that are pending or threatened  or all of them combined  including the preceding antitrust matters  will not have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position or results of operations

international paper continues to maintain a long term credit rating of baa stable and a short term credit rating of p from moody s investor services 
the standard poor s rating actions had no effect on any of the covenants contained in any of international paper s debt obligations 
note derivatives and hedging activities international paper periodically uses derivatives and other financial instruments to hedge exposures to interest rate  commodity and currency risks 
for hedges that meet the criteria under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  international paper  at inception  formally designates and documents the instrument as a hedge of a specific underlying exposure  as well as the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking each hedge transaction 
because of the high degree of effectiveness between the hedging instrument and the underlying exposure being hedged  fluctuations in the value of the derivative instruments are generally offset by changes in the value or cash flows of the underlying exposures being hedged 
derivatives are recorded in the consolidated balance sheet at fair value  determined using available market information or other appropriate valuation methodologies  in other current or noncurrent assets or liabilities 
the earnings impact resulting from the change in fair value of the derivative instruments is recorded in the same line item in the consolidated statement of earnings as the underlying exposure being hedged 
the financial instruments that are used in hedging transactions are assessed both at inception and quarterly thereafter to ensure they are effective in offsetting changes in either the fair value or cash flows of the related underlying exposures 
the ineffective portion of a financial instrument s change in fair value  if any  would be recognized currently in earnings together with the changes in fair value of derivatives not designated as hedges 
interest rate risk interest rate swaps may be used to manage interest rate risks associated with international paper s debt 
some of these instruments qualify for hedge accounting in accordance with sfas no 
and others do not 
interest rate swap agreements with a total notional amount at december   of approximately million and maturities ranging from one to years do not qualify as hedges under sfas no 
and  consequently  were recorded at fair value on the transition date by a pre tax charge of approximately million to earnings 
for the years ended december   and  the change in fair value of the swaps was immaterial 
the remainder of international paper s interest rate swap agreements qualify as fully effective fair value hedges under sfas no 
at december  and  outstanding notional amounts for its interest rate swap fair value hedges amounted to approximately billion and billion  respectively 
the fair values of these swaps were net assets of approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
in november  interest rate swaps with a notional value of million were terminated in connection with the early retirement of international paper s billion notes due in july the resulting gain of approximately million is included in restructuring and other charges in the accompanying consolidated statement of earnings see note 
during  international paper entered into agreements to fix interest rates on an anticipated billion issuance of debt 
upon issuance of the debt in the fourth quarter of  these agreements generated a pre tax loss of million that was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income oci 
this amount is being amortized to interest expense over the term of the bonds through october   yielding an effective interest rate of 
commodity risk to minimize volatility in earnings due to large fluctuations in the price of commodities  international paper currently uses swap and option contracts to manage risks associated with market fluctuations in energy prices 
such cash flow hedges with maturities of months or less are accounted for by deferring the after tax quarterly change in fair value of the outstanding contracts in oci 
on the date a contract matures  the gain or loss is reclassified into cost of products sold concurrently with the recognition of the commodity purchased 
for the years ended december   and  international paper reclassified from oci  after tax gains of million and after tax losses of million and million  respectively 
this amount represents the after tax cash settlements on the maturing energy hedge contracts 
unrealized after tax gains of million and million and after tax losses of million were recorded to oci during the years ended december   and  respectively 
after tax gains of approximately million as of december   are expected to be reclassified into earnings in foreign currency risk international paper s policy has been to hedge certain investments in foreign operations with borrowings denominated in the same currency as the operation s functional currency or by entering into long term cross currency and interest rate swaps  or short term foreign exchange contracts 
these financial instruments are effective as a hedge against fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
gains or losses from changes in the fair value of these instruments  which are offset in whole or in part by translation gains and losses on the foreign operation s net assets hedged  are recorded as translation adjustments in oci 
upon liquidation or sale of the foreign investments  the accumulated gains or losses from the revaluation of the hedging instruments  together with the translation gains and losses on the net assets  are included in earnings 
for the years ended december   and  net losses included in the cumulative translation adjustment on derivative and debt instruments hedging foreign net investments amounted to million  million and million after taxes and minority interest  respectively 
long term cross currency and interest rate swaps and short term currency swaps are used to mitigate the risk associated with changes in foreign exchange rates  which will affect the fair value of debt denominated in a foreign currency 
these hedges existing as of december   totaling a net fair value liability of million have not been designated as hedges pursuant to sfas no 
the impact on earnings from changes in the derivative values is substantially offset by the earnings impact from remeasuring the foreign currency debt each period 
foreign exchange contracts including forward  swap and purchase option contracts are also used to hedge certain transactions  primarily trade receipts and payments denominated in foreign currencies  to manage volatility associated with these transactions and to protect international paper from currency fluctuations between the contract date and ultimate settlement 
these contracts  most of which have been designated as cash flow hedges  had maturities of four years or less as of december  for the years ended december   and  net unrealized gains totaling million  million and million after taxes and minority interest  respectively  were recorded to oci 
gains losses after taxes and minority interest of million  million and million were reclassified to earnings for the years ended december   and  respectively 
as of december   gains of million after taxes and minority interest are expected to be reclassified to earnings in other contracts are used to offset the earnings impact relating to the variability in exchange rates on certain short term monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non functional currencies and are not designated as hedges 
changes in the fair value of these instruments  recognized currently in earnings to offset the remeasurement of the related assets and liabilities  were not significant 
international paper does not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 
the counterparties to swap agreements and foreign exchange contracts consist of a number of major international financial institutions 
international paper continually monitors its positions with and the credit quality of these financial institutions and does not expect nonperformance by the counterparties 
note capital stock the authorized capital stock at both december  and consisted of  shares of common stock  par value   shares of cumulative preferred stock  without par value stated value per share  and  shares of serial preferred stock  par value 
the serial preferred stock is issuable in one or more series by the board of directors without further shareholder action 
note retirement plans international paper maintains pension plans that provide retirement benefits to substantially all employees 
employees generally are eligible to participate in the plans upon completion of one year of service and attainment of age the plans provide defined benefits based on years of credited service and either final average earnings salaried employees  hourly job rates or specified benefit rates hourly and union employees 
us defined benefit plans international paper makes contributions that are sufficient to fully fund its actuarially determined costs  generally equal to the minimum amounts required by the employee retirement income security act erisa 
international paper made no contribution in or and does not expect to make any contribution in to the qualified defined benefit plan 
the nonqualified plan is only funded to the extent of benefits paid which are expected to be million in net periodic pension expense income service cost is the actuarial present value of benefits attributed by the plans benefit formula to services rendered by employees during the year 
interest cost represents the increase in the projected benefit obligation  which is a discounted amount  due to the passage of time 
the expected return on plan assets reflects the computed amount of current year earnings from the investment of plan assets using an estimated long term rate of return

weighted average assumptions used to determine net pension expense income for  and were as follows discount rate expected long term return on plan assets rate of compensation increase weighted average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations as of december  and  were as follows discount rate rate of compensation increase the expected long term rate of return on plan assets is based on projected rates of return for current and planned asset classes in the plan s investment portfolio 
projected rates of return are developed through an asset liability study  in which projected returns for each of the plan s asset classes are determined after analyzing historical experience and future expectations of returns and volatility of the various asset classes 
based on the target asset allocation for each asset class  the overall expected rate of return for the portfolio is developed considering the effects of active portfolio management and expenses paid from plan assets

at the same date  the market value of the plan assets was less than the accumulated benefit obligation abo for this plan 
in accordance with the requirements of sfas no 
 the prepaid asset was reversed and an additional minimum liability of  million was established equal to the shortfall of the market value of plan asset below the abo plus the prepaid benefit cost 
this resulted in an after tax direct charge to accumulated other comprehensive income oci of billion  with no impact on earnings  earnings per share or cash 
this reduction to shareholders equity had no adverse affect on international paper s debt covenants 
at december   a strong actual return on plan assets in the fourth quarter increased the market value of plan assets by more than the increase in the abo  resulting in a reduction  since december   in the required additional minimum pension liability
