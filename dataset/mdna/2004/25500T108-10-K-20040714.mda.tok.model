item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the discussion in this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties  such as statements of our plans  objectives  expectations and intentions 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed here 
see future growth and operating results subject to risk at the end of this item for factors that could cause future results to differ materially 
overview we design  develop and market equipment used in building  expanding and modernizing telecommunications networks 
as a result of announcing our intention to exit our optical communications business and completion of the sale of a substantial portion of assets used in our optical business in the first quarter of fiscal  our continuing operations are currently focused solely on our voice processing products  including our long standing echo cancellation products 
our initial entrance into the voice processing market was focused on echo cancellation 
since entering the voice processing market  we have continued to refine our echo cancellation products to meet the needs of the ever changing telecommunications marketplace 
our more recent product introductions have leveraged off the processing capacity of our newer hardware platforms to offer not only echo cancellation but also new vqa features including noise reduction  acoustic echo cancellation  voice level control and noise compensation through enhanced voice intelligibility 
we are currently selling our seventh generation echo cancellation product  which began production shipments in the third quarter of fiscal since becoming a public company in june  our financial success has been primarily predicated on the success of the domestic wire line and more recently wireless carriers 
during fiscal and the first half of fiscal  we benefited from the rapid expansion in domestic wire line infrastructure spending to support increasing demand expectations due to customer growth and the expectations of increased demand from internet traffic 
in the latter half of fiscal  as the promise of the internet s growth waned we  along with virtually every other telecommunications equipment supplier  experienced a significant decline in revenues due to a dramatic decline in infrastructure spending by domestic carriers 
over the last three years  wire line carriers has experienced a modest recovery in spending while wireless carriers have experienced more rapid growth 
we expect that our near term revenues will continue to be heavily influenced by the buying trends in the domestic wireless market but expect to see increased demand internationally as our newer voice processing platforms  running our vqa software begin to achieve broader market acceptance 
exit of optical business 
in may  we announced a change to our strategic direction 
we decided to focus all of our assets in continuing to grow our voice processing business  including our echo cancellation and new vqa features  and as a result we decided to sell our optical communications business 
in july  we completed the primary step in our planned exit of our optical communications business through the sale of a large portion of the assets of the optical communications business to jds uniphase corporation jdsu 
the assets sold consisted primarily of inventory  certain specified optical related equipment and intellectual property rights  which were sold for an aggregate purchase price of up to approximately million in cash  of which a approximately million was paid to us at closing  b  will be paid to us one year from the closing subject to reduction in the event any successful indemnification claims are made against us  and c up to an additional million to be paid to us  which is comprised of up to  based on the level of inventory consumed by jdsu  and up to million based on revenues generated by the optical business acquired by jdsu through june   if any 
additionally  jdsu has indemnification rights related to any purchased but unused inventory at june   up to million  and certain costs incurred by jdsu in connection with the performance of certain warranty obligations relating to optical products that were sold by us prior to the transaction 
during fiscal  we recognized  associated with the level of revenue generated by jdsu since the close of the sale 
however  these incremental proceeds were substantially offset by increased loss accruals associated with exiting our international optical operations and an estimated loss provision associated with our indemnification of the realizable value of the inventory purchased by jdsu 
the net effect of these items was reported as an incremental net loss on disposition of discontinued operations of million in the consolidated statement of operations 
see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
we have been aggressively pursuing the disposition  through sale  sublease or abandonment  of the optical assets not sold to jdsu and the facility leases for our australian and united kingdom optical research facilities 
as of april   we had exited both the united kingdom facility and australian facility leases 
additionally  we had sold all of the optical assets at our two international optical research operations 
we are still in the process of disposing of a minor amount of remaining optical assets located in the united states 
as a result of exiting the optical business  our consolidated statements of operations reflect the optical business as a discontinued operation for all periods presented 
see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
acquisition history 
since completing our initial public offering in june  we have completed three acquisitions 
at the time we made each of these acquisitions  they were made to bring needed technical skills into our research and development groups to aid in new product introductions 
the most recent  significant acquisition was in july  when we acquired atmosphere networks  inc to bring needed technical skills to our optical engineering group 
the total value of the acquisition was approximately million  which was accounted for using purchase accounting 
in may  we recorded a transitional impairment of the unamortized goodwill balance associated with this acquisition of million  which has been reported as a cumulative effect of accounting change 
our customer base 
historically the majority of our sales have been to customers in the united states 
these customers accounted for approximately  and of our revenue in fiscal  and  respectively 
however  sales to some of our customers in the us may result in our products purchased by these customers eventually being deployed internationally  especially in the case of any original equipment manufacturer that distributes overseas 
to date  the vast majority of our international sales have been export sales and denominated in us dollars 
we expect that as we expand shipments of our newer voice processing products  which are targeted at gsm networks  international revenue will begin to become a larger percentage of our overall revenue 
our revenue historically has come from a small number of customers 
our five largest customers accounted for approximately  and of our revenue in fiscal  and  respectively 
consequently  the loss of any one of these customers  without an offsetting increase in revenue from existing or new customers  would have a negative and substantial effect in our business 
critical accounting policies and estimates 
the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make certain estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses and related disclosures 
we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis  including those related to our revenues  allowance for bad debts  provisions for inventories  warranties and recovery of deferred income taxes receivable 
estimates are based on our historical experience and other assumptions that we consider reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual future results may differ from these estimates in the event that facts and circumstances vary from our expectations 
to the extent there are material differences between our ongoing estimates and the ultimate actual results  our future results of operations will be affected as adjustments to our estimates are required 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition in applying our revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts policies that are outlined in note of notes to the consolidated financial statements  the level of judgment is generally relatively limited  as the vast majority of our revenue has been generated by a handful of relatively long standing customer relationships 
these customers are some of the largest wire line and wireless carriers in the united states and our relationships with them are documented in contracts  which clearly highlight potential revenue recognition issues  such as passage of title and risk of loss 
as of april   we had deferred million of revenue 
to the extent that we have received cash for some or all of a given deferred revenue transaction  it is reported on the consolidated balance sheet as a deferred revenue liability 
however  to the extent that cash has not been collected against the deferred revenue transaction  the deferred revenue is reflected as a reduction in the corresponding account receivable balance 
of the million of revenue deferred as of april   approximately was associated with deferrals from our largest customers due to contractual terms 
in dealing with the remaining smaller customers  we closely evaluate the credit risk of these customers 
in those cases where credit risk is deemed to be high  we either mitigate the risk by having the customer post a letter of credit  which we can draw against on a specified date to effectively provide reasonable assurance of collection  or we defer the revenue until customer payment is received 
at april   the total amount of revenue deferred due to our assessment that collection was not reasonably assured as of shipment was approximately  inventory valuation allowances in conjunction with our ongoing analysis of inventory valuation allowances  we are constantly monitoring projected demand on a product by product basis 
based on these projections we evaluate the levels of allowances required both for inventory on hand  as well as inventory on order from our contract manufacturers 
although we believe we have been reasonably successful in identifying allowance requirements in a timely manner  sudden changes in future buying patterns from our customers  either due to a shift in product interest and or a complete pull back from their expected order levels has resulted in some larger than anticipated write downs being recognized  such as the oc write down recorded in fiscal in the case of the oc write down  the complete pull back from the forecasted demand by the primary customer for this product resulted in a million write down of the oc inventory 
however  in the addition of a few new major customers helped to utilize a large portion of the inventory  which had been written down resulting in approximately million and  of previously written down inventory being sold in fiscal and  respectively 
cost of warranty at the time that revenue is recognized  we accrue for the estimated costs of the warranty we offer on our products 
we currently offer warranties on our products ranging from two to five years 
the warranty generally provides that we will repair or replace any defective product within the term of the warranty 
our accrual for the estimated warranty is based on our historical experience and expectations of future conditions 
to the extent we experience increased warranty claim activity or increased costs associated with servicing those claims  we may revise our estimated warranty accrual to reflect these additional exposures  which would result in a decrease in gross profits 
as of april  we had recorded million of accruals related to estimated future warranty costs 
in general  we have been able to closely estimate the level of warranty exposure on our products  and the level of adjustment required to the reserve has been relatively insignificant 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain items from our consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of revenue for the periods indicated years ended april  revenue cost of goods sold gross profit operating expenses sales and marketing research and development general and administrative restructuring charge amortization of goodwill and other acquisition related intangible assets total operating expenses income loss from continuing operations other income  net income loss from continuing operations before provision for income taxes and cumulative effect of accounting change provision for income taxes income loss from continuing operations before cumulative effect of accounting change discontinued operations loss from discontinued operations loss on disposition  net of tax benefit for the year ended april loss from discontinued operations cumulative effect of accounting change net income loss discussion of fiscal years ended april   and revenue 
years ended april  revenue    the primary reason for the increasing trend in revenue has been the gradual recovery of our echo cancellation product sales since fiscal  which marked our lowest level of sales since becoming a public company 
this increase in revenue was largely driven by the addition of several new customers over the past two years and increased sales volumes to existing customers in the wireless carrier space and to a lesser extent the expansion of our international customer base  primarily in the asia pacific and europe markets 
revenue in fiscal was largely driven by sales of our bbec and oc system based products  as well as the initial sales of our new bvp system 
we believe that the introduction of new products during this period of time was a key contributor to acquiring and retaining our key strategic customers  as these new products have provided for ever increasing flexibility for our customers and ease of installation 
our latest product  the bvp flex system  accounted for of our revenue in fiscal despite the fact that it did not begin production shipment until late in the third quarter of fiscal fiscal also saw the first revenue from our new qvp voice product  which includes our new voice quality features and is primarily targeted to the international gsm market 
the predecessor to the bvp flex  our bvp system  was the single largest source of revenue for both fiscal and  representing and of revenue  respectively  and our older fourth generation products  the quad and bbec system were the primary source of revenue in fiscal with the introduction of our bvp flex system  sales of the bvp system declined dramatically in the fourth quarter of fiscal and are expected to represent a small percentage of future revenue as customers have quickly migrated to our bvp flex system 
we expect that bvp flex system will remain the primary source of revenue for the majority of the coming fiscal year 
geographically  revenue over the three fiscal years has been generated largely from domestic sales  which represented  and of our fiscal  and revenue  respectively 
the slight increase in the percentage of domestic sales over the three years was largely due to the growth in sales of our echo cancellation products to the domestic wireless telecommunications providers outpacing the growth in our international customer base 
although we have experienced several consecutive quarters of revenue growth  we believe that carrier spending levels have not fully recovered from the decline experienced in the latter half of fiscal we believe that our growth for the coming year will continue to be driven by a combination of the addition of new domestic and international customers  the continued gradual recovery of the telecommunications market as a whole and the successful customer migration to our new bvp flex and qvp products  including our new vqa features 
cost of goods sold 
years ended april  cost of goods sold    cost of goods sold consists of direct material costs  personnel costs for test and quality assurance  costs of licensed technology incorporated into our products  provisions for inventory and warranty expenses and other indirect costs 
the increase in cost of goods sold in fiscal as compared to fiscal and was in large part driven by increased unit sales of our echo cancellation products  which contributed to a million increase over fiscal and an million increase over fiscal the other major factors impacting the increase in costs in has been the write off of million of materials that were deemed too expensive or impractical to refurbish and an increase of approximately million in the level of installation costs due to increased shipments and an increase in the level of installation support requested by our customers 
our inventory provisions were million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
we would expect that the trend in cost of goods sold will continue to track fairly closely with the trend in sales and that we will continue to see increased installation activity as we expand internationally 
however  we do not expect to experience the same level of product write offs in the coming year 
gross margin 
years ended april  gross profit    gross margin the primary cause for the increase in our stand alone echo cancellation gross margin was the impact of the oc write down in fiscal as compared to fiscal and in fiscal  we recorded a million special provision  including losses on purchase commitments  for potentially excess oc inventory when our largest customer for the product at that time canceled all planned purchases 
due to the addition of several new oc customers in fiscal  we have been able to sell through the unreserved levels of inventory of this product and have begun selling previously written down product  which has resulted in a benefit of over  in fiscal and million in fiscal the impact of the oc reserve in fiscal and the benefit in fiscal and accounts for approximately of the percentage point increase in voice processing margins in fiscal and of the percentage point increase in echo cancellation margins during fiscal there were no special inventory provisions in fiscal or the other key factor in the improvement in gross margin is the effect of our relatively fixed manufacturing overhead costs 
as these costs have been relatively fixed over the three years while revenue has been steadily improving  we have seen an improvement in our overall gross margin 
although we expect to continue to see improvement in margins due to the fixed nature of our manufacturing costs  we would expect that the benefits from the sale of previously written down products will not be as significant in the future 
as a result barring any unusual events  we would expect that margins will continue to approximate the levels for most of fiscal sales and marketing 
years ended april  sales and marketing    sales and marketing expenses primarily consist of personnel costs  including commissions and costs associated with customer service  travel  trade shows and outside consulting services 
overall  sales and marketing has remained relatively stable over the last three years with fiscal showing a modest decline from the and levels 
approximately million of the decline from fiscal was driven by declines in salary and related spending  including travel and conferences  as a result of the reductions in workforce that occurred in january and september and tighter control of discretionary spending 
however  sales and marketing expenses have begun to trend back up during fiscal as we have expanded our efforts to introduce our newer products internationally 
we expect that sales and marketing expenses will increase in fiscal due to continued international expansion efforts and new product introduction costs 
research and development 
years ended april  research and development    research and development expenses primarily consist of personnel costs  and costs associated with contract consultants  equipment and supplies used in the development of voice processing products  as well as amortization of deferred stock compensation associated with the telinnovation acquisition  which ended in the fourth quarter of fiscal upon the sale of our echo software technology to ti 
the decline in fiscal and from the level of spending is almost entirely due to the cessation of amortization of deferred stock compensation subsequent to the sale of our echo software technology to ti in april in fiscal  this amortization amounted to million  for which there was no corresponding expense in fiscal and research and development expenses other than amortization of deferred stock compensation associated with the telinnovation acquisition increased as a result of spending to bring new voice processing products to market during the past two years 
the largest increase was tied to increased headcount and related costs  as our engineering staff grew from employees in fiscal to and employees in fiscal and  respectively 
in addition  we had increases in depreciation over fiscal levels of approximately  and  in and  respectively  due to increased levels of lab equipment to support voice processing product development 
we expect to continue to experience increases in our research and development spending due to the planned development of new packet based voice processing products in fiscal general and administrative 
years ended april  general and administrative    general and administrative expenses primarily consist of personnel costs for corporate officers  finance and human resources personnel  as well as insurance  legal  accounting and consulting costs 
overall  general and administrative expense has remained relatively constant over the last three years and virtually flat between fiscal and the somewhat lower level of spending in fiscal and as compared to is due to reductions in professional services spending in fiscal and due in large part to reduced tax compliance and planning spending  a reduction in bad debt expense from fiscal levels as several customers filed for bankruptcy in fiscal  reduced printing and graphics costs associated with simplifying our annual financial report  and reduced levels of charitable contributions and temporary labor spending as we attempted to control costs 
these factors resulted in an aggregate savings from the fiscal levels of approximately  and  in fiscal and  respectively 
in addition  we experienced a reduction in amortization of deferred stock compensation related to stock options issued prior to our initial public offering 
see the discussion in under stock compensation below for further details 
the savings in fiscal as compared to were partially offset by increased allocations of facilities costs due to costs being spread over a smaller employee base which resulted in an increase of  in general and administrative expenses over fiscal levels 
we expect general and administrative expenses to increase in fiscal as we continue to expend greater resources to comply with sarbanes oxley requirements that will become applicable for us and as we experience increased insurance costs due to higher business volumes and headcount 
amortization of goodwill and other acquisition related intangible assets 
amortization expense was eliminated in its entirety beginning in fiscal  resulting in a decline of million from fiscal the elimination was due to the sale of our echo cancellation software technology in april  which resulted in the elimination of amortization related to the goodwill and intangibles from our acquisition of telinnovation restructuring charge 
the restructuring charge recognized in fiscal was attributable to the elimination of redundant general corporate level costs  personnel and facilities  that were impacted as a result of exiting the optical business  but did not qualify for inclusion in discontinued operations 
these costs included  of severance and related benefits for impacted employees and an original loss provision of  associated with the abandonment of approximately  square feet of space in our mountain view headquarters 
in march  the then unused portion of the loss provision for the building of  was reversed back through the restructuring charge line 
the reversal was predicated on the significant changes that had occurred in our business since the first quarter of fiscal when the original decision was made to abandon the space 
at the time of the original provision  we were projecting what we viewed as good revenue growth during fiscal  based on our client base and the overall state of the telecommunications industry 
however with fiscal revenue growth reaching almost growth over fiscal  almost five times our plan at the beginning of the year  and an expectation that we will see modest growth again in fiscal  coupled with incremental hiring requirements to begin development of our next generation voice products  the headcount and therefore space demands far exceeded our expectations 
as a result  the fiscal year reflects a net loss provision of  related to our building and employee severance costs 
as of april  we had paid all severance and related costs 
other income  net 
years ended april  other income  net    other income  net consists of interest income on our invested cash and cash equivalent and investment balances  offset by a nominal amount of interest and other expense 
the decreasing trend in other income  net was primarily attributable to lower interest rates reducing earnings on our invested balances  and to a lesser extent  a decline in the average invested cash balance primarily during fiscal and the first half of fiscal the other key factor in the decline in other income  net was the lack of a gain on disposal of assets  as experienced in fiscal when we sold our echo cancellation software technology and related assets to ti for a gain of over  we would expect to see an increase in other income  net  in part as we benefit from a full year of earnings being generated by our new investment strategy  which we expect will yield higher average interest rates 
in addition  we believe that absent a further deterioration in overall interest rates  the increase in the average invested balance will contribute to increased interest income levels in fiscal income taxes 
income taxes consist of federal  state and foreign income taxes 
the effective tax rate for fiscal was a provision of  as compared to and in fiscal and  respectively 
the income taxes incurred in fiscal are due to providing alternative minimum taxes on our domestic operations 
the tax provision in fiscal was primarily related to taxes on our international optical operations 
the tax provision in fiscal was primarily related to providing a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets as a result of our growing losses at that time 
assuming that our level of profitability continues at the rates experienced over the last couple of quarters of fiscal  it is feasible that the valuation allowance on our deferred tax asset could be partially or completely reversed by the end of fiscal until that time  we expect to continue to report minimal income taxes related to our international operations and domestic alternative minimum taxes 
loss from discontinued operations 
years ended april  loss from discontinued operations    loss on disposition  the decreasing trend in the loss from operations of our discontinued optical business was due in large part to reductions in spending realized subsequent to september  when we discontinued our titanium optical system product development 
as a result  there was a significant decline in spending on salaries and materials 
in addition  fiscal also benefited from reduced spending on optical subsystems marketing and development after our announcement to exit the optical business in may and the elimination of substantially all optical costs effective the end of july as all operations related to our optical business have ceased  we do not expect to have any further losses from this discontinued operation 
the loss on disposition in fiscal reflects the aggregate loss of million realized in the first quarter of fiscal upon the sale of the optical technology  inventory and certain fixed assets to jdsu  along with other exit costs associated with abandoning that portion of the optical business not acquired by jdsu 
subsequent adjustments have been made to the recognized loss to reflect incremental sales proceeds associated with the level of revenue generated by jdsu since the close of the sale and estimated tax benefits associated with the year to date loss from disposal  which benefit offset the domestic tax provision recognized from continuing operations  less incremental loss accruals associated with closure of our international optical operations and likely indemnification obligations pursuant to the sales agreement with jdsu 
the net effect of these items resulted in an incremental loss of approximately  and was included in the total loss from disposal of our discontinued optical operations of million for fiscal in the consolidated statement of operations 
we expect that there will be some additional proceeds from the sale of our optical business to jdsu associated with the level of revenue that they generate in the coming fiscal year and there could be some additional costs associated with closing down the international legal entities that were shut down as a result of exiting the optical business 
however  we do not expect that the net effect of these items will be material to our financial condition or results of operations in the coming year 
cumulative effect of accounting change 
the million cumulative effect of an accounting change reported in fiscal represents the transitional impairment loss for previously recorded goodwill associated with our acquisition of atmosphere  which we recorded in connection with our adoption of sfas effective may  there were no accounting changes in fiscal or stock based compensation we recorded deferred compensation of million as of april   as a result of stock options granted in fiscal we amortized the deferred compensation over the corresponding vesting period of the stock options 
as of the third quarter of fiscal  this component of deferred stock compensation had been fully amortized  resulting in no amortization expense during fiscal we amortized approximately  and  of the deferred compensation to general and administrative expense in fiscal and  respectively 
associated with the acquisition of telinnovation in february  we recorded million of deferred compensation related to  restricted shares granted to the telinnovation employees 
these restricted shares were tied to the employees continuing employment with ditech 
the deferred compensation was being amortized as research and development expense over the three year vesting period of the restricted shares 
as part of the disposition of our echo software technology to ti  ti became the custodian of these restricted shares and will release them to the telinnovation employees  who now work for ti  as they are earned 
should a former telinnovation employee leave their employment prior to earning their restricted shares  the shares would be forfeited to ti 
since all former telinnovation employees have left our employment and are now working for ti  the net deferred stock compensation of million remaining on april  was recognized immediately as part of the sale transaction 
therefore  there was no amortization related to deferred stock compensation associated with our acquisition of telinnovation in fiscal and  nor will there be any in the future 
we amortized approximately million of telinnovation related deferred compensation in fiscal associated with the acquisition of atmosphere on july   we recorded million of deferred compensation related to unvested options assumed in the acquisition 
this deferred compensation was amortized to research and development expense over the remaining vesting terms of the assumed options  which became fully vested in the first quarter of fiscal in connection with the acquisition of atmosphere  we issued nonqualified stock options for approximately  shares of our common stock at a price equal to a discount from the market value of the stock on its grant date of august  the discount was recorded as deferred compensation of million in august subsequent to recording this deferred compensation in august  the gross amount of deferred compensation was reduced from time to time for the impact of option cancellations due to employee terminations 
due to the cancellation of all remaining options  from this august grant  as part of our option exchange program as described below  the remaining deferred compensation of million was recognized in the fourth quarter of fiscal and no further amortization of this deferred compensation occurred in fiscal as this deferred compensation was solely attributable to optical operations  the amortization expense has been included in the loss from discontinued operations for all years presented 
the atmosphere related deferred compensation expense totaled approximately million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
in february  we commenced a voluntary stock option exchange program for our employees  including officers 
we implemented this program in order to align employee and stockholder interests while sustaining high levels of performance during the current stagnant economic period 
a large number of our employees stock option exercise prices were significantly higher than the current market price of ditech common stock and  in an effort to motivate and retain our employees  our board approved this stock option exchange program 
under this program  eligible employees were offered the opportunity to exchange certain outstanding stock options with exercise prices of or more for new replacement options pursuant to the terms of the program 
the original options exchanged were canceled on march  on september   we issued options to purchase a total of  shares of common stock  representing of the number of shares originally subject to options exchanged for those individuals still employed by us on september  see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
recent accounting pronouncements in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity sfas 
sfas establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  adoption of sfas did not have any effect on our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
in december  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition sab  which supercedes sab  revenue recognition in financial statements 
the primary purpose of sab is to rescind accounting guidance contained in sab related to multiple element revenue arrangements  which was superceded as a result of the issuance of eitf  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
while the wording of sab has changed to reflect the issuance of eitf  the revenue recognition principles of sab remain largely unchanged by the issuance of sab the adoption of sab did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources since march  we have satisfied the majority of our liquidity requirements through cash flow generated from operations  funds received upon exercise of stock options and the proceeds from our initial and follow on public offerings in fiscal cash flows from operating activities years ended april  cash flow from operating activities    the improvement in our cash flow from operations reflects the overall improvement in our operating results due in large part to increased product shipments 
in addition  our exiting the optical communications business in the first quarter of fiscal also favorably impacted our operating results in fiscal by dramatically reducing the level of spending we had previously invested in this product line 
the combination of these two factors  while controlling growth in our voice quality related operating expenses  has contributed to our return to profitability and positive cash flows from operating activities in fiscal during this same period of time  we have also experienced positive cash flow benefits from changes in the mix of our current assets and liabilities in large part due to favorable revenue linearity and spending control  which helped to reduce the level of accounts receivable while maintaining a consistent level of current liabilities 
although we expect to see positive cash flows from operations in the coming year  they may not be in the same ratio to earnings  largely due to expected increases in accounts receivable as we enter new customer markets internationally  which may prolong payment terms somewhat  and as we introduce new products  which may increase inventory levels 
cash flows from investing activities years ended april  cash flow from investing activities   the change in the trend of cash flows from investing activities is due to two key events 
first  in fiscal  we changed our investing strategy to include short term and long term investments designed to improve our overall return on invested funds  which accounted for the vast majority of the cash used in fiscal partially offsetting this use of cash in fiscal and contributing to the positive cash flows from investing activities in fiscal and was the collection of proceeds from the sale of our echo cancellation software technology in fiscal and collection of the related purchase price installments in fiscal and of million and million  respectively  and to a lesser degree the collection of sales proceeds from the sale of our optical business in fiscal of million 
we expect that investing activities will continue to use cash in the coming year as we continue to utilize longer term investments to help improve the yield on invested cash  although the level of activity is not likely to mirror that experienced in fiscal when we first implemented the investment strategy 
we also plan to continue to invest in capital assets related to new product introductions 
in addition  the level of offset from the proceeds from sale of our echo software technology and our optical business should not be as large in fiscal  as we have now collected the full purchase price related to the sale of our echo software technology to ti and have only modest levels of cash expected to be received from the sale of our optical business to jdsu 
cash flows from financing activities years ended april  cash flow from financing activities   the increase in trend of cash flow from financing activities in fiscal as compared to the prior two fiscal years is primarily due to funds received upon stock option exercises 
the stock option activity in fiscal was largely due to option exercises by employees impacted by the restructuring of our optical business prior to the cancellation of those options  as well as options exercised by existing employees 
although we expect to continue to have positive cash flows from financing activities due to employee stock plan activity  the level of cash flow will vary depending on market conditions 
we further believe that it is unlikely that the cash flows will continue at the pace experienced in fiscal  as the vast majority of cash in flows from former optical employees has been received 
as of april   we had cash and cash equivalents of million as compared to million at april  additionally  we had million of short term investments and million of long term investments as of april   compared to no short term or long term investments as of april  we have no material commitments other than obligations under operating leases  particularly our facility leases and normal purchases of inventory  capital equipment and operating expenses  such as materials for research and development and consulting 
we currently occupy approximately  square feet of space in the two buildings that form our mountain view  california headquarters 
this facility lease expires in june our contractual commitments  by year in which they become due  are as follows payments due by period contractual obligations in thousands total less than year to years to years over years operating leases    purchase commitments   total    in addition  as part of the optical sale agreement with jdsu  jdsu has the right to require us to indemnify jdsu for any purchased but unused inventory at june   up to million  and certain costs incurred by jdsu in connection with the performance of certain warranty obligations relating to optical products that we sold prior to july  as of april   we have recorded an estimated loss provision of  associated with our indemnification of the purchased but unused inventory  which loss provision was included in the loss on disposition of our discontinued operations 
we believe that we will be able to satisfy our cash requirements for at least the next twelve months from our existing cash and short term investments  and receipt of the balance of the sale proceeds from the sale of our optical business  as described above 
at this time  we are unsure whether we will renew our million line of credit  which expires in july  as we currently see no immediate need for the facility 
the ability to fund our operations beyond the next twelve months will be dependent on the overall demand of telecommunications providers for new capital equipment 
should our customers capital spending patterns deteriorate from their current levels  we could need to find additional sources of cash during fiscal or be forced to reduce our spending levels to protect our cash reserves 
future growth and operating results subject to risk our business and the value of our stock are subject to a number of risks  which are set out below 
if any of these risks actually occur  our business  financial condition or operating results could be materially adversely affected  which would likely have a corresponding impact on the value of our common stock 
these risk factors should be carefully reviewed 
we depend on a limited number of customers for our products  the loss of any one of which could cause our revenue to decrease 
our revenue historically has come from a small number of customers 
our five largest customers accounted for approximately  and of our revenue in fiscal  and  respectively 
one of these customers accounted for of our revenues in fiscal a customer may stop buying our products or significantly reduce its orders for our products for a number of reasons  including the acquisition of a customer by another company or a delay in a scheduled product introduction 
if this happens  our revenue could be greatly reduced  which would materially and adversely affect our business 
this occurred in fiscal when qwest  then our largest customer  substantially discontinued purchasing our product due to the down turn in the telecommunications industry 
due to continuing difficult economic conditions  many operators in the telecommunications industry have experienced financial difficulties  which have dramatically reduced their capital expenditures and  in some cases  resulted in their filing for bankruptcy or being acquired by other operators 
we expect this trend to continue  which may result in our dependence on an even smaller customer base 
we are reliant solely on our voice quality business to generate revenue growth and profitability  which could limit our rate of future revenue growth 
we expect that  at least through fiscal  our sole business will be the design  development and marketing of voice processing products 
however  the relatively small size of the overall echo cancellation portion of the voice market  which is where we have derived the majority of our revenues to date  could limit the rate of growth of our business 
our operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past  and we anticipate that they may continue to do so in the future  which could adversely affect our stock price 
our quarterly operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past and may fluctuate in the future as a result of several factors  some of which are outside of our control 
if revenue declines in a quarter  as we experienced in the second half of fiscal and again in the second quarter of fiscal  our operating results will be adversely affected because many of our expenses are relatively fixed 
in particular  sales and marketing  research and development and general and administrative expenses do not change significantly with variations in revenue in a quarter 
adverse changes in our operating results could adversely affect our stock price 
our revenue may vary from period to period 
factors that could cause our revenue to fluctuate from period to period include changes in capital spending in the telecommunications industry and larger macroeconomic trends  the timing or cancellation of orders from  or shipments to  existing and new customers  delays outside of our control in obtaining necessary components from our suppliers  delays outside of our control in the installation of products for our customers  the timing of new product and service introductions by us  our customers  our partners or our competitors  delays in timing of revenue recognition  due to new contractual terms with customers  competitive pricing pressures  variations in the mix of products offered by us  and variations in our sales or distribution channels 
in particular  sales of our echo cancellation products typically come from our major customers ordering large quantities when they deploy a switching center 
consequently  we may get one or more large orders in one quarter from a customer and then no orders in the next quarter 
as a result  our revenue may vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
our customers may delay or rescind orders for our existing products in anticipation of the release of our or our competitors new products 
further  if our or our competitors new products substantially replace the functionality of our existing products  our existing products may become obsolete  which could result in inventory write downs  and or we could be forced to sell them at reduced prices or even at a loss 
in addition  the sales cycle for our products is typically lengthy 
before ordering our products  our customers perform significant technical evaluations  which typically last up to days or more 
once an order is placed  delivery times can vary depending on the product ordered 
as a result  revenue forecasted for a specific customer for a particular quarter may not occur in that quarter 
because of the potential large size of our customers orders  this would adversely affect our revenue for the quarter 
our expenses may vary from period to period 
many of our expenses do not vary with our revenue 
factors that could cause our expenses to fluctuate from period to period include the extent of marketing and sales efforts necessary to promote and sell our products  the timing and extent of our research and development efforts  the availability and cost of key components for our products  and the timing of personnel hiring 
if we incur such additional expenses in a quarter in which we do not experience increased revenue  our operating results would be adversely affected 
if we do not successfully develop and introduce new products  our products may become obsolete 
we operate in an industry that experiences rapid technological change  and if we do not successfully develop and introduce new products and our existing products become obsolete due to product introductions by competitors  our revenues will decline 
even if we are successful in developing new products  we may not be able to successfully produce or market our new products in commercial quantities  or increase our overall sales levels 
these risks are of particular concern when a new generation product is introduced 
although we believe we will achieve our product introduction dates  there is no guarantee that they will not be delayed 
the current product introductions  which are of greatest significance  are our new voice quality features  which are being offered on our new bvp flex and qvp voice processing hardware platforms 
we are currently experiencing numerous customer evaluations of these features around the world and realized our first modest levels of revenue from these new products in the fourth quarter of fiscal  and we expect more significant levels of revenue from these new features beginning in fiscal however  should the customer evaluation process become protracted or the product not meet the customers expectations  the timing of our realization of any revenues from these new products could be delayed or not materialize at all 
we have in the past experienced  and in the future may experience  unforeseen delays in the development of our new products 
for example  in fiscal  sales of our fourth generation echo cancellers and our broadband system generated the majority of our echo revenue while sales of our fifth generation  oc echo cancellation system fell short of our expectations due to a sudden decline in projected demand in the third quarter of fiscal from our primary targeted customer for this product  qwest 
this unexpected drop in demand for the oc product led to the write down of million of excess inventory in the third quarter of fiscal although we were eventually able to sell this product after having written it down  there can be no assurances that we will be able to sell additional written down units in the future 
we must devote a substantial amount of resources in order to develop and achieve commercial acceptance of our new products  most recently  our bvp flex and qvp hardware platforms and our voice quality features 
our new and or existing products may not be able to address evolving demands in the telecommunications market in a timely or effective way 
even if they do  customers in these markets may purchase or otherwise implement competing products 
we anticipate that average selling prices for our products will decline in the future  which could adversely affect our ability to be profitable 
we expect that the price we can charge our customers for our products will decline as new technologies become available  as we expand the distribution of products through oems  value added resellers and distributors internationally and as competitors lower prices either as a result of reduced manufacturing costs or a strategy of cutting margins to achieve or maintain market share 
if this occurs  our operating results will be adversely affected 
we expect price reductions to be more pronounced  at least in the near term  due to our planned expansion internationally 
while we intend to reduce our manufacturing costs in an attempt to maintain our margins and to introduce enhanced products with higher selling prices  we may not execute these programs on schedule 
in addition  our competitors may drive down prices faster or lower than our planned cost reduction programs 
even if we can reduce our manufacturing costs  many of our operating costs will not decline immediately if revenue decreases due to price competition 
in order to respond to increasing competition and our anticipation that average selling prices will decrease  we are attempting to reduce manufacturing costs of our new and existing products 
if we do not reduce manufacturing costs and average selling prices decrease  our operating results will be adversely affected 
manufacturing is currently outsourced to a small number of contract manufacturers 
we believe that our current contract manufacturing relationships provide us with competitive manufacturing costs for our products 
however  if we or these contract manufacturers terminate any of these relationships  or if we otherwise establish new relationships  we may encounter problems in the transition of manufacturing to another contract manufacturer  which could temporarily increase our manufacturing costs and cause production delays 
we face intense competition  which could adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase sales of our products 
the markets for our products are intensely competitive  continually evolving and subject to rapid technological change 
we may not be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors  including our customers 
certain of our customers also have the ability to internally produce the equipment that they currently purchase from us 
in such cases  we also compete with their internal product development capabilities 
we expect that competition will increase in the future 
we may not have the financial resources  technical expertise or marketing  manufacturing  distribution and support capabilities to compete successfully 
we face competition from two major direct manufacturers of stand alone voice processing products  tellabs and natural microsystems 
the other competition in these markets comes from voice switch manufacturers 
these manufacturers don t sell voice processing products or compete in the stand alone voice processing product market  but they integrate voice processing functionality within their switches  either as hardware modules or as software running on chips 
a more widespread adoption of internal voice processing solutions would present an increased competitive threat to us  if the net result was the elimination of demand for our voice processing system products 
with the downturn in spending in the telecommunications industry  service providers appear to be exploring these alternative sources of voice processing more thoroughly  while they wait for more robust capital spending budgets to return 
if our customers decide to design these alternative sources of voice processing functionality into their future network expansion  it could adversely impact the speed and duration of our sales recovery 
most of our competitors and potential competitors have substantially greater name recognition and technical  financial and marketing resources than we do 
such competitors may undertake more extensive marketing campaigns  adopt more aggressive pricing policies and devote substantially more resources to developing new products than we will 
we now license our echo cancellation software from ti  and if we do not receive the level of support we expect from ti  it could adversely affect our echo cancellation systems business 
in april  we sold our echo cancellation software technology and future revenue streams from our licenses of technology acquired from telinnovation to ti  in return for cash and a long term license of the echo cancellation software 
although the licensing agreement has strong guarantees of support for the software used in our products  if ti were to breach that agreement in some fashion  and not deliver complete and timely support to us  our success in the echo cancellation systems business could be adversely affected 
if ti licenses its echo cancellation software to other echo cancellation systems companies  this could increase the competitive pressures on our echo cancellation systems business 
under the terms of the sale agreement of our echo cancellation software to ti  ti is precluded from licensing the software to other echo cancellation systems companies for a period of two years from the date of the sale and to two specified competitors for a period of four years from the date of sale 
if ti were to license its echo cancellation software to other echo cancellation systems companies after two years  this could increase the level of competition and adversely affect our success in our echo cancellation systems business 
we operate in an industry experiencing rapid technological change  which may make our products obsolete 
our future success will depend on our ability to develop  introduce and market enhancements to our existing products and to introduce new products in a timely manner to meet our customers requirements 
the markets we target are characterized by rapid technological developments  frequent enhancements to existing products and new product introductions  changes in end user requirements  and evolving industry standards 
we may not be able to respond quickly and effectively to these rapid changes 
the emerging nature of these products and their rapid evolution will require us to continually improve the performance  features and reliability of our products  particularly in response to competitive product offerings 
we may not be able to respond quickly and effectively to these developments 
the introduction or market acceptance of products incorporating superior technologies or the emergence of alternative technologies and new industry standards could render our existing products  as well as our products currently under development  obsolete and unmarketable 
in addition  we may have only a limited amount of time to penetrate certain markets  and we may not be successful in achieving widespread acceptance of our products before competitors offer products and services similar or superior to our products 
we may fail to anticipate or respond on a cost effective and timely basis to technological developments  changes in industry standards or end user requirements 
we may also experience significant delays in product development or introduction 
in addition  we may fail to release new products or to upgrade or enhance existing products on a timely basis 
we may need to modify our products as a result of changes in industry standards 
the emergence of new industry standards  whether through adoption by official standards committees or widespread use by service providers  could require us to redesign our products 
if such standards become widespread  and our products are not in compliance  our current and potential customers may not purchase our products 
the rapid development of new standards increases the risk that our competitors could develop and introduce new products or enhancements directed at new industry standards before us 
if incumbent and emerging competitive service providers and the telecommunications industry as a whole experience another downturn or reduction in growth rate  the demand for our products will decrease  which will adversely affect our business 
we have experienced  and continue to experience  as have other companies in our sector  a slowdown in infrastructure spending by our customers 
this trend of lower capital spending in the telecommunications industry contributed to the decline in our revenues  beginning in the second half of fiscal  and although we have experienced some level of recovery in sales to these customers  sales have not fully recovered to the levels we saw prior to the decline in fiscal our success will depend in large part on development  expansion and or upgrade of voice and communications networks 
we are subject to risks of growth constraints due to our current and planned dependence on domestic and international telecommunications service providers 
these potential customers may be constrained for a number of reasons  including their limited capital resources  economic conditions  changes in regulation and consolidation 
some of the key components used in our products are currently available only from sole sources  the loss of which could delay product shipments 
we rely on certain vendors as the sole source of certain key components that we use in our products 
for example  we rely on ti as the sole source vendor for the digital signal processors used in our echo cancellation and voice enhancement products 
we have no guaranteed supply arrangements with our vendors 
any extended interruption in the supply of these components would affect our ability to meet scheduled deliveries of our products to customers 
if we are unable to obtain a sufficient supply of these components  we could experience difficulties in obtaining alternative sources or in altering product designs to use alternative components 
resulting delays or reductions in product shipments could damage customer relationships  and we could lose customers and orders 
additionally  because these vendors are the sole source of these components  we are at risk that adverse changes in prices of these components could have negative impacts on the cost of our products or require us to alter product designs to use alternative  less expensive components 
some suppliers of key components may reduce their inventory levels which could result in longer lead times for future component purchases and any delays in filling our demand may reduce or delay our expected product shipments and revenues 
although we believe there are currently ample supplies of components for our products  it is possible that in the near term component manufacturers may reduce their inventory levels and require firm orders before they manufacture components 
this reduction in stocking levels could lead to extended lead times in the future 
if we are unable to procure our planned quantities of materials from all prospective suppliers  and if we cannot use alternative components  we could experience revenue delays or reductions and potential harm to customer relationships 
an example of this risk occurred in the third quarter of fiscal as two vendors supplying us with components used in our oc product did not meet our total demand 
as a result  the schedule shipment of our oc product was delayed  which contributed to our revenue shortfall in that quarter 
we may experience unforeseen problems as we diversify our international customer base  which would impair our ability to grow our business 
historically  we have sold mostly to customers in north america 
we are continuing to execute on our plans to expand our international presence through the establishment of new relationships with established international oems  value added resellers and distributors 
however  we may still be required to hire additional personnel for the overseas market and incur other unforeseen expenditures 
our planned expansion overseas may not be successful 
as we expand our sales focus further into international markets  we will face new and complex issues that we may not have faced before  such as expanded risk to currency fluctuations  longer payment cycles  manufacturing overseas  political or economic instability  potential adverse tax consequences and broadened import export controls  which will put additional strain on our management personnel 
in the past  the vast majority of our international sales have been denominated in us dollars  however  in the future  we may be forced to denominate a greater amount of international sales in foreign currencies 
additionally  the number of installations we will be responsible for is likely to increase as a result of our continued international expansion 
in the past  we have experienced difficulties installing one of our echo cancellation products overseas 
in addition  we may not be able to establish more relationships with international oems  value added resellers and distributors 
if we do not  our ability to increase sales could be materially impaired 
if we lose the services of any of our key management or key technical personnel  or are unable to retain or attract additional technical personnel  our ability to conduct and expand our business could be impaired 
we depend heavily on timothy k 
montgomery  our chairman  president and chief executive officer  and on other key management and technical personnel  for the conduct and development of our business and the development of our products 
we have attempted to mitigate some of this risk through some key hires over the past couple of years 
however  there is no guarantee that if we lost the services of one or more of these people for any reason  that it would not adversely affect our ability to conduct and expand our business and to develop new products 
we believe that our future success will depend in large part upon our continued ability to attract  retain and motivate highly skilled employees 
however  we may not be able to do so 
our ability to compete successfully will depend  in part  on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights  which we may not be able to protect 
we may rely on a combination of patents  trade secrets  copyright and trademark laws  nondisclosure agreements and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect our intellectual property rights 
nevertheless  such measures may not be adequate to safeguard the technology underlying our products 
in addition  employees  consultants and others who participate in the development of our products may breach their agreements with us regarding our intellectual property  and we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach 
in addition  we may not be able to effectively protect our intellectual property rights in certain countries 
we may  for a variety of reasons  decide not to file for patent  copyright or trademark protection outside of the united states 
we also realize that our trade secrets may become known through other means not currently foreseen by us 
notwithstanding our efforts to protect our intellectual property  our competitors may be able to develop products that are equal or superior to our products without infringing on any of our intellectual property rights 
our products employ technology that may infringe on the proprietary rights of third parties  which may expose us to litigation 
although we do not believe that our products infringe the proprietary rights of any third parties  third parties may still assert infringement or invalidity claims or claims for indemnification resulting from infringement claims against us 
such assertions could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  irrespective of the validity or the successful assertion of such claims  we could incur significant costs in defending against such claims 
acquisitions and investments may adversely affect our business 
from time to time  we review acquisition and investment prospects that would complement our existing product offerings  augment our market coverage  secure supplies of critical materials or enhance our technological capabilities 
acquisitions or investments could result in a number of financial consequences  including potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities  large one time write offs  reduced cash balances and related interest income  higher fixed expenses which require a higher level of revenues to maintain gross margins  the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities  and amortization expenses related to other acquisition related intangible assets and impairment of goodwill 
furthermore  acquisitions involve numerous operational risks  including difficulties in the integration of operations  personnel  technologies  products and the information systems of the acquired companies  diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  diversion of resources from our existing businesses  products or technologies  risks of entering geographic and business markets in which we have no or limited prior experience  and potential loss of key employees of acquired organizations 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk due to changes in the general level of united states interest rates relates primarily to our cash equivalents and short term and long term investment portfolios 
our cash  cash equivalents  and short term and long term investments are primarily maintained at three major financial institutions in the united states 
as of april   we did not hold any derivative instruments 
the primary objective of our investment activities is the preservation of principal while maximizing investment income and minimizing risk  and we attempt to achieve this by diversifying our portfolio in a variety of highly rated investment securities that have limited terms to maturity 
we do not hold any instruments for trading purposes 
investment securities that have maturities of more than three months at the date of purchase but current maturities of less than one year are considered short term investments 
investment securities with remaining maturities of one year or more are considered long term investments 
our short term and long term investments consist primarily of us government securities and corporate bonds  as well as  commercial paper  asset backed securities and certificates of deposit 
short term and long term investments are maintained at one major financial institution  are classified as available for sale  and are recorded on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at fair value 
the following table presents the hypothetical changes in fair values of our investments as of april   based on a discounted cash flow calculation over the remaining term of each investment  that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
dollars in thousands valuation of securities given an interest rate decrease of x basis points valuation of securities given an interest rate increase of x basis points fair value as of april  bps bps bps bps bps bps total investments      these instruments are not leveraged 
the modeling technique used measures the change in fair values arising from selected potential changes in interest rates 
market changes reflect immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus basis points bps  bps  and bps over the remaining life of the investments  which shifts are representative of the historical movements in the federal funds rate 
the following table presents our cash equivalents and short term and long term investments subject to interest rate risk and their related weighted average interest rates as of april  in thousands

due to the short term nature of these securities  we do not believe that they presented a material risk to shifts in interest rates 
to date  the vast majority of our sales have been denominated in us dollars 
as only a small amount of foreign invoices are paid in currencies other than the us dollar  our foreign exchange risk is considered immaterial to our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows
