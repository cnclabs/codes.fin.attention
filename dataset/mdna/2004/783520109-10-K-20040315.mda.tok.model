item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations company overview the company s principal business is the ownership and operation of family dining restaurants with grill buffet formats under the ryan s and fire mountain brand names 
at december   the company operated restaurants ryan s brand and fire mountain brand in states 
the principal product for both brands is a self service buffet  which features hand carved and other meats  vegetables  pizza  soups  fresh and prepared salads  fruit  bakery products and soft serve ice cream and yogurt 
about one half of the ryan s restaurants and all of the fire mountain restaurants also have the display cooking format  which involves a glass enclosed grill and cooking area that extends into the dining room 
at restaurants with the display cooking format  a variety of meats  such as steak  chicken and seafood  are grilled daily and available to customers as part of the buffet price 
plated  grilled entr e selections are also available at the ryan s restaurants without the display cooking format 
both brands are characterized by their friendly and attentive service and affordable prices 
the company s revenues are derived principally from food and beverage sales at its restaurants 
sales are generally transacted in cash  checks or credit debit cards 
the latter item is essentially as liquid as cash as it is generally available for use by the company within two days 
sales made on accounts receivable are not significant 
inventories are purchased on credit and are rapidly converted to cash 
therefore  the company does not maintain significant receivables or inventories  and other working capital requirements for operations are not significant 
material opportunities for the company focus on growing its restaurant base in a profitable manner and increasing sales at its existing restaurants 
management considers its store level managers to be key factors in achieving both of these objectives and believes that controlled growth in the number of its restaurants at a rate of approximately per year is optimal for training and maintaining strong store level management teams 
the company also strengthens these teams by striving to keep the teams intact at each restaurant and by continuous training programs 
unit level sales are also impacted by hourly staff training and local marketing programs 
in addition  sales at existing ryan s restaurants have been favorably impacted by conversion to the display cooking format under the fire mountain name 
restaurant sales can be impacted by changes in personal income levels  changes in consumers preference for family dining and food safety concerns by consumers 
in  the average ticket  or sale  per customer at ryan s and fire mountain combined was 
the company s restaurants are especially popular with families and senior citizens  and management strives to attract and retain these customer groups by serving good food at affordable prices 
management believes that this pricing policy helps the company s restaurants remain a favorable dining choice even when its customers undergo economic hardships 
management also recognizes the increase in restaurant choices for consumers and the growing popularity of casual dining restaurants over the past ten years 
the ryan s brand  which was started in  has undergone many format changes over the years 
about one half of the ryan s restaurants have a traditional family steakhouse format  which is characterized by customers carrying their drinks and silverware to their tables and a la carte entr e selections that are available in addition to the buffet described above 
the display cooking format is not available at these restaurants 
the format in the other ryan s restaurants has been modified to feature display cooking  and drinks and silverware are brought to the tables by servers 
the only menu selection available to customers is the buffet 
the fire mountain brand incorporates the changes made to the modified ryan s and also features updated interior furnishings  an upscale food presentation and a lodge look exterior 
by providing more complete table service and surroundings that are more visually interesting  management believes that the fire mountain brand gives consumers an affordable alternative to other casual dining concepts 
growth plans for the ryan s and fire mountain brands are described below in liquidity and capital resources 
also  food safety concerns by consumers can affect sales 
accordingly  food safety is a top priority for the company 
food vendors are held to the highest standards  and all store managers are certified and periodically recertified through the servsafe food safety training program  which was developed by the national restaurant association educational foundation and is administered by the company s in house trainers 
sales and profit growth can be impacted if the company cannot recruit and retain store managers 
to meet this challenge  the company pays competitive salaries and bonuses and  through its store growth  offers excellent opportunities for future promotions 
in addition  many managers are on a rotating four day weekly work schedule  and manager transfers are made only for special circumstances 
the company also offers an operating partner plan for qualified senior managers  who  upon invitation and then joining the plan  can stay in their respective restaurants for a five year period 
operating partners receive cash bonuses based on both the operating profit and profit improvement of their respective restaurants and also receive a deferred cash bonus at the end of the five year period 
at december   there were operating partners in place  representing of the company s restaurants at that date 
the company s long term goal is to have operating partners at approximately two thirds of its restaurants 
principal risks to the company s sales and profit growth plans include unsuitable locations for new or existing restaurants  significant increases in product costs and ineffective controls over restaurant operating costs 
sites for new restaurants are evaluated using both demographic software and on site visits 
consumer income  population density  traffic patterns and retail proximity are important factors used in site selection 
also  executive management visits and approves all sites prior to purchase 
existing sites are also periodically reviewed for long term suitability  and restaurants may be relocated to new sites within the same market area if changing retail conditions have made an existing site unsuitable for long term growth prospects 
during  the company relocated three restaurants  resulting in average sales increases at the new sites in excess of over the prior year 
significant increases in product costs may also adversely affect store level profits 
fortunately  due to the wide variety of products offered at the restaurants  there are typically decreases in the cost of other products to offset many cost increases 
subject to competitive factors  menu price increases can be implemented to maintain profit levels 
however  this step is normally taken as a last measure by the company in order to maintain affordable pricing for its customers 
finally  the company maintains strong cost controls supplemented by an incentive bonus system that rewards managers for good sales and cost containment performance 
food and payroll costs are measured weekly  and store level profits provide the basis for certain bonus payments for store managers as well as for their related supervisory personnel 
critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are defined as those that have a significant impact on the company s financial statements and involve difficult or subjective estimates of future events by management 
management s estimates could differ significantly from actual results  leading to possible significant adjustments to future financial results 
the following policies are considered by management to involve estimates that most critically impact reported financial results 
asset lives property and equipment are recorded at cost  less accumulated depreciation 
buildings and land improvements are depreciated over estimated useful lives ranging from to years  and equipment is depreciated over estimated useful lives ranging from to years 
depreciation expense for financial statement purposes is calculated using the straight line method 
management is responsible for estimating the initial useful lives and any revisions thereafter and bases its estimates principally on historical usage patterns of the assets 
material differences in the amount of reported depreciation could result if different assumptions were used 
impairment of long lived assets long lived assets  which consist principally of restaurant properties  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
management reviews restaurants for possible impairment if the restaurant has had cash flows of  or less in the aggregate over the previous months or if it has been selected for relocation and the new site is under construction 
for restaurants that will continue to be operated  the carrying amount is compared to the undiscounted future cash flows  including proceeds from future disposal  over the remaining useful life of the restaurant 
the estimate of future cash flows is based on management s review of historical and current sales and cost trends of both the subject and similar restaurants 
the estimate of proceeds from future disposal is based on management s knowledge of current and planned development near the restaurant site and on current market transactions 
each of these estimates is based on assumptions  such as with respect to future sales and costs  that may differ materially from actual results 
if the carrying amount exceeds the sum of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows  the carrying value is reduced to the restaurant s current fair value 
if the decision has been made to close and sell a restaurant  the carrying value of that restaurant is reduced to its current fair value less costs to sell and is no longer depreciated 
self insurance liabilities the company self insures a significant portion of expected losses from its workers compensation  general liability and team member medical programs 
see note in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for the aggregate amount of these liabilities 
for workers compensation and general liability claims  the portion of any individual claim that exceeds  is covered by insurance purchased by the company 
accrued liabilities are recorded for the estimated  undiscounted future net payments  or ultimate costs  to settle both reported claims and claims that have been incurred but not reported 
on a quarterly basis  management reviews claim values as estimated by a third party claims administrator tpa and then adjusts these values for estimated future increases in order to record ultimate costs 
both current and prior years claims are reviewed because estimated claim values are frequently adjusted by the tpa as new information  such as updated medical reports or settlements  is received 
management reviews the relationship between historical claim estimates and payment history  overall number of accidents and historical claims experience in order to make an ultimate value estimate 
for team member medical claims  the portion of any individual claim that exceeds  is covered by insurance purchased by the company 
accruals are based on management s review of historical claim experience 
unexpected changes in any of these factors could result in costs that are materially different than initially reported 
net earnings the following table presents items in the consolidated statements of earnings as a percentage of restaurant sales and the percentage change of the dollar amounts between years percentage of restaurant sales percentage change restaurant sales cost of sales food and beverage payroll and benefits depreciation other restaurant expenses total cost of sales general and administrative expenses interest expense royalties from franchised restaurants other income  net earnings before income taxes income taxes net earnings compared to total restaurant sales increased by million  or  to million in from million in the sales increase resulted principally from incremental sales  amounting to approximately million  from new restaurants opened in and  partially offset by an estimated million loss in sales associated with the temporary closing of stores for conversion to the display cooking format with a lodge look exterior see liquidity and capital resources 
each such store was closed for approximately four to six weeks during the conversion process 
same store sales for the year increased 
in computing same store sales  the company averages weekly sales for those units operating for at least months 
all converted or relocated stores are included in the same store sales calculation  provided that their underlying stores were operating for at least months 
same store sales and related factors in compared to and compared to were as follows same store sales customer count menu factor same store sales during improved as the year progressed  ranging from down during the first quarter to up during the fourth quarter 
same store customer counts also improved during  with a decline during the first quarter and a increase during the fourth quarter 
the menu factor principally represents year over year menu price increases 
management attributes this sales trend principally to an improving retail environment  the company s lodge look conversions and the implementation of a store level local marketing program 
during  restaurants were reopened after their conversions to the display cooking format with a lodge look exterior 
average same store sales gains at these restaurants following their conversions were in excess of 
implemented in april  the company s local marketing program trains and encourages store management to get the ryan s and fire mountain brand names in front of potential customers through the use of both external merchandising and community marketing 
while the impact from any company wide marketing program is difficult to evaluate  there were sales gains during the year at the ryan s restaurants that had not been remodeled with the display cooking format  leading management to conclude that local marketing efforts were effective 
during  the company opened new and relocated three restaurants 
all new restaurants in were opened with the display cooking format and lodge look exterior and achieved first year annualized sales volumes that averaged million per restaurant 
five restaurants were closed during  three of which were relocations 
management defines a relocation as a restaurant opened within months after the closing of another restaurant in the same market area 
a relocation generally results in an opening and a closing in the same year 
accordingly  at the end of and  the company owned and operated and restaurants  respectively 
total cost of sales increased to million in from million in such costs  as a percentage of sales  were for and for thus  the company s operating margins at the restaurant level were and of sales in and  respectively 
these costs are presented in a tabular format in the net earnings section above and discussed more fully in the following paragraphs 
food and beverage costs decreased to of sales in from of sales in resulting principally from lower seafood  poultry and pork prices partially offset by higher beef costs 
menu price increases and an increased store level focus by managers  particularly when beef prices were higher during the fourth quarter of  also contributed to lower food costs as a percent of sales 
beef prices have decreased during the first part of  largely due to lower export demand resulting from a december occurrence of bovine spongiform encephalopathy mad cow disease in washington state 
management estimates that beef prices will increase by approximately over average levels 
the company has not seen any reduced demand for its steaks or other beef products by its customers 
payroll and benefits increased to of sales in from of sales in due to higher store management salaries and payroll tax expense  partially offset by well controlled hourly labor costs 
all other restaurant costs  including depreciation  increased to of sales in compared to of sales in due to higher natural gas  depreciation  store opening and local store advertising costs 
general and administrative expenses increased to of sales in from of sales in due principally to higher performance based bonuses 
interest expense amounted to million in of sales compared to million in of sales 
the company s weighted average interest rate was for both and interest expense in was impacted by an million increase in average debt levels during as higher cash balances were maintained during much of the year due to the timing of payments related to the company s revolving credit facility see liquidity and capital resources 
royalties from franchised restaurants decreased to million in from million in due principally to family steak houses of florida fsh  the company s sole franchisee  operating fewer stores in the current year 
in december  the company and fsh amended their franchise agreement so that over the following months  fsh will either sell  close or convert to a non affiliated brand its current ryan s restaurants  and the existing franchise relationship will be terminated by no later than june  management plans to open company owned restaurants in fsh s former territory  starting in based upon the above changes to revenues and expenses  earnings before income taxes decreased to million in from million in the effective income tax rate for decreased to compared to in due to higher federal and state tax credits and lower state income tax expense based on revised estimates made during the fourth quarter of for  management expects an effective income tax rate of around  subject to the reauthorization of the work opportunity tax credit by the us congress 
this credit expired on december  and has a impact on the company s effective tax rate 
this credit has been reauthorized in past years  and management believes that this year s reauthorization is likely given the favorable impact the credit has on economically disadvantaged individuals 
net earnings decreased to million in of sales from million in of sales 
diluted weighted average shares decreased by to  in compared to  in due to the company s stock repurchase program 
accordingly  diluted earnings per share deps increased to in from in all weighted average shares and deps have been restated to reflect the company s for stock split in may see stock split 
compared to total restaurant sales increased by million  or  to million in from million in incremental sales from restaurants opened in and amounted to approximately million and were partially offset by a decrease in same store sales 
same store sales and related factors in compared to and compared to were as follows same store sales customer count menu factor same store sales in were up during the first five months of the year and then became progressively weaker during the remaining seven months with an overall decrease during that period 
same store sales at restaurants with the company s traditional family steakhouse format and at those restaurants with the display cooking format showed a similar trend and ended the year with an overall decrease and a increase  respectively 
management attributed this sales trend principally to an overall weak economic environment that appeared to deteriorate during the year 
during  the company opened new and relocated seven restaurants 
accordingly  at the end of and  the company owned and operated and restaurants  respectively 
total cost of sales increased to million in from million in such costs  as a percentage of sales  were for and for thus  the company s operating margins at the restaurant level were and of sales in and  respectively 
these costs are presented in a tabular format in the net earnings section above and discussed more fully in the following paragraph 
food and beverage costs decreased to of sales in from in resulting from menu price increases and lower seafood and pork prices  partially offset by higher soybean oil products and distribution costs 
payroll and benefits increased to of sales in from of sales in due to higher store management wages and workers compensation costs

in  store closing costs included approximately million of additional depreciation charges associated with the closing of a leased property in january general and administrative expenses amounted to of sales in and of sales in lower performance based bonuses and manager recruiting costs were incurred during interest expense amounted to million in of sales compared to million in of sales 
the decrease resulted from a decrease in the company s weighted average interest rate to in from in debt levels increased by million in as additional purchases of the company s common stock during made under the company s stock repurchase program decreased cash available for debt repayment purposes 
based upon the above changes to revenues and expenses  earnings before income taxes increased to million in from million in the effective income tax rate for increased to compared to in due to changes to various state tax laws and procedures 
net earnings increased to million in of sales from million in of sales 
diluted weighted average shares decreased by to  in compared to  in due to the company s stock repurchase program 
accordingly  deps increased to in from in liquidity and capital resources the company s principal source of liquidity is from its restaurants sales  which  as noted above  are primarily derived from cash  checks or credit debit cards 
principal uses of cash are operating expenses  which have been discussed in the preceding sections  capital expenditures and share repurchases 
a comparison of the company s sources and uses of funds for and follow in millions change net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash used in financing activities net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents net cash provided by operating activities increased due to a million decrease in income tax payments resulting from larger differences between book and tax depreciation related to bonus depreciation rules and larger federal tax credits related principally to the work opportunity tax credit program 
other factors causing the operating cash increase include higher depreciation and amortization and higher accrued liabilities  both of which are related principally to the growth in the number of the company s restaurants in operation 
at december   the company s working capital amounted to a million deficit compared to a million deficit at january  the company does not anticipate any adverse effect from the current working capital deficit due to the significant and steady level of cash flow provided by operations 
net cash used in investing activities decreased by million 
total capital expenditures increased to million in from million in due principally to higher land and remodeling expenditures 
proceeds from the sale of property and equipment increased by million in these sales typically involve closed restaurant properties and excess land and occur on an irregular basis during any given year 
during  the company plans to build and open to new restaurants  including five potential relocations  with an average unit cost including land of approximately million 
these restaurants will open with display cooking and a lodge look exterior and will operate with the fire mountain brand name 
management also intends to remodel approximately to restaurants with these same features at an estimated total cost of million 
each remodeled restaurant will operate as either a ryan s or a fire mountain based on the conditions of its particular market 
important factors for the branding decision include the historical sales and profit performance of the existing ryan s restaurant  the market s competitive environment and management s opinion of the market s disposition towards the ryan s brand name 
total capital expenditures are estimated at million 
the company is currently concentrating its efforts on company owned restaurants and is not actively pursuing any additional franchised locations  either domestically or internationally 
net cash used in financing activities decreased by million due principally to a million decrease in share repurchases offset by a million change in net borrowings 
in addition to a million repayment associated with the company s issuance of million of senior notes in july  net borrowings under the company s revolving credit facility decreased by million in compared to a million increase in the company began its stock repurchase program in march and is currently authorized to repurchase up to an aggregate million shares of its common stock through december through december   approximately million shares  or of total shares outstanding at the beginning of the repurchase program  had been purchased at an average cost of per share  amounting to million in total 
repurchases may be made from time to time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions in accordance with applicable securities regulations  depending on market conditions  share price and other factors 
the company s current credit agreements generally limit share repurchases to of net earnings 
additional repurchases are allowed based on capital expenditure levels 
management intends to actively proceed with the repurchase program through  subject to the continued availability of capital  the aforementioned limitations imposed by the credit agreements  applicable securities regulations and the other factors described in forward looking information 
the company s contractual obligations at december  were as follows payments due by period in millions less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years due in fiscal year after long term debt operating leases construction obligations total the company s long term debt and operating leases are described in footnotes and  respectively  of the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
construction obligations represent commitments for store construction million and land purchases million 
the company has also entered into various contracts for food and other restaurant supply purchases that set pricing and product specifications  but do not specify any minimum purchase quantities 
at december   the company s debt consisted of million of senior notes  million of senior notes and a million revolving credit facility of which million was outstanding 
during  the company issued the senior notes  using the proceeds to repay million in borrowings under the revolving credit facility 
at the same time  the maximum level of the revolving credit facility was reduced from million to million 
after allowances for letters of credit and other items  there was approximately million in funds available under the revolving credit facility at december  during  management estimates that cash generated from operations will exceed the company s capital expenditure requirements and plans to use this excess cash for stock repurchases 
additional debt may be incurred in order to meet the company s share repurchase objectives 
however  based on current projections and target debt levels  management estimates that no more than million of additional borrowings during will be required 
the company s ability to draw on these funds may be limited by restrictions in the agreements governing both sets of senior notes and the revolving credit facility 
management believes that  based on current plans  these restrictions will not impair the company s operations during the current revolving credit facility expires in january  and management intends to refinance the facility during based on preliminary discussions with banks  management believes that the facility will be refinanced in a manner that appropriately supports the company s current operations and growth plans 
however  since final negotiations have not commenced  there can be no assurance that the refinancing will occur on anticipated terms or at all 
management believes that its current capital structure is sufficient to meet its requirements 
the company has entered into interest rate hedging transactions in the past  and although no such agreements are currently outstanding  management intends to continue monitoring the interest rate environment and may enter into such transactions in the future if deemed advantageous

the company has appealed this decision 
as part of the appeal process  the presiding judge stayed the order regarding the employee addresses 
due to the evolving nature of this case  the potential impact to the company s financial results cannot be estimated at this time 
accordingly  no accrual for a loss contingency has been made in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
in addition  from time to time  the company is involved in various legal claims and litigation arising in the normal course of business 
based on currently known legal actions  management believes that  as a result of its legal defenses and insurance arrangements  none of these other actions should have a material adverse effect on the company s business or financial condition  taken as a whole
