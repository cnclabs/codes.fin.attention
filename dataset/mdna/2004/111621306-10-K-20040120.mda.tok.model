item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations recent events on november   we purchased a building located at our san jose headquarters for million in cash plus transaction costs 
the  square foot facility  which houses a portion of our engineering organization and development  test and interoperability laboratories  was previously leased 
as a result of the building purchase  during the first quarter of fiscal  we expect to record a charge ranging from million to million primarily related to lease termination  facilities consolidation and other associated costs  and we expect to reduce our annual operating expenses by approximately million to million 
in addition  we issued a million guarantee as part of the purchase agreements  and cancelled an irrevocable letter of credit of million  which was previously issued as security for the building lease 

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth certain financial data for the periods indicated as a percentage of total net revenues fiscal year ended october  october  october  net revenues cost of revenues gross margin operating expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative amortization of deferred stock compensation restructuring costs in process research and development facilities lease losses and other charges total operating expenses income loss from operations interest and other income  net interest expense gain on repurchases of convertible subordinated debt gain loss on investments  net income loss before provision for income taxes income tax provision net income loss revenues 
our revenues are derived primarily from sales of our silkworm family of products 
net revenues for the year ended october  were million  a decrease of percent compared with net revenues of million for the year ended october  net revenues for the year ended october  represented an increase of percent over net revenues of million for the year ended october  net revenues for the year ended october  were negatively affected by declines in average selling prices as a result of increased competition  partially offset by increases in volume as a result of continued increases in demand for san switching products 
for the year ended october   the increases in net revenues reflect a general increased demand for san switching products  and were the result of increased unit sales offset by declines in average unit selling prices of our products 
we expect that average unit prices of our products will likely continue to decline in the future as a result of competitive pricing pressures or new product introductions by us or our competitors 
we also expect shipping volumes will fluctuate depending on the supply and demand for san switching products 
domestic and international revenues were approximately percent and percent of our total revenues  respectively  for the year ended october  for the year ended october   domestic and international revenues were approximately percent and percent of our total revenues  respectively  and for the year ended october   domestic and international revenues were approximately percent and percent of our total revenues  respectively 
revenues are attributed to geographic areas based on the location of the customer to which our products are shipped 
international revenues primarily consisted of sales to customers in western europe and the greater asia pacific region 
included in domestic revenues are sales to certain oem customers who take possession of our products domestically and then distribute these 
table of contents products to their international customers 
our mix of international and domestic revenue can therefore vary depending on the relative mix of sales to certain oem customers 
a significant portion of our revenue is concentrated among a relatively small number of customers 
for the year ended october   three customers each represented greater than ten percent of our total revenues for a combined total of percent of our total revenues 
for the year ended october   the same three customers each represented greater than ten percent of our total revenues for a combined total of percent of our total revenues  and for the year ended october   three customers each represented greater than ten percent of our total revenues for a combined total of percent of our total revenues 
we expect that a significant portion of our future revenues will continue to come from sales of products to a relatively small number of customers 
therefore  the loss of any one significant customer  or a decrease in the level of sales to any one significant customer  could seriously harm our financial condition and results of operations 
gross margin 
gross margin for the year ended october   was percent compared to percent and percent for the years ended october   and october   respectively 
cost of goods sold consists of product costs and manufacturing operations costs 
for the year ended october   the reduction in gross margins was the result of increased product costs and manufacturing operations costs relative to net revenues 
the increase in product costs relative to net revenues is primarily the result of declines in average unit selling prices of our products  partially offset by lower component and manufacturing costs 
the increase in manufacturing operations costs is a result of increased production volume and greater installed base  combined with continued migration of manufacturing operations to asia 
for the year ended october   the increase in gross margin was the result of decreased product costs and increased manufacturing operations costs relative to net revenues 
the decrease in product costs relative to net revenues was primarily due to lower component and manufacturing costs  partially offset by decreases in the average unit selling prices of our products 
the increase in manufacturing operations costs is a result of increased production volume and greater installed base 
we expect that average unit prices of our products will likely continue to decline in the future as a result of competitive pricing pressures or new product introductions by us or our competitors 
if we are unable to offset future average unit price reductions of our products with reduced manufacturing product costs  or if as a result of future reductions in average unit pricing our revenues do not grow  our gross margin may be negatively affected 
research and development expenses 
research and development r d expenses increased to million for the year ended october   compared with million and million for the years ended october   and october   respectively 
r d expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for personnel engaged in engineering and r d activities  fees paid to consultants and outside service providers  nonrecurring engineering charges  prototyping expenses related to the design  development  testing and enhancement of our products  depreciation related to engineering and test equipment  and it and facilities expenses 
the increases in r d expenses  both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net revenues  reflect our belief that continued investment in research and development is a critical factor in maintaining our competitive position 
further  the increase in r d expenses for the year ended october  were due to the incremental spending associated with our acquisition of rhapsody 
we currently anticipate that r d expenses in fiscal year will increase in absolute dollars principally as a result of continued investment in research and development for new products and technologies 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses decreased to million for the year ended october   compared with million for the year ended october  sales and marketing expenses were million for the year ended october  sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing and sales  costs associated with promotional and travel expenses  and it and facilities expenses 
for the year ended october   the decrease in sales and marketing expenses was primarily due to decreased commissions and decreased travel and marketing program expenses resulting from various cost cutting actions  offset by increased expenses due to the expansion of our sales and marketing organizations 
for the year ended october   the increase in sales and marketing expenses was primarily due to the expansion of our sales and marketing organizations  and an increase in direct selling expenses  principally commissions  associated 
table of contents with increased revenues 
we currently anticipate that sales and marketing expenses in fiscal year will decrease slightly in absolute dollars 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative g a expenses increased to million for the year ended october   compared with million and million for the years ended october   and october   respectively 
g a expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for corporate executives  finance  human resources and investor relations  as well as recruiting expenses  professional fees  corporate legal expenses  other corporate expenses  and it and facilities expenses 
for the year ended october   the increase in g a expenses was primarily due to an increase in personnel related costs 
for the year ended october   the increase in g a expenses was primarily due to additional headcount and other expenses necessary to manage and support increased levels of business activity 
we currently anticipate that g a expenses in fiscal year will remain consistent with fiscal year in absolute dollars 
amortization of deferred stock compensation 
amortization of deferred stock compensation decreased to million for the year ended october   compared with million  and million for the years ended october   and october   respectively 
in the second quarter of fiscal  we recorded million of deferred stock compensation in connection with our acquisition of rhapsody 
the million of deferred stock compensation represented the intrinsic value of unvested restricted common stock and assumed stock options  and is being amortized over the respective remaining service periods on a straight line basis see note  acquisition of rhapsody networks  inc  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
amortization of deferred stock compensation for the years ended october  and october  was related to the grant of certain stock options to employees during the year ended october   which resulted in deferred stock compensation of million 
deferred stock compensation is amortized over the vesting periods of the applicable options 
restructuring costs 
restructuring costs for the year ended october   were million 
restructuring costs consist of million related to a program to restructure and reorganize certain business operations during the three months ended april   and million related to a company wide restructuring program during the three months ended january  see note  restructuring costs  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in process research and development 
on january   we completed our acquisition of rhapsody  a provider of next generation intelligent switching platforms 
in exchange for all of the outstanding securities of rhapsody  we issued million shares of our common stock and assumed warrants and stock options to purchase million shares of our common stock 
in addition  we agreed to issue up to an additional million shares of our common stock if the rhapsody business successfully completed specified product milestones by november  brocade has determined that the specified product milestones were not met  and therefore  brocade does not intend to issue the additional shares 
however  the representative for the former rhapsody stockholders has indicated that he disagrees with brocade s determination and has initiated discussions with brocade on this matter 
as of the acquisition date  rhapsody was a development stage company that had no recognized revenue and a core technology that required substantial additional resources to bring it to technological feasibility 
to date  we have incurred million in expenses related to bringing the rhapsody core technology to technological feasibility 
we currently believe that revenues related to this technology will commence during fiscal year as a result  the acquisition was accounted for as an asset purchase and the total purchase price of million was allocated to the assets acquired  liabilities assumed  and acquired in process r d based on their respective fair values 
the excess of purchase price over the fair value of net assets received was allocated to acquired in process r d and acquired non monetary assets on a pro rata basis 
acquired in process r d of million was expensed during the three months ended april  because it had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use 
no acquired in process r d was recorded in any of the other periods presented see note  acquisition of rhapsody networks  inc  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

table of contents facilities lease losses and other charges 
during the year ended october   we experienced the impact of unfavorable economic conditions and a reduction in it spending rates 
as a result  during the fourth quarter ended october   we performed a comprehensive analysis of our real estate facility requirements and identified vacant excess facilities space  which was subsequently offered for sublease 
factors considered in the analysis included  but were not limited to  anticipated future revenue growth rates  anticipated future headcount requirements in terms of both headquarters and field personnel  anticipated sublease terms  anticipated time to sublease  and anticipated future operating expenses based upon then current market conditions 
based upon the results of this analysis and the excess facilities space identified  during the fourth quarter ended october   we recorded a charge of million related to estimated facilities lease losses  net of expected sublease income  and the impairment of certain related assets see note  liabilities associated with facilities lease losses and asset impairment charges  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the facilities lease losses and related asset impairment charges were estimates and represented the low end of an estimated range that may be adjusted upon the occurrence of future triggering events 
triggering events may include  but are not limited to  changes in estimated time to sublease the facilities  sublease terms  and sublease rates 
during the quarter ended july   we completed a transaction to sublease a portion of these vacant facilities 
accordingly  based upon the most recent market data  we revised certain estimates and assumptions  including those related to expected sublease rates  estimated time to sublease the facilities  expected future operating costs  and expected future use of the facilities 
no material adjustments were made to the facilities lease losses reserve as a result of these revised estimates and assumptions 
as of october   no additional adjustments had been made to the estimated facilities lease losses reserve 
should there be changes in real estate market conditions or should it take longer than expected to find a suitable tenant to sublease the remaining vacant facilities  adjustments to the facilities lease losses reserve may be necessary in future periods based upon then current actual events and circumstances 
also during the fourth quarter ended october   as a result of an accelerated transition of our product offerings from to gbit sec technology  we recorded a charge of million primarily related to the impairment of certain gbit sec related equipment no longer used in research and development and sales and marketing efforts see note  liabilities associated with facilities lease losses and asset impairment charges  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
on november   we purchased a previously leased building located at our san jose headquarters for million in cash plus transaction costs 
in connection with the building purchase  during the first quarter of fiscal  we will record adjustments to the previously recorded facilities lease loss reserve and expect to record a charge ranging from million to million primarily related to lease termination  facilities consolidation and other associated costs 
in addition  we issued a million guarantee as part of the purchase agreements  and cancelled an irrevocable letter of credit of million  which was previously issued as security for the building lease see note  subsequent event  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
interest and other income  net 
net interest and other income decreased to million for the year ended october   compared with million for the year ended october  net interest and other income was million for the year ended october  for the year ended october   the decrease was primarily the result of declining interest rates 
for the year ended october   the increase was primarily the result of increased cash  cash equivalent and investment balances  partially offset by declining interest rates 
the increase in cash balances was attributed to cash generated from operations and the proceeds from the million in aggregate principal amount of two percent convertible subordinated notes due that we issued in december and january see note  convertible subordinated debt  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
interest expense 
interest expense was million and million for the years ended october  and october   respectively 
interest expense primarily represents the interest cost associated with our convertible subordinated debt 
the increase in interest expense for the year ended october   
table of contents compared with the year ended october   was primarily due to a full year of interest expense related to our convertible subordinated debt during fiscal year  partially offset by reduction of interest expense due to repurchases of convertible subordinated debt 
for the year ended october   interest expense related to our convertible subordinated debt was outstanding for ten months 
gain on repurchases of convertible subordinated debt 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we repurchased on the open market million in face value of our convertible subordinated debt 
we paid an average of on each dollar of face value for an aggregate purchase price of million  which resulted in a pre tax gain of million for fiscal year there were no repurchases of convertible subordinated debt during the years ended october  or october  see note  convertible subordinated debt  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
gain loss on investments  net 
net gain on investments of million for the year ended october  consisted of gains on the disposition of non marketable private strategic investments of million  offset by an impairment charge of million that resulted from an other than temporary decline in the estimated fair value of a minority equity investment in a different non publicly traded company 
net gain on investments for the year ended october  resulted from the sale of united states government agency debt securities 
net loss on investments for the year ended october  consisted of impairment losses on minority equity investments in non publicly traded companies of million  partially offset by realized gains from sales of marketable equity securities of million 
as of october  and october   we had net unrealized holding gains of million and million  respectively  associated with our remaining investment portfolio 
we have made certain minority equity investments in non publicly traded companies that develop technology or provide services that are complementary to or broaden the markets for our products  and to promote our business and strategic objectives 
minority equity investments in non public companies are included in other assets on our consolidated balance sheets  are carried at cost  and are accounted for under the cost method 
we hold less than percent of the voting equity of such companies and do no have or seek control or significant influence over the respective companies operating and financial policies 
we monitor our investments for impairment on a quarterly basis and make appropriate reductions in carrying values when such impairment is determined to be other than temporary 
factors used in determining an impairment include  but are not limited to  the current business environment including competition and uncertainty of financial condition  going concern considerations such as the rate at which the investee company utilizes cash to finance overhead  and the investee company s inability to obtain additional private financing to fulfill its stated business plan  the need for changes to the investee company s existing business model due to changing business environments and its ability to successfully implement necessary changes  and comparable valuations 
if an investment is determined to be impaired  a determination is made as to whether such impairment is other than temporary 
during the year ended october   we recorded impairment charges of million that resulted from other than temporary declines in the estimated fair value of our minority equity investments in non publicly traded companies 
the impairment charges reduced the carrying value of our investments to the estimated fair value 
no impairment charges were recorded during the year ended october  during the year ended october   we made minority equity investments in non publicly traded companies of million 
our investments were made primarily in companies in the storage networking  internet infrastructure  fabless semiconductor  networking services  and managed storage services industries 
these companies were  and continue to be  development stage companies with significant risks 
during the year ended october   the industries in which these companies compete experienced considerable market declines associated with a depressed macroeconomic environment 
many of these companies had spent the majority of their funding on operating activities and or lost key business partners due to bankruptcy  and we determined that the carrying value of our investments were impaired 
based upon the then current market conditions and substantial doubt about these companies ability to raise additional funding  achieve positive cash flow  and achieve projected revenues  we concluded the impairments were other than temporary and recorded impairment charges of million 
the impairment charges reduced the carrying value of our 
table of contents investments to the estimated fair value 
the carrying value of our minority equity investments in non publicly traded companies at october  and october  was zero and million  respectively 
provision for income taxes 
our effective tax rate was percent for the year ended october   compared with percent and percent for the years ended october  and october   respectively 
for the year ended october   we recorded a tax provision even though we had a pre tax book loss  because our pre tax book loss included non deductible expenses  primarily in process research and development expenses  incurred in connection with our acquisition of rhapsody 
our effective tax rates have historically differed from the federal statutory rate for various reasons see note  income taxes  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
for the year ended october   our effective tax rate was significantly higher than the federal statutory rate primarily due to the inability to benefit from certain losses on minority equity investments in non publicly traded companies 
our ability to maintain our current effective tax rate requires that international revenues and earnings as a percentage of total revenues and earnings be consistent with historical levels 
to the extent that international revenues and earnings differ from those historically achieved  a factor largely influenced by the buying behavior of our oem partners  or unfavorable changes in tax laws and regulations occur  our tax rate could change 
liquidity and capital resources cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and long term investments were million as of october   a decrease of million over the prior year amount of million 
for the year ended october   we generated million in cash from operating activities  primarily related to non cash losses and a decrease in accounts receivable  partially offset by decreases in accounts payable 
days sales outstanding in receivables for the year ended october  was days 
net cash used in investing activities for the year ended october  totaled million and was primarily the result of million in net purchases of short and long term investments and million invested in capital equipment 
net cash used in financing activities for the year ended october  totaled million 
net cash used in financing activities was primarily the result of repurchases of our convertible subordinated debt totaling million  payments of million related to assumed capital lease and debt obligations in connection with the rhapsody acquisition  offset by million in net proceeds from the issuance of common stock related to employee participation in employee stock programs and exercises of stock options and million in repurchases of convertible debt pending settlement  which was included in accounts payable as of october  net proceeds from the issuance of common stock related to employee participation in employee stock programs have historically been a significant component of our liquidity 
the extent to which our employees participate in these programs generally increases or decreases based upon changes in the market price of our common stock 
as a result  our cash flow resulting from the issuance of common stock related to employee participation in employee stock programs will vary 
as a result of our recent voluntary stock options exchange program  we do not expect to generate significant cash flow from the issuance of common stock related to the employee participation in employee stock programs during fiscal year unless our future common stock price exceeds per share 
we have a manufacturing agreement with solectron and foxconn under which we provide twelve month product forecasts and place purchase orders in advance of the scheduled delivery of products to our customers 
the required lead time for placing orders with both solectron and foxconn depends on the specific product 
as of october   our aggregate commitment to solectron and foxconn for inventory components used in the manufacture of brocade products was million  net of purchase commitment reserves of million  which we expect to utilize during future normal ongoing operations 
although the purchase orders we place with solectron and foxconn are cancelable  the terms of the agreements require us to purchase from solectron and foxconn all inventory components not returnable or usable by  or sold to other customers of solectron or foxconn 
on december   and january   we sold million in aggregate principal amount of two percent convertible subordinated notes due see note  convertible subordinated debt  of the 
table of contents notes to consolidated financial statements 
holders of the notes may  in whole or in part  convert the notes into shares of our common stock at a conversion rate of shares per  principal amount of notes aggregate of approximately million shares at any time prior to maturity on january  at any time on or after january   we may redeem the notes in whole or in part at the following prices expressed as a percentage of the principal amount redemption period price beginning on january  and ending on december  beginning on january  and ending on december  on january  we are required to pay interest on january and july of each year  beginning july  debt issuance costs are being amortized over the term of the notes 
the amortization of debt issuance costs will accelerate upon early redemption  repurchase  or conversion of the notes 
the net proceeds remain available for general corporate purposes  including working capital and capital expenditures 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we repurchased on the open market million in face value of our convertible subordinated notes due we paid an average of on each dollar of face value for an aggregate purchase price of million  which resulted in a pre tax gain of million for fiscal year as of october   million in repurchases of convertible debt were pending settlement  and thus  were included in accounts payable 
as of october   the remaining balance outstanding of the convertible subordinated debt was million

as a result the building purchase  our future contractual obligations related to non cancelable operating leases in the table above has been reduced by million  and standby letters of credit have been reduced by million 
in addition  we issued a million guarantee as part of the purchase agreements

our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the rate of revenue growth  the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts and the expansion of sales and marketing  the timing of introductions of new products and enhancements to existing products  and the market acceptance of our products 
related party transactions larry w 
sonsini  a director of brocade  serves as a member and chairman and ceo of wilson sonsini goodrich rosati  professional corporation wsgr  our principal outside legal counsel 
aggregate fees billed to us by wsgr for legal services rendered  including general corporate counseling  litigation services  merger and acquisition related services  and services related to our convertible debt offering  during the years ended october   october   and october   were million  million  and million  respectively 
we believe that the services rendered to us by wsgr were on terms no more favorable than those with unrelated parties 
mark leslie was a director of brocade until may and served on the board of directors of veritas  a company with whom we do business 
during the years ended october  and october   total revenues from sales to veritas were million and million  respectively 
we believe that sales to veritas were on terms no more favorable than those with unrelated parties 
during the normal course of business we purchase certain equipment from vendors who are also customers of brocade and with whom we have contractual arrangements 
the equipment we purchase is primarily used for testing purposes in our development labs or otherwise consumed internally 
we believe that all such transactions are on an arms length basis and subject to terms no more favorable than those with unrelated parties 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we evaluate  on an on going basis  our estimates and judgments  including those related to sales returns  bad debts  excess inventory and purchase commitments  investments  warranty obligations  lease losses  income taxes  and contingencies and litigation 

table of contents we base our estimates on historical experience and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
the methods  estimates  and judgments we use in applying our most critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results that we report in our consolidated financial statements 
the sec considers an entity s most critical accounting policies to be those policies that are both most important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results of operations  and those that require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain at the time of estimation 
we believe the following critical accounting policies  among others  require significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition  and allowances for sales returns and doubtful accounts  warranty reserves  inventory and purchase commitment reserves  restructuring charges and lease loss reserves  litigation costs  and accounting for income taxes 
revenue recognition  and allowances for sales returns and doubtful accounts 
product revenue is generally recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  fee is fixed or determinable  and collection is probable 
however  revenue recognition is deferred for shipments to new customers and for shipments to existing customers when significant support services are required to successfully integrate our products into our customer s products 
these revenues  and related costs  are deferred and recognized when the customer has successfully integrated our products into its product offerings  and we have met any support obligations 
in addition  revenue from sales to master resellers is recognized upon reported sell through 
we reduce revenue for estimated sales returns and other allowances at the time of shipment 
sales returns and other allowances are estimated based on historical experience  current trends  and our expectations regarding future experience 
estimated sales returns and other allowances include consideration of historical sales levels  the timing and magnitude of historical sales returns and other allowances  and a projection of this experience into the future 
in addition  we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts  which are also accounted for as a reduction in revenue  for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we analyze accounts receivable  historical collection patterns  customer concentrations  customer creditworthiness  current economic trends and changes in customer payment terms and practices when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
if actual sales returns and other allowances exceed our estimate  or if the financial condition of our customers was to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances and charges may be required 
service revenue  which to date has not been material  consists of training  warranty  and maintenance arrangements  including post contract customer support pcs services 
pcs services are offered under renewable  annual fee based contracts or as part of multiple element arrangements and typically include upgrades and enhancements to our software operating system software  and telephone support 
for multiple element arrangements  we allocate revenue to each element based upon vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of the fair value of the element or application of the residual method 
vsoe of the fair value for an element is based upon the price charged when the element is sold separately 
service revenue  including revenue allocated to undelivered elements  is deferred and recognized ratably over the contractual period 
service contracts are typically one to three years in length 
training revenue is recognized upon completion of the training 
warranty reserves 
we provide warranties on our products ranging from one to three years 
estimated future warranty costs are accrued at the time of shipment and charged to cost of revenues based upon 
table of contents historical experience  current trends and our expectations regarding future experience 
if actual warranty costs exceed our estimate  additional charges may be required 
inventory and purchase commitment reserves 
we write down inventory and record purchase commitment reserves for estimated excess and obsolete inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated fair value based upon assumptions about future demand  product transition cycles  and market conditions 
although we strive to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and commitments  and our reported results 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected  additional inventory write downs  purchase commitment reserves  and charges against earnings might be required 
restructuring charges and lease loss reserves 
we monitor and regularly evaluate our organizational structure and associated operating expenses 
depending on events and circumstances  we may decide to restructure our operations to reduce future operating costs 
in determining the restructuring charges  we analyze our future operating requirements  including the required headcount by business functions and facility space requirements 
our restructuring costs  and any resulting accruals  involve significant estimates made by management using the best information available at the time the estimates are made  some of which maybe provided by third parties 
in recording facilities lease loss reserves  we make various assumptions  including the time period over which the facilities will be vacant  expected sublease terms  expected sublease rates  anticipated future operating expenses  and expected future use of the facilities 
our estimates involve a number of risks and uncertainties  some of which are beyond our control  including future real estate market conditions and our ability to successfully enter into subleases or lease termination agreements with terms as favorable as those assumed when arriving at our estimates 
we regularly evaluate a number of factors to determine the appropriateness and reasonableness of our restructuring and lease loss accruals including the various assumptions noted above 
if actual results differ significantly from our estimates  we may be required to adjust our restructuring and lease loss accruals in the future 
litigation costs 
we are subject to the possibility of legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business 
we regularly monitor the status of pending legal actions to evaluate both the magnitude and likelihood of any potential loss 
we accrue for these potential losses when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss  or possible range of loss  can be reasonably estimated 
if actual results differ significantly from our estimates  we may be required to adjust our accruals in the future 
accounting for income taxes 
the determination of our tax provision is subject to judgments and estimates due to operations in several tax jurisdictions outside the united states 
sales to our international customers are principally taxed at rates that are lower than united states rates  resulting in a reduction of our effective tax rate 
the ability to maintain our current effective tax rate is contingent upon existing tax laws in both the united states and in the respective countries in which our international subsidiaries are located 
future changes in domestic or international tax laws could affect the continued realization of the tax benefits we are currently receiving and expect to receive from international sales 
in addition  a decrease in the percentage of our total revenue from international customers or in the mix of international revenue among particular tax jurisdictions could change our overall effective tax rate 
also  our current effective tax rate assumes that united states income taxes are not provided for undistributed earnings of certain non united states subsidiaries 
these earnings could become subject to united states federal and state income taxes and foreign withholding taxes  as applicable  should they be either deemed or actually remitted from our international subsidiaries to the united states 
the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets  which is made up primarily of income tax deductions and credits resulting from stock option exercises  assumes that we will be able to generate sufficient future income to fully utilize these tax deductions and credits 
if we do not generate sufficient future income  the realization of these deferred tax assets may be impaired resulting in additional income tax expense 
we evaluate the expected realization of our deferred tax assets and assess the need for valuation allowances quarterly

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and equity security prices 
interest rate risk our exposure to market risk due to changes in the general level of united states interest rates relates primarily to our cash equivalents and short term and long term investment portfolios 
our cash  cash equivalents  and short term and long term investments are primarily maintained at five major financial institutions in the united states 
as of october   we did not hold any derivative instruments 
the primary objective of our investment activities is the preservation of principal while maximizing investment income and minimizing risk 
the following table presents the hypothetical changes in fair values of our investments in debt securities issued by united states government agencies as of october  that are sensitive to changes in interest rates in thousands valuation of securities given an interest fair value valuation of securities given an interest rate decrease of x basis points as of rate increase of x basis points october  issuer bps bps bps bps bps bps us government obligations corporate bonds and notes total 
table of contents these instruments are not leveraged and are classified as available for sale 
the modeling technique used measures the change in fair values arising from selected potential changes in interest rates 
market changes reflect immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus basis points bps  bps  and bps  which are representative of the historical movements in the federal funds rate 
the following table in thousands presents our cash equivalents and short term and long term investments subject to interest rate risk and their related weighted average interest rates at october  carrying value approximates fair value 
average amount interest rate cash and cash equivalents short term investments long term investments total our convertible subordinated debt is subject to a fixed interest rate and the notes are based on a fixed conversion ratio into common stock 
therefore  we are not exposed to changes in interest rates related to our long term debt instruments 
the notes are not listed on any securities exchange or included in any automated quotation system  however  the notes are eligible for trading on the portal sm market 
on october   the average bid and ask price on the portal market of our convertible subordinated notes due was  resulting in an aggregate fair value of approximately million

equity security price risk our exposure to market risk due to equity security price fluctuations primarily relates to investments in marketable equity securities 
these investments are principally in companies in the volatile high technology sector 
we do not attempt to reduce or eliminate the market exposure on these securities 
adverse changes in equity prices of percent  percent  and percent would result in decreases of approximately   and  in the fair value of marketable equity securities at october   respectively
