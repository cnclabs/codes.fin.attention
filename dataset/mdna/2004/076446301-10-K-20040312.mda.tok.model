item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general we are a self administered and self managed equity real estate investment trust reit 
we own  manage  acquire  and develop industrial and suburban office properties proximate to metropolitan areas in the western united states 
as of december   we owned operating properties totaling approximately million rentable square feet and parcels of land totaling approximately acres 
of the operating properties  are industrial buildings and are suburban offices 
our properties and land are located in california  arizona  washington  colorado  oregon  and nevada 
the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes to financial statements included in this report 
market conditions the northwest region we believe that the puget sound area is still experiencing the effects of significant job loss resulting from the technology and telecommunication slowdown 
we also believe that these economic conditions have affected most commercial real estate markets causing excess space  both direct and sub lease  and weaker deal terms 
at december   our northwest portfolio was occupied with  square feet vacant in three properties 
we believe that this comparatively strong occupancy has insulated us from the worst effects of local market conditions in we have been notified by one of our tenants  who currently occupies approximately  square feet in this region  that it does not plan to renew its lease when it expires in february we have commenced a program to re position the asset and plan to introduce it to the market as a campus style office park in mid the northern california region our properties in northern california are located throughout the san francisco bay area and include one property in reno  nevada 
the bay area market has been impacted by the technology industry slowdown  particularly in the silicon valley area  where we own properties totaling  square feet 
in this sub market  we believe that the job loss associated with the recent recession has been significant  resulting in increased vacancy and reduced rental rates 
in addition  we expect higher than usual lease expirations in the silicon valley during the next two years  which create the potential for increasing vacancy in our portfolio 
in order to retain good credit tenants in the current market  we have engaged in a strategy to negotiate lower rental rates in exchange for extended lease terms  which we refer to as blend and extend leases 
another bay area sub market that has demonstrated weakness during the last two years is the south san francisco industrial market 
in this sub market  we have faced rental rate declines in renewals  and an increase in the vacancy rate of our five building portfolio from at the end of to at the end of other bay area sub markets have not been as dramatically affected as the fremont  milpitas  and san jose markets in silicon valley  and the south san francisco industrial market 
in sonoma county  napa county  and contra costa county  while demand has slowed during the past two years  vacancy rates have not climbed to the extent they have in the silicon valley 
the southern california region in southern california  we have properties in three relatively healthy sub markets 
these sub markets are orange county  san diego  and the inland empire 
we have two properties in orange county and have maintained them at  or close to  leased during in the inland empire  we have a bulk industrial property in ontario  california  which was leased on december  additionally  we have a new development  the jurupa business center phase i  which was leased as of december  finally  in san diego  we were occupied during the year 
in one of our san diego properties  we had a lease expiration in a  square foot single tenant building scheduled in june of  which we have successfully re leased 
the arizona region most of our properties in arizona are in phoenix  a market that has been characterized by the same weakness in demand for office  r d  and industrial space that we have experienced in our other regions 
we have responded to these challenges by improving our marketing processes and the marketability of our vacant spaces 
we are making capital improvements to our vacant spaces to render them to near move in condition for prospective tenants 
notwithstanding these efforts  however  leasing in phoenix remains a slow process  and we expect our vacant suites to remain vacant for longer periods than we have previously experienced 
the colorado region all of our properties in colorado are in the southeast denver suburban office market 
we believe that market conditions in denver reflect the job loss experienced during the last several years  similar to our other markets 
in july  we were successful in executing a significant lease with a large insurance company for the top two floors of our dtc boulevard property  representing of the total square footage of the building 
this ten story office property is leased to a single tenant under a lease that will expire on january   and that tenant has notified us that it does not plan to renew 
we are planning to make significant capital improvements to the property during in preparation of this anticipated vacancy 
future trends and events acquisitions during  we purchased five new properties totaling approximately million 
we plan to continue to seek out potential acquisition properties that meet our required capitalization rate and have stabilized rents 
while capitalization rates continue to remain low as the result of the large amount of capital available in the market place and the low cost of debt  we have been successful at identifying several properties that we believe will enhance our portfolio 
we plan to purchase an additional million in acquisitions during  however  this will be dependent upon the availability of properties that meet our requirements 
dispositions we currently do not have plans to dispose of any properties 
with the low capitalization rate market  however  we plan to continually evaluate potential sales as an exit and support strategy to our property acquisition and share repurchase programs 
development and redevelopment in response to decreasing demand for office and industrial space  our development activities over the past two years have been limited to our jurupa business center project in ontario  california 
as of february  the  square foot phase i was leased  and the  square foot phase ii  which was shell complete in december  was leased 
our board has authorized us to move forward with the final two phases  with construction of phases iii and iv expected to commence in early both phases will be constructed concurrently over an expected month period  taking advantage of the project momentum generated with the recent leasing activities of phases i and ii 
we estimate the total cost of construction of these two phases  including the purchase price of the land  to be approximately million 
in february  one of our larger tenants informed us that it did not intend to renew its lease upon expiration on february  this tenant occupies the entire  square feet of our five building facility in renton  washington 
we are currently planning the redevelopment of this property and expect to commence construction in march when the tenant vacates 
we expect the construction process for site work  shell enhancement  construction of lobbies  and the upgrade of common areas to take place over a month period 
the construction will be completed in phases  with the completion and leasing of some of the buildings occurring prior to the end of the month period 
we expect to incur costs between and million to renovate and re tenant the project 
share repurchases since the inception of our share repurchase program in november of  we have repurchased a total of  shares of our common stock at an average cost of per share  which represents of the shares of common stock outstanding at november we intend to continue to repurchase shares of our common stock on the open market when the opportunities exist 
our share repurchase strategy takes into consideration several factors  including the dividend yield on our stock price  the cost of capital and its alternative uses  existing yields on potential acquisitions  market trading volume  trading regulations  and debt covenants 
we currently have board approval to repurchase up to a total of million shares of our common stock 
occupancy and rental rates as of december   our portfolio was occupied  a decrease of one percentage point over the prior year 
occupancy has been our highest priority during this economic downturn 
in order to retain tenants in the current market  we sometimes find it necessary to negotiate lower rental rates in exchange for extended terms  which we refer to as blend and extend leases 
while this has a negative impact on our income from operations  we believe the impact of losing good credit tenants would surpass the incremental loss due to reduced rental rates 
during the year  we renewed or re leased of the expiring square footage and experienced a decline in weighted average rental rates on these leases 
we intend to continue this strategy of maximizing our occupancy until market conditions improve 
leasing during the years and  we successfully renewed or released and leases  respectively  or and of our expiring square footage  respectively 
over the next three years  we expect to face significant lease rollovers 
during the years   and  leases representing   and of annualized base rent  respectively  will expire 
of the expiring in  is due to the expiration of the lease of one of our largest tenants in renton  washington mentioned in the development and redevelopment section above 
the expirations as a percentage of annualized base rent by region are as follows northern california arizona southern california northwest colorado nevada total less than in order to be successful in sustaining our occupancy  we have developed a plan to focus our attention on a group of tenants 
at the time of implementation of the plan in the second quarter  these mighty ninety tenants represented approximately of our tenant population and over of our annualized base rent  with leases expiring through the end of for each of these tenants  we are taking a proactive approach by creating specific strategies for renewal  which may include blend and extend offers  early renewals  and other appropriate measures 
as of december   we had renewed or re leased of these leases  nine of which were blend and extend leases 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we believe that our critical accounting policies are those that require significant judgments and estimates such as those related to valuation of real estate investments  revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  stock compensation expense  deferred assets  and qualification as a reit 
these estimates are made and evaluated on an on going basis using information that is currently available as well as various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could vary from those estimates  and those estimates could be different under different assumptions or conditions 
real estate investments real estate investments are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation 
the cost of real estate includes purchase price  other acquisition costs  and costs to develop properties which include interest and real estate taxes 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas  business combinations  a portion of the purchase price is allocated to tenant improvements and identifiable intangible assets or liabilities 
for acquired properties with rental guarantees from the seller  amounts received under the rental guarantee are recorded as a reduction to the basis of the asset upon receipt 
expenditures for maintenance and repairs that do not add to the value or prolong the useful life of the property are expensed 
expenditures for asset replacements or significant improvements that extend the life or increase the property s value are capitalized 
real estate properties are depreciated using the straight line method over estimated useful lives 
when circumstances such as adverse market conditions indicate an impairment of a property  we will recognize a loss to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the property 
revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts base rental income is recognized on a straight line basis over the terms of the respective lease agreements 
differences between rental income recognized and amounts contractually due under the lease agreements are credited or charged  as applicable  to rent receivable 
the amount of straight line rent receivable is charged against income upon early termination of a lease or as a reduction of gain on sale of the property 
lease termination income is recorded in the period the lease terminates according to the lease termination agreement 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of tenants to make required payments  which results in a reduction to income 
management determines the adequacy of this allowance by continually evaluating individual tenant receivables considering the tenant s financial condition  security deposits  letters of credit  lease guarantees  and current economic co nditions 
stock compensation expense beginning january   we voluntarily adopted the recognition provisions of sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  using the modified prospective method as prescribed in sfas  accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of sfas the modified prospective method provides for the calculation of the compensation expense as if the fair value based accounting method had been used to account for all stock options granted in fiscal years after december  the impact of adopting sfas was an increase in compensation expense of  and  in the three and twelve months ended december   respectively 
deferred assets costs incurred for debt financing and property leasing are capitalized as other assets 
deferred loan costs include amounts paid to lenders and others to obtain financing 
such costs are amortized over the term of the related loan 
amortization of deferred financing costs is included in interest expense in our consolidated statements of income 
deferred leasing costs include leasing commissions that are amortized using the straight line method over the term of the related lease 
deferred leasing costs are included with the basis when a property is sold and therefore reduce the gain on sale 
unamortized financing and leasing costs are charged to expense in the event of debt prepayment or early termination of the lease 
qualification as a reit we have elected to be taxed as a reit under sections to of the internal revenue code of  as amended 
a reit is generally not subject to federal income tax on that portion of real estate investment trust taxable income that is distributed to stockholders  provided that at least of such taxable income is distributed and other requirements are met 
if we were to fail to qualify as a reit  we would be  among other things  required to provide for federal income taxes on our income and reduce the level of distributions made to our stockholders 
results of operations our operations consist of developing  owning  and operating industrial and suburban office properties located primarily in the western united states 
variances in revenues  expenses  net income  and cash flows for the twelve months ended december  when compared with the same period in were due primarily to the acquisition  development  and sale of operating properties as follows office properties industrial properties total operating properties number of properties square feet number of properties square feet number of properties square feet total at january  activity from january  through december  acquisitions sales total at december  activity from january  through december  acquisitions development total at december  income from property operations for sales has been recorded as discontinued operations and is excluded from the comparisons of income from property operations  rental income  and rental expenses discussed below

lower bad debt expense increased rental income in by an additional  rental expenses the net increase in rental expenses of  is primarily attributable to property acquisitions and stabilized properties 
the increase in operating expenses on stabilized properties of  is generally attributable to increases in depreciation and amortization  repairs and maintenance costs  and real estate taxes 
the increase in depreciation and amortization is due to a greater level of tenant improvement and lease commission spending required to obtain leases 
building maintenance has also been increased in order to attract potential tenants 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased  or in compared to  primarily as a result of increased compensation costs associated with the hiring of the employees of bedford acquisitions  inc  which increased compensation costs by approximately  the remaining increase is partially due to higher legal and accounting fees associated with new compliance requirements resulting from the sarbanes oxley act of interest expense interest expense  which includes amortization of loan fees  increased  or in compared to the increase is attributable to a higher level of weighted average outstanding debt in due to share repurchases and the funding of property acquisitions in the third and fourth quarters of  as well as increased amortization of loan fees 
the amortization of loan fees was  and  in and  respectively 
the increase in amortization of loan fees is primarily due to loan fees paid in connection with the million of mortgage financing obtained in discontinued operations in the second quarter  we sold three industrial properties in vista  california  one industrial property in san diego  california  and one industrial property in scottsdale  arizona for net sale prices totaling  which resulted in an aggregate gain of  net operating income relating to these properties is classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented

liquidity and capital resources liquidity we expect to fund the cost of acquisitions  capital expenditures  costs associated with lease renewals and re letting of space  repayment of indebtedness  share repurchases  development of properties  and dividends from cash flow from operations  borrowings under our credit facility and  if available  other indebtedness which may include indebtedness assumed in acquisitions  the sale of certain real estate investments  and preferred stock issuance 
our line of credit  which has a total commitment of million plus an accordion feature for expansion of million  had an outstanding balance of  and letters of credit issued and undrawn of  leaving  of available borrowing 
we anticipate utilizing this available borrowing as well as other potential sources of financing such as new mortgages and or preferred equity offerings to fund future acquisitions of approximately million  development costs of approximately to million  and capital expenditures of approximately million 
we are currently in the process of renegotiating our line of credit and expect to renew the facility at substantially similar terms 
we anticipate that the cash flow generated by our real estate investments and funds available under our credit facility will be sufficient to meet our short term liquidity requirements 
cash flows comparison of to operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was  and  for the twelve months ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease of  in cash flows from operating activities is primarily due to the following increase in cash flows increased rental receipts of  decreases in cash flows increased lease commission payments of  increased real estate tax payments of  increased general and administrative cost payments of  increased interest payments of  and increased change in tenant improvement liabilities of  resulting from the cash receipt of a  credit through escrow and the cash disbursement for  of this escrow credit 
investing activities net cash used by investing activities was  and  for the twelve months ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in cash used for investing activities of  is primarily due to the following increase in cash flows proceeds of  from sales of real estate investments 
decreases in cash flows increased investments in real estate of  and increased contract retention payments of  financing activities net cash provided by financing activities was  and  for the twelve months ended december  and  respectively 
the net increase in cash provided by financing activities of  is primarily due to the following increases in cash flows increased mortgage proceeds  net of loan costs  of  proceeds of  from our series a preferred stock offering in  and increased proceeds from the issuance of common stock of  decreases in cash flows increased net payments of  on our bank loans  increased payments on mortgages of  including the payoff of an million mortgage at maturity and a million early mortgage payoff  increased payments of  to repurchase and retire our common stock  and increased dividend payments of  comparison of to operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was  and  for the twelve months ended december  and  respectively

decreases in cash flows decreased mortgages proceeds  net of loan costs  of  payments for prepaid loan fees in of  increased payments for the redemption of operating partnership units of  and increased dividend payments of  debt financing our ability to continue to finance operations is subject to several uncertainties 
for example  our ability to obtain mortgage loans on income producing property is dependent upon our ability to attract and retain tenants and the economics of the various markets in which the properties are located  as well as the willingness of mortgage lending institutions to make loans secured by real property 
approximately of our real estate investments served as collateral for our existing indebtedness as of december  our ability to sell real estate investments is partially dependent upon the ability of purchasers to obtain financing at reasonable commercial rates 
we currently have a revolving credit facility with a bank group led by bank of america 
the facility  which matures on june   consists of a million secured line with an accordion feature that gives us the option to expand the facility to million  if needed 
interest on the facility is at a floating rate equal to either the lender s prime rate or libor plus a margin ranging from to  depending on our leverage level as defined in the credit agreement 
as of december   the facility had a total outstanding balance of  an effective interest rate of  and was secured by our interests in properties 
these properties collectively accounted for approximately of our annualized base rent and our total real estate assets as of december  we are currently in the process of renegotiating our revolving credit facility and anticipate that we will renew the line of credit at substantially similar terms 
in march  we obtained a  mortgage from teachers insurance and annuity association of america 
the loan has a ten year term and carries a fixed interest rate of 
proceeds from the mortgage financing were used to pay down a portion of the outstanding balance of our lines of credit and to replace an  mortgage from prudential insurance company of america  which matured in march and carried a fixed interest rate of in october and november  we secured two mortgages with bank of america for  and  these loans each have a ten year term and carry fixed interest rates of and  respectively 
the mortgages call for interest only payments for the first two years and principal and interest payments for the remainder of the loan term 
proceeds from the mortgages were used to finance property acquisitions and to pay down our secured credit facility 
in november  we obtained a  mortgage from jpmorgan chase bank 
the loan has a ten year term and carries a fixed interest rate of 
proceeds from the mortgage were used to finance the acquisition of the property collateralized by the loan 
in november  we obtained three mortgages from john hancock for an aggregate amount of  each of the mortgages has a seven year term and carries a fixed interest rate of 
these three mortgages call for interest only payments for the first four years and principal and interest payments for the remainder of the loan term 
in november  we obtained an additional three mortgages from john hancock for an aggregate amount of  each of these mortgages has a five year term and carries a fixed interest rate of 
these three mortgages call for interest only payments for the first three years and principal and interest payments for the remainder of the loan term 
the majority of the proceeds from the mortgages were used to finance property acquisitions and to pay down our secured credit facility 
proceeds of approximately  were used to pay off the remaining balance of a union bank loan with a floating rat e  which was at the time of the payoff

related party transactions in prior years  we used bedford acquisitions  inc bai  a corporation wholly owned by our chairman of the board and chief executive officer  peter bedford  to provide services for our acquisition  disposition  financing  and development activities 
these services were provided under an agreement that was terminated on july  upon termination of the agreement  we hired the employees of bai 
prior to the termination of the agreement  fees incurred for services provided during the three and six months ended june  were expensed to the extent that such fees did not represent payments to bai for direct and incremental development costs or independent third party costs incurred by bai on our behalf 
during the six months ended june   we paid bai approximately  for acquisition  disposition  financing  and development activities provided pursuant to the agreement 
as of december   we had a receivable of  for excess fees paid to bai  which was subsequently paid in january by bai 
we occasionally use the services of the law firm bartko  zankel  tarrant miller of which a member of our board of directors  martin i 
zankel  is a senior principal 
during the years ended december    and  we paid bartko  zankel  tarrant miller approximately   and  respectively 
off balance sheet arrangements at december  and  we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  including entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  that would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
therefore  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market  or credit risk that could arise if we were engaged in such relationships 
potential factors affecting future operating results many factors affect our actual financial performance and may cause our future results to be different from past performance or trends 
these factors include the following we could experience a reduction in rental income if we are unable to renew or re let space on expiring leases on current lease terms  or at all 
a significant portion of our leases is scheduled to expire in the near future 
as of december   leases representing    and of our total annualized base rent were scheduled to expire during    and  respectively 
if the rental rates upon re letting or renewal of leases were significantly lower than current rates  or if we were unable to lease a significant amount of space on economically favorable terms  or at all  our results of operations could suffer 
we are subject to the risk that  upon expiration  some of these or other leases will not be renewed  the space may not be re let  or the terms of renewal or re letting  including the costs of required renovations or concessions to tenants  may be less favorable than current lease terms 
we could face difficulties re letting our space on commercially acceptable terms when it becomes available 
in addition  we expect to incur costs in making improvements or repairs to our properties required by new or renewing tenants and expenses associated with brokerage commissions payable in connection with the re letting of space 
similarly  our rental income could be reduced by vacancies resulting from lease expirations or by rental rates that are less favorable than our current terms 
if we are unable to promptly renew leases or re let space or if the expenses relating to tenant turnover are greater than expected  our financial results could be harmed 
our leases with our largest tenants generate approximately of our base rent  and the loss of one or more of these tenants  as well as the inability to re lease this space on equivalent terms  could harm our results of operations 
as of december   our largest tenants accounted for approximately of our total annualized base rent 
one of these tenants  in renton  washington  representing approximately of our annualized base rent  has already notified us that it does not intend to renew its lease upon expiration in february additionally  we have been advised by another large tenant  in denver  colorado  that it will not renew the  square feet that it currently leases 
this tenant  whose lease expires on january   also represents approximately of our annualized base rent 
the re leasing of the footage in the renton and denver markets will require considerable capital expenditures and an indeterminate period of time 
further losses of our larger tenants and our inability to re lease the vacated properties on favorable terms could limit our ability to make distributions to our stockholders 
a significant portion of our base rent is generated by properties in california  and our business could be harmed by an economic downturn in the california real estate market or a significant earthquake 
as of december   approximately of our total annualized base rent was generated by our properties located in the state of california 
as a result of this geographic concentration  the performance of the commercial real estate markets and the local economies in various areas within california could affect the value of these properties and the rental income from these properties and  in turn  our results of operations 
in addition  the geographic concentration of our properties in california in close proximity to regions known for their seismic activity exposes us to the risk that our operating results could be harmed by a significant earthquake 
future declines in the demand for office and light industrial space in the greater san francisco bay area could harm our results of operations and  consequently  our ability to make distributions to our stockholders 
approximately of our net operating income for the twelve months ended december  was generated by our office properties and flex industrial properties located in the greater san francisco bay area 
as a result  our business is somewhat dependent on the condition of the san francisco bay area economy in general and the market for office space in the san francisco bay area in particular 
the market for this space in the san francisco bay area is in the midst of one of the most severe downturns of the past several decades 
this downturn has been precipitated by the unprecedented collapse of many technology and so called dot com businesses that  during the past several years  had been chiefly responsible for generating demand for and increased prices of local office properties 
this downturn has harmed  and may continue to harm  our results of operations 
for example  during the fourth quarter of  we experienced a decline in weighted average rental rates on new leases and renewed leases combined compared to the prior rents for these spaces 
this decline was primarily attributable to a decrease in the average rental rates that we were able to obtain on three new leases compared to the prior rents for these spaces 
excluding these three transactions  the average decline in rental rates would have been approximately for the quarter 
the largest of these leases is a  square foot space located in the silicon valley 
we expect that the silicon valley area as a whole may experience higher than usual lease turnover during the next two years  which may increase area vacancy rates and further depress market rents for commercial real estate 
in the event this downturn continues or economic conditions in the san francisco bay area worsen  it could harm the market value of our properties  the results derived from such properties and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders 
real estate investments are inherently risky  and many of the risks involved are beyond our ability to control 
real property investments are subject to numerous risks 
the yields available from an equity investment in real estate depend on the amount of income generated and costs incurred by the related properties 
if the properties in which we invest do not generate sufficient income to meet costs  including debt service  tenant improvements  third party leasing commissions  and capital expenditures  our results of operations and ability to make distributions to our stockholders could suffer 
revenues and values of our properties may also be harmed by a number of other factors  some of which are beyond our control  including the national economic climate  the local economic climate  local real estate conditions  including an oversupply of space or a reduction in demand for real estate in an area  the attractiveness of our properties to tenants  competition from other available space  our ability to provide adequate maintenance and insurance to cover other operating costs  government regulations and changes in real estate  zoning or tax laws  and interest rate levels  the availability of financing  and potential liabilities under environmental and other laws 
if our tenants experience financial difficulty or seek the protection of bankruptcy laws  our cash from operating activities could suffer 
our commercial tenants may  from time to time  experience downturns in their business operations and finances due to adverse economic conditions  which may result in their failure to make rental payments to us on a timely basis or at all 
missed rental payments  in the aggregate  could impair our cash flows and  as a result  our ability to make distributions to our stockholders 
at any time  a tenant could seek the protection of the bankruptcy laws  which might result in the modification or termination of the tenant s lease and cause a reduction in our cash flow 
during the twelve months ended december   three of our tenants  representing less than of our base rent  filed for bankruptcy 
in the event of default by or bankruptcy of a tenant  we may experience delays in enforcing our rights as lessor and may incur substantial costs in protecting our investment 
the default  bankruptcy  or insolvency of a major tenant may harm us and our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders 
our dependence on smaller businesses to rent office space could negatively affect our cash flow 
many of the tenants in our properties operate smaller businesses that may not have the financial strength of larger corporate tenants 
smaller companies generally experience a higher rate of failure and are generally more susceptible to financial risks than large  well capitalized enterprises 
dependence on these companies could create a higher risk of tenant defaults  turnover  and bankruptcies  all of which could harm our ability to pay dividends 
the acquisition and development of real estate is subject to numerous risks  and the cost of bringing any acquired property to standards for its intended market position could exceed our estimates 
a significant portion of our leases is scheduled to expire in   and to supplement the losses in net operating income caused by the leasing turnover  we have expanded our acquisitions program in  with new purchases totaling approximately million  and we expect to continue to focus on property acquisitions in the near future 
as a part of the acquisitions program  we may acquire industrial and suburban office properties and portfolios of these properties  which may include the acquisition of other companies and business entities owning the properties 
although we engage in due diligence review for each new acquisition  we may not be aware of all potential liabilities and problems associated with a property 
we may have limited contractual recourse  or no contractual recourse  against the sellers of a property 
in the future  we expect the majority of our properties and portfolios of properties to be acquired on an a s is basis  with limited recourse against the sellers 
in addition  our investments may fail to perform in accordance with our expectations 
further  estimates of the costs of improvements to bring an acquired property up to standards established for the market position intended for that property might prove inaccurate 
to the extent that we acquire properties with substantial vacancies  as we have in the past  we may be unable to lease vacant space in a timely manner or at all  and the costs of obtaining tenants  including tenant improvements  lease concessions  and brokerage commissions  could prove more costly than anticipated 
real estate development is subject to other risks  including the following the risks of difficult and complicated construction projects  the risks related to the use of contractors and subcontractors to perform all or substantially all construction activities  the risk of development delays  unanticipated increases in construction costs  environmental issues  and regulatory approvals  and financial risks relating to financing and construction loan difficulties 
additionally  the time frame required for development  construction  and lease up of these properties means that we may have to wait a few years or more for a significant cash return to be realized 
we may abandon development opportunities resulting in direct expenses to us 
from time to time  we may invest significant time and resources exploring development opportunities that we subsequently decide are not in our best interest 
the costs of investigating these opportunities will still be considered a direct expense and may harm our financial condition 
our uninsured or underinsured losses could result in a loss in value of our properties 
we currently maintain general liability coverage with primary limits of million per occurrence and million in the aggregate  as well as million of umbrella excess liability coverage 
this coverage protects us against liability claims as well as the cost of legal defense 
we carry property all risks insurance of million on a replacement value basis covering both the cost of direct physical damage and the loss of rental income 
separate flood and earthquake insurance is provided with an annual aggregate limit of million  subject to a deductible of of total insurable value per building and respective rent loss with respect to earthquake coverage 
additional excess earthquake coverage with an aggregate limit of million is provided for properties located in california  which represent approximately of our portfolio s annual base rent 
we also carry additional excess earthquake insurance with an agg regate limit of million for properties located in washington 
some losses  including those due to acts of war  nuclear accidents  pollution  mold  or terrorism  may be either uninsurable or not economically insurable 
however  we do presently carry insurance for terrorism losses as defined under the terrorism risk insurance act of under our all risks property policies  liability policies  primary and umbrella excess policies 
in addition  non certified terrorism coverage is provided under our property policy for losses in excess of million up to the million limit 
some losses could exceed the limits of our insurance policies or could cause us to bear a substantial portion of those losses due to deductibles under those policies 
if we suffer an uninsured loss  we could lose both our invested capital in and anticipated cash flow from the property while being obligated to repay any outstanding indebtedness incurred to acquire the property 
in addition  a majority of our properties are located in areas that are subject to earthquake activity 
although we have obtained earthquake insurance policies for all of our properties  if one or more properties sustain damage as a result of an earthquake  we may incur substantial losses up to the amount of the deductible under the earthquake policy and  additionally  to the extent that the damage exceeds the policy s maximum coverage  we would not have insurance compensation for that portion of the losses 
although we have obtained owner s title insurance poli cies for each of our properties  the title insurance may be in an amount less than the current market value of some of the properties 
if a title defect results in a loss that exceeds insured limits  we could lose all or part of our investment in  and anticipated gains  if any  from  the property 
furthermore  the current insurance market is characterized by rising premium rates  increasing deductibles  and more restrictive coverage language 
continued increases in the costs of insurance coverage or increased limits or exclusions in insurance policy coverage could negatively affect our financial results 
if we fail to maintain our qualification as a real estate investment trust  we could experience adverse tax and other consequences  including the loss of deductibility of dividends in calculating our taxable income and the imposition of federal income tax at regular corporate rates 
we have elected to qualify as a real estate investment trust reit under sections to of the internal revenue code of  as amended 
we believe that we have been organized and have operated in a manner so as to have satisfied the reit qualification requirements since however  the irs could challenge our qualification as a reit for taxable years still subject to audit  and we may fail to qualify as a reit in the future 
qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex tax provisions  and the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control may have an impact on our ability to maintain our qualification as a reit 
for example  in order to qualify as a reit  at least of our gross income in any year must be derived from qualifying sources and we must make distributions to stockholders aggregating annually at least of our reit taxable income  excluding net capital gains 
in addition  we cannot assure you that new legislation  treasury regulations  administrative interpretations  or court decisions will not significantly change the tax laws with respect to our qualification as a reit or the federal income tax consequences of such qualification 
we are not aware of any proposal to amend the tax laws that would significantly and negatively affect our ability to continue to operate as a reit 
if we fail to maintain our qualification as a reit  or are found not to have qualified as a reit for any prior year  we would not be entitled to deduct dividends paid to our stockholders and would be subject to federal income tax  including any applicable alternative minimum tax  on our taxable income at regular corporate rates 
in addition  unless entitled to statutory relief  we would also be disqualified from treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification was lost 
this treatment would reduce amounts available for investment or distribution to stockholders because of any additional tax liability for the year or years involved 
in addition  we would no longer be required by the internal revenue code to make any distributions 
as a result  disqualification as a reit would harm us and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders 
to the extent that distributions to stockholders have been ma de in anticipation of our qualification as a reit  we might be required to borrow funds or to liquidate investments to pay the applicable tax 
we must comply with strict income distribution requirements to maintain favorable tax treatment as a reit 
if our cash flow is insufficient to meet our operating expenses and the distribution requirements  we may need to incur additional borrowings or otherwise obtain funds to satisfy these requirements 
to maintain reit status  we are required each year to distribute to our stockholders at least of our reit taxable income  excluding net capital gains 
in addition  we are subject to a nondeductible excise tax on the amount  if any  by which distributions paid by us in any calendar year are less than the sum of of our ordinary income and of our capital gain net income for the calendar year plus any amount of such income not distributed in prior years 
although we anticipate that cash flow from operations will be sufficient to pay our operating expenses and meet the distribution requirements  we cannot assure you that this will occur  and we may need to incur borrowings or otherwise obtain funds to satisfy the distribution requirements associated with maintaining the reit qualification 
in addition  differences in timing between the receipt of income and payment of expenses in arriving at our taxable income could require us to incu r borrowings or otherwise obtain funds to meet the distribution requirements necessary to maintain our qualification as a reit 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to borrow funds or otherwise obtain funds if and when necessary to satisfy these requirements 
as a reit  we are subject to complex constructive ownership rules that limit any holder to in value of our outstanding common and preferred stock  taken together 
any shares transferred in violation of this rule are subject to redemption by us and any such transaction is voidable 
to maintain reit qualification  our charter provides that no holder is permitted to own more than in value of our outstanding common and preferred stock  taken together  or more than in value or number of our outstanding common stock 
in addition  no holder is permitted to own any shares of any class of our stock if that ownership would cause more than in value of our outstanding common and preferred stock  taken together  to be owned by five or fewer individuals  would result in our stock being beneficially owned by less than persons or would otherwise result in our failure to qualify as a reit 
acquisition or ownership of our common or preferred stock in violation of these restrictions results in automatic transfer of the stock to a trust for the benefit of a charitable beneficiary or  under specified circumstances  the violative transfer may be deemed void or we may choose to redeem the violative shares 
peter b 
bed ford is subject to higher ownership limitations than our other stockholders 
specifically  mr 
bedford is not permitted to own more than of the lesser of the number or value of the outstanding shares of our common stock 
the ownership limitations described above are applied using the constructive ownership rules of the internal revenue code 
these rules are complex and may cause common or preferred stock owned beneficially or constructively by a group of related individuals and or entities to be constructively owned by one individual or entity 
as a result  the acquisition of less than of our outstanding common or preferred stock or the acquisition of an interest in an entity that owns our common or preferred stock by an individual or entity could cause that individual or entity or another individual or entity to constructively own stock in excess of the limits and subject that stock to the ownership restrictions in our charter 
we rely on the services of our key personnel  particularly our chief executive officer  and their expertise and knowledge of our business would be difficult to replace 
we are highly dependent on the efforts of our senior officers 
while we believe that we could find suitable replacements for these key personnel  the loss of their services could harm our business 
in addition  our credit facility provides that it is an event of default if mr 
bedford ceases for any reason to be our chairman or chief executive officer and a replacement reasonably satisfactory to the lenders has not been appointed by our board of directors within six months 
we have entered into an amended employment agreement with mr 
bedford pursuant to which he will serve as chairman of the board and chief executive officer on a substantially full time basis until the agreement is terminated by the board of directors 
the commercial real estate industry is highly competitive  and we compete with companies  including reits  that may be able to purchase properties at lower capitalization rates than would be accretive for us 
we seek to grow our asset base through the acquisition of industrial and suburban office properties and portfolios of these properties  as well as through the development of new industrial and suburban office properties 
many real estate companies  including other reits  compete with us in making bids to acquire new properties 
the level of competition to acquire income producing properties is largely measured by the capitalization rates at which properties are trading 
the capitalization rate is the annual yield that property produces on the investment 
currently  capitalization rates are low due to the amount of capital available for investment and attractive debt financing terms 
as a result  we may not be able to compete effectively with companies  including reits  that may be able to purchase properties at lower capitalization rates than would be accretive for us 
many of our properties are located in markets with an oversupply of space  and our ability to compete effectively with other properties to attract tenants may be limited to the extent that competing properties may be newer  better capitalized or in more desirable locations than our properties 
numerous industrial and suburban office properties compete with our properties in attracting tenants 
some of these competing properties are newer  better located  or better capitalized than our properties 
many of our investments are located in markets that have a significant supply of available space  resulting in intense competition for tenants and lower rents 
we believe the oversupply of available space relative to demand is likely to increase in the near to intermediate term due to the softening us economy 
the number of competitive properties in a particular area could negatively impact our ability to lease space in the properties or at newly acquired or developed properties 
we could incur costs from environmental liabilities even though we did not cause  contribute to  or know about them 
under various federal  state  and local laws  ordinances and regulations  an owner or operator of real estate may be held liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances released on  above  under or in a property 
these laws often impose liability regardless of whether the owner knew of  or was responsible for  the presence of the hazardous or toxic substances 
in addition  environmental laws often impose liability on a previous owner of property for hazardous or toxic substances present during the prior ownership period 
a transfer of the property may not relieve an owner of all liability 
accordingly  we could be liable for properties previously sold or otherwise divested 
the costs of removal or remediation could be substantial 
additionally  the presence of the substances  or the failure to properly remove them  may harm our ability to borrow using the real estate as collateral 
all of our properties have had phase i environmental site assessments  which involve inspection without soil sampling or groundwater analysis  by independent environmental consultants and have been inspected for hazardous materials as part of our acquisition inspections 
none of the phase i assessments has revealed any environmental problems requiring material costs for clean up 
the phase i assessment for milpitas town center  however  indicates that the groundwater under that property either has been or may in the future be  impacted by the migration of contaminants originating off site 
according to information available to us  the responsible party for this offsite source has been identified and has begun clean up 
we do not believe that this environmental matter will impair the future value of milpitas town center in any significant respect or that we will be required to fund any portion of the cost of remediation 
we cannot assure you  ho wever  that these phase i assessments or our inspections have revealed all environmental liabilities and problems relating to our properties 
we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with all federal  state  and local laws regarding hazardous or toxic substances 
to date  compliance with federal  state  and local environmental protection regulations has not had a material effect on us 
however  we cannot assure you that costs relating to the investigation and remediation of environmental issues for properties currently or previously owned by us  or properties that we may acquire in the future  or other expenditures or liabilities  including claims by private parties  resulting from hazardous substances present in  on  under  or above the properties or resulting from circumstances or other actions or claims relating to environmental matters  will not harm us and our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders 
costs associated with moisture infiltration and resulting mold remediation may be significant 
concern about indoor exposure to mold  fungi  and mycotoxins has been increasing because this exposure is allegedly linked to various adverse effects on health 
increasingly  insurance companies are excluding mold related risks from their policy coverage  and it is now excluded from our coverage 
costs and potential liability stemming from tenant exposure to mold and the increased costs of renovating and remodeling buildings with exposure to mold could harm our financial position and results 
we could incur unanticipated costs to comply with the americans with disabilities act  and any non compliance could result in fines 
under the americans with disabilities act the ada  all public accommodations and commercial facilities are required to meet federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons 
compliance with the ada requires removal of access barriers  and any non compliance may result in the imposition of fines by the us government or an award of damages to private litigants 
although we believe that our properties are substantially in compliance with these requirements  in the future we may incur costs to comply with the ada with respect to both existing properties and properties acquired in the future  which could limit our ability to make distributions to stockholders 
we are subject to numerous federal  state  and local regulatory requirements  and any changes to existing regulations or new laws may result in significant  unanticipated costs 
our properties are  and any properties we may acquire in the future will be  subject to various other federal  state  and local regulatory requirements  including local building codes 
failure to comply with these requirements could result in the imposition of fines by governmental authorities or awards of damages to private litigants 
we believe that our properties are currently in substantial compliance with all applicable regulatory requirements  although expenditures at properties owned by us may be necessary to comply with changes in these laws 
although no material expenditures are contemplated at this time to comply with any laws or regulations  we cannot assure you that these requirements will not be changed or that new requirements will not be imposed that would require significant unanticipated expenditures by us  which could harm us and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders 
similarly  changes in laws increasing the p otential liability for environmental conditions existing on our properties could result in significant unanticipated expenditures 
our million credit agreement and our mortgage loans are collateralized by approximately of our total real estate assets  and in the event of default under any of these debt instruments  our lenders could foreclose on the collateral securing this indebtedness 
as of december   our million credit facility was secured by mortgages on properties that accounted for approximately of our annualized base rent and approximately of our total real estate assets 
all of our mortgage loans were collateralized by properties that accounted for approximately of our annualized base rent and approximately of our total real estate assets 
if we fail to meet our obligations under the credit facility  the mortgage loans  or any other debt instruments we may enter into from time to time  including failure to comply with financial covenants  the holders of this indebtedness generally would be entitled to demand immediate repayment of the principal and to foreclose upon any collateral securing this indebtedness 
in addition  default under or acceleration of any debt instrument could  pursuant to cross default clauses  cause or permit the acceleration of other indebtedness 
any default or acceleration would harm us  jeopardizing our qualification as a reit and threatening our continued viability 
our million credit agreement and some of our mortgage loans carry floating interest rates  and increases in market interest rates could harm our results of operations 
as of december   our million credit facility had an outstanding balance of million  and we had other floating rate loans of million 
borrowings under our credit facility bear interest at a floating rate  and we may from time to time incur or assume other indebtedness also bearing interest at a floating rate 
in that regard  our results of operations for have benefited from low levels of interest rates that are currently near historic lows 
should this trend in interest rates reverse itself  our operating results could be harmed 
we use borrowings to finance the acquisition  development and operation of properties and to repurchase our common stock  and we cannot assure you that financing will be available on commercially reasonable terms  or at all  in the future 
we borrow money to pay for the acquisition  development  and operation of our properties  to repurchase our common stock  and for other general corporate purposes 
our credit facility currently expires on june   when the principal amount of all outstanding borrowings must be paid 
since the term of our credit facility is limited  our ability to fund acquisitions and provide funds for working capital and other cash needs following the expiration or utilization of the credit facility will depend primarily on our ability to obtain additional private or public equity or debt financing 
a downturn in the economy could make it difficult for us to borrow money on favorable terms 
if we are unable to borrow money on favorable terms  we may need to sell some of our assets at unfavorable prices in order to pay our loans 
we could encounter several problems  including insufficient cash flow to meet required payments of principal and interest  an increase on variable interest rates on indebtedness  and an inability to refinance existing indebtedness on favorable terms or at all 
our leverage could harm our ability to operate our business and fulfill our debt obligations 
we have significant debt service obligations 
as of december   we had total liabilities of approximately million  excluding unused commitments under our credit facility  and total stockholders equity of approximately million 
payments to service this debt totaled approximately million during the twelve months ended december  our debt level increases the possibility that we could be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay the principal of  interest on  or other amounts due in respect of our indebtedness 
in addition  we may incur additional debt from time to time to fund our stock buy back program  finance strategic acquisitions  investments  or for other purposes  subject to the restrictions contained in our debt instruments 
we have not used derivatives extensively to mitigate our interest rate risks 
historically  we have not used interest rate swaps  caps and floors  or other derivative transactions extensively to help us mitigate our interest rate risks because we have determined that the cost of these transactions outweighed their potential benefits and could have  in some cases  jeopardized our status as a reit 
generally  income from derivative transactions qualifies for purposes of the gross income test but not for purposes of the gross income test 
we have entered into swap agreements to hedge our exposure to variable interest rates on two mortgages with remaining principal balances of approximately million as of december  even if we were to use derivative transactions more extensively  we would not be fully insulated from the prepayment and interest rate risks to which we are exposed 
however  we do not have any policy that prohibits us from using derivative transactions or other hedging strategies more extensiv ely in the future 
if we do engage in additional derivative transactions in the future  we cannot assure you that a liquid secondary market will exist for any instruments purchased or sold in those transactions  and we may be required to maintain a position until exercise or expiration  which could result in losses 
we may change our policies without stockholder approval 
our major policies  including those concerning our qualification as a reit and with respect to dividends  acquisitions  debt  and investments  are established by our board of directors 
although it has no present intention to do so  the board of directors may amend or revise these and other policies from time to time without a vote of or advance notice to our stockholders 
accordingly  holders of our capital stock will have no control over changes in our policies  including any policies relating to the payment of dividends or to maintaining qualification as a reit 
in addition  policy changes could harm our financial condition  results of operations  the price of our securities  or our ability to pay dividends 
recently enacted us federal income tax legislation reduces the maximum tax rates applicable to corporate dividends from to  which may make investments in corporations relatively more attractive than investments in reits and negatively affect our stock price as a result 
the jobs and growth tax relief reconciliation act of reduces the tax rates applicable to corporate dividends  in the case of individual taxpayers  from as high as to through december  the reduced maximum rate imposed on some corporate dividends implemented by the jobs and growth tax relief reconciliation act of does not  however  generally apply to ordinary dividends paid by reits 
we do not presently expect that ordinary dividends paid by us will be eligible for the reduced tax rate on dividends 
this change in the maximum tax rate on qualifying dividends may make investments in corporate stock relatively more attractive than investments in reits  which could harm our stock price 
an increase in market interest rates could cause the respective prices of our common stock and preferred stock to decrease 
one of the factors that may influence the respective market prices of our shares of common stock and preferred stock will be the annual dividend yield on the price paid for shares of our common stock or preferred stock as compared to yields on other financial instruments 
an increase in market interest rates may lead prospective purchasers of our stock to seek a higher annual yield from their investments  which may adversely affect the respective market prices of our common stock and preferred stock 
as of december   interest rates in the us were near their historic lows 
we may incur additional indebtedness  which may harm our financial position and cash flow and potentially impact our ability to pay dividends 
our governing documents and existing debt instruments do not limit us from incurring additional indebtedness and other liabilities 
as of december   we had approximately million of indebtedness outstanding 
we may incur additional indebtedness and become more highly leveraged  which could harm our financial position and potentially limit our cash available to pay dividends 
as a result  we may not have sufficient funds to satisfy our dividend obligations relating to the series a preferred stock or pay dividends on our common stock  if we assume additional indebtedness 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to pay dividends regularly although we have done so in the past 
our ability to pay dividends in the future is dependent on our ability to operate profitably and to generate cash from our operations 
although we have done so in the past  we cannot guarantee that we will be able to pay dividends on a regular quarterly basis in the future 
furthermore  any new shares of common stock issued will substantially increase the cash required to continue to pay cash dividends at current levels 
any common stock or preferred stock that may in the future be issued to finance acquisitions  upon exercise of stock options or otherwise would have a similar effect 
in addition  our existing credit facility limits our ability to pay quarterly dividends to stockholders 
our ability to pay dividends is further limited by the requirements of maryland law 
our ability to pay dividends on our common stock and preferred stock is further limited by the laws of maryland 
under the maryland general corporation law  a maryland corporation may not make a distribution if  after giving effect to the distribution  either the corporation would not be able to pay indebtedness of the corporation as the indebtedness becomes due in the usual course of business or the corporation s total assets would be less than the sum of the corporation s total liabilities plus the amount that would be needed  if the corporation were to be dissolved at the time of distribution  to satisfy the preferential rights upon dissolution of stockholders whose preferential rights are superior to those receiving the distribution 
accordingly  we cannot make a distribution  except by dividend  on our common stock or preferred stock if  after giving effect to the distribution  our total assets would be less than the sum of our l iabilities plus the amount that would be needed to satisfy the preferential rights upon dissolution of the holders of any shares of preferred stock then outstanding  or if we would not be able to pay our indebtedness as it became due 
financial performance our funds from operations ffo during the three and twelve months ended december  was  and  respectively 
during the same periods in  our ffo was  and  respectively 
although ffo is not a financial measure calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap  we believe that ffo may be an appropriate alternative measure of the performance of an equity reit 
presentation of this information provides the reader with an additional measure to compare the performance of equity reits 
ffo is generally defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts as net income loss computed in accordance with gaap  excluding extraordinary items and gains losses from sales of property  plus depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
we computed our ffo in accordance with this definition 
ffo does not represent cash generated by operating activities in accordance with gaap  it is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs and should not be considered as an alternative to net income loss as an indicator of our operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity 
furthermore  ffo as disclosed by other reits may not be comparable to our presentation 
the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with gaap to ffo is net income loss 
the following table sets forth a reconciliation of the differences between our ffo and our net income available to common stockholders for each of the three and twelve months ended december  and three months ended december  twelve months ended december  funds from operations in thousands  except share amounts net income available to common shareholders adjustments depreciation and amortization continuing operations discontinued operations gain on sale of operating properties funds from operations weighted average number of shares diluted item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to interest rate changes primarily as a result of our line of credit and long term debt used to maintain liquidity and fund capital expenditures and expansion of our real estate investment portfolio and operations 
our interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs 
to achieve these objectives  we balance our borrowings between fixed and variable rate debt 
during  we significantly increased our level of fixed rate debt to take advantage of historically low interest rates 
while we have entered into interest swap agreements to minimize our exposure to interest rate fluctuations  we do not enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes 
we monitor our interest rate risk using a variety of techniques 
the table below presents the principal amounts and related weighted average annual interest rates by year of expected maturity to evaluate the expected cash flows and sensitivity to interest rate changes dollars in thousands twelve month period ending december  thereafter total fair value variable rate libor debt weighted average interest rate fixed rate debt weighted average interest rate as the table incorporates only those exposures that existed as of december   it does not consider those exposures or positions that could arise after that date 
moreover  because firm commitments are not presented in the table above  the information presented has limited predictive value 
as a result  our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations would depend on the exposures that arise during the period  our hedging strategies at that time  and interest rates 
in july  we entered into an interest swap agreement with bank of america  na on our two floating rate mortgages with security life of denver insurance company 
the agreement  which commenced on july  and terminates on september   exchanges a floating rate of day libor for a fixed rate of on a notional amount of million for the first months  million in  and million in through the expiration date 
interest rate pay differentials that arise under this swap agreement are recognized in interest expense over the term of the contract 
this interest rate swap agreement was considered to be fully effective in hedging the variable rate risk associated with the two mortgages 
the following table summarizes the notional value and fair value of our interest swap contract 
the notional value below provides an indication of the amount that has been hedged in this contract but does not represent an obligation or exposure to credit risk at december  dollars in thousands notional amount fixed rate contract maturity cumulative cash paid  net fair value of asset at december  september  to determine the fair values of derivative instruments in accordance with sfas  we use the discounted cash flow method  which requires the use of assumptions about market conditions and risks existing at the balance sheet date 
judgment is required in interpreting market data to develop estimates of market value 
accordingly  estimated fair value is a general approximation of value  and such value may or may not actually be realized
