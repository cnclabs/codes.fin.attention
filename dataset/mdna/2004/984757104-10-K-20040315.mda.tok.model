item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to inventories  restructuring costs  bad debts  intangible assets  income taxes  debt service and contingencies and litigation 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about operating results and the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  involve its more significant estimates and judgments and are therefore particularly important to an understanding of our results of operations and financial position 
revenue receivables we sell our products both directly to retail customers and through wholesale channels 
revenue from the sale of merchandise to retail customers is recognized at the time of sale  while revenue from wholesale customers is recognized when risk of loss has passed to the customers 
we believe that this is the time that persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed and determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
revenue is recognized net of any applicable discounts and allowances 
customers  be they retail or wholesale  do have the right to return product to us in certain limited situations 
such rights of return have not precluded revenue recognition because we have a long history with such returns  which we use in constructing a reserve 
this reserve  however  is subject to change 
in addition to returns  we bear credit risk relative to our wholesale customers 
we have provided a reserve for bad debts in our financial statements based on our estimates of the creditworthiness of our customers 
however  this reserve is also subject to change 
changes in these reserves could affect our operating results 
inventory we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory in an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value  based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
in addition  our inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market on a last in first out lifo basis 
fluctuations in inventory levels along with the cost of raw materials could impact the carrying value of our inventory 
changes in the carrying value of inventory could affect our operating results 

table of contents taxes we have a significant deferred tax asset recorded on our financial statements 
this asset arose at the time of our recapitalization in and is a future tax deduction for us 
the recoverability of this future tax deduction is dependent upon our future profitability 
we have made an assessment that this asset is likely to be recovered and is appropriately reflected on the balance sheet 
should we find that we are not able to utilize this deduction in the future we would have to record a reserve for all or a part of this asset  which would adversely affect our operating results and cash flows 
restructuring reserve in fiscal we closed our distribution facility in utah  recorded a restructuring charge and established a reserve for future expenses related to the restructuring 
part of the restructuring charge related to the lease commitment that we have through in connection with the restructuring we did not record the entire lease commitment as a liability because we believed we would be able to sublet the facility 
during the second quarter of fiscal we were successful in subletting the facility for the remaining lease term 
if the facility were to be vacated by the current tenant in breach of its sublease this would negatively affect our results of operations and cash flows 
value of long lived assets  including intangibles long lived assets on our balance sheet consist primarily of property  plant and equipment and trademarks 
we periodically review the carrying value of all of these assets based  in part  upon our projections of anticipated undiscounted future cash flows 
we undertake this review when facts and circumstances suggest that cash flows emanating from those assets may be diminished 
any impairment charge that we record reduces our earnings 
while we believe that our future estimates are reasonable  different assumptions regarding items such as future cash flows and the volatility inherent in markets which we serve could affect our evaluations and result in impairment charges against the carrying value of those assets 
stock based compensation effective in  we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation 
under the prospective transition method selected by us  as described in sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  an amendment of sfas no 
 all stock option grants beginning with grants made in fiscal are being expensed over the vesting period  based on the fair value at the date of the grant 
fair value is determined based on a variety of factors  all of which are estimates subject to judgment 
changes in estimated lives of options  risk free interest rates or exercise patterns could impact our results of operations 
we recorded a charge of approximately million for the fifty three weeks ended january  performance measures we measure the performance of our retail and wholesale segments through a segment margin calculation  which specifically identifies not only gross profit on the sales of products through the two channels but also costs and expenses specifically related to each segment 

table of contents fluctuations in quarterly operating results we have experienced  and may experience in the future  fluctuations in our quarterly operating results 
there are numerous factors that can contribute to these fluctuations  however  the principal factors are seasonality and new store openings 
seasonality 
we have historically realized higher revenues and operating income in our fourth quarter  particularly in our retail business 
we believe that this has been due primarily to the increase in the number of our retail stores and to increased sales in the giftware industry during the holiday season of the fourth quarter 
new store openings 
the timing of our new store openings may also have an impact on our quarterly results 
first  we incur certain one time expenses related to opening each new store 
these expenses  which consist primarily of salaries  supplies and marketing costs  are expensed as incurred 
second  most store expenses vary proportionately with sales  but there is a fixed cost component 
this typically results in lower store profitability when a new store opens because new stores generally have lower sales than mature stores 
due to both of these factors  during periods when new store openings as a percentage of the base are higher  operating profit may decline in dollars and or as a percentage of sales 
as the overall store base matures  the fixed cost component of selling expenses is spread over an increased level of sales  assuming sales increase as stores age  resulting in a decrease in selling and other expenses as a percentage of sales 
fifty three weeks ended january  compared to fifty two weeks ended december  general the fiscal year ended january  consisted of weeks  while the fiscal years ended december  and december  consisted of weeks 
sales sales increased to million in from million in the additional rd week in contributed million and million in retail and wholesale sales  respectively 
wholesale sales  including european operations  increased to million in from million for this growth was achieved primarily by increasing sales to existing customers and to a lesser extent by increasing the number of wholesale locations 
retail sales increased to million in from million for there were retail stores open as of january  compared to stores open at december  the increase in retail sales was achieved primarily through the addition of new stores in and to a lesser extent increased sales in the stores opened in which in were open for less than a full year  partially offset by a decrease in comparable store sales 
comparable store and catalog and internet sales in decreased compared to retail comparable store sales in decreased compared to we believe the primary factor contributing to the decrease in comparable store sales was a decline in store traffic  and mall traffic generally 
comparable store sales were also negatively impacted in due to the president s day february snowstorm which affected most of our store base in the eastern half of the united states and successive weekend snowstorms in early december 
comparable store sales represent a comparison of the sales  during the corresponding fiscal periods of the two fiscal years compared  of the stores included in our comparable store sales base 
a store first enters our comparable store sales base after completing fiscal months of operation 
there were stores included in the comparable store base at the end of  and of these stores were included for less than a full year

immature stores are generally stores that are less than four years old 
immature stores typically generate higher selling expenses as a percentage of sales than stores that have been open for more than four years since fixed costs  as a percent of sales  are higher during the early sales maturation period 
the increase in selling expense as a percentage of sales for is also explained by the decrease in retail comparable store sales since the fixed components of labor and occupancy do not decrease with negative comparable store sales 
selling expenses were also unfavorably impacted by the million bad debt provision the company recognized in the fourth quarter of related to the failure of our former canadian distributor to pay to us amounts due and payable for product shipped

general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses  which consist primarily of personnel related costs  increased to million in from million in as a percentage of sales  general and administrative expenses increased to from 
the increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to headcount additions in the latter part of and in  consulting costs related to a strategic planning project that began in late february  stock option expense  profit sharing expense and to a lesser extent increased insurance costs associated with the company s directors and officers insurance policy

the decrease in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales for fiscal was primarily attributable to our ability to leverage these expenses over a larger sales base and our continued focus on expense control

table of contents restructuring charge a restructuring charge for million was recorded in fiscal to record costs associated with our decision to consolidate and restructure our distribution and manufacturing operations 
we closed our utah distribution facility and restructured our distribution and manufacturing work force during included in the restructuring charge are severance and other employee related costs   of a non cash write down of non recoverable leasehold improvements  fixture and equipment investments and estimated continuing occupancy expenses for abandoned facilities  net of anticipated sub lease income 
as a result of this consolidation and restructuring  the company terminated approximately manufacturing and logistics employees

management believes that the remaining reserve at january  appropriately reflects the company s remaining lease commitment exposure 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources we have consistently generated positive cash flow from operations 
specifically  over the last three fiscal years we have generated a total cash flow of approximately million  including approximately million in these amounts have exceeded net income in all the fiscal years presented due to two factors 
first  we have incurred non cash charges for depreciation and amortization 
second  income tax expense has significantly exceeded taxes actually paid owing to the tax deduction that we continue to utilize that arose from the recapitalization 
this tax deduction is expected to continue to provide an annual cash benefit for the next ten years 
on an annual basis  this results in tax savings of approximately million per year through assuming sufficient income to realize the full benefit of this deduction 
these internally generated cash flows have been sufficient to fund necessary capital expenditures for our expansion plans 
capital expenditures in were million and were primarily related to the capital requirements to open new stores and investments in manufacturing and logistics operations 
capital expenditures were approximately million in and primarily related to similar expenditures 
we anticipate that capital expenditures in will total approximately million and will be spent in a similar manner as in we plan to open approximately new stores in despite significant capital expenditures  and our repurchase of million of our common stock pursuant to our stock repurchase program discussed below  operating cash flows have also provided sufficient cash to fund both repayments of our term loan and borrowings under our credit facility 
we currently have a credit agreement with a consortium of banks that was established at the time of our initial public offering 
this credit agreement provides for an initial maximum borrowing of million and consists of a revolving credit facility for million and a term loan for million 
we can elect to set the interest rates on all or a portion of the borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement at a rate per annum equal to a the greatest of the prime rate  the base cd rate plus or the federal funds effective rate plus  plus a margin ranging from to  or b the eurodollar rate plus a margin ranging from to 
the weighted average interest rate on outstanding borrowings at january  was 
our credit agreement requires that we comply with several financial and other covenants  including requirements that we maintain at the end of each fiscal quarter the following financial ratios as set forth in our credit agreement a consolidated total debt to consolidated ebitda ratio of no more than to at january  and for subsequent fiscal quarters at january  this ratio was to 
a fixed charge coverage ratio the ratio of the sum of consolidated ebitda plus lease expense to the sum of consolidated cash interest expense plus lease expense of no less than to at january  and for subsequent fiscal quarters at january  this ratio was to our credit agreement defines ebitda as our consolidated net income excluding extraordinary gains  and gains and losses from material dispositions  plus the amount of net interest expense  depreciation and amortization  income taxes  certain non cash compensation expenses  and certain rental expenses 
ebitda as defined in our credit agreement differs from the definition of ebitda used elsewhere herein  in that it excludes gains and losses from dispositions of material assets and non cash compensation expense 
we have included the amount of these expenses in our more conservative calculation of ebitda used elsewhere  which calculation is therefore lower than ebitda as used in our credit agreement 
this credit arrangement matures in july and we have accordingly classified all our debt as current on our balance sheet 
no payments of principal are due on the revolving credit facility until this maturity date 
the term loan is payable in quarterly installments 
in  the remaining two term loan payments of million 
table of contents each will be made in march and june 
as of january   million was outstanding under the revolving credit facility  leaving million in availability 
as of january   we were in compliance with all covenants under our credit facility 
we are currently engaged in negotiations with various commercial banks to replace our existing credit agreement with a new credit facility 
we are optimistic that a new credit facility will be finalized and in place prior to the expiration of our existing credit agreement in july in addition to obligations to repay our debt obligations  we lease the majority of our retail stores under long term operating leases 
the following table summarizes our commitments under both our debt and lease obligations payments due by period in thousands contractual obligations total thereafter debt obligations operating leases total contractual cash obligations on may  we announced that our board of directors had approved a stock repurchase program authorizing us to repurchase up to million of yankee candle common stock 
during fiscal  we repurchased a total of  shares of common stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million 
our repurchase activities were funded from cash flow from operations and borrowings under our existing credit agreement 
on february   the board of directors authorized a new stock repurchase program for the repurchase of up to an additional million of our common stock 
we expect that the principal sources of funding for our planned store openings and other working capital needs  capital expenditures  debt service obligations and stock repurchase program will be a combination of our available cash and cash equivalents  funds generated from operations  and borrowings under our credit facility 
we believe that our current funds and sources of funds will be sufficient to fund our liquidity needs for at least the next months 
however  there are a number of factors that may negatively impact our available sources of funds 
the amount of cash generated from operations will be dependent upon factors such as the successful execution of our business plan and worldwide economic conditions 
in addition  borrowings under our credit facility are dependent upon our continued compliance with the financial and other covenants contained therein and will cease as of july

accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  an amendment of sfas no 
under the prospective transition method  the company has valued all stock option grants beginning with grants made in fiscal these are being expensed over the vesting period based on the fair value at the date of the grant 
the adoption of the fair value method of accounting for stock based compensation resulted in a charge of million for the fiscal year ended january  impact of inflation we do not believe inflation has a significant impact on our operations 
the prices of our products have not varied based on the movement of the consumer price index 
the majority of our material and labor costs have not been materially affected by inflation 
future operating results as referenced above  there are a number of factors that might cause our actual results to differ significantly from the results reflected by the forward looking statements contained herein 
in addition to factors generally affecting the political  economic and competitive conditions in the united states and abroad  such factors include those set forth below 
if we fail to grow our business as planned  our business could suffer and financial results could decline 
as we grow it will be difficult to maintain our historical growth rates 
we intend to continue to pursue a business strategy of increasing sales and earnings by expanding our retail and wholesale operations both in the united states and internationally 
our current plans are to grow internally and not by acquisition  although from time to time we do consider possible acquisition candidates 
in particular  our retail growth strategy depends in large part on our ability to open new stores in both existing and new geographic markets 
since our ability to implement our growth strategy successfully will be dependent in part on factors beyond our control  including consumer preferences and the competitive environment  we may not be able to achieve our planned growth or sustain our financial performance 
our ability to anticipate changes in the candle and giftware industries  and identify industry trends  will be critical factors in our ability to remain competitive 
we expect that  as we grow  it will become more difficult to maintain our historical growth rate  which could negatively impact our operating margins and results of operations 
new stores typically generate lower operating margin contributions than mature stores because fixed costs  as a percentage of sales  are higher and because pre opening costs are fully expensed in the year of opening 
in addition  our retail sales generate lower margins than our wholesale sales 
our wholesale business has grown by increasing sales to existing customers and by adding new customers 
if we are not able to continue this  our sales growth and profitability 
table of contents could be adversely affected 
we cannot assure you that we will continue to grow at a rate comparable to our historic growth rate or that our historic financial performance will continue as we grow 
we face significant competition in the giftware industry 
this competition could cause our revenues or margins to fall short of expectations which could adversely affect our future operating results  financial condition and liquidity and our ability to continue to grow our business 
we compete generally for the disposable income of consumers with other producers in the giftware industry 
the giftware industry is highly competitive with a large number of both large and small participants 
our products compete with other scented and unscented candle and personal care products and with other gifts within a comparable price range  like boxes of candy  flowers  wine  fine soap and related merchandise 
our retail stores compete with franchised candle store chains  specialty candle stores and gift and houseware retailers 
some of our competitors are part of large  diversified companies which have greater financial resources and a wider range of product offerings than we do 
this competitive environment could adversely affect our future revenues and profits  financial condition and liquidity and our ability to continue to grow our business 
a material decline in consumers discretionary income could cause our sales and income to decline 
our results depend on consumer spending  which is influenced by general economic conditions and the availability of discretionary income 
accordingly  we may experience declines in sales during economic downturns or during periods of uncertainty like that which followed the september  terrorist attacks on the united states or which result from the threat of war or the possibility of further terrorist attacks 
any material decline in the amount of discretionary spending could have a material adverse effect on our sales and income 
because we are not a diversified company and are effectively dependent upon one industry  we have less flexibility in reacting to unfavorable consumer trends  adverse economic conditions or business cycles 
we rely primarily on the sale of premium scented candles and related products in the giftware industry 
in the event that sales of these products decline or do not meet our expectations  we cannot rely on the sales of other products to offset such a shortfall 
as a significant portion of our expenses is comprised of fixed costs  such as lease payments  our ability to decrease expenses in response to adverse business conditions is limited in the short term 
as a result  unfavorable consumer trends  adverse economic conditions or changes in the business cycle could have a material and adverse impact on our earnings 
if we lose our senior executive officers  our business could be disrupted and our financial performance could suffer 
our success is substantially dependent upon the retention of our senior executive officers 
if our senior executive officers become unable or unwilling to participate in our business  our future business and financial performance could be materially affected 
many aspects of our manufacturing and distribution facilities are customized for our business  as a result  the loss of one of these facilities would disrupt our operations 
approximately of our sales in were generated by products we manufacture at our manufacturing facility in whately  massachusetts and we rely primarily on our distribution facilities in south deerfield  massachusetts to distribute our products 
because most of our machinery is designed or customized by us to manufacture our products  and because we have strict quality control standards for our products  the loss of 
table of contents our manufacturing facility  due to natural disaster or otherwise  would materially affect our operations 
similarly  our distribution facilities rely upon customized machinery  systems and operations  the loss of which would materially affect our operations 
although our manufacturing and distribution facilities are adequately insured  we believe it would take up to twelve months to resume operations at a level equivalent to current operations 
seasonal  quarterly and other fluctuations in our business  and general industry and market conditions  could affect the market for our common stock 
our sales and operating results vary from quarter to quarter 
we have historically realized higher sales and operating income in our fourth quarter  particularly in our retail business  which accounts for a larger portion of our sales 
we believe that this has been due primarily to an increase in giftware industry sales during the holiday season of the fourth quarter 
as a result of this seasonality  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful and that these comparisons cannot be relied upon as indicators of future performance 
in addition  we may also experience quarterly fluctuations in our sales and income depending on various factors  including  among other things  the number of new retail stores we open in a particular quarter  changes in the ordering patterns of our wholesale customers during a particular quarter  and the mix of products sold 
most of our operating expenses  such as rent expense  advertising and promotional expense and employee wages and salaries  do not vary directly with sales and are difficult to adjust in the short term 
as a result  if sales for a particular quarter are below our expectations  we might not be able to proportionately reduce operating expenses for that quarter  and therefore a sales shortfall could have a disproportionate effect on our operating results for that quarter 
further  our comparable store sales from our retail business in a particular quarter could be adversely affected by competition  economic or other general conditions or our inability to execute a particular business strategy 
as a result of these factors  we may report in the future sales  operating results or comparable store sales that do not match the expectations of market analysts and investors 
this could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline 
in addition  broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the price of our common stock  regardless of our operating performance 
public health epidemics such as severe acute respiratory syndrome may affect our operating results 
approximately of our sales in were generated by products  primarily accessories  that we purchased overseas 
substantially all of these products were purchased from east asia 
a sustained interruption of the operations of our suppliers  as a result of the impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome or other similar health epidemics  could have an adverse effect on our ability to receive timely shipments of certain of our products and could result in scrutiny or embargoing of goods produced in infected areas 
provisions in our corporate documents and massachusetts law could delay or prevent a change in control of yankee candle 
our articles of organization and by laws may discourage  delay or prevent a merger or acquisition involving yankee candle that our stockholders may consider favorable  by authorizing the issuance of preferred stock  the terms of which may be determined at the sole discretion of the board of directors  providing for a classified board of directors  with staggered three year terms  and establishing advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted on by stockholders at meetings 

table of contents massachusetts law may also discourage  delay or prevent someone from acquiring or merging with us 
we do not currently intend to pay dividends on our capital stock 
we have never paid a cash dividend on our common stock as a public company 
instead  we have retained earnings for the future operation of our business 
while we have no current plan to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future  we intend to periodically evaluate the advisability of a dividend program 
any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will be dependent upon our results of operations  our financial condition  contractual and legal restrictions  and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors 
under the terms of our existing credit agreement which is scheduled to expire on july   we may not declare or pay dividends on our common stock unless our ratio of consolidated total debt to consolidated ebitda as defined in our credit agreement is less than or equal to or our aggregate principal amount of loans and letters of credit outstanding is less than million 
although we currently meet this requirement  we have to current plan to pay dividends 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s our market risks relate primarily to changes in interest rates 
we bear this risk in two specific ways 
first  we have debt outstanding 
at january   we had million outstanding under our credit agreement  which bears interest at variable rates 
at january   the weighted average interest rate on outstanding borrowings was 
this facility is intended to fund operating needs if necessary 
because this facility carries a variable interest rate pegged to market indices  our results of operations and cash flows will be exposed to changes in interest rates 
based on january  borrowing levels  a increase or decrease in current market interest rates would have the effect of causing an approximately million additional annual pre tax charge or credit to the statement of operations 
the second component of interest rate risk involves the short term investment of excess cash 
this risk impacts fair values  earnings and cash flows 
excess cash is primarily invested in interest bearing accounts that fluctuate with market interest rates 
based on january  cash equivalents  a increase or decrease in current market interest rates would have the effect of causing an approximately million additional pre tax credit or charge to the annual statements of operations 
we buy a variety of raw materials for inclusion in our products 
the only raw material that is considered to be of a commodity nature is wax 
wax is a petroleum based product 
however  its market price has not historically fluctuated with the movement of oil prices 
rather  over the past five years wax prices have generally moved with inflation 
at this point in time  operations outside of the united states are immaterial 
accordingly  we are not exposed to substantial risks arising from foreign currency exchange rates
