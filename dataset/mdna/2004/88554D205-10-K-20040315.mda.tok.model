the company s sales of small frame systems benefited modestly from new applications  including hearing aids and jewelry 
in addition  other systems revenue  mostly derived from rentals  royalties and other products  decreased by million 
systems orders and sales may fluctuate on a yearly basis as a result of a number of factors  including world economic conditions  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  customer acceptance of new products and the timing of product shipments

product sales of million were recorded in  a decrease of compared to million for without the inclusion of the sls product line which includes materials from the sls product line  product sales of million would have been recorded for  compared to million for this decrease in product sales is due primarily to the decrease in our sales of thermojet solid object printers and related equipment of million or  a decrease in sales of our sla systems and related equipment of million or and a decrease in materials revenue of million  or 
machine revenue decreased approximately million or from million in to million in the decrease is attributable to a decrease of approximately million in volume  offset by a million increase in our average price 
the offsetting variances represent the shift in machine sales mix from thermojet solid object printers and sla machines to the newer sls product line 
in  we sold a total of sla systems compared to in which we sold a total of sla systems 
in addition  we sold sls systems in  compared to sls systems in sls unit sales from reflect the consolidated results of dtm as of august  the reduction in the number of units sold is a result of the economic slowdown worldwide during most of overall  our material revenue increased approximately million or from million in to million in the increase is attributable to a decrease of approximately million in volume  offset by an increase of approximately million in the average price

system orders and resultant sales may fluctuate on a yearly basis as a result of a number of factors  including world economic conditions  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  customer acceptance of new products and the timing of product shipments 
due to the price of certain systems and the overall low unit volumes  the acceleration or delay of shipments of a small number of higher end sla systems from one period to another can significantly affect the results of operations for the periods involved 
service sales in totaled million  an increase of from million in the increase primarily reflects added service revenue of approximately million from the dtm business as well as an increase in the installed base of machines  partially offset by a decline in other service revenue

the lower end systems appeal to a broader base of customers  and we anticipate that the lost margin will be recovered over time by the increased sales volume 
service cost of sales as a percentage of service sales increased to in fiscal year from in the increase is due to an increase in fixed costs of our education centers  which are located in certain of our facilities that we maintain to train customers to use our products  and technology centers  attributable to the addition of the sls product line

the determination to fully reserve the deferred tax assets was based primarily on our cumulative losses in recent years  our current deficit operations and our projected operating losses through the third quarter of we determined that it was more likely than not that we would not be in a position to realize the benefit from these tax assets in future periods until such time as the company reaches a level of profitability that supports the reduction or reversal of the valuation allowance 
for  the valuation allowances for deferred taxes related primarily to the realizability of foreign net operating losses and dtm net operating losses  which were transferred to us in connection with the acquisition of dtm

the debentures are redeemable by the company  in whole or in part  commencing on november  at a price equal to of the then outstanding principal amount of the debentures being redeemed  together with all accrued and unpaid interest and other amounts due in respect of the debentures 
if there is a change in control with respect to the company  as defined in the debenture purchase agreement  the holders may require the company to redeem the debentures at of the then outstanding principal amount  together with all accrued and unpaid interest and other amounts due in respect of the debentures 
the debentures are subordinated in right of payment to all senior indebtedness as defined in the debenture purchase agreement and pari passu in right of payment with the company s outstanding convertible subordinated debentures 
the net proceeds from the sale of the debentures were approximately million 
in september  the company acquired rpc ltd  a swiss company for million  of which million was paid in cash in and the remaining deferred portion of the purchase price  denominated in swiss francs  of chf million approximately million at the purchase date  was payable on september  on november   the company entered into an agreement with the former stockholders of rpc to pay such amount equivalent to million at november  in installments over a two year period ending september   with interest on the unpaid amount at the rate of per annum 
during  the company paid million pursuant to this agreement 
commitments and contingencies the company leases certain facilities under non cancelable operating leases expiring through december the leases are generally on a net rent basis  whereby the company pays taxes  maintenance and insurance 
leases that expire are expected to be renewed or replaced by leases on other properties 
rental expense for the years ended december   and was million  million and million  respectively 
future contractual payments at december  are as follows in thousands later years total industrial development bonds subordinated debt convertible debentures  convertible debentures     redeemable preferred stock     liquidated damages payments to rpc shareholders non cancelable operating leases    total       includes interest at the rate in effect at december  and scheduled principal payments in each year 
includes interest or cumulative dividends  as the case may be  in each period at the rate provided for in each of these instruments and assumes that they will not be converted into common stock and will remain outstanding until their respective final maturity dates 
the amount included for cumulative dividends on the preferred stock also assumes that the annual dividend rate will not increase to per share after may  reflects the company s obligation at december  to compensate certain stockholders who acquired shares of its common stock in private placement transactions for the company s failure to maintain an effective registration statement that would permit such holders to sell such shares 
such damages accrue at the rate of approximately per month 
series b convertible preferred stock the series b convertible preferred stock accrues dividends  on a cumulative basis  at or per share 
the company has agreed to register the resale by the holders of the shares of common stock into which the shares of series b convertible preferred stock are convertible 
if the registration statement is not declared effective by the securities and exchange commission before the close of business on may   the dividend rate increases to or per share 
the series b convertible preferred stock is senior to the company s common stock and any other stock that ranks junior to the series b convertible preferred stock 
dividends are payable semi annually  when  as and if declared by the board of directors  on may and november of each year while the series b convertible preferred stock remains outstanding 
in addition  the series b convertible preferred stock votes equally with the company s common stock and is convertible at any time at the option of its holders on a basis into approximately  shares of common stock 
the series b convertible preferred stock is redeemable at the company s option after may  the company must redeem any shares of series b convertible preferred stock that remain outstanding on may  the redemption price is per share plus any accrued and unpaid dividends 
stockholders equity stockholders equity was million at december   a reduction of million or from the balance of at december  stockholders equity was reduced during by the company s net loss of million and the accrual of million of dividends  including accretion of preferred stock issuance costs  on the series b convertible preferred stock 
stockholders equity was further reduced by costs of million associated with filing a registration statement with the sec for the company s common stock and million of liquidated damages incurred under private placement agreements requiring the company to maintain an effective registration statement permitting the resale of such shares of common stock 
these reductions were partially offset by increases in common stock and additional paid in capital of million for stock issuances and a million cumulative translation adjustment 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices  which may adversely affect its results of operations and financial condition 
the company seeks to minimize these risks through regular operating and financing activities and  when deemed appropriate  through the use of derivative financial instruments 
the company does not purchase  hold or sell derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
interest rates the company s exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to its cash investments and its outstanding industrial development bonds 
the company seeks to minimize the risk to its cash investments by investing cash in excess of its operating needs in short term  high quality instruments issued by highly creditworthy financial institutions or governments 
a hypothetical or basis point change in interest rates would not have a significant effect on the company s financial position or results of operation 
from time to time  the company may use interest rate swaps  collars or options to manage its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates 
at december  and  the company had no such financial instruments outstanding 
the fair value of the company s fixed rate debt and preferred stock  collectively referred to below as fixed rate instruments  varies with changes in interest rates and the market fluctuations for its common stock 
generally  the fair value of these fixed rate instruments will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise 
these instruments also contain options to convert them into the company s common stock  and the fair value of these instruments is affected by the company s stock price and stock volatility 
at december   the carrying value of the company s total debt was million of which approximately million was fixed rate debt  and the carrying value of the preferred stock was million 
at december   the carrying value of the company s total debt was million of which million was fixed rate debt 
there was no preferred stock outstanding at december  the estimated fair value of the company s total debt  which includes the cost of replacing the company s fixed rate instruments with borrowings at current market rates  was approximately million at december  compared to million at december  the fair value of the company s fixed rate instruments is an estimate  which includes discounting of the outstanding balance to reflect current market rates of interest and an estimation of the value of the conversion options based on the black scholes option model 
the black scholes option model attempts to value the options while giving effect to the term of the option  the exercise or strike price  market price of the company s stock and an estimate of the volatility of the company s common stock 
such changes in the fair value of the company s fixed rate instruments do not alter the company s obligations to repay the outstanding principal amount of such debt or the total liquidation value of its outstanding preferred stock at maturity 
the increase in estimated fair value of fixed rate instruments during was predominantly the result of issuance of new instruments during the year  a decrease from to in the interest rate used to discount the contractual payments associated with the instruments and  with respect to the value of the conversion options  an increase in the year end market price of the company s common stock into which certain of the instruments are convertible from per share at december  to per share at december  a hypothetical or basis point change in interest rates would result in a change in the estimated fair value of the company s debt at december  of million 
foreign exchange rates at december   the company had an obligation to the former stockholders of rpc  ltd 
of million swiss francs approximately million  which accrues interest at a fixed rate 
the company had not undertaken any steps to hedge its exposure for the foreign exchange risk nor the market risk for this obligation at december  as a result  the company is exposed to these risks related to changes in foreign exchange rates and changes in fair value due to interest rates with respect to this obligation 
the company operates in locations outside the us that are not considered to be highly inflationary 
nevertheless  these foreign operations  which are conducted primarily by foreign sales subsidiaries  are sensitive to fluctuations in currency exchange rates arising from  among other things  intercompany transactions that are generally denominated in us dollars rather than their respective functional currency 
as discussed above  revenues from the company s operations outside the us accounted for of total revenue for the year ended december  these revenues were generated primarily from the operations of the company s foreign sales subsidiaries in their respective countries and surrounding geographic areas that are denominated either in us dollars or in the local currency of each country 
these subsidiaries incur most of their expenses other than intercompany expenses in the functional currency of their local countries  and they use the local currency as their functional currency 
the company s operating results as well as its assets and liabilities are also subject to the effect of foreign currency translation as the operating results and balance sheets of its subsidiaries outside the us are translated in consolidation into us dollars 
the realized effect of foreign currency translation in resulted in a million gain that was recorded in cost of sales  compared to million gain in and million loss in the unrealized effect of foreign currency translation in resulted in million of gain that was recorded in equity as other comprehensive income  compared to million gain in and million loss in a hypothetical change of in the foreign currency exchange rates would cause a change of million to the net assets on the company s consolidated balance sheet and a million change in revenue in the company s consolidated statements of operations 
the company may use other derivative instruments from time to time  such as foreign exchange options to manage exposure due to foreign exchange rates and foreign currency forward contracts to fix the amount payable on certain transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
the terms of such instruments are generally twelve months or less 
the company does not hedge its foreign currency exposure in a manner that would entirely eliminate the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates on its consolidated net loss income 
at december  and  the company had no foreign exchange financial instruments outstanding 
at december   the company had cash and cash equivalents of million denominated in local currencies in its european subsidiaries 
the company has not used any derivative instruments to hedge these investments against foreign exchange rate fluctuations  and as a result is exposed to the risk of changes in the exchange rates 
commodity prices the company uses various commodity raw materials and energy products in conjunction with its manufacturing processes 
generally  the company acquires such components at market prices and does not use financial instruments to hedge commodity prices 
as a result  the company is exposed to market risks related to changes in commodity prices of these components 
a hypothetical change in commodity prices for raw materials would cause a change of million to cost of sales in the company s consolidated statement of operations 
critical accounting policies and significant estimates the discussion and analysis of the company s results of operations and financial condition set forth in this annual report on form k is based on the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make critical accounting estimates that directly impact its condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures 
critical accounting estimates are estimates that meet two criteria the estimates require that the company make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimates are made  and there exist different estimates that could reasonably be used in the current period  or changes in the estimates used are reasonably likely to occur from period to period  both of which would have a material impact on the results of the company s operations or on its financial condition 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to the allowance for doubtful accounts  income taxes  inventory  goodwill  intangible and other long lived assets  contingencies and revenue recognition 
the company bases its estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other assumptions that the company believes are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the following represent what management believes are the critical accounting policies most affected by significant management estimates and judgments 
management has discussed these critical accounting policies  the basis for their underlying assumptions and estimates and the nature of the company s related disclosures herein with the audit committee of the board of directors 
revenue recognition revenues from the sale of systems and related products are recognized upon shipment or when services are performed  provided that persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists  both title and risk of loss have passed to the customer and collection is reasonably assured 
persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists upon execution of a written sales agreement that constitutes a fixed and legally binding commitment for the buyer and us 
sales transactions generally include equipment  software license  warranty  training and installation 
the company allocates and records revenue in these transactions based on vendor specific objective evidence that has been accumulated through historic operations  which  in most cases  is the price charged for the deliverable when sold separately 
if fair value for all deliverables cannot be determined  the company will use the residual method to determine the amount of the consideration to be allocated to the delivered items 
the company also evaluates the impact of undelivered items on the functionality of delivered items for each sales transaction and  where appropriate  defers revenue on delivered items when that functionality has been affected 
functionality is determined to be met if the delivered products or services represent a separate earnings process 
revenues from services are recognized at the time of performance 
the company provides end users with maintenance under a warranty agreement for up to one year and defers a portion of the revenues at the time of sale based on the relative fair value of those services 
after the initial warranty period  the company offers these customers optional maintenance contracts 
deferred maintenance revenue is recognized ratably  on a straight line basis  over the period of the contract 
the company s systems are sold with licensed software products that are integral to the operation of the systems 
these software products are generally sold or licensed only for use in our systems 
certain of the company s sales prior to were made through a sales agent to customers where substantial uncertainty exists with respect to collection of the sales price 
the substantial uncertainty is generally a result of the absence of a history of doing business with the customer and uncertain political environment in the country in which the customer does business 
for these sales  the company records revenues based on the cost recovery method  which requires that the sales proceeds received are first applied to the carrying amount of the asset sold until the carrying amount has been recovered  thereafter  all proceeds are credited to sales 
the company s terms of sale vary depending upon the product being sold or service being performed 
for systems sales  the company typically requires a deposit and substantial payments prior to shipment 
customers with a favorable credit profile may receive other credit terms based on that profile 
creditworthiness is determined based on an evaluation of each customer s financial condition 
new customers are required to complete a credit application and provide references  credit checks and bank information to facilitate an analysis of creditworthiness 
the company often requires customers outside the united states to furnish letters of credit 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company s estimate for the allowance for doubtful accounts related to trade receivables is based on two methods 
the amounts calculated from each of these methods are combined to determine the total amount reserved 
first  the company evaluates specific accounts where we have information that the customer may have an inability to meet its financial obligations for example  bankruptcy 
in these cases  we use the company s judgment  based on available facts and circumstances  and record a specific reserve for that customer against amounts due to reduce the receivable to the amount that is expected to be collected 
these specific reserves are reevaluated and adjusted as additional information is received that impacts the amount reserved 
second  a reserve is established for all customers based on a range of percentages applied to aging categories 
these percentages are based on historical collection and write off experience 
if circumstances change for example  we experience higher than expected defaults or an unexpected material adverse change in a major customer s ability to meet its financial obligation to us  the company s estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to us could be reduced by a material amount 
we believe that the company s allowance for doubtful accounts is a critical accounting estimate because it is susceptible to change and dependent upon events that may or may not occur  and because the impact of recognizing additional allowances for doubtful accounts may be material to the assets reported on the company s balance sheet and the company s results of operations 
income taxes the company and its domestic subsidiaries file a consolidated us federal income tax return 
the company s non us subsidiaries file income tax returns in their respective local jurisdictions 
the company provides for income taxes on those portions of its foreign subsidiaries accumulated earnings that it believes are not reinvested indefinitely in their business 
income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and tax benefit carry forwards 
deferred tax liabilities and assets at the end of each period are determined using enacted tax rates 
the company records deferred tax assets arising from temporary timing differences between recorded net income and taxable net income when and if the company believes that future earnings will be sufficient to realize the tax benefit 
for those jurisdictions where the expiration date of tax benefit carry forwards or the projected taxable earnings indicate that realization is not likely  a valuation allowance is provided 
the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  require the establishment of a valuation allowance when  based on currently available information and other factors  it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
sfas no 
provides that an important factor in determining whether a deferred tax asset will be realized is whether there has been sufficient income in recent years and whether sufficient income is expected in future years in order to utilize the deferred tax asset 
in  the company determined  based upon its accumulated losses and its continuing operating losses  that it was more likely than not that the company would not be in a position to realize its deferred tax assets in future years 
accordingly  in  the company provided a valuation allowance of million that reduced the carrying value of its deferred tax assets to zero 
during  the company recorded a tax benefit of million arising primarily from its net loss for the year  and the company increased its valuation allowance for deferred tax assets by the same amount 
at december   the company s net deferred tax assets  before giving effect to its accumulated valuation allowances  were approximately million 
the company intends to maintain a valuation allowance for its deferred tax assets until sufficient evidence exists to support its reversal or reduction 
if in future periods the company determines that it is more likely than not that it will be able to recognize all or a portion of its deferred tax assets  the company will at that time reverse or reduce the valuation allowance 
the company believes that its estimate of deferred tax assets and its determination to record a valuation allowance against such assets are critical accounting estimates because they are subject to  among other things  an estimate of future taxable income in the united states  which is susceptible to change and dependent upon events that may or may not occur  and because the impact of recording a valuation allowance may be material to the assets reported on the company s balance sheet and the company s results of operations 
the determination of the company s income tax provision is complex due to operations in numerous tax jurisdictions outside the united states  which are subject to certain risks  which ordinarily would not be expected in the united states 
tax regimes in certain jurisdictions are subject to significant changes  which may be applied on a retroactive basis 
if this were to occur  the company s tax expense could be materially different than the amounts reported 
furthermore  as explained in the preceding paragraph  in determining the valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets  we adopt the liability method as required by sfas no 
this method requires that the company establish a valuation allowance if  based on the weight of available evidence  in the company s judgment it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets may not be realized 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value  cost being determined on the first in  first out method 
reserves for slow moving and obsolete inventories are provided based on historical experience and current product demand 
the company s reserve for slow moving and obsolete inventory was million and million at december  and december   respectively 
the company evaluates the adequacy of these reserves quarterly 
there were no inventories consigned to a sales agent at december   and inventories consigned to a sales agent at december  were million 
the company s determination of the allowance for inventory obsolescence is subject to change because it is based on management s current estimates of required reserves and potential adjustments 
the company believes that the allowance for inventory obsolescence is a critical accounting estimate because it is susceptible to change and dependent upon events that may or may not occur and because the impact of recognizing additional obsolescence reserves may be material to the assets reported on the company s balance sheet and in its results of operations 
goodwill and intangible and other long lived assets the company applied sfas no 
 business combinations  in the allocation of the purchase prices of dtm corporation  rpc ltd 
and optoform sarl 
the annual impairment testing required by sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  requires the company to use its judgment and could require the company to write down the carrying value of its goodwill and other intangible assets in future periods 
sfas no 
requires companies to allocate their goodwill to identifiable reporting units  which then are tested for impairment using a two step process detailed in the statement 
the first step requires comparing the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if that fair value exceeds the carrying amount  the second step of the process is not necessary and there are no impairment issues 
if that fair value does not exceed that carrying amount  companies must perform the second step that requires an allocation of the fair value of the reporting unit to all assets and liabilities of that unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a purchase business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase price 
the goodwill resulting from that purchase price allocation is then compared to its carrying amount with any excess recorded as an impairment charge 
pursuant to the requirements of sfas no 
 the company is required to perform a valuation of its reporting units annually  or upon significant changes in the company s business environment 
the company performed an evaluation of its reporting units upon implementation of sfas no 
in january  and for the years ended december  and  and concluded that the fair values of the company s reporting units exceeded their carrying values 
accordingly  no goodwill impairment adjustments were recorded for or for goodwill recorded as part of the acquisition of dtm and rpc 
the company evaluates long lived assets other than goodwill for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
if the estimated future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges from the use of an asset are less than the carrying value  a write down would be recorded to reduce the related asset to its estimated fair value 
at december   the company determined that an impairment of the acquired technology and other long lived assets arising from the acquisition of optoform sarl had occurred as it had become unlikely that the technology would be commercialized 
accordingly  future cash flows from this component of the company s reporting units are expected to be negligible 
the company recorded the estimated impairment amount of million at december  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company believes that its determinations whether or not to recognize an impairment of goodwill or of intangible assets or other long lived assets is a critical accounting estimate because it is susceptible to change  dependent upon estimates of the fair value of the company s reporting units  and because the impact of recognizing an impairment may be material to the assets reported on its balance sheet and to its results of operations 
contingencies the company accounts for contingencies in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
sfas no 
requires that we record an estimated loss from a loss contingency when information available prior to issuance of its financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
accounting for contingencies such as legal and income tax matters requires the company to use its judgment 
at this time  the company cannot reasonably estimate its contingencies  and accordingly  under the guidance of sfas no 
 except for an accrual of million that it made in accrued liabilities as of december  with respect to the settlement of its litigation with regent pacific management corporation  no contingency has been recorded

all statements other than statements of historical fact are statements that could be deemed forward looking statements  including the difficulty of keeping expense growth at modest levels while increasing revenues  any projections of earnings  revenues or other financial items  any statements of the plans  strategies and objectives of management for future operations  any statement concerning proposed new products  services or developments  any statements regarding future economic conditions or performance  any statements of belief  and any statements of assumptions underlying any of the foregoing 
these statements may use words such as anticipate  believe  estimate  expect  intend  predict  project and similar expressions as they relate to the company or its management 
any forward looking statements are based on management s beliefs and assumptions  using information currently available to the company 
the company assumes no obligation  and does not intend  to update these forward looking statements 
if one or more of these or other risks or uncertainties materialize  or if the company s underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect  actual results may vary materially from what the company projected 
any forward looking statement you read in this annual report on form k reflects the company s current views with respect to future events and is subject to these and other risks  uncertainties and assumptions relating to the company s operations  results of operations  growth strategy and liquidity 
all subsequent written and oral forward looking statements attributable to the company or individuals acting on its behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by this paragraph 
you should specifically consider the factors identified in this annual report on form k which would cause actual results to differ 
cautionary statements and risk factors the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks and uncertainties that the company faces 
additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to the company or that the company currently deems not to be material also may impair its business operations 
if any of the following risks actually occur  the company s business  results of operations and financial condition could suffer 
in that event the trading price of the company s common stock could decline  and you may lose all or part of your investment in the company s common stock 
the risks discussed below also include forward looking statements and the company s actual results may differ substantially from those discussed in these forward looking statements 
the company s debt level could adversely affect its financial health and affect its ability to run its business 
as of december   the company s debt was million 
this debt included million of convertible subordinated debt and of industrial development bonds  million of which were current 
in addition  the company had outstanding million of series b convertible preferred stock  which is mandatorily redeemable in this level of debt and preferred stock could have important consequences to you as a holder of shares 
the company has identified below some of the material potential consequences resulting from this significant amount of debt and preferred stock the company may be unable to obtain additional financing for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and general corporate purposes 
the company s ability to adapt to changing market conditions may be hampered 
the company may be more vulnerable in a volatile market and at a competitive disadvantage to its competitors that have less debt 
the company s operating flexibility may be limited by restrictive covenants contained in credit documents such as restrictions on incurring additional debt  creating liens on properties  making acquisitions and paying dividends and requirements that the company satisfy certain financial covenants such as the maintenance of certain levels of net worth  interest coverage ratios  fixed charge coverage ratios or other financial covenants 
the company may be subject to the risks that interest rates  interest expense and fixed charges will increase 
the company s ability to plan for  or react to  changes in its business may be more limited 
the company s operating results may be insufficient to achieve compliance with financial covenants in financing documents  thereby causing acceleration of outstanding debt 
the company s reimbursement agreement with wells fargo bank  na related to a letter of credit supporting million of industrial development bonds outstanding on december  contains two financial covenants 
one covenant requires the company to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio as defined of 
at december   the company s fixed charge coverage ratio was 
the other covenant requires the company to maintain tangible net worth as defined of million plus of net income subsequent to july  because the company has incurred losses since july   the covenant requirement was million at december   and the company s calculated tangible net worth at that date was million 
future losses could cause the company to breach either or both of these covenants 
although the company was in compliance with the covenants at december   it has previously received waivers from wells fargo bank  na when it breached the fixed charge coverage ratio as of the end of and the third quarter of if the company is unable to generate net cash flow from operations or if it is unable to raise additional capital  the company s financial condition would be adversely affected 
notwithstanding the private placement of its convertible subordinated debentures  the company cannot assure you that during or thereafter it will generate funds from operations or that capital will be available from external sources such as debt or equity financings or other potential sources to fund future operating costs  debt service obligations and capital requirements 
the company s operations were not profitable in the three year period ended december  the lack of additional capital resulting from the inability to generate cash flow from operations or to raise equity or debt financing would force the company to substantially curtail or cease operations and would  therefore  have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
further  the company cannot assure you that any necessary funds  if available  will be available on attractive terms or that they will not have a significantly dilutive effect on its existing stockholders 
if the company s financial condition worsens and it is unable to attract additional equity or debt financing or other strategic transactions  the company may become insolvent or be forced to declare bankruptcy 
the company s balance sheet contains several categories of intangible assets totaling million that the company may be required to write off or write down based on the impairment of certain of those assets and its future performance  which may adversely impact its future earnings and stock price  its ability to obtain financing and adversely affect its customer relationships 
as of december   the company had million of unamortized intangible assets  consisting of licenses  patents  acquired technology and other intangibles that the company amortizes over time 
any material impairment to any of these items could reduce the company s net income and may adversely affect the trading price of its common stock 
at december   the company had million in goodwill capitalized on its balance sheet 
sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  requires  among other things  the discontinuance of the amortization of goodwill and certain other intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives and the introduction of impairment testing in its place 
under sfas no 
 goodwill and some indefinite lived intangibles will not be amortized into results of operations  but instead will be tested for impairment at least annually  with impairment being measured as the excess of the carrying value of the goodwill or intangible asset over its fair value 
in addition  goodwill and intangible assets will be tested more often for impairment as circumstances warrant  and may result in write downs of some of the company s goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles 
accordingly  the company could  from time to time  incur impairment charges  which will be recorded as operating expenses and will reduce its net income and adversely affect its operating results 
the mix of products the company sells could cause significant quarterly fluctuations in its gross margins and net income 
the company works to expand continuously its product offerings  including its systems  materials and services  the number of geographic areas in which it operates and the distribution channels it uses to reach various target product applications and customers 
this variety of products  applications and channels results in a range of gross margins and operating income which can cause substantial quarterly fluctuations depending upon the mix of product shipments from quarter to quarter 
the company may experience significant quarterly fluctuations in gross margins or net income due to the impact of the mix of products  channels or geographic areas in which it sells its products from period to period 
more recently  the company s mix of products sold has reflected increased sales of its lower cost and smaller frame systems  which have reduced gross margins compared to high end stereolithography systems 
if this trend continues over time  the company may experience lower average gross margins and returns 
the company may be subject to product liability claims  which could result in material expense  diversion of management time and attention and damage to its business reputation 
products as complex as those the company offers may contain undetected defects or errors when first introduced or as enhancements are released that  despite testing  are not discovered until after the product has been installed and used by customers 
this could result in delayed market acceptance of the product or damage to the company s reputation and business 
the company attempts to include provisions in its agreements with customers that are designed to limit the company s exposure to potential liability for damages arising from defects or errors in its products 
however  the nature and extent of these limitations vary from customer to customer  and it is possible that these limitations may not be effective as a result of unfavorable judicial decisions or laws enacted in the future 
the sale and support of the company s products entails the risk of product liability claims 
any product liability claim brought against the company  regardless of its merit  could result in material expense to  diversion of management time and attention and damage to its business reputation and ability to retain existing customers or to attract new customers 
political and economic events and the uncertainty resulting from them may have a material adverse effect on our market opportunities and operating results 
the terrorist attacks that took place in the united states on september   along with the us military campaigns against terrorism in iraq  afghanistan and elsewhere and continued violence in the middle east have created many economic and political uncertainties  some of which may materially harm the company s business and revenues 
the disruption of the company s business as a result of these events  including disruptions and deferrals of customer purchasing decisions  had an immediate adverse impact on its business 
since september   some economic commentators have indicated that spending on capital equipment of the type that the company sells has been weaker than spending in the economy as a whole  and many of the company s customers are in industries that also are viewed as under performing the overall economy  such as the automotive and telecommunication industries 
the long term effects of these events on the company s customers  the market for its common stock  the markets for its services and the us economy as a whole are uncertain 
the consequences of any additional terrorist attacks or of any expanded armed conflicts are unpredictable  and the company may not be able to foresee events that could have an adverse effect on its market opportunities or its business 
the company faces significant competition in many aspects of its business  which could cause its revenues and gross margins to decline 
the competition in the company s industry could cause the company to reduce sales prices or incur additional marketing or related costs of production  which could result in decreased revenues  increased costs and reduced margins 
the company competes for customers with a wide variety of producers of equipment for models  prototypes and other three dimensional objects as well as producers of materials and services for this equipment 
some of the company s existing and potential competitors are researching  designing  developing and marketing other types of competitive equipment  materials and services 
many of these competitors have financial  marketing  manufacturing  distribution and other resources substantially greater than those of the company 
in connection with its cost containment efforts  the company has reduced the number of employees engaged in research and development efforts 
the company did not introduce any significant product advances in its sla and sls systems in  or these factors may have negatively affected the company s ability to compete effectively 
a continued reduction in research and development efforts attributable to these systems  or any reduction in the company s research and development efforts generally  could affect its ability to compete effectively 
the existence of competitors extends the purchase decision time as customers investigate the alternative products and solutions 
in addition  in june  the company entered into a license agreement with sony corporation pursuant to the terms of its consent decree with the us department of justice under which the company licenses to sony certain of its patents for use in the manufacture and sale of stereolithography in north america the united states  canada and mexico 
sony is an extremely large and sophisticated corporation with substantial resources  and the company anticipates that it will aggressively compete in all aspects of the company s stereolithography business 
as discussed above  in february  the company settled all of its outstanding litigation with eos gmbh 
as a result of that settlement  eos will be able to sell certain systems and other products in the us in exchange for the payment of royalties to the company 
the company also expects that future competition may arise from the development of allied or related techniques for equipment and materials that are not encompassed by the company s patents  from the issuance of patents to other companies that inhibit the company s ability to develop certain products and from the improvement to existing material and equipment technologies 
the company intends to follow a strategy of continuing product development to enhance its position to the extent practicable 
the company cannot assure you that it will be able to maintain its current position in the field or continue to compete successfully against current and future sources of competition 
if the company does not keep pace with technological change and introduce new products  it may lose revenue and demand for its products 
the company is affected by rapid technological change  changes in user and customer requirements and preferences  frequent new product and service introductions embodying new technologies and the emergence of new standards and practices  any of which could render its existing products and proprietary technology and systems obsolete 
the company believes that its future success may depend on its ability to deliver products that meet changing technology and customer needs 
the company believes that sales of its sla and sls systems have declined in part because the company has not introduced any significant advances in these products during the past three years 
to remain competitive  the company s must continually enhance and improve the functionality and features of its products  services and technologies 
the company s success will depend  in part  on its ability to develop or obtain leading technologies useful in its business  enhance its existing products  develop new products and technologies that address the increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of prospective customers  particularly in the area of material functionality  respond to technological advances and emerging industry standards and practices on a cost effective and timely basis  and recruit and retain key technology employees 
the investigation initiated by the sec in into the company s revenue recognition practices may lead to charges or penalties and may adversely affect the company s business 
if any government inquiry or other investigation leads to charges against the company  it likely will be harmed by negative publicity  the costs of litigation  the diversion of management time and other negative effects  even if the company ultimately prevails 
the sec has commenced a formal investigation into matters pertaining to the company s revenue recognition practices and has issued a subpoena requesting documents 
this matter is pending and continues to require management attention and resources 
any adverse finding by the sec may lead to significant fines and penalties and limitations on the company s activities and may harm the company s relationships with existing customers and impair its ability to attract new customers 
the company depends on a single or limited number of suppliers for components and sub assemblies used in its systems and raw materials used in its resin and other materials 
if these relationships were to terminate  the company s business could be disrupted while it locates an alternative supplier and its expenses may increase 
as discussed above  the company purchases components and sub assemblies for its systems and purchases raw materials for its resin and other materials from third party suppliers 
while there are several potential suppliers of the material components  parts and subassemblies for the company s products  the company currently uses only one or a limited number of suppliers for several of these components  including its lasers  materials and certain ink jet components 
the company s reliance on a single or limited number of vendors involves many risks including potential shortages of some key components  product performance shortfalls  and reduced control over delivery schedules  manufacturing capabilities  quality and costs 
if any of the company s suppliers suffers business disruptions or financial difficulties  or if there is any significant change in the condition of the company s relationship with the supplier  the company s cost of goods sold may increase and it may be unable quickly to obtain these components from alternative sources 
while the company believes that it can obtain all of the components necessary for its products from other manufacturers  the company requires any new supplier to become qualified pursuant to its internal procedures  which could involve a day to day process 
the company generally builds its systems based on its internal forecasts 
any unanticipated change in the source of its supplies  or unanticipated supply limitations  could increase production costs and consequently reduce margins 
in addition  certain of the company s components require an order lead time of three months or longer 
other components that currently are readily available may become more difficult to obtain in the future 
the company may experience delays in the receipt of some components 
to meet forecasted production levels  the company may be required to commit to long lead times for delivery from suppliers prior to receiving orders for its products 
if the company s forecasts exceed actual orders  it may hold large inventories of slow moving or unusable parts  which could have an adverse effect on its cash flows  profitability and results of operations 
the company faces risks associated with conducting business outside of the us  and  if the company does not manage these risks  its costs may increase  its revenues from non us operations may decline  and the company may suffer other adverse effects to its results of operations and financial condition 
a material portion of the company s revenues are derived from customers in countries outside of the us there are many risks inherent in business activities outside of the us that  unless managed properly  may adversely affect the company s profitability  including its ability to collect amounts due from customers 
the company s non us operations could be adversely affected by unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  export controls  tariffs and other barriers  social and political risks  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  seasonal reductions in business activity in certain parts of the world  particularly during the summer months in europe  reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  taxation  terrorism  and other factors  depending upon the country in which an opportunity arises 
the company s operating results vary from quarter to quarter  which could impact its stock price 
the company s operating results fluctuate from quarter to quarter and may continue to fluctuate in the future 
in some quarters  it is possible that results could be below expectations of analysts and investors 
if so  the price of its common stock may decline 
many factors  some of which are beyond its control  may cause these fluctuations in operating results 
these factors include acceptance and reliability of new products in the market  size and timing of product shipments  currency and economic fluctuations in foreign markets and other factors affecting international sales  price competition  delays in the introduction of new products  general worldwide economic conditions  changes in the mix of products and services sold  impact of ongoing litigation  and impact of changing technologies 
the price of the company s common stock may be volatile 
the company s future earnings and stock price may be subject to significant volatility  particularly on a quarterly basis 
shortfalls in the company s revenues or earnings in any given period relative to the levels expected by investors and securities analysts could immediately  significantly and adversely affect the trading price of its common stock 
historically  the company s common stock has been characterized by generally low daily trading volume  and its common stock price has been volatile 
the price of its common stock ranged from to during factors that may have a significant impact on the market price of the company s common stock include the company s perceived value in the securities markets  future announcements concerning developments affecting the company s business or those of its competitors  including the receipt of substantial orders for products  overall trends in the stock market  the impact of changes in its results of operations  its financial condition or its prospects on the perception of the company in the securities markets  changes in recommendations of securities analysts  and sales or purchase of substantial blocks of stock 
takeover defense provisions may adversely affect the market price of the company s common stock 
various provisions of the company s corporate governance documents and of delaware law may inhibit changes in control not approved by its board of directors and may have the effect of depriving the company s stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium over the prevailing market price of the company s common stock in the event of an attempted hostile takeover 
the company s board of directors is authorized to issue up to million shares of preferred stock  of which approximately million are outstanding as series b convertible preferred stock 
the board of directors is authorized to determine the price  rights  preferences and privileges of series of preferred stock without any further vote or action by the stockholders 
the rights of the holders of any preferred stock may adversely affect the rights of holders of common stock 
the company s ability to issue preferred stock gives it flexibility concerning possible acquisitions and financings  but it could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of the company s outstanding voting stock 
in addition  any preferred stock that is issued may have other rights  including economic rights  senior to the common stock  which could have a material adverse effect on the market value of the common stock 
in addition  provisions of the company s certificate of incorporation  as amended  and by laws could have the effect of discouraging potential takeover attempts or making it more difficult for stockholders to change management 
the company is subject to delaware laws that could have the effect of delaying  deterring or preventing a change in control of the company 
one of these laws prohibits the company from engaging in a business combination with any interested stockholder for a period of three years from the date that the person became an interested stockholder  unless certain conditions are met 
the number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the company s convertible subordinated debentures  convertible subordinated debentures and series b convertible preferred stock and the number of shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of outstanding stock options could dilute your ownership and negatively impact the market price for the company s common stock 
approximately  shares of the company s common stock were issuable as of december  upon the conversion of convertible securities and the exercise of outstanding stock options 
the company s convertible subordinated debentures are convertible at any time into approximately  shares of common stock 
its convertible subordinated debentures are convertible at any time into approximately  shares of common stock 
the series b convertible preferred stock is convertible at any time into approximately  shares of common stock 
approximately  shares of common stock were issuable upon the exercise of outstanding stock options 
to the extent that all of the company s subordinated debentures and the series b convertible preferred stock are converted or the company s outstanding stock options are exercised  a significantly greater number of shares of the company s common stock will be outstanding  and the interests of the company s existing stockholders may be diluted 
at the same time  any conversions of such convertible securities correspondingly would reduce the company s subordinated debt and preferred stock obligations 
moreover  future sales of substantial amounts of the company s stock in the public market  or the perception that these sales could occur  could adversely affect the market price of the company s common stock 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices  which may adversely affect its results of operations and financial condition 
the company seeks to minimize these risks through regular operating and financing activities and  when deemed appropriate  through the use of derivative financial instruments 
the company does not purchase  hold or sell derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
interest rates the company s exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to its cash investments and its outstanding industrial development bonds 
the company seeks to minimize the risk to its cash investments by investing cash in excess of its operating needs in short term  high quality instruments issued by highly credit worthy financial institutions or governments 
a hypothetical or basis point change in interest rates would not have a significant effect on the company s financial position or results of operation 
from time to time  the company may use interest rate swaps  collars or options to manage its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates 
at december  and  the company had no such financial instruments outstanding 
the fair value of the company s fixed rate debt and preferred stock  collectively referred to below as fixed rate instruments  varies with changes in interest rates and the market fluctuations for our common stock 
generally  the fair value of these fixed rate instruments will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise 
these instruments also contain options to convert them into our common stock  and the fair value of these instruments is affected by the company s stock price and stock volatility 
at december   the carrying value of the company s total debt was million of which approximately million was fixed rate debt  and the carrying value of the preferred stock was million 
at december   the carrying value of the company s total debt was million of which million was fixed rate debt 
there was no preferred stock outstanding at december  the estimated fair value of the company s total debt  which includes the cost of replacing the company s fixed rate instruments with borrowings at current market rates  was approximately million at december  compared to million at december  the fair value of the company s fixed rate instruments is an estimate  which includes discounting of the outstanding balance to reflect current market rates of interest and an estimation of the value of the conversion options based on the black scholes option model 
the black scholes option model attempts to value the options while giving effect to the term of the option  the exercise or strike price  market price of the company s stock and an estimate of the volatility of the company s common stock price 
such changes in the fair value of the company s fixed rate instruments do not alter the company s obligations to repay the outstanding principal amount of such debt or the total liquidation value of its outstanding preferred stock at maturity 
the increase in estimated fair value of fixed rate instruments during is predominantly the result of issuance of new instruments during the year  a decrease from to in the interest rate used to discount the contractual payments associated with the instruments and  with respect to the value of the conversion options  an increase in the year end market price of the company s common stock into which certain of the instruments are convertible from per share at december  to per share at december  a hypothetical or basis point change in interest rates would result in a change in the estimated fair value of the company s debt at december  of million 
foreign exchange rates at december   the company had an obligation to the former stockholders of rpc  ltd 
of million swiss francs approximately million which accrues interest at a fixed rate 
the company had not undertaken any steps to hedge its exposure for the foreign exchange risk nor the market risk for this obligation at december  as a result  the company is exposed to risks related to changes in foreign exchange rates and changes in fair value due to interest rates with respect to this obligation 
the company operates in locations outside the us that are not considered to be highly inflationary 
nevertheless  these foreign operations  which are conducted primarily by foreign sales subsidiaries  are sensitive to fluctuations in currency exchange rates arising from  among other things  intercompany transactions that are generally denominated in us dollars rather than their respective functional currency 
as discussed above  revenues from the company s operations outside the us accounted for of total revenue for the year ended december  these revenues were generated primarily from the operations of the company s foreign sales subsidiaries in their respective countries and surrounding geographic areas that are denominated either in us dollars or in the local currency of each country 
these subsidiaries incur most of their expenses other than intercompany expenses in the functional currency of their local countries  and they use the local currency as their functional currency 
the company s operating results as well as its assets and liabilities are also subject to the effect of foreign currency translation as the operating results and balance sheets of its subsidiaries outside the us are translated in consolidation into us dollars 
the realized effect of foreign currency translation in resulted in a million gain that was recorded in cost of sales  compared to million gain in and million loss in the unrealized effect of foreign currency translation in resulted in million of gain that was recorded in equity as other comprehensive income  compared to million gain in and million loss in a hypothetical change of in the foreign currency exchange rates would cause a change of million to the net assets on the balance sheet of the company and a million change in revenue in the company s consolidated statement of operations 
the company may use other derivative instruments from time to time  such as foreign exchange options to manage exposure due to foreign exchange rates and foreign currency forward contracts to fix the amount payable on certain transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
the terms of such instruments are generally twelve months or less 
the company does not hedge its foreign currency exposure in a manner that would entirely eliminate the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates on its consolidated net loss income 
at december  and  the company had no foreign exchange financial instruments outstanding 
at december   the company had cash and cash equivalents of million denominated in local currencies in its european subsidiaries 
the company has not used any derivative instruments to hedge these investments against foreign exchange rate fluctuations  and as a result is exposed to the risk of changes in the exchange rates 
commodity prices the company uses various commodity raw materials and energy products in conjunction with its manufacturing processes 
generally  the company acquires such components at market prices and does not use financial instruments to hedge commodity prices 
as a result  the company is exposed to market risks related to changes in commodity prices of these components 
a hypothetical change in commodity prices for raw materials would cause a change of million to cost of sales in the company s consolidated statement of operations
