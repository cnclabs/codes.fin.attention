we do not undertake any obligation to update forward looking statements 
the following should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements located elsewhere in this annual report on form k for the year ended december  and other documents filed by us from time to time with the securities and exchange commission 
overview we are a biotechnology company focused on the research  development and commercialization of biological therapies for cancer 
we are currently developing cell based cancer vaccines  oncolytic virus therapies and antiangiogenesis therapies to treat different types of cancer 
our clinical stage cancer programs involve cell or viral based products that have been genetically modified during product development to impart disease fighting characteristics that are not found in conventional therapeutic agents 
as part of our gvax cancer vaccines program  we have completed phase clinical trials in prostate cancer  are in ongoing phase clinical trials in lung cancer  pancreatic cancer and leukemia  and are in a phase clinical trial for multiple myeloma 
we expect to initiate a phase clinical trial for gvax prostate cancer vaccine during the second quarter of in our oncolytic virus therapies program  which we are developing in part through a global alliance with novartis ag  we are conducting a phase clinical trial in combination with radiation therapy in early stage prostate cancer patients 
in addition  we have preclinical oncolytic virus therapy programs as well as preclinical antiangiogenesis therapy programs evaluating potential therapies for multiple types of cancer 
additionally  we have a majority owned subsidiary  ceregene  inc  which is focused on gene therapies for neurological disorders  and we continue to hold approximately million shares of common stock of our former subsidiary  abgenix  inc nasdaq abgx  which is focused on the development and commercialization of antibody therapies 
critical accounting policies we consider certain accounting policies related to revenue recognition  lease accounting and income taxes to be critical policies 
there have been no material changes in our critical accounting policies from what was previously disclosed in our annual report on form k for the year ended december  revenue recognition since our inception  a substantial portion of our revenues has been generated from research and licensing agreements with collaborators 
revenue under such collaboration agreements typically includes upfront payments  cost reimbursements and milestone payments 
revenue from non refundable upfront license fees and other payments under collaboration agreements where we continue involvement throughout development is recognized over the development period based upon when the underlying development expenses are incurred 
we recognize cost reimbursement revenue under collaborative agreements as the related research and development costs are incurred  as provided for under the terms of these agreements 

table of contents incentive milestone payments under collaborative arrangements are recognized as revenue upon achievement of the incentive milestone events  which represent the culmination of the earnings process 
incentive milestone payments are triggered either by the results of our research efforts or by events external to us  such as regulatory approval to market a product or the achievement of specified sales levels by a marketing partner 
as such  the incentive milestones are substantially at risk at the inception of the contract  and the amounts of the payments assigned thereto are commensurate with the milestone achieved 
upon the achievement of an incentive milestone event  we have no future performance obligations related to that payment 
amounts received under license agreements relating to our intellectual property are recognized as revenue upon execution of the technology licensing agreement  if we have no future performance obligations 
deferred revenue represents the portion of upfront payments received that has not been earned 
lease accounting we record our obligations under facility operating lease agreements as rent expense 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded approximately million of general and administrative expense for estimated lease exit costs associated with the move of our corporate headquarters to south san francisco  california in march and the related vacancy in foster city  california 
based upon updated estimates of the rental market for comparable laboratory and office space  we subsequently revised our estimate of accrued lease exit costs and recorded an additional million of general and administrative expense in accrued lease exit costs will continue to be revised as necessary and could increase by as much as an additional million based on our ability to sublease the facilities and as market conditions change 
we will actively pursue subleasing of our former headquarter facilities in foster city  california  until these leases expire in income taxes our income tax benefits during the past three years have been based on our determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowances that might be required against these deferred tax assets 
we record valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not to be realized 
we have considered anticipated future taxable income  including future taxable income that may result from future sales of holdings of our abgenix common stock  and potential tax planning strategies in assessing the need for valuation allowances 
certain of these determinations require judgment on the part of management 
if we determine that we will be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets  adjustments to the deferred tax assets will increase income by reducing tax expense in the period that we make such determination 
likewise  if we determine that we will not be able to realize all or part of the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets in the future  adjustments to the deferred tax assets will decrease income by increasing tax expense in the period that we make such determination 
if our investment in abgenix common stock were to suffer a significant decline in value  we may be required to reverse tax benefits in future periods that were previously recorded 
significant estimates are required in determining our income tax benefits 
various internal and external factors may have favorable or unfavorable effects on our future effective tax rate 
these factors include  but are not limited to  changes in tax laws and regulations  our future levels of spending for research and development  and changes in our overall level of pre tax earnings or losses 
we believe that our reserves for these uncertainties are adequate 

table of contents results of operations revenue revenues were million in compared to million in and million in  as shown in the following table in thousands novartis ag japan tobacco inc aventis transkaryotic therapies  inc other in august  we announced that an agreement had been reached regarding outstanding clinical and patent related milestone and wind down payments from japan tobacco inc jt  in connection with the termination in of a collaboration agreement for certain gvax cancer vaccines  for which we now hold all worldwide commercial rights 
in connection with this final agreement  jt paid us approximately million in cash and waived future repayment obligations for capital expenditures associated with our manufacturing facilities in hayward  california and memphis  tennessee 
we recorded million in revenue associated with this final agreement in revenues for also included million from novartis recognized in connection with our global alliance for the development and commercialization of oncolytic virus therapies  and million in connection with our gene activation technology license agreement with aventis for gene activated erythropoietin 
we received an upfront payment of million from novartis in july  million of which was initially recorded to deferred revenue  of which million remains as deferred revenue at december  we expect to recognize the remaining million as revenue in and revenues for included million associated with a license agreement with transkaryotic therapies  inc tkt for the company s gene activation technology and million from our since terminated gvax collaboration agreement with jt 
revenues for also included million pursuant to the aventis license agreement 
revenues for included million from our gvax collaboration agreement with jt and million pursuant to the aventis license agreement 
research and development expenses research and development expenses were million in compared to million in and million in these increases can be attributed primarily to our expanding clinical trials and other product development activities in both our gvax cancer vaccines and oncolytic virus therapy programs 
we expect that our research and development expenditures and headcount will continue to increase in future years to support expanded  more advanced and more numerous clinical trials  additional manufacturing and office facilities and additional product development activities 
the rate of increase depends on a number of factors  including progress in research and development and clinical trials 
biopharmaceutical products  such as those being developed by us  may take to years to research  develop and bring to market in the united states 
drug development in the us is a process that includes several steps regulated by the fda 
the process begins with the filing of an ind  which  if successful  allows opportunity for clinical study of the potential new medicine 
clinical development typically involves three phases of study phase  and costs for each phase are generally larger than the preceding phase  as the size of the clinical trial number of patients grows 
the most significant costs associated with clinical development are the 
table of contents phase trials  as they tend to be the longest and largest studies conducted during the drug development process 
we currently have one product in development that has been targeted for the initiation of phase studies during however  the successful development of our products is highly uncertain 
estimates of product completion dates and completion costs can vary significantly for each product and are difficult to predict 
completion of clinical trials  including the phase trials that we plan to initiate in and  may take several years or more 
the length of time generally varies substantially according to the type  complexity  novelty and intended use of the product candidate 
however  we estimate that clinical trials of the type we generally conduct are usually completed over the following timelines clinical phase estimated completion period phase years phase years phase years many factors may delay our commencement and speed of completion of clinical trials  including the size and number of patients participating in the trial  the duration of patient follow up required  the number of clinical sites at which the trial is conducted  and the length of time required to locate and enroll suitable patient subjects 
various statutes and regulations also govern or influence the manufacturing  safety  labeling  storage  record keeping and marketing of each product 
the lengthy process of seeking these approvals  and the subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations  require the expenditure of substantial resources 
any failure by us to obtain  or any delay in obtaining  regulatory approvals could materially adversely affect our business 
in responding to an nda or a bla  the fda may grant marketing approval  request additional information or deny the application if it determines that the application does not provide an adequate basis for approval 
there can be no assurance that any approval required by the fda or other regulatory body will be obtained on a timely basis  if at all 
for additional discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with completing development of potential products  see other factors affecting future operations below 
included below is a summary of products and the related stage of development for each product in clinical development 
the information in the column labeled estimated completion of ongoing phase contains forward looking statements regarding timing of completion of product development phases 
our estimates of timing of completion of these trials are based on typical times of completion for trials of that type at such phases of development 
the actual timing of completion of these phases of our clinical trials could differ materially from the estimates provided in the table due to the number of patients enrolled in the trial  the number of clinical trial sites involved  the time needed to fully enroll the trial  the time required for patient follow up and other factors 
in addition  it is possible that any of these ongoing clinical trials may never be completed due to the occurrence of unacceptable treatment related side effects  lack of clinical efficacy  insufficient supply of product for these clinical trials and other factors 
for a discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with the timing of completing a product development phase  see other factors affecting future operations below 
product indication phase of development estimated completion of ongoing phase gvax prostate prostate cancer phase gvax lung non small cell lung cancer phase gvax pancreatic pancreatic cancer phase gvax leukemia acute leukemia phase gvax myeloma multiple myeloma phase cg oncolytic virus prostate cancer phase 
table of contents general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses were million in compared to million in and million in these increases can be attributed to increased headcount costs and facility related costs  including lease exit costs associated with the move of our corporate headquarters to south san francisco  california in march and the related vacancy in foster city  california  including expenses of million and million recorded in and  respectively 
future spending for general and administrative costs is expected to continue to increase in order to support our growing infrastructure needs  particularly in the areas of manufacturing and other facilities 
purchased in process technology during  we recorded a credit of  to purchased in process technology related to our acquisition of calydon  inc in the adjustment related to the return to us of a portion of the purchase price held in escrow in accordance with the terms of the purchase agreement 
in  we recorded a charge of million for the purchased in process technology from the acquisition of calydon 
we do not anticipate that there is any alternative future use for the in process technology that was expensed 
we continue to conduct research using the technology acquired in the acquisition of calydon 
gain on sale of abgenix common stock during we recorded a gain of million associated with the sale of  shares of abgenix common stock 
at december  we continued to hold approximately million shares of abgenix common stock  which had a fair market value of approximately million as of that date 
during we recorded a gain of million associated with the sale of approximately  shares of abgenix common stock 
we did not sell any abgenix common stock during interest and other income interest and other income was million in compared to million in and million in the decrease in compared to is attributed to lower average cash balances and lower interest rates 
the decrease in compared to is attributed to lower average cash balances and lower interest rates and the effect of million of realized gains earned from the sale of certain tax free securities during the first quarter of interest expense interest expense was million in compared to million in and million in the increase in compared to is primarily attributed to interest expense from the capital lease obligation for our headquarters facility in south san francisco  california  which we occupied in march the increase in compared to is primarily attributed to the million asset backed debt financing completed in december in connection with the construction of our manufacturing facility in hayward  california 
we capitalized interest expense of million and million in and  respectively  in connection with the construction of our manufacturing facility in hayward  california 
no interest expense was capitalized in income taxes we recorded a tax benefit of million in compared to million in and million in the tax benefit recorded in relates to net operating losses that we have concluded are realizable based on our estimate of future taxable income  including future taxable income that may result from future sales of holdings of our abgenix common stock  and thus our ability to carry forward these losses to offset that potential 
table of contents future taxable income 
the tax benefits recorded in and primarily related to our ability to carry back and net operating losses to the tax year 
if our investment in abgenix were to suffer a decline in value  we may be required to reverse tax benefits in future periods that were previously recorded 
at december   we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million 
the net operating losses will expire in the years through  if not utilized 
liquidity and capital resources at december   we had approximately million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  of which million is classified as restricted cash  primarily related to one of our outstanding debt financings 
information regarding the classification of these assets is included in note of notes to consolidated financial statements included under item of this annual report on form k 
we have maintained our financial position through strategic management of our resources including our holdings in abgenix common stock  the availability of debt financing and by relying on funding from various corporate collaborations and licensing agreements 
at december  we continued to hold approximately million shares of abgenix common stock  which had a fair market value of approximately million as of that date 
additionally  in february  our shelf registration statement was declared effective by the securities and exchange commission under the securities act of  as amended  which allows us to offer up to million of securities on short notice in one or more public offerings 
however  there can be no assurance we will be able to issue such securities on acceptable terms  or at all 
net cash used in operating activities was million in compared to million in and million in this increase was due primarily to million in increased pre tax losses offset by million in additional income tax benefits and the receipt of million from a license agreement with transkaryotic therapies  inc cash requirements for operating activities are expected to increase in future periods  due in part to significant costs related to the phase trials that we expect to initiate in and the timing of these cash requirements may vary from period to period depending on our research and development activities  including our planned preclinical and clinical trials  obligations related to our existing manufacturing and headquarter facilities  and future requirements to establish manufacturing and marketing capabilities for any products that we may develop 
net cash used by investing activities  which includes capital expenditures  was million in compared to million in and to net cash provided by investing activities of million in capital expenditures were million in compared to million in and million in capital expenditures for all periods consisted primarily of expenses incurred in connection with the construction of our cgmp manufacturing facilities for our phase trials and future market launch in hayward and san diego  california  and memphis  tennessee  as well as leasehold improvements for our corporate headquarters in south san francisco  california  to which we moved in march we currently have three cgmp manufacturing facilities located in hayward and san diego  california and memphis  tennessee 
we have completed the construction necessary at our cgmp manufacturing facility for non patient specific gvax cancer vaccines located in hayward  california for initiation of our first phase trial  and manufacturing is currently underway at this facility 
patient specific gvax lung cancer vaccines are being manufactured for an ongoing phase clinical trial at our cgmp manufacturing facility in memphis  tennessee 
in  we completed modifications of our cgmp manufacturing facility in san diego  california for the manufacture of viral based products and have since used this facility to supply product for clinical trials 
results for the period also include million in net proceeds from the sale of  shares of abgenix common stock 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in compared to million in and million in in july  we received a million upfront payment from novartis ag  of which million was attributed to the issuance of an aggregate of  shares of our common stock to novartis and gti  and the remaining million was attributed to deferred revenue 
in september  we borrowed million from silicon valley bank under a five year term loan agreement 
in  we borrowed 
table of contents million from fleet national bank under an asset backed debt financing in connection with the construction of our manufacturing in hayward  california 
we did not enter into any significant financing activities in we have financed our operations primarily through the sale of equity securities  funding under collaborative arrangements  sales of abgenix common stock and secured debt financing 
during and  we received and million in net proceeds from the sale of  and approximately  shares of abgenix common stock  respectively 
we did not sell any abgenix stock in our retained ownership of abgenix common stock represents a material portion of our working capital 
the common stock price of abgenix has proven to be highly volatile  which has a direct impact on our liquidity and capital resources 
to the extent that we continue to hold a substantial amount of these shares  our working capital position can be expected to continue to fluctuate in future periods 
the value of our investment in abgenix common stock was million at december  and million at december  in connection with a gain on sale of abgenix common stock in  we paid million in federal and state income taxes 
since we have received million in tax refunds from the carryback of losses 
we have additional unutilized net operating loss nol carryforwards  although the future utilization of these nol carryforwards is limited by internal revenue code section  which imposes an annual limitation on taxable income that can be offset by nol s following a change in control 
for irs purposes we experienced a change in control during our acquisition of somatix in it is our current intention to minimize future tax liabilities on sales of abgenix common stock by offsetting gains against current operating losses and the nol carryforwards allowed under section in addition  we have certain research and development tax credits that we may utilize to offset the tax effects of such gains 
however  under some circumstances we may sell more abgenix common stock  and consequently recognize gains in excess of the amount we can offset with net operating losses and credit carryforwards 
our long term contractual obligations at december  were as follows in thousands payment due total and and and thereafter debt financing facility lease obligation operating leases in july  we received million from novartis in connection with a global alliance for the development and commercialization of oncolytic virus therapies  of which million remained dedicated to the further development of these products at december  we expect to spend these remaining funds in and our operating lease commitments include rent payments through january for our foster city location of million  of which million was accrued at december  as part of the estimated facility exit costs associated with the move to our south san francisco  california headquarters building in march accrued lease exit costs will continue to be revised as necessary and could increase by as much as an additional million based on our ability to sublease the facilities and as market conditions change 
we expect to receive million in aggregate future rentals under a related existing sublease through january we lease certain of our facilities and equipment under non cancelable operating leases 
these leases  including the hayward  foster city  san diego and memphis facility leases  expire at various dates through and some contain options for renewal 
the south san francisco headquarters facility lease is recorded as a capital lease as a result of certain amendments that required us to fund the costs of certain structural components of the facility 
ceregene  our majority owned subsidiary focused on gene therapies for neurodegenerative disorders  also maintains a facility operating lease and capital leases to fund the purchases of furniture and machinery equipment 

table of contents in april we amended the terms of our million asset backed debt financing 
under the amendment  the quarterly principal payments have been replaced with a single payment in  and the interest rate was reduced from libor london interbank offering rate plus percent to libor plus percent 
the financing obligation remains secured by liquid financial instruments  including cash and marketable securities  which are classified as restricted cash and investments on our consolidated balance sheet 
in september we borrowed million under a five year term loan agreement 
the loan bears interest at a rate of percent  which rate is subject to upward adjustment upon certain events or defaults 
we are required to make monthly interest only payments for the first year  followed by monthly principal and interest payments  based on an month amortization schedule  for the next months 
a final loan payment of approximately million is due in september the loan is secured by certain assets  other than our intellectual property assets  deposits in certain investment accounts and holdings of abgenix common stock 
we estimate that our cash to be used in operating activities during will be approximately to million 
this estimated use of cash does not include capital expenditures or the cost of any potential acquisitions  nor does it reflect the potential offset by future sales of abgenix stock or equity or debt financings 
our capital requirements depend on numerous factors  including the progress of our research and development programs and our preclinical and clinical trials  clinical and commercial scale manufacturing requirements  the extent of funding from collaborative partners  the acquisition of new products or technologies  and the cost and outcome of litigation  patent interference proceedings or other legal proceedings 
our ongoing development programs and any increase in the number and size of programs and trials will reduce our current cash resources and potentially create the need to raise further capital 
therefore  we will continue to consider financing alternatives  including potential equity and debt financings in addition to periodic sales of our holdings of abgenix stock 
while we believe that our current liquidity position will be sufficient to meet our cash needs for at least the next year  we may need to raise substantial additional funds in order to complete our pending and planned trials over their multi year course before we will obtain product revenue  if any  from such products 
accordingly  we may entertain the possibility of raising additional capital to preserve our liquidity  depending on a number of conditions  including conditions in the capital markets 
the sources of liquidity available to us include the sale of abgenix common stock  payments from potential partners and or licensees of our potential products and technologies  and private or public placement of cell genesys equity securities  warrants  debt securities or depositary shares 
we regularly consider the conditions of capital markets  dilution  stockholder value and tax consequences of each type of financing on stockholders 
certain of the financing options available to us may have negative consequences to stockholders such as dilution 
given the volatile nature of the capital markets  decisions to raise capital may require actions that would impose a negative consequence in order to reduce or minimize a more significant negative consequence to stockholders 

table of contents other factors affecting future operations investors should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision 
the risks described below are not the only ones facing our company 
additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also impair our business operations 
our business could be harmed by any of these risks 
the trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks  and investors may lose all or part of their investment 
in assessing these risks  investors should also refer to the other information contained or incorporated by reference in this annual report on form k  including our consolidated financial statements and related notes 
risks related to our company our products are in developmental stage  are not approved for commercial sale and might not ever receive regulatory approval or become commercially viable 
all of our potential cancer vaccines  oncolytic virus therapies and antiangiogenesis therapy products are in research and development 
we have not generated any revenues from the sale of products 
we do not expect to generate any revenues from product sales for at least the next several years 
our products currently under development will require significant additional research and development efforts  including extensive preclinical and clinical testing and regulatory approval  prior to commercial use 
our research and development efforts may not be successful  and any of our future products may not be ultimately commercially successful 
even if developed  our products may not receive regulatory approval or be successfully introduced and marketed at prices that would permit us to operate profitably 
our cancer vaccines and oncolytic virus therapies must undergo exhaustive clinical testing and may not prove to be safe or effective 
if any of our proposed products are delayed or fail  we may have to curtail our operations 
there are many reasons that potential products that appear promising at an early stage of research or development do not result in commercially successful products 
clinical trials may be suspended or terminated if safety issues are identified  if our investigators or we fail to comply with regulations governing clinical trials or for other reasons 
although we are testing some of our proposed products and therapies in human clinical trials  we cannot guarantee that we  the fda or the institutional review boards at our research institutions will not suspend or terminate any of our clinical trials  that we will be permitted to undertake human clinical trials for any of our other products or that adequate numbers of patients can be recruited for our clinical trials 
also  the results of this testing might not demonstrate the safety or efficacy of these products 
even if clinical trials are successful  we might not obtain regulatory approval for any indication 
preclinical and clinical data can be interpreted in many different ways  and fda officials could interpret data that we consider promising differently  which could halt or delay our clinical trials or prevent regulatory approval 
finally  even if our products proceed successfully through clinical trials and receive regulatory approval  there is no guarantee that an approved product can be manufactured in commercial quantities at reasonable cost or that such a product will be successfully marketed 
our programs utilize new technologies 
existing preclinical and clinical data on the safety and efficacy of our programs are limited 
our gvax cancer vaccines and oncolytic virus therapies are currently being tested in human clinical trials to determine their safety and efficacy 
none of our other products or therapies under development is in human clinical trials 
the results of preclinical or earlier stage clinical trials do not necessarily predict safety or efficacy in humans 
our products in later stage clinical trials may fail to show desired safety and efficacy  despite having progressed through preclinical or early clinical trials 
serious and potentially life threatening side effects may be discovered during preclinical and clinical testing of our potential products or thereafter  which could delay  halt or interrupt clinical trials of our products  and could result in the fda or other regulatory authorities denying approval of our drugs for any or all indications 
in the case of patient specific therapies such as our gvax lung cancer vaccine  the risks of any surgical procedure that may 
table of contents be required to prepare the vaccine must be considered in the evaluation of the product s safety profile 
all surgical procedures  particularly those in advanced disease settings  involve some element of risk to the patient  which must be evaluated in the context of the patient s condition and therapeutic alternatives 
in past and current clinical trials involving patients with very advanced stages of lung cancer  a small number of patients with progressive disease have died during the period following surgical removal of their tumor and prior to administration of gvax vaccine 
the fda has informed us that additional deaths associated with the procurement of the tumor that occur in the future will result in a reassessment of the overall risk benefit profile of our current study and may result in termination of the trial 
we have voluntarily limited the types of tumor removal procedures that will be performed in this trial to those with lower risk of post operative patient death  and we have revised the eligibility criteria to exclude certain high risk patients from the trial 
these precautionary measures are intended to minimize  but cannot entirely eliminate  the risk that there will be other post operative deaths following the tumor procurement procedures 
clinical trials are very costly and time consuming  especially the typically larger phase trials which we expect to initiate during the next twelve months 
we cannot exactly predict if and when our current clinical trials will be completed 
we also cannot exactly predict when other planned clinical trials  including planned phase trials of our gvax cancer vaccines  will begin or be completed 
though we anticipate commencing our phase trial of gvax prostate cancer vaccine during the second quarter of  we cannot guarantee that we will be able to begin the phase trial within that timeframe 
the anticipated phase trial of our gvax prostate cancer vaccine is our first phase trial 
many factors affect patient enrollment in clinical trials  including the size of the patient population  the proximity of patients to clinical sites  the eligibility criteria for the trial  competing clinical trials and new therapies approved for the conditions that we are investigating 
in addition to delays in patient enrollment  other unforeseen developments  including delays in obtaining regulatory approvals to commence a study  delays in identifying and reaching agreement on acceptable terms with prospective clinical trial sites  lack of effectiveness during clinical trials  unforeseen safety issues  uncertain dosing issues  inability to monitor patients adequately during or after treatment  our or our investigators failure to comply with fda regulations governing clinical trials  and an inability or unwillingness of medical investigators to follow our clinical protocols  could prevent or delay completion of a clinical trial and increase its costs  which could also prevent or delay any eventual commercial sale of the therapy that is the subject of the trial 
each of our anticipated phase clinical trials of gvax prostate cancer vaccine will compare gvax vaccine to a taxane chemotherapy regimen  which is widely used to treat this patient group 
however  there can be no assurance that this chemotherapy regimen will continue to be commonly used to treat these patients in the future 
third party trials to evaluate taxane chemotherapy are currently underway 
should these or other trials demonstrate that another therapy or regimen is more effective than the taxane chemotherapy regimen to which we compare the gvax vaccine  we will need to modify our current phase clinical trial strategy for gvax prostate cancer vaccine or possibly conduct additional comparative clinical trials 
we have not been profitable in our operations absent the gains on sales of abgenix common stock and certain upfront or non recurring license fees 
we expect to continue to incur substantial losses and negative cash flow from operations and may not become profitable in the future 
we have incurred an accumulated deficit since our inception 
at december   our accumulated deficit was million 
our accumulated deficit would be substantially higher absent the gains we have realized on sales of our abgenix common stock 
for the year ended december   we recorded a loss attributed to common stockholders of million  which included million in non recurring revenue from japan tobacco inc and million in gains on sales of our abgenix common stock 
we expect to incur substantial operating losses for at least the next several years and potentially longer 
this is due primarily to the expansion of research and development programs  clinical trials and manufacturing activities and  to a lesser extent  general and administrative expenses 
we also have substantial lease obligations related to our new manufacturing and headquarter facilities 
we expect that losses will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and that these fluctuations may be substantial 
we cannot guarantee that we will successfully develop  manufacture  commercialize or market any products  or that we will ever achieve profitability 

table of contents we will need substantial additional funds to continue operations  and our ability to generate funds depends on many factors beyond our control 
we will need substantial additional funds for existing and planned preclinical and clinical trials  to continue research and development activities  for lease obligations related to our manufacturing and headquarter facilities  for principal and interest payments related to our debt financing obligations and to establish marketing capabilities for any products we may develop 
at some point in the future  we will also need to raise additional capital to further fund our operations 
our future capital requirements will depend on  and could increase as a result of  many factors  such as the progress and scope of our internally funded research  development and commercialization activities  our ability to establish new collaborations and the terms of those collaborations  competing technological and market developments  the time and cost of regulatory approval  the extent to which we choose to commercialize our future products through our own sales and marketing capabilities  the costs we incur in obtaining and enforcing patent and other proprietary rights or gaining the freedom to operate under the patents of others  our success in acquiring and integrating complementary products  technologies or businesses  and the extent to which we choose to expand and develop our manufacturing capacities  including manufacturing capacities necessary to meet potential commercial requirements 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of  or eliminate one or more of our research  development or clinical activities 
we plan to raise additional funds through collaborative business relationships  sales of some portion or all of our investment in abgenix common stock  additional equity or debt financings  or otherwise  but we may not be able to do any of the foregoing on favorable terms  or at all 
because of our long term capital requirements  we may seek to access the public or private debt and equity markets  by selling our holdings of abgenix common stock and or our own debt or equity securities 
additional funding may not be available to us  and  if available  may not be on acceptable terms 
opportunities for out licensing technologies or for third party collaborations may not be available to us on acceptable terms  or at all 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of  or eliminate one or more of our research  development or clinical activities 
in addition  we may decide to raise additional capital when conditions are favorable  even when we do not have an immediate need for additional capital at that time 
if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities  stockholders will incur immediate dilution 
alternatively  we may need to seek funds through arrangements with collaborative partners or others that require us to relinquish rights to technologies or product candidates that we would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize ourselves 
either of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition or cash flow 
currently  we do not have collaborative partners for the further development of our gvax cancer vaccines 
though we plan to seek such partners in the future  we may not be successful in entering into collaborative partnerships on favorable terms  if at all 
certain of our oncolytic virus therapy products are being developed under our global strategic alliance with novartis  and novartis has future commercialization rights for these products 
also  we can give no assurance that our alliance with novartis will continue  as novartis periodically has the option of terminating the alliance at its discretion 

table of contents our ability to manufacture our products is uncertain  which may delay or impair our ability to develop  test and commercialize our products 
we have built our own manufacturing facilities to operate according to the fda s cgmp regulations for the manufacture of products for clinical trials and to support the potential commercial launch of our product candidates 
we are under significant lease obligations for each of our facilities 
we may be unable to establish and maintain our manufacturing facilities within our planned time and budget  which could have a material adverse effect on our product development timelines 
our manufacturing facilities will be subject to ongoing  periodic inspection by the fda and state agencies to ensure compliance with cgmp 
our failure to follow and document our adherence to such cgmp regulations or other regulatory requirements may lead to significant delays in the availability of products for commercial use or clinical study  may result in the termination or hold on a clinical study  or may delay or prevent filing or approval of marketing applications for our products 
we also may encounter problems with the following achieving consistent and acceptable production yield and costs  meeting product release specifications  quality control and assurance  shortages of qualified manufacturing personnel  shortages of raw materials  shortages of key contractors  and ongoing compliance with fda and other regulations 
failure to comply with applicable regulations could also result in sanctions being imposed on us  including fines  injunctions  civil penalties  failure of regulatory authorities to grant marketing approval of our products  delays  suspension or withdrawal of approvals  license revocation  seizures or recalls of products  operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions  any of which could harm our business 
developing advanced manufacturing techniques and process controls is required to fully utilize our expanded facilities 
the manufacturing techniques and process controls  as well as the product release specifications  required for our gvax cancer vaccines and oncolytic virus therapies are more complex and less well established than those required for other biopharmaceutical products  including small molecules  therapeutic proteins and monoclonal antibodies 
we may not be able to develop these techniques and process controls to manufacture our products effectively to meet the demands of regulatory agencies  clinical testing and commercial production 
in addition  during the course of the development and testing of our products  we may make and have made improvements to processes  formulations or manufacturing methods or employ different manufacturing facilities 
such changes may be made to improve the product s potential efficacy  make it easier to manufacture at scale  reduce variability or the chance of contamination of the product  or for other reasons 
as a result  certain of the products we are currently testing in clinical trials  including our most advanced products  are not identical to those used in previous clinical trials from which we have reported clinical data 
we may be required to conduct certain laboratory studies to demonstrate the comparability of our products if we introduce additional manufacturing changes 
we cannot guarantee that the results of studies using the current versions of our products will be as successful as the results of earlier studies conducted using different versions of our products 
if we are unable to manufacture our products for any reason  our options for outsourcing manufacturing are currently limited 
we are unaware of available contract manufacturing facilities on a worldwide basis in which our gvax product candidates can be manufactured under cgmp regulations  a requirement for all pharmaceutical products 
it would take a substantial period of time for a contract manufacturing facility that has not been producing our particular products to begin producing them under cgmp regulations 

table of contents our manufacturing facilities are subject to licensing requirements of the dea  the california department of health services and the tennessee department of commerce and insurance  board of pharmacy  referred to as the tennessee board of pharmacy 
while not yet subject to license by the fda  these facilities are subject to inspection by the fda  as well as by the dea  the california department of health services and the tennessee board of pharmacy 
failure to maintain these licenses or to meet the inspection criteria of these agencies would disrupt our manufacturing processes and have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flow 
in order to produce our products in the quantities that we believe will be required to meet anticipated market demand  we will need to increase  or scale up  the production process by a significant factor over the current level of production 
if we are unable to do so  or if the cost of this scale up is not economically feasible for us  we may not be able to produce our products in a sufficient quantity to meet the requirements for product launch or future demand 
if our proposed products are not effectively protected by issued patents or if we are not otherwise able to protect our proprietary information  we will be more vulnerable to competitors  and our business could be adversely affected 
we rely heavily on the development and protection of our intellectual property portfolio 
the patent positions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology firms  including ours  are generally uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions 
as of december  we had approximately patents issued or granted to us or available to us based on licensing arrangements and approximately applications pending in our name or available to us based on licensing arrangements 
although we are prosecuting patent applications  we cannot be certain whether any given application will result in the issuance of a patent or  if any patent is issued  whether it will provide significant proprietary protection or whether it will be invalidated 
also  depending upon their filing date  patent applications in the united states are confidential until patents are published or issued 
publication of discoveries in scientific or patent literature tends to lag behind actual discoveries by several months 
accordingly  we cannot be sure that we were the first creator of inventions covered by pending patent applications or that we were the first to file patent applications for these inventions 
in addition  to the extent we license our intellectual property to other parties  we may incur expenses as a result of contractual agreements in which we indemnify these licensing parties against losses incurred if our intellectual property infringes upon the rights of others 
our intellectual property may be challenged by our competitors in the future  which may have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flow 
our commercial success depends in part on not infringing the patents or proprietary rights of others and not breaching licenses granted to us 
we are aware of competing intellectual property relating to both our programs in cancer vaccines and oncolytic virus therapies 
while we currently believe we have freedom to operate in these areas  others may challenge our position in the future 
we may be required to obtain licenses to third party technologies or genes necessary in order to market our products 
any failure to license any technologies or genes required to commercialize our technologies or products at reasonable cost may have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flow 
we may have to engage in litigation  which could result in substantial cost  to enforce our patents or to determine the scope and validity of other parties proprietary rights 
to determine the priority of inventions  the united states patent and trademark office frequently declares interference proceedings 
in europe  patents can be revoked through opposition proceedings 
these proceedings could result in an adverse decision as to the priority of our inventions 
we are currently involved in several interference and or opposition proceedings related to our current product portfolio and certain of our core technologies 
we cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings 
an 
table of contents adverse result in any of these proceedings could have an adverse effect on our intellectual property position in these areas and on our business as a whole 
if we lose in any such proceeding  our patents or patent applications that are the subject matter of the proceeding may be invalidated or may not be permitted to issue as patents 
consequently  we may be required to obtain a license from the prevailing party in order to continue the portion of our business that relates to the proceeding 
such license may not be available to us on acceptable terms or on any terms  and we may have to discontinue that portion of our business 
we may be involved in other interference and or opposition proceedings in the future 
we believe that there will continue to be significant litigation in the industry regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
our competitive position may be adversely affected by our limited ability to protect and control unpatented trade secrets  know how and other technological innovation 
our competitors may independently develop similar or better proprietary information and techniques and disclose them publicly 
also  others may gain access to our trade secrets  and we may not be able to meaningfully protect our rights to our unpatented trade secrets 
we require our employees and consultants to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting relationships with us 
these agreements provide that all confidential information developed by or made known to an individual during the course of the employment or consulting relationship generally must be kept confidential 
in the case of employees  the agreements provide that all inventions relating to our business conceived by the employee while employed by us are our exclusive property 
these agreements may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of such information 
our competitors may develop therapies for the diseases that we are targeting that are more advanced or more effective than ours  which could adversely affect our competitive position  or they may commercialize products more rapidly than we do  which may adversely affect our competitive position 
there are many companies pursuing programs for the treatment of cancer 
some of these competitors are large pharmaceutical companies  such as aventis and bristol myers squibb  which have greater experience and resources than we do in developing products  in undertaking preclinical testing and human clinical trials of new pharmaceutical products  in obtaining fda and other regulatory approvals of products  and in manufacturing and marketing new therapies 
we are also competing with other biotechnology companies with similar experience and resources to ours  but which may have programs that are in a later stage of clinical testing than ours  such as dendreon corporation  antigenics  inc and cancervax  inc 
some competitors are pursuing a product development strategy competitive with ours  particularly with respect to our cancer vaccine and oncolytic virus therapy programs 
certain of these competitive products are in more advanced stages of product development and clinical trials 
we compete with other clinical stage companies and institutions for clinical trial participants  which could reduce our ability to recruit participants for our clinical trials 
delay in recruiting clinical trial participants could adversely affect our ability to bring a product to market prior to our competitors 
our competitors may develop technologies and products that are more effective than ours  or that would render our technology and products less competitive or obsolete 
our competitive position and those of our competitors can vary based on the performance of products in clinical trials 
in addition  our competitors may obtain patent protection or fda approval and commercialize products more rapidly than we do  which may impact future sales of our products 
we also may not have the access that some of our competitors have to biological materials necessary to support the research  development or manufacturing of planned therapies 
if we are permitted by the fda to commence commercial sales of products  we will also be competing with respect to marketing capabilities and manufacturing efficiency  areas in 
table of contents which we have limited or no experience 
we expect that competition among products approved for sale will be based  among other things  on product efficacy  price  safety  reliability  availability  patent protection  and sales  marketing and distribution capabilities 
our competitive position also depends upon our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel  develop proprietary products or processes  and secure sufficient funding for the often lengthy period between product conception and commercial sales 
to the extent we depend on strategic partners to sell  market or distribute our products  we will have reduced control over the success of the sales  marketing and distribution of our future products 
we have no experience in sales  marketing or distribution of biopharmaceutical products 
we may in the future rely on sales  marketing and distribution expertise of potential corporate partners for our initial products 
the decision to market future products directly or through corporate partners will be based on a number of factors  including market size and concentration  size and expertise of the partner s sales force in a particular market  and our overall strategic objectives 
if we choose to rely on strategic partners for the sale  marketing or distribution of our future products  we will have less control over the success of our products and will depend heavily upon our partners abilities and dedication to our products 
we cannot assure you that these future strategic partnerships will be available on favorable terms  if at all  nor can we assure you that they will enhance our business 
we may in the future be exposed to product liability claims  which could adversely affect our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flow 
clinical trials or marketing of any of our potential products may expose us to liability claims resulting from the use of our products 
these claims might be made by clinical trial participants  consumers  health care providers or sellers of our products 
we currently maintain product liability insurance with respect to each of our clinical trials 
we may not be able to maintain insurance or obtain sufficient coverage at a reasonable cost  given the increasing cost of insurance in today s insurance market 
an inability to maintain insurance at an acceptable cost  or at all  could prevent or inhibit the clinical testing or commercialization of our products or otherwise affect our financial condition 
a claim  particularly resulting from a clinical trial  on any of our insurance policies or a product recall could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flow 
our business  financial condition and results of operations could suffer as a result of future strategic acquisitions and investments 
we may engage in future acquisitions or investments that could dilute our existing stockholders or cause us to incur contingent liabilities  commitments  debt or significant expense 
from time to time  in the ordinary course of business  we may evaluate potential acquisitions or investments in related businesses  products or technologies  although we currently have no commitments or agreements for any such acquisitions or investments 
we may not be successful with any strategic acquisition or investment 
any future acquisition or investment could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents if we engage in future acquisitions  we may not be able to fully integrate the acquired companies and their intellectual property or personnel 
our attempts to do so may place additional burdens on our management and infrastructure 
future acquisitions will also subject us to a number of risks  including the loss of key personnel and business relationships  difficulties associated with assimilating and integrating the new personnel and operations of the acquired companies  the potential disruption of our ongoing business  the expense associated with maintenance of diverse standards  controls  procedures  employees and clients  the diversion of resources from the development of our own proprietary technology  and our inability to generate revenue from acquired technology sufficient to meet our objectives in undertaking the acquisition or even to offset the associated acquisition and maintenance costs 
our operations are vulnerable to interruption by fire  earthquake  power loss  telecommunications failure  terrorist activity and other events beyond our control  which could result in a material adverse effect on our business 
our facilities in california have  in the past  been subject to electrical blackouts as a result of a shortage of available electrical power 
future blackouts could disrupt the operations of our facilities 
in addition  we do not carry sufficient business interruption insurance to compensate us for actual losses from interruption of our business that may occur  and any losses or damages incurred by us could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we are vulnerable to a major earthquake and other calamities 
most of our facilities are located in seismically active regions 
we have not undertaken a systematic analysis of the potential consequences to our business and financial results from a major earthquake and do not have a recovery plan for fire  earthquake  power loss  terrorist activity or similar disasters 
we are unable to predict the effects of any such event  but the effects could be seriously harmful to our business 
we depend on our key technical and management personnel to advance our technology  and the loss of these personnel could impair the development of our products 
we rely and will continue to rely on our key management and scientific staff  all of whom are employed at will 
the loss of key personnel or the failure to recruit necessary additional qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
there is intense competition from other companies  research and academic institutions and other organizations for qualified personnel 
we may not be able to continue to attract and retain the qualified personnel necessary for the development of our business 
we will need to continue to recruit experts in the areas of clinical testing  manufacturing  marketing and distribution and to develop additional expertise in our existing personnel 
if we do not succeed in recruiting necessary personnel or developing this expertise  our business could suffer significantly 
we depend on clinical trial arrangements with public and private medical institutions to advance our technology  and the loss of these arrangements could impair the development of our products 
we have arrangements with a number of public and private medical institutions for the conduct of human clinical trials for our gvax cancer vaccine programs and oncolytic virus therapies 
the early termination of any of these clinical trial arrangements or the failure of these institutions to comply with the regulations and requirements governing clinical trials would hinder the progress of our clinical trial program 
if any of these relationships are terminated  the clinical trials might not be completed  and the results might not be evaluable 

table of contents inventions or processes discovered by our outside scientific collaborators may not become our property  which may affect our competitive position 
we rely on the continued availability of outside scientific collaborators performing research 
these relationships generally may be terminated at any time by the collaborator  typically by giving days notice 
these scientific collaborators are not our employees 
as a result  we have limited control over their activities and can expect that only limited amounts of their time will be dedicated to our activities 
our arrangements with these collaborators  as well as those with our scientific consultants  provide that any rights we obtain as a result of their research efforts will be subject to the rights of the research institutions for which they work 
in addition  some of these collaborators have consulting or other advisory arrangements with other entities that may conflict with their obligations to us 
for these reasons  inventions or processes discovered by our scientific collaborators or consultants may not become our property 
our stock price is influenced by the market price of abgenix stock  which has been highly volatile 
our retained ownership of abgenix common stock represents a material portion of the total assets on our balance sheet 
the common stock price of abgenix has proven to be highly volatile 
the value of our holdings of abgenix common stock was million at december  compared to million at december  movements in the price of abgenix common stock  up or down  may exert corresponding influences on the market price of our stock 
our stock price has fluctuated in the past and is likely to continue to be volatile in the future 
the stock prices of biopharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  including ours  have historically been highly volatile 
since january   our stock price has fluctuated between a high closing price of on december  and a low closing price of on march  the market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
the following factors  among others  may affect our stock price announcements of data from  or material developments in  our clinical trials or those of our competitors  including delays in the commencement of a clinical trial  fluctuations in our financial results  announcements of technological innovations or new therapeutic products by us or our competitors  including innovations or products by our competitors that may require us to redesign  and therefore delay  our clinical trials to account for those innovations or products  announcements of changes in governmental regulation affecting us or our competitors  announcements of regulatory approval or disapproval of our or our competitors products  announcements of new collaborative relationships by us or our competitors  developments in patent or other proprietary rights affecting us or our competitors  public concern as to the safety of products developed by us or other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies  general market conditions  fluctuations in the price of abgenix common stock  material developments related to our majority owned subsidiary  ceregene  fluctuations in price and volume in the stock market in general  or in the trading of the stock of biopharmaceutical and biotechnology companies in particular  that are unrelated to our operating performance  
table of contents issuances of securities in equity  debt or other financings or issuances of common stock upon conversion of our remaining series b redeemable convertible preferred stock  sales of common stock by existing stockholders  and the perception that such issuances or sales could occur 
our stockholders may be diluted by the conversion of outstanding series b redeemable convertible preferred stock 
as of december   shares of series b redeemable convertible preferred stock  referred to as the series b preferred  issued in january remained outstanding and were convertible into an aggregate of  shares of common stock as of that date 
the holders of the series b preferred may choose at any time to convert their shares into common stock 
conversion of the series b preferred would result in issuance of additional shares of common stock  diluting existing common stockholders 
the number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the series b preferred is determined by dividing the market value of the shares to be converted by the lower of a fixed conversion price of per share subject to antidilution provisions  or the average of certain trading prices during the ten trading days preceding such date of conversion 
the market value of the series b preferred is based on the outstanding carrying value from the original issuance plus the deemed dividend earned over the holding period 
as of december   the aggregate market value for all outstanding series b preferred was approximately million 
the number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the series b preferred  and therefore the dilution of existing common stockholders  could increase as a result of either an event triggering the antidilution rights of the series b preferred or a decline in the market price of our common stock immediately prior to conversion of the series b preferred 
during the year ended december   shares of the company s series b preferred were converted into  shares of the company s common stock at an average effective conversion price of per common share 
in the event the holders of the remaining outstanding series b preferred do not convert their shares  the shares will automatically be converted on january  according to the formula described above 
our stockholders may be diluted by the exercise of outstanding stock options or other issuances of our common stock 
substantially all shares of common stock for which our outstanding stock options are exercisable are  once they have been purchased  eligible for immediate sale in the public market 
issuance of common stock or the exercise of stock options would dilute existing investors 
we have adopted anti takeover defenses that could make it difficult for another company to acquire control of us or could limit the price investors might be willing to pay for our stock 
certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation  bylaws and delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if doing so would benefit our stockholders 
these provisions include the adoption of a stockholder rights plan  commonly known as a poison pill 
under the stockholder rights plan  we made a dividend distribution of one preferred share purchase right for each share of our common stock outstanding as of august  and each share of our common stock issued after that date 
in july  we made certain technical changes to amend the plan and extended the term of such plan until the rights are exercisable only if an acquirer purchases percent or more of our common stock or announces a tender offer for percent or more of our common stock 
upon exercise  holders other than the acquirer may purchase our stock 
table of contents at a discount 
our board of directors may terminate the rights plan at any time or under certain circumstances redeem the rights 
because the rights may substantially dilute the stock ownership of a person or group attempting to take us over without the approval of our board of directors  the plan could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us or a significant percentage of our outstanding capital stock without first negotiating with our board of directors regarding such acquisition 
these provisions and certain provisions of the delaware general corporation law may have the effect of deterring hostile takeovers or otherwise delaying or preventing changes in our management or in the control of our company  including transactions in which our stockholders might otherwise receive a premium over the fair market value of our common stock 
due to the potential value of our strategic investments  we could be determined to be an investment company  and if such a determination were made  we would become subject to significant regulation that would adversely affect our business 
our non controlling positions in abgenix and  should we lose our controlling position  ceregene  along with investments of our available cash resources in certain types of fixed income securities  could be considered investment securities under the investment company act of investment company act  raising a question of whether we are an investment company required to register and be regulated under the investment company act 
regulation under the investment company act  or a determination that we failed to register when required to do so  could materially and adversely affect our business 
we believe that we are primarily engaged in the research  development and commercialization of biological cancer therapies and that any investment securities are ancillary to our primary business 
nevertheless  to address any uncertainty in this regard  we will redeploy a portion of our existing portfolio to invest more heavily in money market funds and us government securities and to reduce the level of investment in corporate bonds and other instruments that could be considered investment securities 
in addition  over time we plan to reduce the level of our investment securities by disposing of our holdings in abgenix 
we may also be required to reduce the level of our investment in entities we may not control in the future such as ceregene so as to reduce our holdings of investment securities 
these dispositions may be effected under unfavorable market conditions 
the lower rates of return expected from the redeployment of our investment portfolio  and any required dispositions of non controlling investments  could adversely affect our future reported results 
risks related to our industry in order for our products to be offered to the public  they must undergo extensive clinical testing and receive approval from the fda  which could delay or prevent the commercialization of our products 
human therapeutic products must undergo rigorous preclinical and clinical testing and other premarket approval procedures by the fda and similar authorities in foreign countries 
preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of potential products and animal studies to assess the potential safety and efficacy of the product and its formulations 
clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to healthy volunteers or to patients under the supervision of a qualified principal investigator 
clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with fda good clinical practices under protocols that detail the objectives of the study  the parameters to be used to monitor safety and the efficacy criteria to be evaluated 
the developer of the drug must provide information relating to the characterization of the product before administration to the patients participating in the clinical trials 
this requires developing approved assays of the product to test before and after administration to the patient 
in addition  developers of pharmaceutical products must provide periodic data regarding clinical trials to the fda  and the fda may issue a clinical hold upon a trial if the fda does not believe  or cannot confirm  that the trial can be conducted without unreasonable risk to the trial participants 
we cannot assure you that the fda will not issue a clinical hold with respect to any of our clinical trials in the future 
the results of the preclinical testing and clinical testing  together with chemistry  manufacturing and controls 
table of contents information  are submitted to the fda in the form of a new drug application for a pharmaceutical product  and in the form of a biologics license application for a biological product  requesting approval to commence commercial sales 
in responding to a new drug application or a biologics license application  the fda may grant marketing approvals  request additional information or further research  or deny the application if it determines that the application does not satisfy its regulatory approval criteria 
regulatory approval of a new drug application  new drug application supplement or biologics license application is never guaranteed  and the approval process typically takes several years and is extremely expensive 
the fda has substantial discretion in the drug and biologics approval processes 
despite the time and expense incurred  failure can occur at any stage  and we could encounter problems that cause us to abandon clinical trials or to repeat or perform additional preclinical or clinical studies 
approvals may not be granted on a timely basis  if at all  and if granted may not cover all the clinical indications for which we may seek approval 
also  an approval might contain significant limitations in the form of warnings  precautions or contraindications with respect to conditions of use 
even if our products are approved by regulatory authorities  if we fail to comply with ongoing regulatory requirements  or if we experience unanticipated problems with our products  these products could be subject to restrictions or withdrawal from the market 
any product for which we obtain marketing approval  along with the manufacturing processes  post approval clinical data and promotional activities for such product  will be subject to continual review and periodic inspections by the fda and other regulatory bodies 
even if regulatory approval of a product is granted  the approval may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or contain requirements for costly post marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of the product 
later discovery of previously unknown problems with our products including unanticipated adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency  manufacturer or manufacturing processes  or failure to comply with regulatory requirements  may result in restrictions on such products or manufacturing processes  withdrawal of the products from the market  voluntary or mandatory recall  fines  suspension of regulatory approvals  product seizures or detention  injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties 
we are subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations  and complying with these may cause us to incur significant costs 
we are subject to laws and regulations enforced by the fda  the dea  the california department of health services  the tennessee board of pharmacy and other regulatory statutes including the occupational safety and health act  the environmental protection act  the toxic substances control act  the resource conservation and recovery act  and other current and potential future federal  state or local laws and regulations 
in particular with respect to environmental laws  product development activities involve the use of hazardous materials  and we may incur significant costs as a result of the need to comply with these laws 
our research and development activities involve the controlled use of hazardous materials  chemicals  viruses and radioactive compounds 
we are subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations governing the use  manufacture  storage  handling and disposal of these materials and waste products 
although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of these materials comply with the standards prescribed by applicable laws and regulations  we cannot completely eliminate the risk of contamination or injury  by accident 
table of contents or as the result of intentional acts of terrorism  from these materials 
in the event of an accident  we could be held liable for any damages that result  and any resulting liability could exceed our resources 
we may also be required to incur significant costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations in the future 
failure to comply with foreign regulatory requirements governing human clinical trials and marketing approval for drugs and devices could prevent us from selling our products in foreign markets  which may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
for marketing drugs and biologics outside the united states  the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials  product licensing  pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country and may require additional testing 
the time required to obtain approvals outside the united states may differ from that required to obtain fda approval 
we may not obtain foreign regulatory approvals on a timely basis  if at all 
approval by the fda does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries  and approval by one foreign regulatory authority does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or by the fda 
failure to comply with these regulatory requirements or obtain required approvals could impair our ability to develop foreign markets for our products and may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
reimbursement from third party payors may become more restricted in the future  which may reduce demand for our products 
there is uncertainty related to the extent to which third party payors will cover and pay for newly approved drugs 
sales of our future products will be influenced by the willingness of third party payors to provide reimbursement 
in both domestic and foreign markets  sales of our potential products will depend in part upon coverage and payment amounts from third party payors  including government agencies  private health care insurers and other health care payors such as health maintenance organizations  self insured employee plans  and blue cross blue shield and similar plans 
there is considerable pressure to reduce the cost of biotechnology and pharmaceutical products 
reimbursement from government agencies  insurers and large health organizations may become more restricted in the future 
our potential products represent a new mode of therapy  and while the cost benefit ratio of the products may be favorable  we expect that the costs associated with our products will be substantial 
our proposed products  if successfully developed  may not be considered cost effective by third party payors 
insurance coverage might not be provided by third party payors at all or may be provided only after substantial delay 
even if such coverage is provided  the approved third party payment amounts might not be sufficient to permit widespread acceptance of our products 
the continuing efforts of governmental and third party payors to contain or reduce the costs of healthcare may impair our future revenues and profitability 
the pricing of our future products may be influenced in part by government controls 
for example  in certain foreign markets  pricing or profitability of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to government control 
in the united states  there have been  and we expect that there will continue to be  a number of federal and state proposals to implement more rigorous provisions relating to government payment levels 
while we cannot predict whether the government will adopt any such legislative or regulatory proposals  the announcement or adoption of these proposals could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flow
