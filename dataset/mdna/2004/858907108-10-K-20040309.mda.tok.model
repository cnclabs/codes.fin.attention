introduction management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations analyzes major elements of our consolidated financial statements and provides insight into important areas of management s focus 
this introduction highlights selected information in this report and may not contain all of the information that is important to you 
for a more complete understanding of trends  events  commitments  liquidity  capital resources and critical accounting estimates  you should carefully read this entire report 
our success is highly dependent on economic conditions and market interest rates 
because we operate primarily in houston  and to a lesser extent  in the dallas and san antonio metropolitan areas  the local economic conditions of these areas are particularly important 
during the course of  we experienced the impact of the recent economic downturn in our asset quality measures 
this lag is expected in any economic downturn  as business customers who have struggled to survive the effects of recession become unsuccessful in doing so 
we expect that asset quality measures will improve in as the national and local economies improve 
steep declines in market interest rates over the past few years have dramatically affected our earnings 
at december   interest rates are near year lows 
while lower interest rates are designed to stimulate the economy  they can have a significant impact on bank earnings 
we realize income primarily from the difference between interest earned on loans and investments and the interest paid on deposits and borrowings 
each of these financial instruments reacts differently to interest rates 
during the last few years of declining interest rates  our net interest margin has dropped from in to for this significantly reduced our earnings 
we have noted a slowdown in the rate of decrease in the margin during the latter part of and  based on these trends  expect the margin will stabilize in the company s balance sheet is positioned to benefit from a rising rate environment 
there are several factors impacting comparisons of our financial statements for to earlier years 
these factors should be kept in mind when considering our future prospects as well sale of scmc divestitures of banking offices acquisition of plaza bank was a year of transition for sterling bancshares and sterling bank 
we made several key decisions designed to more clearly align our operations with our long term vision and strategy 
the strategic divestiture of scmc was made to better position the company to serve small and mid sized businesses 
we plan to use the net proceeds of the sale to support our ongoing internal growth and to make strategic acquisitions within our target market areas 
scmc s operations were reported previously as the company s mortgage banking segment  which is now reported together with the net gain on sale as discontinued operations 
other areas of our financial statements affected by the sale of scmc are not as easily highlighted 
as a banking operation  sterling bank benefited by providing scmc with a warehouse line of credit which financed mortgage loans held for sale 
additionally  scmc maintained operating and escrow deposits with sterling bank reducing sterling bank s other borrowing needs 
due to decisions made by the buyer of scmc  sterling bank lost the benefit of these loan and deposit balances shortly after completing the sale of scmc in september also in  we sold five banking offices acquired as part of recent acquisitions 
these banking offices were located in eagle pass  pearsall  crystal city  carrizo springs and highlands  texas and were sold because their operations and growth potential did not align with our business banking strategy of serving small and mid sized businesses in the major metropolitan areas 
finally  acquisitions we make will not only affect comparisons with previous periods  but also our future prospects 
during the fourth quarter of  we completed the acquisition of south texas capital group  inc of san antonio and its subsidiary bank  plaza bank 
critical accounting estimates the company s accounting policies are important to understanding the results reported 
accounting policies are described in detail in note to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report 
allowance for credit losses the allowance for credit losses is a valuation allowance for probable losses incurred on loans and binding loan commitments 
loans are charged to the allowance when the loss actually occurs or when a determination is made that a probable loss has occurred 
recoveries are credited to the allowance at the time of recovery 
throughout the year  management estimates the probable level of losses to determine whether the allowance for credit losses is adequate to absorb losses in the existing portfolio 
based on these estimates  an amount is charged to the provision for credit losses and credited to the allowance for credit losses in order to adjust the allowance to a level determined to be adequate to absorb losses 
management s judgment as to the level of probable losses on existing loans involves the consideration of current economic conditions and their estimated effects on specific borrowers  an evaluation of the existing relationships among loans  potential credit losses and the present level of the allowance  results of examinations of the loan portfolio by regulatory agencies  and management s internal review of the loan portfolio 
in determining the collectibility of certain loans  management also considers the fair value of any underlying collateral 
the amount ultimately realized may differ from the carrying value of these assets because of economic  operating or other conditions beyond the company s control 
please refer to the subsequent discussion of allowance for credit losses below as well as in note to the consolidated financial statements for additional insight into management s approach and methodology in estimating the allowance for credit losses 
stock based compensation the company accounts for stock based employee compensation plans using the intrinsic value based method 
because the exercise price of the company s employee stock options equals the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant  no compensation expense is recognized on options granted 
compensation expense for restricted stock awards is based on the market price of the stock on the date of grant and is recognized ratably over the vesting period of the award 
we make pro forma disclosures of net income and earnings per share assuming the fair value based accounting method in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the financial accounting standards board the fasb is currently working on a project to address issues related to equity based compensation 
the objective of the project is to achieve convergence with international standards setting bodies on one single  global accounting standard for equity based compensation 
in the project  the fasb wishes to resolve whether compensation paid in the form of equity instruments should be recognized in the financial statements and how this compensation should be measured 
the fasb has tentatively determined that all equity based compensation should be recognized in the financial statements beginning in deliberations as to how equity based compensation should be measured are ongoing 
the fasb is scheduled to issue an exposure draft in the first quarter of and has set a goal of issuing a final accounting standard in the second half of results of operations performance summary net income for was million compared with million in  an increase of

on a continuing operations basis  diluted earnings per share were in compared with in the decrease in earnings per share for was caused principally by a decline in our net interest income and an increase in the provision for credit losses

two commonly used industry measures of a banking institution s performance are return on average assets and return on average common equity 
return on average assets roa measures net earnings in relation to average total assets and is an indicator of a company s ability to employ its resources profitably 
for  our roa from continuing operations was  as compared to and for and  respectively 
return on average common equity roe measures net income in relation to average common equity and is an indicator of a company s return to its owners 
for  the company s roe from continuing operations was compared to and for and  respectively 
net interest income net interest income represents the amount by which interest income on interest earning assets  including securities and loans  exceeds interest paid on interest bearing liabilities  including deposits and other borrowed funds 
net interest income is our principal source of earnings 
interest rate fluctuations  as well as changes in the amount and type of earning assets and liabilities  combine to affect net interest income 
certain average balances  together with the total dollar amounts of interest income and expense and the average interest rates  were as follows dollars in thousands year ended december  average balance interest average yield rate average balance interest average yield rate average balance interest average yield rate interest earning assets deposits in financial institutions federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreements to resell trading assets securities taxable securities non taxable loans held for sale taxable loans held for investment taxable loans held for investment non taxable total interest earning assets noninterest earning assets cash and due from banks premises and equipment  net other assets allowance for credit losses assets related to discontinued operations total noninterest earning assets total assets interest bearing liabilities demand and savings deposits certificates and other time deposits other borrowed funds notes payable subordinated debt total interest bearing liabilities noninterest bearing liabilities demand deposits other liabilities liabilities related to discontinued operations total noninterest bearing liabilities trust preferred securities shareholders equity total liabilities and shareholders equity net interest income and margin loan origination fees are reported together with interest income on loans 
these fees aggregated million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
related loan origination costs are not separately allocated to loans  but are charged to non interest expense 
for the purpose of calculating loan yields  average loan balances include nonaccrual loans with no related interest income 
the net interest margin is equal to net interest income divided by average total interest earning assets 
the following rate volume analysis shows the portions of the net change in interest income due to changes in volume or rate

the average yield on interest earning assets decreased basis points from in to in in november and june  the federal reserve bank decreased the discount rate basis points and basis points  respectively 
since our balance sheet is asset sensitive  our interest earning assets generally reprice more quickly than the interest bearing liabilities 
average interest earning assets increased million or during offsetting much of the impact of lower yields 
additionally  competitive pressures often limit our ability to reduce rates on deposits by the same amounts as we do on loans during periods of declining rates 
average interest bearing liabilities for were billion  an increase of million or 
the cost of interest bearing liabilities decreased basis points from for to for overall  the company s net interest margin of in decreased basis points from the net interest margin during because we are asset sensitive  our net interest margin and net interest income generally tends to increase during periods of rising interest rates and decrease during periods of declining interest rates 
net interest income for was million  up million or from million for the growth in net interest income is attributable primarily to a increase in average loans during partially offset by decreasing interest rates 
loan growth related to acquisitions made during this period was 
the federal reserve bank decreased the discount rate in the aggregate by basis points in and basis points in november of consequently  our yields on interest earning assets decreased in and as a result of the bank lowering its prime rate in relation to the federal reserve decreases and as maturing fixed rate loans and securities were redeployed into new instruments having lower yields

for  noninterest income was million  as compared to million for  an increase of million or 
during  customer service fees increased million or  primarily as a result of acquisitions during these periods and other internal growth in deposit transaction accounts

sterling bank s legal lending limit was million at december  and was not exceeded by any single relationship 
we make commercial loans primarily to small and mid sized businesses and to professionals 
our commercial loan products include revolving lines of credit  letters of credit  working capital loans  and loans to finance accounts receivable  inventory and equipment 
typically  commercial loans have floating rates of interest  are for varying terms generally not exceeding three years  are personally guaranteed by the business owner and are secured by accounts receivable  inventory and or other business assets 
in addition to the commercial loans secured solely by non real estate business assets  we make commercial loans that are secured by owner occupied real estate  as well as other business assets 
commercial mortgage loans are secured generally by first liens on real estate  typically have floating interest rates  and are most often amortized over a year period with balloon payments due at the end of three years 
in underwriting commercial mortgage loans  consideration is given to the property s operating history  future operating projections  current and projected occupancy  location and physical condition 
the underwriting analysis also includes credit checks  appraisals  and a review of the financial condition of the borrower 
we also make loans to finance the construction of residential and  to a lesser extent  nonresidential properties  such as churches 
generally  construction loans are secured by first liens on real estate and have floating interest rates 
the bank conducts periodic inspections  either directly or through an architect or other agent  prior to approval of periodic draws on these loans 
underwriting guidelines similar to those described above are also used in our construction lending activities

shortly after the sale of scmc on september   this mortgage warehouse line was repaid in full at the discretion of the buyer 
loans held for sale at december  included certain purchased commercial real estate loans and the guaranteed portion of sba loans originated by the bank 
due to the timing of the sales of these loans to investors  the balance of loans held for sale at any given time may be somewhat volatile

these subordinated notes bear interest at a fixed rate of and mature on april  interest payments are due semi annually 
the subordinated notes may not be redeemed or called prior to their maturity 
in june  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement in which the bank swapped the fixed rate to a floating rate 
under the terms of the swap agreement  we receive a fixed coupon rate of and pay a variable interest rate equal to the three month libor that is reset on a quarterly basis  plus 
this swap is designated as a fair value hedge 
changes in the fair value of both the swap and the hedged subordinated debt are reflected in the statements of income

company obligated mandatorily redeemable trust preferred securities at december   we had three issues of company obligated mandatorily redeemable trust preferred securities trust preferred securities outstanding totaling million as follows dollars in thousands description issuance date trust preferred securities outstanding interest rate junior subordinated debt owed to trusts final maturity date capital trust iii september   fixed  september  statutory trust one august   month libor plus  august capital trust ii march   fixed  march  total each of the trusts is a statutory business trust organized for the sole purpose of issuing trust securities and investing the proceeds thereof in junior subordinated debentures of sterling bancshares  the sole asset of each trust 
the preferred trust securities of each trust represent preferred beneficial interests in the assets of the respective trusts and are subject to mandatory redemption upon payment of the junior subordinated debentures held by the trust 
the common securities of each trust are wholly owned by sterling bancshares 
each trust s ability to pay amounts due on the trust preferred securities is solely dependent upon sterling bancshares making payment on the related junior subordinated debentures 
sterling bancshares obligations under the junior subordinated debentures and other relevant trust agreements  in aggregate  constitute a full and unconditional guarantee by sterling bancshares of each respective trust s obligations under the trust securities issued by each respective trust 
in late  the fasb issued fin r 
fin r requires that trust preferred securities be deconsolidated from our consolidated financial statements 
we will adopt fin r on january  after adoption  the trust preferred securities will no longer be shown in our consolidated financial statements 
instead  the junior subordinated debentures will be shown as liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets and interest expense associated with the junior subordinated debentures will be shown in the consolidated statements of income 
currently  trust preferred securities are considered in calculating tier capital ratios 
however  the banking regulators may disallow this practice 
it is unclear whether existing issues of trust preferred securities will be grandfathered permitting their continued inclusion in the calculation of tier capital or not 
this reconsideration of trust preferred securities was caused by the issuance of fin r 
refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the impact of this possible change on our regulatory capital ratios 
after completing our latest issuance of trust preferred securities in  we used the proceeds to prepay the junior subordinated debentures issued in june upon the prepayment  the trust preferred securities outstanding were mandatorily redeemed 
this effectively lowered our overall borrowing costs 
we recorded a million non cash charge associated with the early redemption of these securities 
asset quality risk elements nonperforming and past due loans are fully or substantially secured by assets  with any excess of loan balances over collateral values specifically allocated in the allowance for credit losses 
the bank receives  on an ongoing basis  updated appraisals on loans secured by real estate  particularly those categorized as nonperforming loans and potential problem loans 
in those instances where updated appraisals reflect reduced collateral values  an evaluation of the borrower s overall financial condition is made to determine the need  if any  for possible write downs or appropriate additions to the allowance for credit losses 
potential problem loans are those loans not classified as nonperforming  but where information known by management indicates serious doubt that the borrower will be able to comply with the present payment terms 
management identifies these loans through its ongoing loan review process 
nonperforming assets and potential problem loans consisted of the following dollars in thousands nonaccrual loans restructured loans total nonperforming loans real estate acquired by foreclosure other repossessed assets total nonperforming assets nonperforming loans to total loans nonperforming assets to total assets potential problem loans accruing loans past due days or more total loans total assets nonperforming assets were million at december   up from million at year end much of this increase can be attributed to three problem loan relationships placed on nonaccrual status during the second half of these relationships individually were larger than million 
management implemented more stringent credit approval standards for relationships of this size in the fourth quarter of the overall level of nonperforming assets has been impacted negatively by the weak economic conditions of the past few years 
we expect some improvement in asset quality during late and early as the local and national economies strengthen 
allowance for credit losses the provision for credit losses increased during to million as compared with million for during  net charge offs of million or of average loans were incurred 
these increases are attributable principally to the impact of the economic downturn of the past few years 
the provision for credit losses and net charge offs for were impacted also by the partial charge off of one of the three problem loan relationships discussed above 
a total of million was charged off during the fourth quarter of in conjunction with this relationship 
the remaining balance of this relationship was classified as nonperforming at december  the allowance for credit losses is a reserve established through charges to earnings in the form of a provision for credit losses 
based on an evaluation of the loan portfolio  management presents a quarterly review of the allowance for credit losses to the bank s board of directors  indicating any changes in the allowance since the last review and any recommendations as to adjustments in the allowance 
in making our evaluation  we consider the industry diversification of the commercial loan portfolio and the effect of changes in the local real estate market on collateral values 
we also consider the results of recent regulatory examinations 
we continually monitor economic conditions in our local market areas and the probable impact on borrowers  on past due amounts  on related collateral values  on the number and size of non performing loans and on the resulting amount of charge offs for the period 
we have several systems and procedures in place to assist in managing the overall quality of the loan portfolio 
in addition to established underwriting guidelines and approval processes  we monitor delinquency levels for any negative or adverse trends 
we also perform reviews of the loan portfolios on a regular basis to identify troubled loans and to assess their overall collection probability 
ongoing portfolio reviews are conducted by our internal loan review department under an established loan review program 
under this program  we particularly monitor working capital credits having a total exposure of  or more 
annually  we target a loan review penetration of at least of the total commercial and real estate loan portfolios 
through the loan review process  we maintain an internally classified loan list  which  along with the delinquency list of loans  helps us assess the overall quality of the loan portfolios and the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses 
loans on this listing are classified as substandard  doubtful or loss based on the severity of credit probability of repayment  collateral valuation and related collectibility 
loans classified as substandard have clear and defined weaknesses such as highly leveraged positions  unfavorable financial ratios  uncertain repayment sources or poor financial condition  which may jeopardize the loan s recoverability 
loans classified as doubtful have characteristics similar to substandard loans but with an increased risk that a loss may occur  or at least a portion of the loan may require a charge off if liquidated at present 
although loans classified as substandard do not duplicate loans classified as doubtful  both substandard and doubtful loans include some loans that are delinquent at least days or on nonaccrual status 
loans classified as loss are those loans that are in the process of being charged off 
at december   substandard loans totaled million  of which million were loans designated as delinquent or nonaccrual  and doubtful loans totaled million of which million were designated as delinquent or nonaccrual 
in addition to the internally classified loan list and delinquency list of loans  we maintain a separate watch list which further aids in monitoring the loan portfolios 
watch list loans show warning elements or more deficiencies that require attention in the short run or where pertinent ratios of the loan account have weakened to a point where more frequent monitoring is warranted 
these loans do not have all the characteristics of a classified loan substandard or doubtful but do show weakened elements as compared with those of a satisfactory credit 
we review these loans in assessing the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses 
as of december   watch list loans totaled million 
management assigns loan grades by loan and allocations are made within each loan grade so that double allocations are avoided 
loans are assigned a grade according to payment history  collateral values  and financial condition of the borrower 
the bank maintains an adequate allowance for credit losses through its watchlist classifications  allocating an increasing reserve amount as the severity of a problem loan increases 
the bank maintains an unallocated reserve for satisfactory non classified credits based  in part  on the average of the last three year s actual net charge offs

this process requires a balance between profitability  liquidity  and interest rate risk 
to effectively measure and manage interest rate risk  the company uses simulation analysis to determine the impact on net interest income of changes in interest rates under various interest rate scenarios  balance sheet trends  and strategies 
from these simulations  interest rate risk is quantified and appropriate strategies are developed and implemented 
the overall interest rate risk position and strategies are reviewed by senior management  the asset liability management committee and the company s board of directors on an ongoing basis 
an interest rate sensitive asset or liability is one that experiences a measurable change in value as a direct result of changes in market interest rates 
interest rate risk is measured by analyzing the maturity and repricing relationships between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at specific points in time gap and by analyzing the effects of interest rate changes on net interest income over specific periods of time by projecting the performance of the mix of assets and liabilities in varied interest rate environments 
interest rate sensitivity reflects the potential effect on net interest income of a movement in interest rates 
a bank is considered asset sensitive  or having a positive gap  when the amount of its interest earning assets maturing or repricing within a given period exceeds the amount of its interest bearing liabilities also maturing or repricing within that time period 
conversely  a bank is considered liability sensitive  or having a negative gap  when the amount of its interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within a given period exceeds the amount of its interest earning assets also maturing or repricing within that time period 
during a period of rising interest rates  a negative gap would tend to adversely affect net interest income  while a positive gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income 
during a period of falling interest rates  a negative gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income  while a positive gap would tend to affect net interest income adversely 
when analyzing its gap position  the company emphasizes the next twelve month period 
we are positioned to benefit from rising rates because the company has an asset sensitive position 
also  we would likely benefit from an increase in short term interest rates as this might signify that economic conditions are improving 
as mentioned  we utilize simulation models to estimate the impact on net interest income and present value of equity due to changes in interest rates under various scenarios 
this analysis estimates a percentage of change in these metrics from the stable rate base scenario versus alternative scenarios of rising and falling market interest rates by instantaneously shocking the balance sheet 
the following table summarizes the simulated change over a month period as of december  and dollars in thousands increase decrease in changes in interest rates basis points net interest income present value of equity december  base december  base these sensitivities are all within the thresholds set by our asset liability committee 
each rate scenario reflects unique prepayment and repricing assumptions 
since there are limitations inherent in any methodology used to estimate the exposure to changes in market interest rates  this analysis is not intended to be a forecast of the actual effect of a change in market interest rates 
the interest rate sensitivity analysis includes assumptions that i the composition of our interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at year end will remain constant over the measurement period  and ii that changes in market rates are parallel and instantaneous across the yield curve regardless of duration or repricing characteristics of specific assets or liabilities 
further  the analysis does not contemplate any actions that we might undertake in response to changes in market interest rates 
accordingly  this analysis is not intended to and does not provide a precise forecast of the effect actual changes in market rates will have on the company

management utilizes the interest rate risk simulation model to monitor and forecast the effect of various interest rate environments on earnings and the company s net capital position 
the objectives of the company s liquidity management is to maintain our ability to meet day to day deposit withdrawals and other payment obligations  to raise funds to support asset growth  to maintain reserve requirements and otherwise operate the company on an ongoing basis 
we strive to manage a liquidity position sufficient to meet operating requirements while maintaining an appropriate balance between assets and liabilities to meet the expectations of our shareholders 
in recent years  our liquidity needs have primarily been met by growth in core deposits 
in addition to core deposits  we have access to funds from correspondent banks and from the federal home loan bank  supplemented by amortizing securities and loan portfolios 
the bank also accepts brokered certificates of deposit 
sterling bancshares must provide for its own liquidity and fund its own obligations 
the primary source of sterling bancshares revenues is from dividends declared by the bank 
there are statutory and regulatory provisions that could limit the ability of the bank to pay dividends to sterling bancshares 
at december   the bank had approximately million in the aggregate available to be paid as dividends to sterling bancshares 
it is not anticipated that such restrictions will have an impact on the ability of sterling bancshares to meet its ongoing cash obligations 
as of december   we did not have any material commitments for capital expenditures 
off balance sheet arrangements  guarantees and contractual obligations the company s future contractual cash payments are as follows in thousands less than one year years years over years total operating leases certificates and other time deposits subordinated debt trust preferred securities total the amount reflected above for subordinated debt represents our contractual obligation 
the subordinated debt is reflected in the consolidated balance sheet at its fair value 
the bank entered into an interest rate swap designated as a fair value hedge of the subordinated debt

factors that may affect future results of operations in addition to the other information contained in this report  the following risks may affect us 
if any of these risks occurs  our business  financial condition or operating results could be adversely affected 
our profitability depends significantly on local economic conditions 
our success depends primarily on the general economic conditions of the houston metropolitan area and  to a lesser extent  that of the san antonio and dallas metropolitan areas 
unlike larger banks that are more geographically diversified  we provide banking and financial services to customers primarily in these areas 
the local economic conditions of these areas have a significant impact on our commercial  real estate and construction loans  the ability of the borrowers to repay these loans and the value of the collateral securing these loans 
a significant decline in general economic conditions  such as inflation  recession  acts of terrorism  an outbreak of hostilities  unemployment and other factors beyond our control will impact these local economic conditions and will negatively affect the financial results of our banking operations 
in addition  houston remains largely dependent on the energy industry 
a downturn in the energy industry and the energy related business could indirectly adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition we rely on an owner operated business market 
we target our business development and marketing strategy primarily to serve the banking and financial needs of owner operated businesses with credit needs of under million 
these owner operated businesses represent a major sector of the houston and national economies 
if general economic conditions negatively impact this economic sector in the metropolitan areas in which we operate  our results of operations and financial condition will be significantly affected 
if our allowance for credit losses is not sufficient to cover actual loan losses  our earnings could decrease 
our loan customers may not repay their loans according to the terms of these loans and the collateral securing the payment of these loans may be insufficient to assure repayment 
we may experience significant credit losses that could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
we make various assumptions and judgments about the collectibility of our loan portfolio  including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of many of our loans 
in determining the size of the allowance  we rely on our experience and our evaluation of economic conditions 
if our assumptions prove to be incorrect  our current allowance may not be sufficient to cover future loan losses and adjustments may be necessary to allow for different economic conditions or adverse developments in our loan portfolio 
significant additions to our allowance would materially decrease our net income 
in addition  federal and state regulators periodically review our allowance for credit losses and may require us to increase our provision for credit losses or recognize further loan charge offs  based on judgments different than those we make 
any increase in our allowance or charge offs as required by these regulatory agencies could have a negative affect on us 
fluctuations in interest rates could reduce our profitability 
we realize income primarily from the difference between interest earned on loans and securities and the interest paid on deposits and borrowings 
we expect that we will periodically experience gaps in the interest rate sensitivities of our assets and liabilities  meaning that either our interest bearing liabilities will be more sensitive to changes in market interest rates than our interest earning assets  or vice versa 
in either event  if market interest rates should move contrary to our position  this gap will work against us  and our earnings may be negatively affected 
we are unable to predict fluctuations of market interest rates  which are affected by the following factors inflation  recession  a rise in unemployment  tightening money supply  international disorder and instability in domestic and foreign financial markets  and instability in domestic and foreign financial markets 
our asset liability management strategy  which is designed to mitigate the risk from changes in market interest rates  may not be able to prevent changes in interest rates from having a material adverse effect on our results of operation and financial condition 
competition with other financial institutions could adversely affect our profitability 
we face vigorous competition from banks and other financial institutions  including savings institutions  finance companies and credit unions 
a number of these banks and other financial institutions have substantially greater resources and lending limits  larger branch systems and a wider array of banking services 
to a limited extent  we also compete with other providers of financial services  such as money market mutual funds  brokerage firms  consumer finance companies and insurance companies 
this competition may reduce or limit our margins on banking services  reduce our market share and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
we may not be able to maintain our historical growth rate which may adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition 
to achieve our growth  we have initiated internal growth programs  completed various acquisitions and opened additional branches in the past few years 
we may not be able to sustain our historical rate of growth or may not even be able to grow at all 
we may not be able to obtain the financing necessary to fund additional growth and may not be able to find suitable candidates for acquisition 
various factors  such as economic conditions and competition  may impede or prohibit the opening of new branch offices 
further  our inability to attract and retain experienced bankers may adversely affect our internal growth 
a significant decrease in our historical rate of growth may adversely impact our results of operation and financial condition 
we may be unable to complete acquisitions  and once complete  may not be able to integrate our acquisitions successfully 
our growth strategy includes our desire to acquire other financial institutions 
we may not be able to complete any future acquisitions and  if completed  we may not be able to successfully integrate the operations  management  products and services of the entities we acquire 
following each acquisition  we must expend substantial managerial  operating  financial and other resources to integrate these entities 
in particular  we may be required to install and standardize adequate operational and control systems  deploy or modify equipment  implement marketing efforts in new as well as existing locations and employ and maintain qualified personnel 
our failure to successfully integrate the entities we acquire into our existing operations may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
we operate in a highly regulated environment and may be adversely affected by changes in federal and local laws and regulations 
we are subject to extensive regulation  supervision and examination by federal and state banking authorities 
any change in applicable regulations or federal or state legislation could have a substantial impact on us and our operations 
additional legislation and regulations may be enacted or adopted in the future that could significantly affect our powers  authority and operations  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
further  regulators have significant discretion and power to prevent or remedy unsafe or unsound practices or violations of laws by banks and bank holding companies in the performance of their supervisory and enforcement duties 
the exercise of this regulatory discretion and power may have a negative impact on us
