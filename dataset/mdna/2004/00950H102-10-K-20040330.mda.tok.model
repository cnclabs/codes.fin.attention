item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this report 
overview we are a global supplier of broadband wireless access bwa equipment that allows communications service providers often referred to as local exchange carriers  or simply telephone companies  internet service providers often referred to as isps and other telecommunications users  such as utilities and enterprises  to cost effectively deliver high speed data and voice services using radio frequencies rather than wires 
we call this transmission method wireless broadband 
the primary market for our systems is a subset of the fixed wireless access systems market  which is the fixed point to multipoint market in radio frequencies below ghz 
each of our fixed wireless access systems utilizes digital wireless techniques  which provide wide area coverage  security and resistance to fading 
our systems can be deployed rapidly and cost effectively  providing an attractive alternative or complement to traditional copper wire  cable  or fiber optic communications access networks 
our products also include software tools that optimize geographic coverage of our systems and provide ongoing network management 
to facilitate the deployment and operation of our systems  we also offer network installation  training and support services 

a more complete description of our various wireless access systems is provided below 
our bwa systems the airspan bwa solutions have been installed by more than network operators in more than countries and are being tested by numerous other service providers 
our products were developed and sold originally to provide wireless voice connections between network operators and their end customers 
product enhancements introduced in enabled us to offer both voice and data connectivity over a single wireless link 
we have continued to develop the capabilities and features of the original products  and today we sell them as the as and as products  in systems capable of delivering high capacity broadband data with carrier quality voice connections to operators globally 
in october  we strengthened our position in the bwa equipment market with the acquisition of the wipll wireless internet protocol in the local loop business from marconi pursuant to a stock purchase agreement  and renamed the business airspan networks israel limited airspan israel 
the products and services produced by airspan israel enable operators in licensed and unlicensed wireless bands to offer high speed  low cost  wireless broadband connections for data and voice over ip 
we acquired all of the issued and outstanding capital stock and debt of marconi wipll in exchange for million of cash 
in october  we released our airspan branded as and as product range of high end point to multipoint and point to point products suitable for operators wishing to deliver service offerings to medium and large businesses and multi tenant dwellings that require considerable bandwidth for their end users 
these products  based on orthogonal frequency division multiplexing ofdm technology can also be used for a wide range of backhaul applications 
on december   we completed an agreement with nortel networks to acquire the fixed wireless access business of nortel networks known as proximity in accordance with the terms and conditions of a contemporaneously executed and delivered purchase and sale agreement 
the final purchase price of approximately million was offset at closing against customer prepayments totaling approximately million transferred to us as part of the transaction 
we assumed the product supply obligations associated with the customer prepayments and certain other liabilities and obligations of nortel networks relating to the proximity business 
as part of the transaction  we acquired inventory relating to the proximity business as well as existing assets associated with the manufacture  development and support of the proximity product line 
in addition  we agreed to hire nortel networks workforce directly employed in the proximity business  which at closing totaled persons who are located in maidenhead  england and sunrise  florida 
we also assumed nortel networks then current manufacturing obligations for the assembly and final testing of proximity products 
the acquired proximity products and services provide carrier class circuit switched voice and data  based on a time division multiple access tdma technology 
the purchase of the proximity business does not result in an additional business segment 
in connection with the acquisition of the proximity business  we acquired customer prepayments of million of cash  and inventory which we valued at approximately million 
as of december   substantially all of the million of cash was held by us as prepayments from axtel relating to future deliveries and substantially all of the million of inventory was expected to be sold to axtel 
we intend to continue our strategy of expanding our business through  among other things  acquisitions of other businesses and technologies and joint ventures 
see risk factors our failure to manage future acquisitions our corporate headquarters are located in boca raton  florida 
our primary operations  manufacturing and product development centers are located in uxbridge  uk  and airport city  israel 
we generated revenue of million in  million in and million in we have incurred net losses of million  million and million for  and  respectively 
since becoming an independent company  we have generated significant net losses and negative cash flow and expect to continue to do so in we have an accumulated deficit of million as of december  we generate revenue from sales of our systems including both hardware and software and from services related to implementation and support activities 
revenue from services has always been under of our total revenue 
our proprietary software is integral to our products and is not sold separately 
customer service contracts are generally of a short term nature  for days and weeks rather than months  and are sold separately from sales of our systems 
although service revenue does not currently constitute a material portion of our revenue  we believe that in future  services will increase as a percentage of our revenue 
we recognize revenue pursuant to staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition 
accordingly  revenues are recognized when all of the following conditions are met an arrangement exists with the customer  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price for the product or service is fixed and determinable  and collection of the receivable is reasonably assured 
revenue from product sales  including sales to our distributors and resellers  is generally recognized at the time the product is shipped to the end customer 
revenue is deferred when customer acceptance is required  rights of return exist  or other significant obligations remain that are essential to the functionality of the delivered products 
once these conditions have been satisfied  revenue is recognized 
the estimated cost of any post sale obligations  including basic product warranties  is accrued at the time revenue is recognized based on historical experience 
revenue from time and material service contracts is recognized once the services have been performed 
revenue from service contracts that relate to a period of cover is recognized ratably over the given contract period 
revenue is recognized on fixed price service contracts using the percentage of completion method unless we are not unable to make reasonable estimates under that method  in which case revenue is recognized on a completed contract basis 
in certain cases  we enter into agreements with customers whereby we are obligated to deliver multiple products and or multiple services multiple deliveries 
in these transactions  we allocate the total revenue to be earned under the arrangement among the various elements based on their relative fair value 
revenue for these transactions is recognized on each element when the revenue recognition criteria have been met for that element 
we recognize revenue for delivered products and services only if i the above product revenue or service revenue criteria are met  ii undelivered products or services are not essential to the functionality of the delivered elements  iii payment for the delivered products or services is not contingent upon delivery of the remaining products or services  and iv the fair value for each of the undelivered elements is known 
we sell our products primarily through our direct sales force and  to a lesser extent  through distribution channels 
we have direct sales offices in the us  us  australia  brazil  china  czech republic  germany  indonesia  new zealand  the philippines  poland  russia  south africa and sri lanka 
we also sell through independent agents and resellers in markets where we do not have a direct sales presence and to original equipment manufacturers  or oems  who may sell our products under their name 
our sales cycle is typically long and unpredictable and typically varies from one month to two years  often involving extensive testing and evaluation by prospective customers  which makes it difficult for us to anticipate the quarter in which particular sales may occur 
in  our non us sales accounted for of our total revenue 
of the us sales  consisted of systems sold to us customers that were shipped to destinations outside the us in  our top ten customers accounted for of our revenue 
in  our non us sales accounted for of our total revenue 
of the us sales  consisted of systems sold to us customers that were shipped to destinations outside the us in  our top ten customers accounted for of our revenue 
in  our non us sales accounted for of our total revenue 
of the us sales  consisted of systems sold to us customers that were shipped to destinations outside the us in  our top ten customers accounted for of our revenue 
we currently derive  and expect to continue to derive  a substantial percentage of our revenue from fewer than ten customers 
in the year ended december  broadcast communications ltd in new zealand represented of our revenue 
in the year ended december   siemens telecommunications pty ltd 
in south africa and speednet inc in japan represented and respectively  of our revenue 
in the year ended december  there were no customers that individually accounted for more than ten percent of the year s revenue 
we anticipate that our dependence on our ten largest customers will grow in  primarily due to our projected sales of proximity solutions to axtel 
the following table identifies the percentage of our revenue by geographic region in the periods identified 
percentage of revenue geographic area year ended december  year ended december  year ended december  united states asia pacific europe africa and middle east south and central america and caribbean we anticipate that the percentage of our sales to central america will increase in  primarily as a result of our projected sales of proximity solutions to axtel 
cost of revenue consists of component and material costs  direct labor costs  warranty costs  royalties  overhead related to manufacture of our products and customer support costs 
our gross margin is affected by changes in our product mix because our gross margin on base stations and related equipment is higher than the gross margin on subscriber terminals 
in addition  our gross margin is affected by changes in the average selling price of our systems  volume discounts granted to significant customers and the proportion of total revenue of sales of software  which typically carries a higher gross margin than hardware 
we expect the average selling prices of our products to decline and we intend to continue to implement product cost reductions and develop and introduce new products or product enhancements in an effort to maintain or increase our gross margins 
further  we expect to derive an increasing proportion of our revenue from the sale of our integrated systems through distribution channels 
revenue derived from these sales channels typically carries a lower gross margin than direct sales 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs for personnel and expenses for design  development and testing facilities and equipment 
these expenses also include costs associated with product development efforts  including consulting fees and prototyping costs from initial product concept to manufacture and production 
we expect to continue to make substantial investments in research and development 
sales and marketing expenses consist of salaries and related costs for personnel  sales commissions  consulting fees and expenses for advertising  travel  technical assistance  trade shows  and promotional and demonstration materials 
we expect to continue to incur substantial expenditures related to sales and marketing activities including costs associated with the recruitment of additional sales and marketing personnel and for the expansion of our distribution channels 
general and administrative expenses consist of salaries and related expenses for personnel  professional and consulting fees and other related expenses and facilities costs 
we outsource most of our manufacturing processes for the as andas products to solectron in scotland  and we outsource the manufacturing for the wipll product to racamtech limited  part of the cam group of companies  in israel 
the airspan branded as and as products are manufactured and sourced from a canadian manufacturer 
during the proximity product was manufactured by nortel networks in canada and by solectron in milpitas  california and guadalajara  mexico 
we expect to continue to use solectron as the principal contract manufacturer of proximity in we also expect to continue to use contract manufacturers for our other products 
we also purchase some of the key components of our products from single vendors for which alternative sources are generally not readily available 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  reserves for doubtful debt  excess or obsolete inventory  warranty costs  restructuring costs  the valuation goodwill  and legal proceedings 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions and may change as future events occur 
we believe the following critical accounting policies are dependant on significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition under our revenue recognition policy see note in the notes to the financial statements we are required to assess the credit worthiness of our customers 
we use our own judgment in assessing their credit worthiness  and the criteria by which each judgment is made may change in future periods and therefore may change future revenue recognition 
accounts receivable we are required to assess the collectibility of our accounts receivable balances 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the ultimate realization of these receivables including the current credit worthiness of each customer 
significant changes in required reserves have been recorded in recent periods to reflect our current judgment  and changes may occur in the future due to the market environment 
inventory we value inventory at the lower of cost or market value 
as a result  we exercise judgment as to the level of provisions required for excess and obsolete inventory 
these judgments are based on our assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
should we decide in the future that actual market conditions have become less favorable  or our assumptions change due to changing market conditions  additional inventory provisions may be required 
warranty costs typically our products are covered by a warranty for periods ranging from one to two years 
we accrue a warranty reserve for estimated costs to provide warranty services 
our estimate of costs required to fulfill our warranty obligations is based on historical experience and expectation of future conditions 
to the extent we experience increased warranty claim activity  increased costs or our assessment of future conditions change  our warranty accrual will increase  which will result in decreased gross profit 
restructuring during  and we recorded restructuring charges arising from our cost reduction programs 
these reserves include estimates pertaining to employee termination costs  the loss on subletting excess facilities  and the write down of assets to be disposed of as part of the restructuring 
although we do not anticipate significant changes  the actual costs may differ from the amount of the reserves 
purchase accounting in connection with acquisitions  we assess the fair value of assets acquired with liabilities assumed 
items such as accounts receivable  fixed assets  intangible assets and accrued liabilities require a high degree of judgment involving assumptions and estimates including future cash flows and discount rates 
in certain situations  where deemed necessary  we may use third parties to assist us with such valuations 
valuation of goodwill on january   fas  goodwill and other intangible assets  was implemented and as a result  we ceased to amortize our goodwill 
we were required to perform an initial impairment review of goodwill in and an annual impairment review thereafter 
we performed our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of the carrying value of goodwill was compared to its implied fair value by using the expected present value of future cash flows 
the result of this review was that no impairment of goodwill was recorded during the year ended december  in the impairment review  we make various assumptions regarding the estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of goodwill 
if these estimates or related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record an impairment charge that would adversely affect our results 
legal proceedings we are subject to class action complaints related to alleged false and misleading information in our registration statement and prospectus see item legal proceedings  and may also face litigation for labor and other matters 
we are required to assess the likelihood of adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of reserves required  if any  for these contingencies are made after careful analysis of each individual issue 
the required reserves may change in the future due to changes in circumstances within each case 
results of operations the following table provides operating data as a percentage of revenue for the periods presented 
year ended december  year ended december  year ended december  revenue cost of revenue inventory provision gross profit operating expenses research and development sales and marketing bad debt expense general and administrative acquired in process research and development and amortization of intangibles restructuring provision total operating expenses loss from operations interest and other income  net income taxes net loss before extraordinary item extraordinary item gain on extinguishment of debt income tax charge gain after tax net loss restructuring in  the company implemented a restructuring program to reduce operating expenses and recorded a charge of million in relation to this program 
included in this charge were costs related to excess facilities and severance 
a further thousand was recognized as restructuring in the income statement in the first quarter of in the third quarter of  a new restructuring program was initiated to further reduce our operating expenses 
a charge of thousand was recorded in the quarter 
included in this charge were costs related to the write off of tradeshow equipment and severance costs 
the total number of employees terminated as part of this restructuring program was and all severance payments were made by the end of the second quarter of in the fourth quarter of the decision was made to completely outsource all our manufacturing 
as a result in we recorded a thousand restructuring charge for the closure of our riverside  uxbridge facility 
all of this cost relates to the excess facility 
a further thousand was recognized as restructuring in the income statement in the fourth quarter of as the company reassessed the ability to sublease the riverside facility 
in the second quarter of a further restructuring program was initiated to lower operating expenses 
the total cost expected to be incurred as part of this restructuring program was thousand arising from facility closures and severance costs 
during the second half of the expected cost to be incurred as part of this restructuring program was reassessed and adjusted to thousand as set out in the table below 
in conjunction with the purchase of the proximity business the company implemented its plan to relocate the proximity business from maidenhead  england and sunrise  florida to the company s facilities in uxbridge  england and boca raton  florida 
the company recorded thousand for acquisition related restructuring charges in connection with the relocation of the proximity business 
the restructuring charges and their utilization are summarized as follows all figures in us thousands balance at beginning of period restructuring charge accrued at acquisition utilized balance at end of period year ended december  facility related severance and other year ended december  facility related severance and other year ended december  facility related severance and other included in the third quarter facility restructuring charge was thousand for the write down of certain fixed assets  mainly furniture and fixtures 
these assets were disposed of as part of the lease assignment of our sunrise  florida head office 
included in the restructuring charge was thousand for the write down of certain fixed assets used at tradeshows and the riverside facility 
all charges  other than the fixed asset write downs  will result in direct cash outlays 
the realizable value of these assets has been estimated from the expected market price of similar assets 
during the first quarter of we initiated a further restructuring program to reduce our operating expenses 
this plan involves the termination of employees and is expected to cost thousand 
all severance payments are expected to be made by the end of the third quarter of we believe the restructurings described above will enable us to reduce our otherwise projected expenses and uses of cash for operations by approximately million in the vast majority of the cost reductions relate to research and development 
comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december revenue revenue increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the million increase in revenue is attributable to an increase in revenues in the first half of relative to the first half of revenue growth was principally driven by growth in asia pacific  primarily by sales to broadcast communications in new zealand  and in europe  partly as a result of sales by airspan israel  which we acquired in october we project that our revenue will increase in fiscal primarily as a result of the acquisition of the proximity business 
revenues from the proximity business are currently projected to exceed million in the year ended december  see risk factors we currently depend on a few key customers 
cost of revenue and inventory provision cost of revenue increased from million in the year ended december  to million in the year ended december  the increase was due primarily to the increase in revenue 
as a percentage of revenue  our cost of revenue was in and in during both and we wrote down material amounts of inventory 
as a result of the depressed revenue for the first six months of  we reassessed the levels of excess and obsolete inventory and decided to write down inventory by million in the second quarter of during the second quarter of we took a million inventory provision to reflect our view that  with the full introduction of the new as product line in the quarter  demand for as equipment had lessened 
gross margin declined to in from for the year of the decline in gross margin was a function of lower average selling prices  a change in product mix and an increase in inventory provisions 
research and development expenses research and development expenses increased from million in the year ended december  to million in the year ended december  the increase was due to the additional research and development expense of the airspan israel business purchased in the fourth quarter of we expect research and development expense to increase in the early part of as we incur additional costs of the proximity business acquired from nortel networks in december our cost reduction program  initiated in the first quarter of  is expected to reduce research and development expenses for the second half of sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses increased from million in the year ended december  to million in the year ended december  the increase in sales and marketing expenses is primarily attributable to the increase in revenue partially offset by our expense reduction programs 
we have been able to sell the airspan israel products through our existing sales network 
we anticipate that the sales and marketing expenses associated with the proximity business will increase the absolute level of sales and marketing expenses in by approximately million 
in we wrote down receivables by million due to our concerns with customers in asia and eastern europe 
during we wrote down receivables by million due to our concerns with customers in asia 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses decreased from million in the year ended december  to million in the year ended december  the decrease in general and administrative expenses was primarily the result of the full year effect of our cost reduction programs  including reductions in personnel and our relocation from our original headquarters in sunrise florida to smaller offices in boca raton 
amortization of goodwill and intangibles amortization of goodwill and intangibles expense increased from thousand in the year ended december  to thousand in the year ended december  the increase arose from the amortization of intangibles identified after our fourth quarter acquisition of airspan israel 
as a result of the proximity acquisition at the end of the fourth quarter of these costs are expected to be approximately million for restructuring provision during both and we implemented expense reduction programs 
during  we made restructuring provisions totaling million to cover employee termination costs and facility closure costs 
as part of this million we recorded a million restructuring charge for the closure of our riverside  uxbridge facility 
the closure of this facility was a direct result of the decision to fully outsource all of our as and as product manufacturing 
during we charged million to restructuring expense related to further employee termination costs and an increase in the estimated closure costs of the riverside facility 
for more information regarding restructuring  see the section above entitled restructuring 
interest and other income net interest and other income  which increased from million for the year ended december  to million in the year ended december   consisted of gains and losses on foreign currency cash balances and foreign exchange hedging contracts and interest earned on cash deposits with financial institutions 
the increase in foreign currency exchange gains were partially offset by lower interest income from lower cash balances and lower interest rates in amounts from interest income were partially offset by interest expense of thousand in the year ended december  and thousand in the year ended december  interest expense decreased in as a result of the repayment of debt 
income taxes an income tax provision of thousand recorded in the year ended december relates to a foreign branch of the uk company but no income tax benefit has been recoded for the tax losses generated because overall operating losses have been experienced since inception 
the tax credit relates to the receipt of million from the united kingdom tax authorities in lieu of carrying forward tax losses related to research and development costs 
the company surrendered million of carry forward tax losses in the uk as a result 
net loss for the reasons described above  our net loss before taxes decreased from million in to million in and our net loss increased by from million in to million in comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december revenue revenue decreased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the million decline in revenue is primarily attributable to a decrease in revenues in the first half of relative to the first half of in the second half of our revenue improved and revenue for the second half of was greater than the comparable period of we believe the drop in revenue in the first half of was primarily due to a decrease in demand for telecom equipment in the usa  asia and south america 
in the second half of revenue was principally driven by growth in africa  primarily sales to siemens in south africa  and asia  mainly as a result of sales by airspan israel  which we acquired in october cost of revenue and inventory provision cost of revenue decreased from million in the year ended december  to million in the year ended december  the decrease was due primarily to the decrease in revenue 
during both and we wrote down material amounts of inventory 
during the third quarter of we ceased marketing certain product variants and we also undertook a detailed review of the levels and mix of related inventory 
as a result we wrote down inventory in the third quarter of by million 
as a result of the decline in revenue for the first six months of  we reassessed the levels of excess and obsolete inventory and decided to write down inventory by million in the second quarter of our gross margin was in compared with in the decline in gross margin was primarily a function of increased inventory provisions in and certain relatively fixed period costs being allocated to a relatively smaller revenue base 
research and development expenses research and development expenses decreased from million in the year ended december  to million in the year ended december  as part of our operating expense reduction programs introduced in the third quarters of and  we re focused our research and development priorities to lower our ongoing product development costs 
we believe these cost savings will initially be offset by the additional research and development expenses that will be incurred to further develop the wipll business  which was acquired in october sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses decreased from million in the year ended december  to million in the year ended december  the decline in sales and marketing expenses is primarily attributable to the decrease in revenue and the effect of our expense reduction programs 
the airspan israel products are being sold though our existing sales network and there has been no material increase in sales costs arising out of the acquisition 
in we wrote down receivables by million due to our concerns with customers in asia and eastern europe 
during we wrote down receivables by million 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses decreased from million in the year ended december  to million in the year ended december  the decrease in general and administrative expenses was primarily the result of our cost reduction programs  including reductions in personnel and our relocation from our original headquarters in sunrise florida to smaller offices in boca raton 
amortization of goodwill and intangibles amortization of goodwill and intangibles expense decreased from million in the year ended december  to thousand in the year ended december  this reflects the full write down of all intangibles from the original set up of the company and the implementation of fas  goodwill and other intangible assets  where goodwill in no longer amortized 
the charge recorded during arises from the amortization of intangibles identified after our fourth quarter acquisition of airspan israel 
restructuring provision during both and we implemented expense reduction programs 
during the third quarter of  we made a restructuring provision of million to cover employee termination costs and facility closures 
during  we made restructuring provisions totaling million to cover further employee termination costs and facility closure costs 
as part of this million we recorded a million restructuring charge for the closure of our riverside  uxbridge facility 
the closure of this facility was a direct result of the decision to fully outsource all of our as and as product manufacturing 
for more information regarding restructuring  see the section above entitled restructuring 
interest and other income net interest and other income  which decreased from million for the year ended december  to million in the year ended december   consisted of interest earned on cash deposits with financial institutions  foreign exchange gains and losses on cash balances and the cost of purchasing foreign exchange contracts and options 
the decrease in interest income arose from lower cash balances and lower interest rates in amounts from interest income were partially offset by interest expense of million in the year ended december  and million in the year ended december  interest expense decreased in as a result of the repayment of debt 
income taxes in general we did not record an income tax benefit for the tax losses generated because we have experienced operating losses since inception 
the tax credit provision of million includes a million credit to offset the income tax expense recorded on our extraordinary gain and a million income tax benefit for us tax losses offset against previous years federal income taxes paid on intercompany interest income 
the tax credit relates to the receipt of million from the united kingdom tax authorities in lieu of carrying forward tax losses related to research and development costs 
the company has surrendered million of carry forward tax losses in the uk as a result 
extraordinary gain the company negotiated a settlement of its million promissory note with dsc telcom lp in the first quarter of under the settlement agreement  the company agreed to pay million in the first half of  in exchange for complete forgiveness of the debt owed by the company that was originally repayable in equal installments over three years starting february  in addition  the company and dsc telcom lp mutually released each other from certain claims made by the parties relating to the formation of airspan in january the extraordinary gain of million that arose from this transaction was partially offset by tax on the gain of million to show an extraordinary gain  net of taxes  of million 
net loss for the reasons described above  our net loss increased by from million in to million in liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents totaling million and million of restricted cash that is held as collateral for performance guarantees on customer and supplier contracts and with landlords 
we do not have a line of credit or similar borrowing facility  nor do we have any material capital commitments 
since inception  we have financed our operations through private sales of convertible preferred stock  which totaled million net of transaction expenses and an initial public offering of common stock  which we completed on july  in that offering  we issued  shares of common stock for approximately million in cash net of underwriting discounts  commission and other expenses 
we have used the net proceeds of the offering for working capital and other general corporate purposes 
at december   we had no outstanding debt  compared to million at december  until we are able to generate cash from operations  if ever  we intend to use our existing cash resources to finance our operations 
we believe we have sufficient cash resources to finance our operations for at least the next twelve months 
for the year ended december   we used million cash in operating activities compared with million for the year ended december  the difference between our net loss of million and the million cash used in operating activities principally arose from non cash depreciation and amortization of million and tighter working capital control 
during we reduced our inventory by million and our receivables by million 
the net cash provided in investing activities for the year ended december  of million arose from the sale of investment securities of million along with net cash proceeds from acquisitions of million  partially offset by capital equipment purchases of million 
our financing cash flow for the year ended december  was a net outflow of million 
the outflow arose from a repayment of long term debt of million and a million purchase of treasury stock partially offset by a million decrease in restricted cash and net proceeds from issuance of common stock of million 
restricted cash increases whenever the company issues a guarantee secured by cash collateral and decreases whenever such a guarantee is cancelled or expires according to its terms 
for the year ended december   our cash and cash equivalents decreased by an aggregate of million for the reasons described above 
we do not expect the proximity business to increase our expected cash usage in the year ended december  see risk factors we have recently acquired nortel networks 
contractual obligations the impact that our contractual obligations as of december   are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods is as follows payments due by period total thereafter contractual obligations operating lease obligations    purchase obligations   as of december   the company had commitments with its main sub contract manufacturers under various purchase order and forecast arrangements  to a value of  and with other suppliers for capital equipment  to a value of the company has bank guarantees with its landlords  customers totaling  at december  the guarantees secure payment or performance obligations of the company under contracts 
the company has pledged cash to the banks as collateral for the guarantees in the same amounts as the guarantees 
these pledges have been classified as restricted cash 
we have no material commitments other than operating leases  supplier purchase commitments and forward exchange contracts mentioned herein 
see item a and note of the notes to the financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk the company s earnings are affected by changes in interest rates 
as of december  and we had cash and cash equivalents  restricted cash and short term investments of million and million  respectively 
of these amounts  in  million related to investments with purchase to maturity dates between and days in 
substantially all of the remaining amounts consisted of highly liquid investments with purchase to maturity terms of less than days 
these investments are exposed to interest rate risk  but a hypothetical increase or decrease in market interest rates by two percentage points from december  rates would cause the fair market value of these short term investments to change by an insignificant amount 
due to the short duration of these investments  a short term increase in interest rates would not have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
declines in interest rates over time would  however  reduce our interest income 
due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken to mitigate this  and their possible effects  the sensitivity analysis does not take into account any such action 
foreign currency exchange rate risk for the year ended december   of our sales were denominated in us dollars and the remaining were predominantly denominated in euro 
comparatively for the year ended december   of our sales were denominated in us dollars  were denominated in australian dollars  and the remaining were denominated predominantly in euro 
our total euro denominated sales for the year ended december  were million us million  which were recorded at an average exchange rate of us compared to total euro denominated sales for the year ended december  of million us million which were recorded at an average exchange rate of us 
although our total australian dollar denominated sales for the year ended december  were insignificant our total australian dollar denominated sales for the year ended december  were aus million  which were recorded at an average exchange rate of us aus 
if the average exchange rates used had been higher or lower during by they would have decreased or increased the total non us dollar denominated sales value by million 
we expect the proportions of sales in australian dollars and euro to fluctuate over time 
the company s sensitivity analysis for changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in changes in sales volumes 
since may  we have from time to time entered into fair value currency hedging contracts that lock in minimum exchange rates for payments due to us under some of our sales contracts where those payments are to be made in currencies other than us dollars 
we do not enter into any currency hedging activities for speculative purposes 
there was no impact from such contracts during on earnings  nor were there any fair value hedges outstanding at december  we will continue to monitor our foreign currency exposures and may modify our hedging strategies  as we deem appropriate 
we have also entered into cash flow currency hedges 
our operating results are affected by moves in foreign currency exchange rates  particularly the rate between us dollars and us pounds sterling and the us dollar and the israeli shekel 
this is because most of our operating expenses  which may fluctuate over time  are incurred in pounds sterling and israeli shekels 
to manage our pound foreign currency risk we have  at various times in  and  forecast our likely net spending in non us dollars until december  and  based on these forecasts  we have entered into forward exchange contracts to cover at least of the projected exposure 
we have entered into the following forward exchange contracts in october  we entered into a forward exchange contract to purchase million pounds sterling at an average exchange rate of us pounds sterling in eight equal amounts  from may to december at december  there were no contracts outstanding
