item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview net sales for the year ended september  increased to billion  up from billion in income before income taxes increased to million from million last year 
the improved operating results reflected higher sales  earnings and operating margins in each of the company s segments 
the company s building products operations enjoyed a solid economy in the garage door segment finished the year with improved operating results reflecting strong demand and operational improvements 
installation services  the company s other building products operation  also performed well  buoyed by active construction markets and realizing the benefits of the elimination in of an underperforming location 
specialty plastic films continued its positive operating trend  but experienced reduced unit volume toward the end of due primarily to product design changes by its major customer 
the customer will be using a narrower  printed film product designed to meet its changing needs  instead of the film laminate product currently supplied by the segment 
the conversion to the new printed film has begun and is expected to be completed in the first half of both the specialty plastic films and the garage doors segments performed well  achieving higher sales and profits while market prices for their principal raw materials were rising 
in specialty plastic films  raw material resin costs increased throughout in both north america and in europe 
it is estimated that resin cost movement produced a negative impact on operations of approximately to million 
in garage doors  escalating raw material steel costs in the second half of the year negatively impacted operating income by approximately to million 
these segments increased selling prices during the year  moderating the impact of the raw material price volatility on their operating results 
upward pressure on raw material prices has continued  and it is expected that these segments operating results in the near term will continue to be affected until prices stabilize or the segments are able to implement further selling price increases 
telephonics  the company s electronic information and communication systems segment  achieved a substantial increase in net sales and operating profit compared to shipments under a million contract for ground surveillance radar providing perimeter protection of us air force bases were a significant contributor to this segment s operational improvement 
the specialty plastic films segment continued to execute its capital program  adding film capacity in its north american operations and additional printing capacity in europe and in north america 
capital expenditures by this segment were approximately million in and the segment will add substantial additional capacity in fiscal in its operations in germany and brazil 
these investments  which will incorporate engineering and technology upgrades  are expected to provide for future geographic expansion and development of new markets

accounting policies and pronouncements critical accounting policies the company s significant accounting policies are set forth in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the following discussion of critical accounting policies addresses those policies that require management judgment and estimates and are most important in determining the company s operating results and financial condition 
the company recognizes revenues for most of its operations when title and the risks of ownership pass to its customers 
provisions for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to remit payments are recorded in the company s consolidated financial statements 
judgment is required to estimate the ultimate realization of receivables  including specific reviews for collectibility when  based on an evaluation of facts and circumstances  the company may be unable to collect amounts owed to it  as well as estimation of overall collectibility of those receivables that have not required specific review 
the company s electronic information and communication systems segment does a significant portion of its business under long term contracts 
this unit generally recognizes contract related revenue and profit using the percentage of completion method of accounting  which relies on estimates of total expected contract costs 
a significant amount of judgment is required to estimate contract costs  including estimating many variables such as costs for material  labor and subcontracting costs  as well as applicable indirect costs 
the company follows this method of accounting for its long term contracts since reasonably dependable estimates of costs applicable to various elements of a contract can be made 
since the financial reporting of these contracts depends on estimates  recognized revenues and profit are subject to revisions as contracts progress to completion 
contract cost estimates are generally updated quarterly 
revisions in revenue and profit estimates are reflected in the period in which the circumstances requiring the revision become known 
provisions are made currently for anticipated losses on uncompleted contracts 
inventory is stated at the lower of cost principally first in  first out or market 
inventory valuation requires the company to use judgment to estimate any necessary allowances for excess  slow moving and obsolete inventory  which estimates are based on assessments about future demands  market conditions and management actions 
the company sponsors several defined benefit pension plans 
the amount of the company s liability for pension benefits and the amount of pension expense recognized in the financial statements is determined using actuarial assumptions such as the discount rate  the long term rate of return on plan assets and the rate of compensation increases 
judgment is required to annually determine the rates to be used in performing the actuarial calculations 
the company evaluates these assumptions with its actuarial and investment advisors and believes that they are within accepted industry ranges 
in the discount rate was lowered to reflect current market conditions 
upon acquisition  the excess of cost over the fair value of an acquired business net assets is recorded as goodwill 
annually in its fourth fiscal quarter  the company evaluates goodwill for impairment by comparing the carrying value of its operating units to estimates of the related operation s fair values 
an evaluation would also be performed if an event occurs or circumstances change such that the estimated fair value of the company s operating units would be reduced below its carrying value 
the company depreciates property  plant and equipment on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives  which are based upon the nature of the assets and their planned use in the company s operations 
events and circumstances such as changes in operating plans  technological change or regulatory matters could affect the manner in which long lived assets are held and used 
judgment is required to establish depreciable lives for operating assets and to evaluate events or circumstances for indications that the value of long lived assets has been impaired 
income taxes include current year amounts that are payable or refundable and deferred taxes reflecting the company s estimate of the future tax consequences of temporary differences between amounts reflected in the financial statements and their tax basis 
changes in tax laws and rates may affect the amount of recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities 
recent accounting pronouncements in october the financial accounting standards board ratified the consensus of the emerging issues task force on issue  the effect of contingently convertible instruments on diluted earnings per share 
this consensus requires contingently convertible debt to be included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share even though related market based contingencies have not been met 
holders of the company s convertible subordinated notes are entitled to convert their notes into the company s common stock upon the occurrence of certain events and on the terms described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
shares potentially issuable upon conversion will be included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share using the treasury stock method 
adoption of issue  which becomes effective for fiscal  will not affect the company s fiscal or previously reported diluted earnings per share amounts
