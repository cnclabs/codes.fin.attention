item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations expenses 
other healthcare regulations fraud and abuse laws 
provisions of the social security act  commonly referred to as the fraud and abuse provisions  prohibit the filing of false or fraudulent claims with medicare or medicaid and the payment or receipt of any form of remuneration in return for the referral of medicare or medicaid patients or arranging for the referral of patients  or in return for the recommendation  arrangement  purchase  lease or order of items or services that are covered by medicare or medicaid programs 
violation of these provisions could constitute a felony criminal offense and applicable sanctions include imprisonment of up to five years  criminal fines of up to  civil money penalties of up to  per act plus three times the amount claimed or three times the remuneration offered and exclusion from the medicare and medicaid programs 
many states have adopted similar prohibitions against payments that are intended to induce referrals of medicaid and other third party payor patients 
the office of inspector general  department of health and human services oig  has published numerous safe harbors that exempt some practices from enforcement action under the federal fraud and abuse laws 
these safe harbors exempt specified activities  including bona fide employment relationships  some contracts for the rental of space or equipment  and some personal service arrangements and management contracts 
while the failure to satisfy all of the requirements of a particular safe harbor does not necessarily mean that the arrangement is unlawful  arrangements that do not satisfy a particular safe harbor may be subject to scrutiny by the oig 
we are required under the medicare conditions of participation and some state licensing laws to contract with numerous healthcare providers and practitioners  including physicians  hospitals and nursing homes  and to arrange for these individuals or entities to provide services to our patients 
in addition  we have contracts with other suppliers  including pharmacies  ambulance services and medical equipment companies 
some of these individuals or entities may refer  or be in a position to refer  patients to us  and we may refer  or be in a position to refer  patients to these individuals or entities 
these arrangements may not qualify for a safe harbor 
we believe that our contracts and arrangements with providers  practitioners and suppliers are not in violation of applicable fraud and abuse laws 
we cannot assure you  however  that these laws will ultimately be interpreted in a manner consistent with our practices 
from time to time  various federal and state agencies  such as the department of human services  issue a variety of pronouncements  including fraud alerts  the office of inspector general s annual work plan and other reports  identifying practices that may be subject to heightened scrutiny 
for example  in march  the oig issued a special fraud alert titled fraud and abuse in nursing home arrangements with hospices 
this special fraud alert focused on payments received by nursing homes from hospices 

table of contents we believe that we are in material compliance with all applicable federal and state fraud and abuse laws 
however  we cannot assure that these laws will not be interpreted in the future in such a way as to cause us to be in violation of these laws 
hipaa fraud and abuse provisions 
the health insurance portability and accountability act of hipaa broadened the application of the federal fraud and abuse provisions beyond the medicare and medicaid programs 
an amendment included in hipaa extended the federal fraud and abuse provisions prohibitions to all federal healthcare programs  which include all state healthcare programs receiving federal funding but exclude the federal employees health benefit program 
additionally  hipaa created five new categories of criminal federal offenses that apply to all healthcare benefit programs regardless of whether such programs are funded in whole or in part with federal funds 
the five new categories of federal offenses created by hipaa are healthcare fraud  theft or embezzlement in connection with healthcare  false statements relating to healthcare matters  obstruction of criminal investigations of healthcare offenses  and money laundering 
violations of these provisions constitute felony criminal offenses and applicable sanctions include imprisonment and or substantial monetary fines 
civil monetary penalties statute 
the federal civil monetary penalties statute prohibits any person or entity from knowingly submitting false or fraudulent claims  offering to or making payments to a beneficiary to induce the beneficiary to use a particular provider or supplier  or arranging or contracting with an individual or entity that the person or entity knows or should know is excluded from the medicare or medicaid programs for the provision of items or services that may be reimbursed  in whole or in part  by the medicare or medicaid programs 
violations can result in civil monetary penalties ranging from  to  per claim or act  plus damages of not more than three times the amount claimed for each such item or service 
false claims act 
in addition to federal fraud and abuse laws  under separate statutes  the submission of claims for items and services that are not provided as claimed may lead to civil money penalties  criminal fines and imprisonment  and or exclusion from participation in federally funded healthcare programs  including the medicare and medicaid programs 
these false claims statutes include the federal false claims act 
under the federal false claims act  in addition to actions being initiated by the federal government  a private party may bring an action on behalf of the federal government 
these private parties are often referred to as qui tam relators  and are entitled to share in any amounts recovered by the government 
both direct enforcement activity by the government and qui tam actions have increased significantly in recent years and have increased the risk that a healthcare company  like us  will have to defend a false claims action  pay fines or be excluded from the medicare and or medicaid programs as a result of an investigation arising out of this type of an action 
many states have enacted similar laws providing for the imposition of civil and criminal penalties for the filing of fraudulent claims 
because of the complexity of the government regulations applicable to our industry  we cannot assure that we will not be the subject of an action under the false claims act or similar state law 
the stark law and state physician self referral laws 
section of the social security act  commonly known as the stark law  prohibits physicians  subject to the exceptions described below  from referring medicare or medicaid patients to any entity providing designated health services in which the physician has an ownership or investment interest or with which the physician has entered into a compensation arrangement 
persons who violate the stark law are subject to civil monetary penalties and exclusion from the medicare and medicaid programs 
hospice care is not specifically enumerated as a health service subject to this prohibition  however  some of the ten designated health services under the stark law  including physical therapy  pharmacy services and certain infusion therapies  are among the specific services furnished by our hospices 
regulations interpreting the stark law currently provide that investments by referring physicians in a hospice will not violate the stark law 
we cannot assure you  however  that future regulatory changes will not result in us becoming subject to the stark law s prohibition in the future 
many states have also enacted physician self referral laws  which generally prohibit financial relationships with referral sources that are not limited to services for which medicare or medicaid payment may be made 
similar penalties  including loss of license or eligibility to participate in government programs and civil and 
table of contents criminal fines  apply to violations of these state self referral laws 
these laws vary from state to state and have seldom been interpreted by the courts or regulatory agencies 
we believe that our relationships with physicians do not violate these state self referral laws 
however  we cannot assure that these laws will not be interpreted in the future in such a way as to call into question our relationships with physicians 
corporate practice of medicine and fee splitting 
most states have laws that restrict or prohibit unlicensed persons or business entities  including corporations  from employing physicians and or prohibit direct or indirect payments or fee splitting arrangements between physicians and unlicensed persons or business entities 
possible sanctions for violations of these restrictions include loss of a physician s license  civil and criminal penalties and rescission of business arrangements 
these laws vary from state to state  are often vague and have seldom been interpreted by the courts or regulatory agencies 
we contract with physicians to provide medical direction and patient care services 
a state with these prohibitions could determine that the provision of patient care services by our contracted physicians violates the corporate practice of medicine and or fee splitting prohibitions 
we structure our arrangements with healthcare providers to comply with the relevant state law 
however  we cannot assure you that government officials charged with the responsibility for enforcing these laws will not assert that we  or transactions in which we are involved  are in violation of these laws 
these laws may also be interpreted by the courts in a manner inconsistent with our interpretations 
the determinations or interpretations by a state may require us to restructure our arrangements with physicians in the applicable state 
health information practices 
the administrative simplification provisions of hipaa contain provisions that require many organizations  including us  to implement very significant  potentially expensive new computer systems and business procedures designed to protect each patient s individual healthcare information 
hipaa requires the department of health and human services to issue rules to define and implement patient privacy standards 
among the standards that the department of health and human services has or will adopt pursuant to hipaa are standards for the following electronic transactions and code sets  unique identifiers for providers  employers  health plans and individuals  privacy  security and electronic signatures  and enforcement 
on december   the secretary of the department of health and human services published a final rule establishing standards for the privacy of individually identifiable health information 
the final rule became effective on april   and compliance was required by april  these privacy standards apply to all health plans  all healthcare clearinghouses and many healthcare providers  including healthcare providers that transmit health information in an electronic form in connection with certain standard transactions 
we are a covered entity under the final rule 
the privacy standards apply to protect individually identifiable health information held or disclosed by a covered entity in any form  whether communicated electronically  on paper or orally 
these standards not only require our compliance with rules governing the use and disclosure of protected health information  but they also require us to impose those rules  by contract  on any business associate to whom such information is disclosed 
on february   the secretary of the department of health and human services published a final rule that establishes  in part  standards for the security of health information by health plans  healthcare clearinghouses and healthcare providers that maintain or transmit any health information in electronic form  regardless of format 
the final rule became effective april   with a compliance date of april  we are a covered entity under the final rule 
these security standards require covered entities to establish and maintain reasonable and appropriate administrative  technical and physical safeguards to ensure integrity  confidentiality and availability of the information 
the security standards were designed to protect health information against reasonably anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of the information and to protect the information against unauthorized use or disclosure 
although the security standards do not 
table of contents reference or advocate a specific technology  and affected entities have the flexibility to choose their own technical solutions  we expect that compliance with the security standards will require us to implement significant systems and procedures 
a violation of these standards could result in civil monetary penalties of per incident  up to a maximum of  per person  per year  per standard 
the final rule also provides for criminal penalties of up to  and one year in prison for knowingly and improperly obtaining or disclosing protected health information  up to  and five years in prison for obtaining protected health information under false pretenses  and up to  and ten years in prison for obtaining or disclosing protected health information with the intent to sell  transfer or use such information for commercial advantage  personal gain or malicious harm 
compliance with these standards has required significant commitment and action by us 
we have management in place to direct our compliance with these standards and we are now in compliance with the privacy standards and the electronic transactions and code sets standards 
additional federal and state laws 
the federal government and all states also regulate other aspects of the hospice industry 
in particular  our operations are subject to federal and state laws covering professional services  the dispensing of drugs and other types of hospice activities 
some of our employees are subject to state laws and regulations governing the ethics and practice of medicine  respiratory therapy  pharmacy and nursing 
our operations are subject to periodic survey by government entities to assure compliance with applicable state licensing and medicare and medicaid certification  as the case may be 
from time to time in the ordinary course of business  we  like other healthcare companies  receive survey reports containing deficiencies for alleged failure to comply with applicable requirements 
we review these reports and take appropriate corrective action 
the failure to effect corrective action or to obtain  renew or maintain any of the required regulatory approvals  certifications or licenses could materially adversely affect our business and could prevent our hospice programs involved from offering services to patients 
in addition  laws and regulations often are adopted to regulate new products  services and industries 
we cannot assure that either the states or the federal government will not impose additional regulations upon our activities that might adversely affect us 
as a large employer  we are subject to various federal and state laws regulating employment practices 
we are specifically subject to audits by various federal and state agencies regarding our compliance with these laws 
we believe that our employment practices are in material compliance with applicable federal and state laws 
however  we cannot assure that government officials charged with the responsibility of enforcing these laws will not assert that we are in violation of these laws  or that these laws will be interpreted by the courts in a manner consistent with our interpretations 
a substantial number of hospice programs which could be potential acquisition targets for us are operated by not for profit entities 
some states require government review  and in some cases approval  of transactions in which a not for profit entity sells a healthcare facility or business 
this increased scrutiny may increase the difficulty in completing or prevent the completion of acquisitions in some states in the future 
we have acquired two not for profit hospice programs and did not encounter any substantial regulatory or governmental obstacles to our acquisition or integration of those hospice programs 
we cannot  however  assure that we will not encounter regulatory or governmental obstacles in connection with our acquisition of not for profit hospices in the future 
we maintain an internal corporate compliance program and from time to time retain regulatory counsel for guidance on applicable laws and regulations 
however  we cannot assure that our practices  if reviewed  would be found to be in compliance with applicable federal and state laws  as the laws ultimately may be interpreted 

table of contents compliance and continuous quality improvement programs we have a comprehensive company wide compliance program 
our compliance program provides for the appointment of a compliance officer and committee  adoption of a corporate code of business conduct and ethics  employee education and training  implementation of an internal system for reporting concerns on a confidential  anonymous basis  ongoing internal auditing and monitoring programs  and a means for enforcing the compliance programs policies 
as part of our ongoing internal auditing and monitoring programs  we conduct periodic  at least annual  internal regulatory audits and mock surveys at each of our hospice programs 
if a program does not achieve a satisfactory rating  we require it to prepare and implement a plan of correction 
we then perform a follow up audit and survey to verify that all deficiencies identified in the initial audit and survey have been corrected 
as required under the medicare conditions of participation  we have a continuous quality improvement program in place 
our continuous quality improvement program involves on going education of staff and quarterly continuous quality improvement meetings at each of our hospice programs and at our corporate office  quarterly comprehensive audits of patient charts performed by each of our hospice programs  and at least once a year  a comprehensive audit of patient charts performed on each of our hospice programs by our corporate staff 
if a hospice program fails to achieve a satisfactory rating on a patient chart audit  we require the program to prepare and implement a plan of correction 
we then conduct a follow up patient chart audit to verify that appropriate action has been taken to prevent future deficiencies 
we continually expand and refine our compliance and continuous quality improvement programs 
specific written policies  procedures  training and educational materials and programs  as well as auditing and monitoring activities  have been prepared and implemented to address the functional and operational aspects of our business 
our programs also address specific problem areas identified through regulatory interpretation and enforcement activities 
our policies  training  standardized documentation requirements  reviews and audits also specifically address our financial arrangements with our referral sources  including fraud and abuse laws and physician self referral laws 
competition hospice care in the united states is competitive 
because payments for hospice services are primarily paid on a per diem basis  we compete primarily on our ability to deliver quality  responsive services 
the hospice care market is highly fragmented  and we compete with a large number of organizations  some of which have or may obtain significantly greater financial and marketing resources than us 
based on industry data  we estimate that approximately of existing hospice programs are local not for profit programs 
most hospice programs are small and medium sized programs 
we also compete with a number of national and regional hospice providers  including vitas healthcare corporation and vistacare  inc  hospitals  nursing homes  home health agencies and other healthcare providers  including those with which we presently maintain contractual relationships  that offer hospice and or palliative care services 
many of them offer home care to patients who are terminally ill  and some actively market palliative care and hospice like programs 
in addition  various healthcare companies have diversified into the hospice market 
for example  beverly enterprises  inc and manor care  inc 
compete with us in some of our markets 

table of contents relatively few barriers to entry exist in the markets served by us 
accordingly  other companies that are not currently providing hospice care may enter these markets and expand the variety of services offered 
insurance we maintain primary general and professional liability coverage on a claims made and company wide basis with limits of million per occurrence and million in the aggregate 
in addition  we maintain umbrella coverage on a claims made and company wide basis with a limit of million 
while we believe that our insurance coverage is adequate for our current operations  we cannot assure that our coverage will cover all future claims or will be available in adequate amounts or at a reasonable cost 
our current general and professional liability policy does not provide coverage for claims that arise from acts that occurred prior to the policy s start date of april  from march  to april   reliance national insurance company provided our insurance coverage 
since april   lexington insurance company  a subsidiary of american international group  inc  has provided our insurance coverage 
during the fourth quarter of  the insurance commissioner of the commonwealth of pennsylvania placed reliance national insurance company in liquidation 
based on our estimation of open claims  we are maintaining a reserve to cover potential losses resulting from current and future litigation claims covered by reliance national insurance company to the extent its assets are not sufficient to pay such claims 
although we believe that the amount reserved is adequate to cover our potential losses  there can be no assurance that our losses will not exceed the amount reserved 
our profitability will be negatively impacted to the extent our actual losses exceed the amount reserved 
employees as of february   we had  full time employees and part time employees 
none of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements 
we believe that our relations with our employees are good 
some risks related to our business an investment in our common stock is subject to the significant risks inherent in our business 
readers should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below and the other information included in this annual report on form k 
the occurrence of any of the events described below could have a material adverse effect on our business 
this could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline  perhaps significantly 
we are highly dependent on payments from medicare and medicaid 
if there are changes in the rates or methods governing these payments for our services  our net patient service revenue and profits could materially decline 
we are highly dependent on payments from medicare and medicaid 
approximately  and of our net patient service revenue for the years ended december   and  respectively  consisted of payments  paid primarily on a per diem basis  from the medicare and medicaid programs 
because we generally receive fixed payments for our hospice care services based on the level of care provided to our hospice patients  we are at risk for the cost of services provided to our hospice patients 
reductions in amounts paid by government programs for our services or changes in methods or regulations governing payments could cause our net patient service revenue and profits to materially decline 
overall payments made by medicare to us are subject to a cap amount calculated by the medicare fiscal intermediary at the end of the hospice cap period 
the hospice cap period runs from november st of each year through october st of the following year 
total medicare payments to us during this period are compared to the cap amount for this period 
payments in excess of the cap amount must be returned by us to medicare 
the cap amount is calculated by multiplying the number of beneficiaries electing hospice care during the period by a statutory amount that is indexed for inflation 
the cap amount was  for the twelve month period ending october  the cap amount for the twelve month period ending 
table of contents october  has not been established by medicare 
once published  the new cap amount will become effective retroactively for all services performed since november  the hospice cap amount is computed on a program by program 
our net patient service revenue for was reduced by approximately million as a result of six of our hospice programs exceeding the medicare cap 
our ability to comply with this limitation depends on a number of factors relating to a given hospice program  including the rate at which our patient census increases  the average length of stay and mix in level of care 
our revenue and profitability may be materially reduced if we are unable to comply with this and other medicare payment limitations 
we cannot assure that additional hospices will not exceed the cap amount in the future 
we operate in an industry that is subject to extensive federal  state and local regulation  and changes in law and regulatory interpretations could reduce our net patient service revenue and profitability 
the healthcare industry is subject to extensive federal  state and local laws  rules and regulations relating to  among others payment for services  conduct of operations  including fraud and abuse  anti kickback prohibitions  physician self referral prohibitions and false claims  privacy and security of medical records  employment practices  and facility and professional licensure  including certificates of need  surveys  certification and recertification requirements  and corporate practice of medicine prohibitions 
in recent years  congress and some state legislatures have introduced an increasing number of proposals to make significant changes in the healthcare system 
changes in law and regulatory interpretations could reduce our net patient service revenue and profitability 
recently  there have been heightened coordinated civil and criminal enforcement efforts by both federal and state government agencies relating to the healthcare industry 
there has also been an increase in the filing of actions by private individuals on behalf of the federal government against healthcare companies alleging the filing of false or fraudulent medicare or medicaid claims 
this heightened enforcement activity increases our potential exposure to damaging lawsuits  investigations and other enforcement actions 
any such action could distract our management and adversely affect our business reputation and profitability 
in the future  different interpretations or enforcement of laws  rules and regulations governing the healthcare industry could subject our current business practices to allegations of impropriety or illegality or could require us to make changes in our facilities  equipment  personnel  services and capital expenditure programs  increase our operating expenses and distract our management 
if we fail to comply with these extensive laws and government regulations  we could become ineligible to receive government program payments  suffer civil and criminal penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations 
in addition  we could be forced to expend considerable resources responding to an investigation or other enforcement action under these laws or regulations 
for a more detailed discussion of the regulatory environment in which we operate  see government regulation 
almost half of our hospice patients reside in nursing homes 
changes in the laws and regulations regarding payments for hospice services and room and board provided to our hospice patients residing in nursing homes could reduce our net patient service revenue and profitability 
for our hospice patients receiving nursing home care under certain state medicaid programs who elect hospice care under medicare or medicaid  the state must pay us  in addition to the applicable medicare or medicaid hospice per diem rate  an amount equal to at least of the medicaid per diem nursing home rate for room and board furnished to the patient by the nursing home 
we contract with various nursing homes for the nursing homes provision of certain room and board services that the nursing homes would otherwise provide medicaid nursing home patients 
we bill and collect from the applicable state medicaid program an 
table of contents amount equal to at least of the amount that would otherwise have been paid directly to the nursing home under the state s medicaid plan 
under our standard nursing home contracts  we pay the nursing home for these room and board services at of the medicaid per diem nursing home rate 
government studies conducted in the last several years have suggested that the reimbursement levels for hospice patients living in nursing homes may be excessive 
in particular  the federal government has expressed concern that hospice programs may provide fewer services to patients residing in nursing homes than to patients living in other settings due to the presence of the nursing home s own staff to address problems that might otherwise be handled by hospice personnel 
because hospice programs are paid a fixed per diem amount  regardless of the volume or duration of services provided  the government is concerned that hospice programs may be increasing their profitability by shifting the cost of certain patient care services to the nursing home 
the reduction or elimination of medicare payments for hospice patients residing in nursing homes would significantly reduce our net patient service revenue and profitability 
in addition  changes in the way nursing homes are reimbursed for room and board services provided to hospice patients residing in nursing homes could affect our ability to obtain referrals from nursing homes 
a reduction in referrals from nursing homes would adversely affect our net patient service revenue and profitability 
if we are unable to maintain relationships with existing patient referral sources or to establish new referral sources  our growth and profitability could be adversely affected 
our success is heavily dependent on referrals from physicians  nursing homes  assisted living facilities  adult care centers  hospitals  managed care companies  insurance companies and other patient referral sources in the communities that our hospice locations serve  as well as on our ability to maintain good relations with these referral sources 
our referral sources are not contractually obligated to refer hospice patients to us and may refer their patients to other hospice care providers  or not at all 
our growth and profitability depend significantly on our ability to provide good patient and family care  to establish and maintain close working relationships with these patient referral sources and to increase awareness and acceptance of hospice care by our referral sources and their patients 
we cannot assure that we will be able to maintain our existing referral source relationships or that we will be able to develop and maintain new relationships in existing or new markets 
our loss of existing relationships or our failure to develop new relationships could adversely affect our ability to expand our operations and operate profitably 
moreover  we cannot assure that awareness or acceptance of hospice care will increase 
our growth strategy to develop new hospice locations in new and existing markets may not be successful  which could adversely impact our growth and profitability 
a significant element of our growth strategy is expansion of our business by developing new hospice programs in new markets and growth in our existing markets 
this aspect of our growth strategy may not be successful  which could adversely impact our growth and profitability 
we cannot assure that we will be able to identify markets that meet our selection criteria for new hospice programs  hire and retain a qualified management team to operate each of our new hospice programs  manage a large and geographically diverse group of hospice programs  become medicare and medicaid certified in new markets  transfer provider numbers between hospice programs in a timely manner  generate sufficient hospice admissions in new markets to operate profitably in these new markets  or compete effectively with existing programs in new markets 

table of contents our growth strategy to acquire other hospices may not be successful and the integration of future acquisitions may be difficult and disruptive to our ongoing business 
in addition to growing existing programs and developing new hospice programs  an element of our growth strategy is expansion through the acquisition of other hospice programs 
we cannot assure that our acquisition strategy will be successful 
the success of our acquisition strategy is dependent upon a number of factors  including our ability to identify suitable acquisition candidates  our ability to negotiate favorable acquisition terms  including purchase price  which may be adversely affected due to increased competition with other buyers  the availability of financing on terms favorable to us  or at all  our ability to integrate effectively the systems and operations of acquired hospices  our ability to retain key personnel of acquired hospices  and our ability to obtain required regulatory approvals 
acquisitions involve a number of other risks  including diversion of management s attention from other business concerns and the assumption of known or unknown liabilities of acquired hospices  including liabilities for failure to comply with healthcare laws and regulations 
the integration of acquired hospices may place significant strains on our current operating and financial systems and controls 
we may not successfully overcome these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with our acquisition strategy 
an estimated of hospice programs in the united states are not for profit programs 
accordingly  it is likely that a substantial number of acquisition opportunities may involve hospices operated by not for profit entities 
in recent years  several states have increased review and oversight of transactions involving the sale of healthcare facilities by not for profit entities 
although the level of review varies from state to state  the current trend is to provide for increased governmental review  and in some cases approval  of transactions in which a not for profit entity sells a healthcare facility or business 
this increased scrutiny may increase the difficulty in completing  or prevent the completion of  acquisitions in some states in the future 
our loss of key management personnel or our inability to hire and retain skilled employees could adversely affect our business and our ability to increase patient referrals 
our future success depends  in significant part  upon the continued service of our senior management personnel 
the loss of services of one or more of our key senior management personnel or our inability to hire and retain new skilled employees could adversely affect our future operating results 
in addition  the loss of key community education representatives could negatively impact our ability to maintain or increase patient referrals  a key aspect of our growth strategy 
as we previously disclosed in our earnings release in february  as part of our ceo succession plan  david c 
gasmire  president and former chief operating officer  has been promoted to the position of president and chief executive officer  effective january  richard r 
burnham  chairman of the board and former chief executive officer  will continue as chairman of the board 
during  with the assistance of mr 
burnham  mr 
gasmire began the orderly transition to chief executive officer as part of our ceo succession plan 
we do not expect mr 
gasmire s and mr 
burnham s changing management roles to have any adverse affect on our future operating results 
deborah hoffpauir  former senior vice president of operations  has been promoted to the position of chief operating officer 
competition for skilled employees is intense  and the process of locating and recruiting skilled employees with the combination of qualifications and attributes required to care effectively for terminally ill patients and their families can be difficult and lengthy 
we cannot assure that we will be successful in attracting  retaining or training highly skilled nursing  management  community education  operations  admissions and other personnel 
our business could be disrupted and our growth and profitability negatively impacted if we are unable to attract and retain skilled employees 

table of contents a nationwide shortage of qualified nurses could adversely affect our profitability and our ability to grow and continue to provide quality  responsive hospice services to our patients as nursing wages and benefits increase 
we currently employ approximately full time nurses and part time nurses 
we depend on qualified nurses to provide quality  responsive hospice services to our patients 
there is currently a nationwide shortage of qualified nurses that is being felt in some of the markets in which we provide hospice services  primarily in california 
in response to the shortage of qualified nurses in these markets  we have increased and are likely to continue to increase our wages and benefits to recruit and retain nurses or to engage contract nurses until we hire permanent staff nurses 
our inability to attract and retain qualified nurses could adversely affect our ability to provide quality  responsive hospice services to our patients and our ability to increase patient census in those markets 
in addition  because we operate in a fixed reimbursement environment  increases in the wages and benefits that we must provide to attract and retain qualified nurses or an increase in our reliance on contract nurses could negatively impact our profitability 
medical reviews and audits by governmental and private payors could result in material payment recoupments and payments denials  which could negatively impact our business 
medicare fiscal intermediaries and other payors periodically conduct pre payment or post payment medical reviews or other audits of our reimbursement claims 
in order to conduct these reviews  the payor requests documentation from us and then reviews that documentation to determine compliance with applicable rules and regulations  including the eligibility of patients to receive hospice benefits  the appropriateness of the care provided to those patients  and the documentation of that care 
we cannot predict whether medical reviews or similar audits by federal or state agencies or commercial payors of our hospice programs reimbursement claims will result in material recoupments or denials  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
if any of our hospice programs fails to comply with the medicare conditions of participation  that program could be terminated from medicare hospice reimbursement  thereby adversely affecting our net patient service revenue and profitability 
each of our hospice programs must comply with the extensive conditions of participation of the medicare hospice reimbursement benefit 
if any of our hospice programs fails to meet any of the medicare conditions of participation  that program may receive a notice of deficiency from the applicable state surveyor 
if that hospice program then fails to institute a plan of correction and correct the deficiency within the correction period provided by the state surveyor  that program could be terminated from receiving medicare reimbursement 
for example  under medicare hospice program  each of our hospice programs must demonstrate that volunteers provide administrative and direct patient care services in an amount equal to at least five percent of the total patient care hours provided by our employees and contract staff at the hospice program 
if we are unable to attract a sufficient number of volunteers at one of our hospice programs to meet this requirement  that program could be terminated from the medicare benefit if the program fails to address the deficiency within the applicable correction period 
any termination of one or more of our hospice programs from medicare reimbursement for failure to satisfy the volunteer or other conditions of participation could adversely affect our net patient service revenue and profitability 
many states have certificate of need laws or other regulatory provisions that may adversely impact our ability to expand into new markets and thereby limit our ability to grow and to increase our net patient service revenue 
many states have enacted certificate of need laws that require prior state approval to open new healthcare facilities or expand services at existing facilities 
currently  the states of arkansas  florida  hawaii  kentucky  maryland  new york  north carolina  tennessee  vermont  washington and west virginia have certificate of need laws that apply to hospices 
of these states  we currently operate in arkansas and tennessee 
florida and new york have additional barriers to entry 
florida places restrictions on the ability of for profit corporations to own and operate hospices  and new york places restrictions on the corporate ownership of hospices 

table of contents accordingly  our ability to operate in florida and new york is restricted 
these laws could affect our ability to expand into new markets and to expand our services and facilities in existing markets 
we may not be able to compete successfully against other hospice providers  and competitive pressures may limit our ability to maintain or increase our market position and adversely affect our profitability 
hospice care in the united states is competitive 
in many areas in which our hospice programs are located  we compete with a large number of organizations  including community based hospice providers  national and regional companies  hospital based hospice and palliative care programs  nursing homes  and home health agencies 
some of our current and potential competitors have or may obtain significantly greater financial and marketing resources than us 
various healthcare companies have diversified into the hospice market 
for example  a few large healthcare providers  including beverly enterprises  inc and manor care  inc  have entered the hospice business directly or through affiliates 
relatively few barriers to entry exist in our local markets 
accordingly  other companies  including hospitals and other healthcare organizations that are not currently providing hospice care  may expand their services to include it 
we may encounter increased competition in the future that could negatively impact patient referrals to us  limit our ability to maintain or increase our market position and adversely affect our profitability 
if our costs were to increase more rapidly than the fixed payment adjustments we receive for our hospice services from medicare and medicaid  our profitability could be negatively impacted 
we generally receive fixed payments for our hospice services based on the level of care we provide to patients and their families 
accordingly  our profitability is largely dependent on our ability to manage costs of providing hospice services 
medicare and medicaid currently provide for an annual adjustment of the various hospice payment rates based on the increase or decrease of the medical care expenditure category of the consumer price index  however  the increases have usually been less than actual inflation 
if this adjustment were eliminated or reduced  or if our costs of providing hospice services  over one half of which consist of labor costs  increased more than the annual adjustment  our profitability could be negatively impacted 
in addition  cost pressures resulting from shorter patient lengths of stay and the use of more expensive forms of palliative care  including drugs and drug delivery systems  could negatively impact our profitability 
new federal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to patient privacy could require us to expend substantial sums on acquiring and implementing new information systems  which could negatively impact our profitability 
there are currently numerous legislative and regulatory initiatives at both the state and federal levels that address patient privacy concerns 
in particular  hipaa contains provisions that may require us to implement expensive new computer systems and business procedures designed to protect the privacy and security of each of our patient s individual health information 
the department of health and human services published final regulations addressing patient privacy on december  and final regulations addressing the security of such health information on february  we have complied with the requirements of the privacy regulations and must comply with the requirements of the security regulations by april  because the final security regulations have only recently been issued  we cannot predict the total financial or other impact of the regulations on our operations 
compliance with these rules could require us to spend substantial sums  which could negatively impact our profitability 

table of contents our net patient service revenue and profitability may be constrained by cost containment initiatives undertaken by insurers and managed care companies 
initiatives undertaken by insurers and managed care companies to contain healthcare costs affect the profitability of our hospice programs 
we have a number of contractual arrangements with insurers and managed care companies for providing hospice care for a fixed fee 
these payors attempt to control healthcare costs by contracting with hospices and other healthcare providers to obtain services on a discounted basis 
we believe that this trend may continue and may limit payments for healthcare services  including hospice services 
in addition  future changes in medicare related to medicare hmo programs could result in managed care companies becoming financially responsible for providing hospice care 
if such changes were to occur  managed care companies could be responsible for payments to us out of their medicare payments  and a greater percentage of our net patient service revenue could come from managed care companies 
as managed care companies attempt to control hospice related costs  they could reduce payments to us for hospice services 
these developments could negatively impact our net patient service revenue and profitability 
a significant reduction in the carrying value of our goodwill could have a material adverse effect on our profitability 
a significant portion of our total assets consists of intangible assets  primarily goodwill 
goodwill accounted for approximately of our total assets as of december  any event that results in the significant impairment of our goodwill  such as closure of a hospice program or sustained operating losses  could have a material adverse effect on our profitability 
professional and general liability claims may have an adverse effect on us either because our insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover the losses or because claims against us  regardless of merit or eventual outcome  may adversely affect our reputation  our ability to obtain patient referrals or our ability to expand our business 
in recent years  participants in the healthcare industry have become subject to an increasing number of lawsuits  including allegations of medical malpractice 
many of these lawsuits involve large claims and substantial defense costs 
from time to time  we are subject to these types of lawsuits 
while we maintain professional and general liability insurance  some risks and liabilities  including claims for punitive damages  are not covered by insurance 
in addition  we cannot assure that our coverage will be adequate to cover potential losses 
while we have been able to obtain liability insurance in the past  insurance can be expensive and may not be available in the future on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
claims  regardless of their merit or eventual outcome  may also adversely affect our reputation  our ability to obtain patient referrals or our ability to expand our business  as well as divert management resources from the operation of our business 
our current general and professional liability policy does not provide coverage for claims that arise from acts that occurred prior to the policy s start date of april  from march  to april   reliance national insurance company provided our insurance coverage 
since april   lexington insurance company  a subsidiary of american international group  inc  has provided our insurance coverage 
during the fourth quarter of  the insurance commissioner of the commonwealth of pennsylvania placed reliance national insurance company in liquidation 
based on our estimation of open claims  we are maintaining a reserve to cover potential losses resulting from current and future litigation claims covered by reliance national insurance company to the extent its assets are not sufficient to pay such claims 
although we believe that the amount reserved is adequate to cover our potential losses  there can be no assurance that our losses will not exceed the amount reserved 
our profitability will be negatively impacted to the extent our actual losses exceed the amount reserved 
we may need additional capital to fund our operations and finance our growth  and we may not be able to obtain it on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
we expect that our existing funds  cash flows from operations and borrowings under our credit agreement will be sufficient to fund our working capital needs  anticipated hospice development and acquisition plans  
table of contents debt service requirements and other anticipated capital requirements for at least months following the date of this annual report on form k 
continued expansion of our business through the development of new hospice programs and acquisitions may require additional capital  in particular if we were to accelerate our hospice program development and acquisition plans 
in the past  we have relied on funds raised through our initial public offering and private issuances of debt and equity and also through bank financing and cash flows from operations to support our growth 
in the future  required financing may not be available or may be available only on terms that are not favorable to us 
if we are unable to raise additional funds  we may have to delay or abandon some or all of our growth strategies 
further  if additional funds are raised through the issuance of additional equity securities  the percentage ownership of our stockholders would be diluted 
any new equity securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of our common stock 
provisions in our charter documents  under delaware law  and in our stockholder rights plan could discourage a takeover that stockholders may consider favorable 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage  delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that a stockholder may consider favorable because they authorize the issuance by the board of directors of preferred stock without the requirement of stockholder approval  which could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock  provide for a classified board of directors with staggered  three year terms  prohibit cumulative voting in the election of directors  prohibit our stockholders from acting by written consent  limit the persons who may call special meetings of stockholders  prohibit our stockholders from amending our bylaws unless the amendment is approved by the holders of at least of our shares of common stock  and establish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters to be approved by stockholders at stockholder meetings 
in addition  our certificate of incorporation prohibits the amendment by our stockholders of many provisions of our certificate of incorporation unless the amendment is approved by the holders of at least of our shares of common stock 
delaware law may also discourage  delay or prevent someone from acquiring or merging with us 
under delaware law  a corporation may not engage in a business combination with any holder of or more of its capital stock until the holder has held the stock for three years unless  among other possibilities  the board of directors approves the transaction 
our board of directors could use this provision to prevent or delay takeovers 
in addition  purchase rights distributed under our stockholder rights plan will cause substantial dilution to any person or group that attempts to acquire us without conditioning the offer on our redemption of the rights 
these provisions could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change of control transaction 
as a result  they may limit the price investors may be willing to pay for our stock in the future

payors may determine that the services provided are not covered and do not qualify for a payment or  for commercial payors  that payments are subject to usual and customary rates 
to determine net patient service revenue  we adjust gross patient service revenue for estimated payment denials and contractual adjustments based on historical experience 
we recognize net patient service revenue in the month in which our services are delivered 
services provided under the medicare program represented approximately  and of our net patient service revenue for the years ended december   and  respectively 
services provided under medicaid programs represented approximately  and of our net patient service revenue for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the payments we receive from medicare and medicaid are calculated using daily or hourly rates for each of the four levels of care we deliver and are adjusted based on geographic location 
routine home care is the largest component of our gross patient service revenue  representing  and of gross patient service revenue for the years ended december   and  respectively 
inpatient care represented  and of gross patient service revenue for the years ended december   and  respectively 
continuous care and respite care  combined  represented most of the remaining  and of gross patient service revenue for these periods  respectively 
the principal factors that impact net patient service revenue are our average daily census  levels of care provided to our patients and changes in medicare and medicaid payment rates due to adjustments for 
table of contents inflation 
average daily census is affected by the number of patients referred and admitted into our hospice program and average length of stay of those patients once admitted 
average length of stay is impacted by patients decisions of when to enroll in hospice care after diagnoses of terminal illnesses and  once enrolled  the length of the terminal illnesses 
our average hospice length of stay has increased from days in to days in this increase is  in part  related to a change in the patient diagnosis mix  to increased admissions of non cancer ailments  whose lengths of stay are typically higher than those with cancer related illnesses 
see expenses and item business hospice industry and market opportunity 
payment rates under medicare and medicaid are indexed for inflation annually  however  the increases have historically been less than actual inflation 
on october  and  the base medicare payment rates for hospice care increased by approximately over the base rates previously in effect 
these rates were further adjusted geographically by the hospice wage index 
in the future  reductions in the rate of increase in medicare and medicaid payments may have an adverse impact on our net patient service revenue and profitability 
see item business government regulation overview of government payments 
expenses because payments for hospice services are primarily paid on a per diem basis  our profitability is largely dependent on our ability to manage the expenses of providing hospice services 
we recognize expenses as incurred and classify expenses as either direct hospice care expenses or general and administrative expenses 
direct hospice care expenses primarily include direct patient care salaries and payroll taxes  pharmaceuticals  medical equipment and supplies  and inpatient costs 
length of stay impacts our direct hospice care expenses as a percentage of net patient service revenue because  if lengths of stay decline  direct hospice care expenses  which are often highest during the earliest and latter days of care for a patient  are spread against fewer days of care 
expenses are normally higher during the latter days of care  because patients generally require greater hospice services  including drugs  medical equipment and nursing care at that time due to their deteriorating medical condition 
in addition  cost pressures resulting from the use of more expensive forms of palliative care  including drugs and drug delivery systems  could negatively impact our profitability 
for our patients receiving nursing home care under a state medicaid program who elect hospice care under medicare or medicaid  we contract with nursing homes for room and board services 
the state must pay us  in addition to the applicable medicare or medicaid hospice daily or hourly rate  an amount equal to at least of the medicaid daily nursing home rate for room and board furnished to the patient by the nursing home 
under our standard nursing home contracts  we pay the nursing home for these room and board services at the medicaid daily nursing home rate 
we refer to these costs  net of medicaid payments  as nursing home costs  net 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
general and administrative expenses primarily include non patient care salaries  employee benefits and office leases

and its related interpretations 
we recognize compensation charges over the vesting periods of the stock options using a graded amortization methodology in accordance with financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
for purposes of the period to period comparisons included in our results of operations  general and administrative expenses exclude these stock based compensation charges  which are reflected as a separate line item 
we have recorded deferred stock based compensation charges related to unvested stock options granted to employees and directors during and based on the number of outstanding stock options granted during and  we expect to amortize approximately million of deferred stock based compensation during and in future periods 
upon completion of our initial public offering  we forgave the repayment of promissory notes payable to us by richard r 
burnham  and david c 
gasmire  who at the time of our initial public offering were chairman and chief executive officer and president and chief operating officer  respectively 
we recorded a compensation charge of million in connection with the forgiveness of these notes in the fourth quarter of provision for income taxes our provision for income taxes consists of current and deferred federal and state income tax expenses 
we estimate that our effective tax rate will be approximately during see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
certain of our accounting policies are 
table of contents particularly important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations included elsewhere in this annual report on form k and require the application of significant judgment by us  as a result  they are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
in applying those policies  we use our judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of certain estimates 
those estimates are based on our historical payment experience  our observance of trends in the industry and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 
net patient service revenue and allowance for uncollectible accounts we report net patient service revenue at the estimated net realizable amounts from patients  medicare  medicaid  commercial insurance  managed care payors and others for services rendered 
payors may determine that the services provided are not covered and do not qualify for payment or  for commercial payors  that payments are subject to usual and customary rates 
to determine net patient service revenue  we adjust gross patient service revenue for estimated payment denials and contractual adjustments based on historical experience 
we recognize net patient service revenue in the month in which our services are delivered 
due to the complexity of the laws and regulations affecting medicare and medicaid  a reasonable possibility exists that recorded estimates could change by a material amount in the future 
overall payments made by medicare to us are subject to a cap amount calculated by the medicare fiscal intermediary at the end of the hospice cap period 
the hospice cap period runs from november st of each year through october st of the following year 
total medicare payments to us during this period are compared to the cap amount for this period 
payments in excess of the cap amount must be returned by us to medicare 
the cap amount is calculated by multiplying the number of beneficiaries electing hospice care during the period by a statutory amount that is indexed for inflation 
the cap amount was  for the twelve month period ending october  the cap amount for the twelve month period ending october  has not been established by medicare 
once established  the new cap amount will become effective retroactively for all services performed since november  the hospice cap amount is computed on a program by program basis 
our net patient service revenue for was reduced by million as a result of six of our hospice programs exceeding the medicare cap 
we cannot assure you that additional hospices will not exceed the cap amount in the future 
we maintain a policy for reserving for uncollectible accounts 
we calculate the allowance for uncollectible accounts based on a formula tied to the aging of accounts receivable by payor class 
we reserve for specific accounts that are determined to be uncollectible when such determinations are made 
accounts are written off when all collection efforts are exhausted 
insurance risks general and professional liability costs for the healthcare industry have increased and become more difficult to estimate 
in addition  insurance coverage for patient care liabilities and other risks has become more difficult to obtain 
insurance carriers often require companies to increase their liability retention levels and pay higher policy premiums for reduced coverage 
in our consolidated financial statements  we provide for liabilities associated with the uninsured portion of our general and professional liability risks  based on our experience  consultation with our attorneys and insurers  and our existing insurance coverage 
goodwill goodwill is the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable assets acquired in an acquisition 
prior to the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  goodwill was amortized using the straight line method  generally over periods ranging from years 
after the adoption of sfas  we review goodwill for impairment annually during the fourth quarter 
we determine the fair value of the reporting units using multiples of revenue 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value  then an indication of impairment exists 
the amount of the impairment would be the difference between the carrying amount of the goodwill

no impairment charges have been recorded  but we cannot guarantee that impairment charges will not impact our results of operations or financial position in the future

borrowings outstanding under our revolving line of credit bore interest at fluctuating rates equal to above the prime rate of interest 
table of contents designated by citibank  with a floor of per annum 
our revolving line of credit matured on october  at that time  we let our line of credit expire 
our revolving line of credit was secured by all of our accounts receivable and any other right to payment for goods sold or leased or services rendered by us and all other property in our possession or under our control

we expect that our existing funds  cash flows from operations and borrowings under our new credit agreement will be sufficient to fund our principal liquidity requirements for at least months following the date of this annual report on form k

these programs are subject to statutory and regulatory changes  possible retroactive and prospective rate adjustments  administrative rulings  rate freezes and funding reductions 
reductions in amounts paid by these programs for our services or changes in methods or regulations governing payments for our services could materially adversely affect our net patient service revenue and profitability
