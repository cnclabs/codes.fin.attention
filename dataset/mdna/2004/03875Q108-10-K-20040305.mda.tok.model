overview arbitron is an international media and marketing research firm primarily serving radio  cable  advertising agencies  advertisers  outdoor and out of home media and  through its scarborough joint venture  broadcast television and print media 
arbitron currently has four main services measuring radio audiences in local markets in the united states and mexico  measuring national radio audiences and the audience size of network radio programs and commercials  providing application software used for accessing and analyzing media audience and marketing information data  and providing consumer and media usage information services to radio  cable  advertising agencies  advertisers  outdoor and out of home media  internet broadcasters and through its scarborough joint venture  broadcast television and print media 
arbitron s quantitative radio audience measurement business and related software sales accounted for approximately and of its revenue in and  respectively 
consolidation in the radio broadcasting industry has led to arbitron s dependence on a limited number of key customers 
in  clear channel communications  inc clear channel communications and infinity broadcasting corp 
infinity broadcasting represented approximately and  respectively  of arbitron s revenue 
arbitron s agreements with these customers are not exclusive and contain no renewal obligations 
certain license agreements with clear channel communications and infinity broadcasting  which accounted for approximately and  respectively  of arbitron s revenue  are up for renewal in arbitron cannot give any assurances that it could replace the revenue that would be lost if a key customer failed to renew all or part of its agreements with arbitron 
the loss of a key customer would materially harm arbitron s business  financial condition and operating results 
arbitron entered into an agreement on may   with nielsen media research  inc  a provider of us television and cable audience measurement services  under which arbitron granted nielsen media research an option to join arbitron in the potential commercial deployment of the portable people meter portable people meter or ppm in the united states 
in the event nielsen media research exercises the option  the parties would form a joint venture to commercially deploy and operate the business of utilizing the portable people meter for the collection of listening and viewing audience data 
in  arbitron worked with nielsen media research on response rate issues and a variety of engineering tests 
in october  arbitron and nielsen media research announced that the initial results from tests of two separate respondent recruitment methods were positive 
in  arbitron expects to focus on another market test to confirm the results of previous tests and demonstrate enhancements to the portable people meter system that have been made since it was tested in philadelphia 
arbitron continues to work with nielsen media research to resolve outstanding issues and to negotiate business terms for a potential portable people meter joint venture 
separate from the proposed joint venture with nielsen media research  arbitron began testing additional marketing research applications of the portable people meter technology in one application being tested is the use of the portable people meter as the media collection tool for a national marketing oriented panel designed to correlate advertising with shopping behavior and sales 
the objective is to provide multimedia exposure data combined with sales data from a single source to produce a measure of advertising effectiveness for advertisers  agencies and broadcasters 
this would be a new type of service for which market acceptance is not yet known 
the continuing development and anticipated rollout of ppm services will require significant capital resources and will increase arbitron s operating costs over the next several years 
in the event arbitron decides to commercialize either a ppm ratings service or a ppm marketing application service there could be significant start up expenses that could adversely affect arbitron s financial results 
arbitron uses listener diaries to gather radio listening data from sample households in the united states local markets for which it currently provides radio ratings 
a representative sample of the population in each local market is randomly selected for each survey and is recruited by telephone 
it is increasingly difficult and more costly to obtain consent from the phone sample to participate in the surveys and to get a usable diary returned to arbitron 
arbitron must achieve response rates sufficient to maintain confidence in its ratings  the support of the industry and accreditation by the media rating council 
response rates are a key quality measure of survey performance and an important factor in determining costs associated with data collection 
response rates have continued to decline over the past few years 
if response rates continue to decline further  arbitron s radio audience measurement business could be adversely affected 
arbitron commits extensive efforts and resources to slow the decline of response rates 
in  arbitron s response rate initiatives included the opening of a second calling center for recruiting survey participants and the implementation of a survey treatment initiative giving respondents the option to agree to participate in the arbitron radio survey through a secure web site 
effective march   arbitron will no longer produce its internet audience measurement monthly and weekly ratings service 
the after tax charges resulting from the impairment of the fixed assets and intangibles related to this service will be approximately million in the first quarter of critical accounting policies and estimates critical accounting policies and estimates are those that are both important to the presentation of arbitron s financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  complex or subjective judgments 
the company s most critical accounting policy relates to the capitalization and recovery of software development costs 
the company capitalizes software development costs with respect to major product initiatives or enhancements  which are incurred during the period from the time of technological feasibility until the time that the software is ready for use 
to the extent that software is being developed for use by customers or to support data collection activities  the company also considers the recovery of such costs through future revenue streams in its decision to capitalize software development costs 
once the software is placed in service  the capitalized costs are generally amortized over periods of three to five years 
if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of software may not be recovered  a recoverability analysis is performed based on estimated undiscounted cash flows to be generated from the software in the future 
if the analysis indicates that the carrying value is not recoverable from future cash flows  the software cost is written down to estimated fair value and an impairment loss is recognized 
the company s estimates are subject to revision as market conditions and the company s assessments of them change 
as of december   the company s internally developed capitalized portable people meter software had a carrying amount of million

for the first quarter of  the company contributed cash generated from operating and investing activities to ceridian as part of ceridian s centralized cash management system 
available cash and cash equivalents was million  million and million as of december    and  respectively 
the company as of december   had million in available borrowings under its bank credit facility 
although arbitron has a limited history as a stand alone company  management expects that cash flow generated from operations  as well as available borrowings from its bank credit facility  if necessary  will be sufficient to support the company s operations  including research and development costs  for both the short and long term periods 
arbitron may consider from time to time various uses of its cash  including but not limited to paying down its debt  stock repurchases  cash dividends  acquisitions and increased ppm investments 
arbitron s commitment under its revolving credit facility  which was million at inception  had a balance of million on march  at the end of march  the commitment will be reduced to approximately million in accordance with a mandatory commitment reduction provision and an excess cash flow provision of the company s debt covenants 
arbitron s credit facility and senior secured notes borrowings contain non investment grade financial terms  covenants and operating restrictions that increase the cost of financing and restrict financial flexibility 
under the terms of the borrowings  arbitron is required to maintain leverage and coverage ratios and meet other financial conditions 
the agreements limit  among other things  arbitron s ability to buy and sell assets  incur additional indebtedness  grant or incur liens on its assets  repay senior indebtedness  pay cash dividends  make certain investments or acquisitions  repurchase or redeem capital stock and engage in certain mergers or consolidations 
although arbitron does not believe that the terms of its borrowings limit the operation of its business in any material respect  the terms may restrict or prohibit arbitron s ability to raise additional capital when needed or could prevent arbitron from making acquisitions or investing in other growth initiatives that otherwise may be important to the operation of arbitron s business 
arbitron holds a derivative instrument as a hedge of its variable interest rate debt as indicated below under item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in  clear channel communications and infinity broadcasting represented approximately and  respectively  of arbitron s revenue 
arbitron s agreements with these customers are not exclusive and contain no renewal obligations 
certain arbitron license agreements with clear channel communications that accounted for approximately of arbitron s revenue expire on december  in  arbitron entered into a one year extension with infinity broadcasting for those contracts that were up for renewal 
the license agreements with infinity broadcasting  which expire on march   accounted for approximately of arbitron s revenue 
contracts with some customers may continue to be of a shorter than normal term until more detailed analysis of ppm data is completed 
it is expected that with this additional analysis these customers will have a fuller understanding of the value of the ppm service  which will then serve as the basis for longer term contract negotiations 
arbitron cannot give any assurances that it could replace the revenue that would be lost if a key customer failed to renew all or part of its agreement with arbitron 
the loss of a key customer would adversely affect arbitron s results of operations and liquidity 
during  arbitron and nielsen media research performed major response rate tests and continued research on the portable people meter 
arbitron continues to work with nielsen media research to resolve outstanding issues and to negotiate business terms for a potential portable people meter joint venture 
separate from the proposed joint venture with nielsen media research  arbitron began testing additional marketing research applications of the portable people meter technology in one application being tested is the use of the portable people meter as the media collection tool for a national marketing oriented panel designed to correlate advertising with shopping behavior and sales 
the objective is to provide multimedia exposure data combined with sales data from a single source to produce a measure of advertising effectiveness for advertisers  agencies and broadcasters 
this would be a new type of service for which market acceptance is not yet known 
the continuing development and anticipated rollout of ppm services will require significant capital resources and will increase our operating costs over the next several years 
in the event arbitron decides to commercialize either a ppm ratings service or a ppm marketing application service there could be significant start up expenses that could adversely affect arbitron s financial results

emerging issues task force eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  established guidelines on revenue recognition involving multiple deliverables 
the company determined that its revenue recognition policies were consistent with the consensus reached in eitf seasonality arbitron recognizes revenue for products and services over the terms of license agreements as products and services are delivered  and expenses are recognized as incurred 
arbitron gathers radio listening data in approximately united states local markets 
all markets are measured at least twice per year april  may  june  spring survey  and october  november  december  fall survey 
in addition  all major markets are measured two additional times per year january  february  march  winter survey  and july  august  september  summer survey

arbitron s expenses are generally higher in the second and fourth quarters as the spring survey and fall survey are being conducted 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest risk the company currently has no exposure to market risk with respect to changes in interest rates because the variable portion of the company s long term obligations is fully hedged with a derivative instrument 
the company does not use derivatives for speculative or trading purposes 
the company has two long term obligations senior notes that bear interest at a fixed rate of  and a revolving credit facility which bears interest at libor plus a margin of to 
the variable portion of the interest rate  libor  is hedged with an interest rate swap which has a fixed rate of 
due to the variable rate debt being fully hedged  a hypothetical market interest rate change of would have no effect on the company s results of operations 
however  changes in market interest rates would impact the fair values of the company s long term obligations 
foreign currency risk arbitron s foreign operations are not significant at this time  and  therefore  arbitron s exposure to foreign currency risk is minimal
