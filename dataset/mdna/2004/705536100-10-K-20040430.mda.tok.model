the following should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto contained in this annual report on form k 
highlights consolidated revenues for fiscal year were million  a decrease from the prior fiscal year 
the decrease in revenues was primarily attributable to lower product licensing fees and engineering services revenues  which was partially offset by an increase in revenue from the company s application specific integrated circuits asics 
product licensing revenues decreased as a result of decreased demand for oem s products containing the company s technologies  which resulted from the shift in demand from monochrome to color technologies and with oems developing their own solutions in monochrome product offerings 
engineering services revenues also decreased in fiscal year due to lack of expected design wins 
product licensing revenues for fiscal year were million  including million of block licenses  a decrease of from the previous fiscal year 
thirteen block licensing agreements totaling million were signed during fiscal year  all of which was recognized as revenue during fiscal year this last fiscal year the company has been presenting its new color technologies to its customers 
although there have been no design wins as of january   the company has been engaged with a number of oems that are looking at the application of the company s peerless sierra technologies in a number of specific products 
the company believes that  if it is able to successfully launch its high performance mfp color controller in may  there will be a validation of the company s color offering  which will facilitate future oem design wins 
engineering services and maintenance contract backlog at january  approximated million  this compares to million as of january   reflecting the lack of design wins in fiscal year 
table of contents on february   the company announced the sale of its remaining interest in netreon 
as a result of the sale  the company recorded in other income a gain of  net of expenses  associated with this transaction in the first quarter of fiscal year the company had announced the divestiture of its netreon storage management operations on january   effective january  peerless retained the networking technology obtained from the company s acquisition of netreon for continuing integration into peerless core document imaging products 
as a result of the divestiture  the company experienced a decline in operating expenses of approximately in fiscal year from levels experienced during fiscal year because the effective date of the divestiture so closely approximated the company s year end  the fiscal year consolidated results of operations included netreon s results for the entire year 
during fiscal year  the company continued to improve on and support its core monochrome imaging operations and technologies  however  the company also continued to increase its focus on developing its new high performance color architecture peerless sierra technologies 
the company believes that on a going forward basis revenue generated from the company s peerless sierra technologies will begin to increase as a percentage of total revenue 
general the company generates revenue from its oems through the sale of imaging solutions in either turnkey or sdk form 
historically  oem demand for turnkey solutions had exceeded demand for sdk solutions 
however  in the fiscal year  the company experienced a shift in demand away from turnkey solutions towards demand for the company s sdks  particularly for its mature monochrome solutions 
the company has attempted to expand its high performance color solutions  by seamlessly incorporating the company s networking technologies and related imaging technologies licensed from third parties 
the company s product licensing revenues are comprised of both recurring per unit and block licensing revenues and development licensing fees for source code or sdks 
licensing revenues are derived from per unit fees paid periodically by the company s oem customers upon manufacturing and subsequent commercial shipment of products incorporating the company s technology 
licensing revenues are also derived from arrangements in which the company enables third party technology  such as solutions from adobe or novell  to be used with the company and or oem products 
block licenses are per unit licenses made in large volume quantities to an oem for products either in or about to enter into distribution into the marketplace 
payment schedules for block licenses are negotiable and payment terms are often dependent on the size of the block and other terms and conditions of the block license being acquired 
typically  payments are made in either one lump sum or over a period of four or more quarters 
revenue received for block licenses is recognized in accordance with sop  which requires that revenue be recognized after acceptance by the oem and if fees are fixed and determinable and the collection of fees is probable 
for block licenses that have a significant portion of the payments due within twelve months  revenue is recognized at the time the block license becomes effective 
the company also has engineering services revenues that are derived primarily from adapting the company s software and supporting electronics to specific oem requirements 
the company provides its engineering services to oems seeking a turnkey imaging solution for their digital document products 
the company s maintenance revenues are derived from software maintenance agreements 
maintenance revenues currently constitute a small portion of total revenue 
as part of the total solution offered to its oems  the company developed a direct distribution channel for its asic chips 
under this fabless model  peerless supplies asic chips from the foundry directly to the oems through third party distributors  which include arrow electronics and marubun corporation 
the company is responsible for marketing and sales administration  including the billings and collections to and from its oems and distributors  and the third party is responsible for the coordination of production with the foundry  maintenance of necessary inventories  and providing just in time delivery to oems and distributors 

table of contents historically  a limited number of customers have provided a substantial portion of the company s revenues 
therefore  the availability and successful closing of new contracts  or modifications and additions to existing contracts with these customers may materially impact the company s financial position and results of operations from quarter to quarter 
peerless technology has addressed the worldwide market for monochrome printers pages per minute  or ppm and mfp ppm 
this market has been consolidating  and the demand for the monochrome technology and products offered by the company declined throughout fiscal year the company believes that unit volume for these types of printers will grow at lower rates than in past years 
available data indicate that retail prices are declining in these segments 
there has been a decline in the number of monochrome contracts that the company has with oems under which the company is currently performing services and granting licenses  and this decline is likely to continue along with the demand for the monochrome technology and products the company presently offers 
competitors have merged into larger business units with the resulting strength to acquire and impose a competitive advantage in the company s market segments 
sales decreased during fiscal year  as the company is continuing to meet sales resistance from its customers 
in the past  oems have reduced the absolute number of new products being developed and in some instances  oems have preferred to perform in house development projects for the products that they are developing and or planning to launch 
although there have been fewer opportunities for the company to sell its turnkey services and sdks  the company continued to support its current oem controller customers in the digital printing devices business with its existing technology and has sized the organization to provide the necessary support and maintenance 
in response to the company s belief that the demand for the company s core monochrome offerings may grow at lower rates than in past years and that the company may continue to meet sales resistance from its customers  peerless has recently developed and commercialized high performance color imaging and printing technologies and a new open architecture named peerless sierra technologies 
peerless believes that products based on its peerless sierra technologies address key growth areas in the imaging market including increased demand for color imaging  the emergence of mfps  and continued demand for faster low cost monochrome printing solutions  to which many of the peerless sierra technologies attributes are applicable 
during the last fiscal year  peerless introduced peerless sierra technologies at trade shows in the united states and demonstrated it in japan 
peerless believes that peerless sierra technologies will increase the company s future license revenues if the company is able to successfully introduce it into the marketplace and the company begins sale of this technology 
peerless believes that the launch of its high performance color mfp controller into the distribution channels will be followed by sales to oems for utilization of its high performance color technology  with licensing revenues beginning in early fiscal year see  however  if the company is unable to sell the new peerless sierra technologies on a timely basis  the company s future revenue and operating results may be harmed and if the marketplace does not accept peerless new peerless sierra technologies  the company s future revenues and operating results may be harmed in the section entitled certain factors and trends affecting peerless and its business of this annual report on form k 
peerless believes that its new peerless sierra technologies will contribute an increasing percentage of the company s overall revenue in the future 
the company has addressed the deterioration in the demand for its solutions by investing in leading edge technologies  by sizing its organization to manage the current business requirements of imaging for digital document products and has adapted its pricing model to changing market conditions 
the company has also addressed the deterioration in revenues by expanding its offerings in new geographic regions and in distribution channels 
in addition  as a result of the decline in the embedded controller business  the company is exploring opportunities to enhance the value of the company  including new market opportunities  mergers  acquisitions  spin offs and or the sale of all or a portion of company s assets 

table of contents critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations addresses the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
the company accounts for its software revenues in accordance with statement of position sop  software revenue recognition as amended by sop  staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition and emerging issues task force  reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent 
over the past two years  the company entered into block license agreements that represent unit licenses for products that will be licensed over a period of time 
in accordance with sop  revenue is recognized when the following attributes have been met an agreement exists between the company and the oem selling product utilizing the company s intellectual property and or a third party s intellectual property for which peerless is an authorized licensor  delivery and acceptance of the intellectual property has occurred  the fees associated with the sale are fixed and determinable and collection of the fees are probable 
under the company s accounting policies  fees are fixed and determinable if of the fees are to be collected within a twelve month period  in accordance with sop if more than of the payments of fees extend beyond a twelve month period  they are recognized as revenues when they are due for payment  in accordance with sop as of january   the company had no such revenues to be recognized in future periods 
the company recognizes revenues for certain of its engineering services projects on a percentage of completion basis  in accordance with accounting research bulletin  long term construction type contracts and sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
the estimates to complete the projects are determined by the individual project engineering manager responsible for the oversight of the individual projects 
the estimates are made at end of each accounting period and are subject to unforeseen circumstances that can increase or decrease the hours necessary to complete the efforts 
for fiscal year  the company reported no engineering services revenues on a percentage of completion basis 
the company provides an accrual for estimated product licensing costs owed to third party vendors whose technology is included in the products sold by the company 
the accrual is impacted by estimates of the mix of products shipped under certain of the company s block license agreements 
the estimates are based on historical data and available information as provided by the company s customers concerning projected shipments 
should actual shipments under these agreements vary from these estimates  adjustments to the estimated accruals for product licensing costs may be required 
such losses have historically been within management s expectations 
as of january   the company had net operating loss carryforwards available to reduce future federal and state income of approximately million and million  respectively  which expire through fiscal years for federal and for state  respectively 
in addition  as of january   the company had tax credit carryforwards available to reduce future income tax liabilities of approximately million  which expire between fiscal years and the realization of these assets is based upon management s estimates of future taxable income 
the company has provided a valuation allowance for all of its net deferred tax assets because of the uncertainty with respect to the company s ability to generate future taxable income 
table of contents to realize the deferred tax assets 
with a change in management s assessment of the uncertainty  the valuation allowance will be adjusted accordingly 
the company grants credit terms in the normal course of business to its customers 
the company continuously monitors collections and payments from its customers and maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of any customers to make required payments 
estimated losses are based primarily on specifically identified customer collection issues 
if the financial condition of any of the company s customers  or the economy as a whole  were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
such losses have historically been within management s expectations 
the company s recurring product licensing revenues are dependent  in part  on the timing and accuracy of product sales reports received from the company s oem customers 
these reports are provided only on a calendar quarter basis and  in any event  are subject to delay and potential revision by the oem 
therefore  the company is required to estimate all of the recurring product licensing revenues for the last month of each fiscal quarter and to further estimate all of its quarterly revenues from an oem when the report from such oem is not received in a timely manner 
in the event the company is unable to estimate such revenues accurately prior to reporting financial results  the company may be required to adjust revenues in subsequent periods 
fiscal year revenues subject to such estimates were minimal 
actual results have historically been consistent with management s estimates
