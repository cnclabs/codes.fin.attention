consolidated overview the company reported net income of million for compared to a net loss of million for most of the improved net results were from the sale of the napili plaza  the company s interest in the queen ka ahumanu center and the costa rican pineapple assets  as well as non recurring pineapple cash receipts related to the settlement of lawsuits and receipt of the proceeds of anti dumping duties from the government 
these transactions contributed pretax income of million to and generated cash flow that resulted in a or million reduction of the company s debt as of december  overall  consolidated operating results benefited from some improvement in the company s ongoing operations  but the material improvements reflected in the financial results were from non recurring sources 
consolidated general and administrative expenses increased general and administrative expenses continued to negatively affect the company s results in consolidated general and administrative expenses for increased by million or compared to the major components of this increase were as follows in millions employee severance expense write off of obsolete and or abandoned assets increase in pension expense increase in depreciation expense increase in insurance expense other net total general and administrative expenses are incurred at the corporate level and at the segment level 
in and  approximately of corporate general and administrative expenses were allocated to the operating segments 
the increase in employee severance costs was due to management changes at the corporate level as well as in the pineapple and resort segments and to reductions in force  in particular in the pineapple segment 
the write off of assets and increase in depreciation were primarily attributable to the pineapple segment and are explained in more detail in the pineapple section below 
pension expense  other than special termination benefits  increased in because of a reduction in the discount rate from in to in  and due to negative returns on pension asset investments in and company wide insurance expense  in particular for casualty and executive liability increased by approximately in compared to the increase in insurance expense is primarily a reflection of the insurance industry experience and not the experience of the company 
the company s net periodic pension cost for and was calculated using a long term rate of return of 
as explained in note to consolidated financial statements  this rate was based on historical total returns of broad equity and bond indices weighted against the company s targeted asset allocation 
the company s pension plans average year returns for the last three years have slightly lagged the blended rate of these broad indices and therefore  from  the company will use a long term rate of return of in the calculation of net periodic pension and other post retirement costs 
the reduction in the long term rate of return assumption from to and the decrease in the assumed discount rate from to at december   are not expected to significantly increase the company s net periodic pension cost in the increase in cost because of these factors will be partially offset by the investment return of on the pension plan assets in consolidated interest expense interest expense increased by in largely due to interest expense on prior years federal income tax adjustments that were settled in and to a lower amount of interest capitalized in than in in  interest was capitalized on the installation of the integrated accounting system that was placed in service as of january the company s average interest rates were slightly higher in as compared to because a portion of the company s million term loan was based on a three year rate  which was higher than the six month rate used in the prior year 
the company s average borrowings in were lower than key performance indicators in general  the key performance indicators for the segments that are evaluated by management are recurring sources of revenues and operating profit before corporate allocation of general and administrative expenses 
other performance measures commonly relied on by the company are cash flow  return on assets  return on equity and the subjective performance measure of the company s reputation as a good corporate citizen 
in  the company had a long term incentive plan that covered certain key employees  where performance was based on cash flows from operating activities and return on equity 
the goals were not met for the performance cycle ended december  and this long term incentive plan was terminated on march  pineapple overview the company began to refocus its pineapple business into its core maui operations by selling substantially all of the assets of its costa rican subsidiary in december in october of  the company also reached a strategic decision to cease production of its fresh cut pineapple products and to abandon that product line 
as discussed above  in  the team evaluating the pineapple segment operations spent a considerable amount of time examining all facets of those operations 
the company has begun to implement some of the decisions made by the team  which have already resulted in consistently better quality fresh pineapple 
the higher quality fruit is more durable and thus the company can rely to a greater extent on surface shipment to the us mainland  while reducing its use of air shipment  which is more costly 
management believes that the other new procedures and practices that are being implemented as a result of the team evaluations  strengthen its pineapple operations by producing a greater balance of revenue sources between champaka pineapple primarily a canning variety and hawaiian gold hybrid pineapple primarily sold as fresh whole and increased predictability of the timing of production volume 
the worldwide supply of canned and fresh pineapple  and the company s ability to adjust its production  influences the profitability of the company s pineapple segment 
being able to shift pineapple between canned and fresh pineapple products and revenue sources is expected to strengthen the pineapple operations 
the company also intends to reduce the number of types of canned products it produces and to focus on those products and customers that offer an opportunity for higher margins 
pineapple operations incurred an operating loss from continuing operations of  for compared to an operating loss of million for revenues for were million compared to million in while basic operations showed improvement in  the pineapple segment results were primarily affected by several nonrecurring items 
nonrecurring items in december  the company received million from the us customs service 
this cash distribution was made pursuant to the continued dumping and subsidy offset act of the dumping act  which allows for distribution of antidumping duties to injured domestic producers 
the distribution is recorded as other income in the company s consolidated financial statements 
the dumping act may be repealed and as a result  the company may not receive any further distributions of the antidumping duties collected by customs 
in  the company received  pursuant to the same program 
anti dumping duties have been in effect on canned pineapple fruit imported from thailand since the duties can be increased or decreased annually based on reviews by the us department of commerce that are conducted pursuant to requests by the thai producers or the company 
the us department of commerce and the us international trade commission are scheduled to review the duties in at which time they will determine whether the duties will continue for the next five year period 
in december  the company sold substantially all of the assets of its costa rican pineapple subsidiary with a carrying value of million and recognized a gain from the sale of million after reduction for the minority interest 
the sale closed in december and title to all but two parcels of land was transferred to the buyer 
the operating results of this subsidiary prior to the sale and the gain on the sale are reported as discontinued operations and prior period amounts have been restated for comparability 
see note to consolidated financial statements 
the sales agreement provided for withholding million of the sales price approximately  gain after reduction for minority interest pending the transfer of title to the two remaining properties 
the sale of the remaining two parcels is expected to be recognized in when titles to the properties are transferred to the buyer 
in february  title to one of the remaining parcels was transferred to the buyer and million of the previously withheld sales price was paid to the company s affiliate 
revenues for also include non recurring cash receipts of million related to the settlement of certain lawsuits 
legal fees and consultant costs related to these issues were million in compared to million in canned and fresh pineapple operations in  the volume of canned pineapple sales declined compared to  but average prices exceeded by approximately 
the higher average prices were the result of general mid year price increases in and to an increase in sales volume of larger size cases to the us government 
also in  the volume of hawaiian gold fresh whole pineapple grown in hawaii sales exceeded  but the average sales prices were lower by approximately 
the reduction in price is estimated to be partially due to an increase in the supply of fresh pineapple because of higher worldwide production levels 
in  of the pineapple segment s net sales from continuing operations were from fresh pineapple compared to in this continued shift towards fresh sales contributed to the improved operating results in in  pineapple segment cost of sales were lower than the prior year by about and shipping and selling expenses were higher by about 
the company s pineapple inventories are maintained on a last in  first out lifo method of accounting 
therefore  in periods of rising prices  current production costs are higher than the average per unit values in inventory 
in  there was a partial liquidation of the lifo inventories resulting in lower per unit production costs from prior years being included in cost of sales 
cost of sales would have been higher by  based on current per unit production costs 
excluding the effect of the lifo liquidation  the variance in cost of sales and shipping and selling costs were primarily reflective of changes in sales volume of canned and fresh pineapple  as opposed to changes in per unit production  shipping or selling costs or methods 
the company s gross profit margin from fresh whole pineapple is higher than that of canned pineapple products 
at year end  pineapple products inventories were lower than by million  principally reflecting a reduction in the inventory of canned pineapple 
abandoned product line in october  the company decided to cease production of its fresh cut pineapple products and to abandon that product line 
pursuant to this decision  million of fixed assets  inventory and supplies related to this product line were written off in the fourth quarter of approximately of pineapple net sales for and of pineapple net sales for were from fresh cut pineapple products 
integrated accounting system the integrated accounting system that the company began implementing in september was fully placed in service on january  depreciation expense charged to the pineapple segment increased by million in compared to  as a result of the cost of the new accounting system 
depreciation charges for this system in are estimated to be million 
in  after a thorough review of the newly installed integrated accounting system  the company elected to discontinue use of a portion of the system and components totaling  were written off 
outlook in  the company intends to continue to shift its pineapple production toward the fresh pineapple market with the goals of optimizing the balance of production and sales between the canned and fresh pineapple segments  and producing better quality and a more reliable volume of fresh whole pineapples 
as noted above  the company also intends to reduce the number of types of canned products  and to focus on those products and customers that offer an opportunity for higher margins 
however  as the company restructures its pineapple operations  and in particular continues its emphasis on the fresh pineapple market  it will incur certain additional costs and expenses and it runs the risk of targeted market responses by its principal competitors 
the company intends to improve its practices in the areas of soil  water and energy conservation 
the company also intends to improve relationships with its neighbors through improved farm practices as well as a renewed emphasis on communications 
resort overview the resort segment includes the development and sale of kapalua real estate as well as the operation of three golf courses  ten retail facilities  the kapalua villas short term rental program and other resort operations 
the team evaluating the company s resort operations is engaged in the process of analyzing the market position and future direction of the kapalua resort 
among other things  the company believes that the future success of the kapalua resort will depend on its ability to cooperate and coordinate effectively with the other businesses that operate in the resort  including the owners and operators of the hotels that reside on land leased from the company 
on the development side  the company hopes to create value from its land resources  by moving up the value hierarchy in development  by designing new communities that reflect a unique character and set of values  and evaluating its land resources comprehensively in an effort to identify and achieve their highest and best use 
if it is to achieve these goals  the company believes that it is critical to build strong relationships with both its business partners and community stakeholders 
the environment for the resort segment improved as the year progressed 
as the uncertainty brought on by the war in iraq passed and the united states economy improved  hawaii s visitor industry began to recover from the effect of the september  terrorist attacks 
the second half of saw improved visitor counts for the island of maui and the state of hawaii 
kapalua s operations also benefited from the increase in visitors and the general improvement in the us economy 
kapalua resort reported an operating loss of million for compared to an operating profit of million for resort revenues were million in compared to million in a reduction in sales of new real estate product was the primary reason for lower operating results from the resort segment in in  revenues from new real estate sales were million compared to million in  and operating profit from real estate development and sales was less than  after administrative expenses compared to million in resort operations revenues attributable to the resort operations  other than real estate development  increased from million in to million in revenues from the golf operations increased by in  primarily due to higher average green fees 
paid rounds of golf were higher in  but the increase was less than commensurate with the increase in room occupancies at the resort 
higher room occupancies in were responsible for increased villa revenues  as the average room rates were about lower in compared to in  room occupancies at kapalua increased by approximately 
this was about the same as the hotel and resort condominium occupancy for the state of hawaii in total  but not as large an increase as was experienced by the island of maui as a whole  which showed almost a increase in occupancies over merchandise sales in exceeded by  primarily reflecting higher sales volume and increased floor space with the opening of the kapalua home store in december although revenues from these operations increased in  operating profit declined because of increased operating expenses and higher general and administrative costs 
increased expenses in largely reflect a renegotiated union contract for the company s golf course maintenance employees early in  an increase in the number of employees at the resort  increased workers compensation accruals  higher pension costs and severance expense 
real estate sales in  nine of the lots remaining in pineapple hill estates and the two remaining lots in plantation estates were sold 
also in  one of the remaining pineapple hill estates lots was contributed to a joint venture for construction of a custom home 
in  the last pineapple hill estates lot was sold 
the custom home was completed in march and remains for sale at year end in  a remnant land parcel in the resort was sold and the profit from this sale is included in other income in the company s consolidated financial statements 
a acre conservation zoned parcel was the only other new real estate product available for sale in this property is in escrow and because of its location in a conservation district  additional approvals were required to allow the potential buyer to build a home on the site 
it is expected that this sale will be concluded in the first quarter of resort real estate development and resort real estate sales are cyclical and depend on a number of factors 
results for one period are  therefore  not necessarily indicative of future performance trends for this segment 
a key factor in the financial results of resort real estate sales is the availability of new product inventory 
outlook a result of the comprehensive examinations mentioned above  was development of a ranking and prioritization of the company s developable land assets 
while it is the company s intention to retain most of its land holdings in open space  be it agriculture  parks  forest preserve  conservation or otherwise  the profitability of the company is highly dependant on the company s ability to develop a portion of its land assets into real estate products desired by the community and which meet the needs of the market 
the company received preliminary approval by the county of maui for the subdivision plans and drawings for the next phase of plantation estates at kapalua 
after it has obtained the final approval from the county  the company will proceed in an effort to obtain the state and federal registrations of the subdivision that are necessary before offering the lots for sale 
this phase consists of agricultural lots ranging in size from three acres to over fifteen acres 
the company has reached a tentative agreement with the board of trustees of the neighboring homeowners association to withdraw its opposition to the project  although this agreement must still be approved by the association s membership 
although no assurance can be given  it is presently estimated that sale of the lots and construction of the improvements could begin later in to the extent the lots are sold  revenues from this subdivision would be recognized on a percentage of completion basis as subdivision improvements are constructed 
the company is in the planning and entitlement stage of other kapalua resort real estate projects  but at this time does not anticipate that any other projects will be available for sale in the maui county council recently passed bill  which requires a managed and directed growth plan be included in the county s general plan to clearly define urban and rural growth areas 
the bill is presently awaiting the mayor s signature 
if the bill becomes law  the company expects that the plan showing the growth areas will be developed and approved within a year period 
development would be allowed only within those growth areas  although exemptions or amendments could be requested 
if the company s high profile lands fall outside the growth areas  the company s ability to develop those properties could be impeded 
commercial property overview the commercial property segment reported an operating profit from continuing operations of million for compared to an operating loss of  for revenues attributable to this segment were million in compared to million in several nonrecurring items affected such amounts 
nonrecurring items in september  the queen ka ahumanu center was sold for million 
kaahumanu center associates kca  a limited partnership in which the company was the general partner  owned the center 
the company s equity in earnings of kca was million in reflecting the gain from the sale of the center as compared to a loss of million in by agreement between the partners  kca was dissolved upon the sale of the center and the company s accumulated losses in excess of its investment of million were reversed into income 
the company  as managing partner  is winding up the affairs of the partnership 
the winding up period  as defined by agreement  will run for at least thirteen months following the closing of the sale 
in august  the company sold the napili plaza for million 
the gain from this sale of million and the results of operations prior to the sale are reported as discontinued operations 
prior period amounts have been restated for comparability 
see note to consolidated financial statements 
continuing operations revenues and operating profit from commercial property continuing operations for and include the closing of and lot sales  respectively  in the kapua village employee subdivision 
the closing of lot sales began in december and was completed in the third quarter of operating profit includes gains from these sales of  and  for and  respectively 
revenues for also included  from other land sales 
outlook the napili plaza and the company s investment in kaahumanu center associates were the two primary assets in the commercial property segment 
in  the remaining commercial property rentals and the company s land entitlement activities will be reported in a new business segment that will include all resort and non resort real estate development activity 
vs 
consolidated the company reported a net loss of million for compared to net income of million for the decline in results primarily reflects increased operating losses from the pineapple segment due largely to increased general and administrative expenses  coupled with lower operating profit from the resort segment 
the reduction in operating profit from the resort primarily reflected the absence of new real estate product available for sale 
general and administrative expenses for including amounts allocated to the business segments increased by million or as compared to fees paid to outside consultants increased by approximately million in compared to increases in consultant fees due to lawsuits related to pineapple operations were partially offset by reductions in fees paid for other professional services 
the net periodic cost for defined benefit pension plans increased by approximately million in primarily because of negative investment returns in and in addition  depreciation  medical  and general insurance expenses increased by million in as compared to interest expense decreased by in compared to due to lower average interest rates 
average interest rates on company borrowings in were percentage points lower than the reduction in interest expense due to lower rates was partially offset by higher average borrowings in pineapple pineapple revenues were million in compared to million in the operating loss from continuing operations attributable to this segment was million in compared to million in see discontinued operations  note to consolidated financial statements 
the increased loss was largely attributable to higher general and administrative costs as discussed above 
general and administrative expenses attributable to the pineapple segment increased by million in compared to shipping and marketing costs were higher in primarily because of increased use of air freight to ship fresh whole and fresh cut pineapple  increased fuel surcharges affecting ocean freight and trucking rates and additional transportation  warehousing  labeling and casing costs incurred as a result of the west coast labor dispute in the fourth quarter of pineapple cost of sales as a percentage of sales for was lower than  primarily due to a shift in sales volume to fresh whole pineapple  which generally yield a higher gross margin 
in the fourth quarter of  the labor dispute between the west coast longshoremen and shipping companies resulted in a temporary shutdown of the west coast shipping ports followed by a backlog at the ports through most of december during that period  the company incurred additional air freight costs and inter modal rerouting costs to make timely deliveries to its customers and additional warehousing  labeling and casing costs to meet estimated orders for its customers for the remainder of and the first quarter of losses and additional expenditures incurred by the company during this period due to the labor dispute totaled approximately  at year end  a portion of these expenditures was deferred as prepaid shipping and selling costs 
case volume of canned pineapple sales was higher in compared to  but average sales prices were slightly lower in contribution to pineapple segment revenues from non canned product sales pineapple juice in pet bottles  fresh cut and fresh whole pineapple increased by to approximately of net sales in compared to in  revenues included a distribution of antidumping duties by the u 
s 
customs service of  a decrease of million as compared to these distributions were made pursuant to the continued dumping and subsidy offset act of  which allows for distribution of antidumping duties to injured domestic producers 
resort revenues from the kapalua resort segment were million in compared to million in the operating profit from this segment was million in compared to million in the decrease in revenues and operating profit is primarily due to reduced inventory in the company s real estate development projects  sales of which contributed million to operating profit in compared to million in in  the sales of all luxury condominium units in the coconut grove on kapalua bay closed escrow and title passed to the buyers  resulting in profit contribution to the company of million 
in  the resort segment recognized profit on sales of of the single family lots at the pineapple hill estates subdivision and the sale of a one acre land parcel next to the ironwoods condominiums 
in  nine of the remaining lots in the pineapple hill estates subdivision and the two final lots in plantation estates were sold 
revenues and operating profit from resort operations excluding real estate development activity were lower in compared to much of the business activity at kapalua resort is related to hotel and condominium occupancies on maui and  for  hotel and villa occupancies at kapalua decreased by and  for the island of maui  occupancies decreased by compared to for the state of hawaii  hotel and condominium occupancies were about higher in compared to throughout  the resort operating results were affected by the slow recovery of hawaii s visitor industry from the events of september   continued challenges from a weak united states economy  difficult air travel and the threat of a united states military conflict 
in  paid rounds of golf at the resort declined compared to  and revenues from golf operations decreased by  merchandise sales decreased by and revenues from the kapalua villas decreased by 
partially offsetting these declines were commission income from kapalua realty  which increased by in compared to  primarily reflecting real estate resale activity 
commercial property revenues of million attributable to the commercial property segment increased by in compared to the segment produced an operating loss from continuing operations of  in compared to million in see discontinued operations  note to consolidated financial statements 
the improved results were principally due to land sales in in the fourth quarter of  the company closed sales on of lots in the kapua village employee subdivision in west maui 
revenues for also included other land sales totaling  compared to land sales of  in the company s equity in the losses of kaahumanu center associates was million in compared to million in the reduction in losses was primarily due to lower expense in for write off of tenant improvement allowances and lower reserves for uncollectible accounts 
the gross leasable area occupied by tenants in increased  but sales reported by the tenants decreased in as compared to liquidity and capital resources debt reduction at december   the company s total debt was million  compared to million at december  five transactions contributed to the reduction in debt in in connection with the million sale of the napili plaza in august  the company repaid the million mortgage loan on that property  the sale of the company s costa rican pineapple assets in december  provided cash of million from which million of short and long term debt of the company s costa rican subsidiary were repaid 
the company received cash distributions from its costa rican subsidiary totaling million in december  the sale of queen ka ahumanu center resulted in a cash distribution to the company in september of million  representing the repayment of partner advances and other working capital advances  the cash distribution of million from us customs in december  and million of cash receipts related to settlement of law suits primarily in august  were also used to repay debt 
future cash inflows and outflows the company s central american subsidiary expects to make cash distributions to its minority shareholders of approximately million in the first and second quarters of in march  the company expects to make income tax payments of approximately  and in september  the company expects to make pension plan contributions of million 
in  capital expenditures are expected to total million  of which million are for the replacement of existing facilities and equipment 
in january  the company purchased land for million in west maui that will be used in its future operations and it expects to incur approximately million in mid to acquire land as part of a land exchange with the state of hawaii 
the company expects to incur approximately million in for real estate development planning and million for the completion of highway improvements related to subdivision projects sold in prior years 
the company expects that cash from operating activities and cash inflows from investing activities will substantially fund the aforementioned cash commitments for both the pineapple operations and the resort ongoing operations typically produce net positive cash inflows from operating activities on a full year basis  which can fund the capital expenditures required by those segments and contribute to unallocated corporate expenses and other cash commitments 
in  the company also expects to receive additional cash distributions from its central american subsidiary as the sale of the remaining properties is completed 
construction and sales of the next phase of plantation estates is expected to begin in as with some of the company s prior real estate projects  the sales agreement for this subdivision will probably require the buyers to pay the full purchase price and to close the sale transaction  although construction of the improvements would not be complete until a later date 
assuming no unreasonable delays are encountered and sales are accomplished  the company expects that the sales proceeds from this project will fund the construction of the million improvements and on a full year basis  the net cash flows will contribute to liquidation of the company s cash requirements 
pineapple operations seasonal cash requirements  in particular during the summer months are expected to be funded by bank lines of credit 
at december   the company had unused short and long term lines of credit totaling million 
contractual obligations following are summaries of the company s contractual obligations as of december  in thousands payment due by period years contractual obligations total less than after long term debt      capital lease obligations  operating leases    purchase commitments      other long term liabilities    total      these operating leases and purchase commitments are not reflected on the consolidated balance sheet under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
million of these purchase commitments at year end were for pineapple purchases for the company s costa rican subsidiary 
as of march   a third party assumed the purchase agreement 
amounts consist primarily of payments due under the company s deferred compensation plan  unfunded pension payments and severance costs 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles require the use of accounting estimates 
some of these estimates and assumptions involve a high level of subjectivity and judgment and therefore the impact of a change in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the amounts reported in the company s financial statements 
at december  and for the year then ended  estimates that the company has identified as critical to the financial statements were as follows deferred development costs  principally predevelopment costs related to various projects at the kapalua resort totaled at year end such amounts are carried on the balance sheet at the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value 
based on the company s future development plans for kapalua and the estimated value of these future projects  management has concluded that these deferred costs will be recoverable from future development projects 
the volatility of this assumption arises because of the long term nature of the company s development plans and the uncertainty of when or if certain parcels will be developed 
approximately million of the resort deferred development costs relate to a fee paid by the company for future sewerage capacity 
management estimates that the capacity in the sewerage system will be available for future development projects 
the company s pineapple segment expects to continue to shift its production and sales volume from canned to fresh pineapple 
management has evaluated the fixed assets of the pineapple segment in view of the prospective shift in operations and presently estimates that the net book value of all assets  carried on the balance sheets at cost less accumulated depreciation  will be recoverable from future operations 
this estimate could be affected by management s estimate as to the rate of production of the canning operations and by decisions that management could make regarding the size and locations of future pineapple operations 
these decisions could result in a change in the depreciable lives of the assets  or in a write down of their carrying values 
impact of inflation and changing prices the company uses the lifo method of accounting for its pineapple inventories 
under this method  the cost of products sold approximates current cost and  during periods of rising prices  the ending inventory is reflected at an amount below current cost 
the replacement cost of pineapple inventory was million at december   which is million more than the amount reflected in the financial statements 
most of the land owned by the company was acquired from to and is carried at cost 
a small portion of real estate held for sale represents land cost 
replacements and additions to pineapple operations occur every year and some of the assets presently in use were placed in service in at kapalua  some of the fixed assets were constructed and placed in service in the mid to late s 
depreciation expense would be considerably higher if fixed assets were stated at current cost 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s primary market risk exposure with regard to financial instruments is to changes in interest rates 
the company manages this risk by monitoring interest rates and future cash requirements and evaluating opportunities to refinance borrowings at various maturities and interest rates 
at december   of the company s short and long term borrowing commitments carried interest rates that were periodically adjustable to the prime rate  a federal farm credit bank index rate or to a libor rate and carried interest at fixed rates 
based on debt outstanding at the end of a hypothetical increase in interest rates of basis points would increase the company s interest expense by approximately  and a hypothetical decrease in interest rates of basis points would increase the fair value of the company s long term debt by approximately  at december   the fair value of the company s long term debt exceeded the carrying value by approximately  as a result of a general decrease in quoted interest rates 
the company does not believe that the market risk exposure due to foreign exchange transactions would have a material impact on the company s financial statements
