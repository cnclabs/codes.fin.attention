table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the company is a worldwide oil and gas drilling contractor  owning or operating a fleet of over marine and land drilling rigs 
the company s fleet currently includes floating rigs  cantilevered jackup rigs  land rigs and one platform rig 
the company currently has two ultra deepwater semisubmersibles and one high performance jackup under construction 
the company also operates two semisubmersible rigs for third parties under a joint venture agreement 
during  the company announced its plans to exit its platform rig operations  which have historically not had a material effect on the company s consolidated operating results 
the company or its affiliates currently maintain two platform rigs for third parties 
as part of the company s goal of enhancing long term shareholder value  the company is currently considering the possibility of selling its land rig fleet assets provided that the company receives value from such a sale  if any  that the company deems fair in light of the quality of these assets and the company s long term market outlook for these assets 
the net book value of the company s land drilling fleet totaled million at december  the company provides oil and gas contract drilling services to the oil and gas industry worldwide on a daily rate dayrate basis 
the company also provides oil and gas drilling management services on either a dayrate or completed project  fixed price turnkey basis  as well as drilling engineering and drilling project management services  and it participates in oil and gas exploration and production activities 
the company derives substantially all of its revenues from its contract drilling and drilling management services operations  which depend on the level of activity in offshore and onshore oil and natural gas exploration and development drilling in markets worldwide 
these operations are subject to a number of risks  many of which are outside the control of the company 
for a discussion of these risks  see item and business and properties risk factors 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s consolidated financial statements are impacted by the accounting policies used and the assumptions and estimates made by management during their preparation 
these policies  assumptions and estimates affect the carrying values of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date and the amounts of revenues and expenses recognized during the period 
the following is a discussion of the company s most significant accounting policies and assumptions as well as the use of estimates 
properties and depreciation rigs and drilling equipment 
capitalized costs of rigs and drilling equipment include all costs incurred in the acquisition of capital assets including allocations of interest costs incurred during periods that assets are under construction 
expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred 
costs of property sold or retired and the related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts  resulting gains or losses are included in income 
depreciation and amortization 
the company depreciates its rigs and equipment over their remaining estimated useful lives 
the company s estimates of these remaining useful lives may be affected by such factors as changing market conditions  technological advances in the industry or changes in regulations governing the industry 
jackup drilling rigs and semisubmersibles are currently depreciated over lives ranging from to years  with salvage values of million and million  respectively  per rig 
all land drilling rigs are depreciated over year lives with no salvage value 
drillships  with the exception of the glomar explorer  are depreciated over year lives  with salvage values of million per rig 
the glomar explorer is being depreciated over approximately years  which represents the time that remained on its year lease as of the date it entered service following its conversion to a drillship  with no salvage value 

table of contents impairment of rigs and drilling equipment 
the company reviews its long term assets for impairment when changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
 among other things  requires that long lived assets and certain intangibles to be held and used be reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value and establishes criteria to determine when a long lived asset is classified as available for sale 
assets to be disposed of and assets not expected to provide any future service potential to the company are recorded at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 
the company s determination of impairment of rigs and drilling equipment  if any  requires estimates of undiscounted future cash flows 
actual impairment charges  if any  are recorded on the basis of an estimate of discounted future cash flows utilizing a discount rate based upon the company s cost of capital 
estimation of future cash flows expected to be generated by the company s rigs and drilling equipment requires the company to estimate dayrates and utilization in future periods 
actual future amounts may vary from estimates due to changes in market conditions  technological advances in the industry or changes in regulations governing the industry 
oil and gas properties 
the company uses the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas exploration and development costs 
under this method of accounting  the company capitalizes all costs incurred in the acquisition  exploration  and development of oil and gas properties by cost center country and amortizes such costs  together with estimated future development and dismantlement costs  using the units of production method 
costs of offshore unproved properties and development projects are not amortized until they are fully evaluated or  in the case of development projects  ready for their intended use 
all unproved properties are reviewed periodically to ascertain if impairment has occurred 
if the results of an assessment indicate that the properties are impaired  the amount of the impairment is added to the capitalized costs to be amortized 
costs of proved oil and gas properties that exceed the present value of estimated future net revenues are charged to expense 
sales of proved and unproved properties are accounted for as adjustments of capitalized costs with no gain or loss recognized  unless such adjustments would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves of oil and gas attributable to a cost center  in which case the gain or loss is recognized in income 
abandonments of properties are accounted for as adjustments of capitalized costs with no loss recognized 
intersegment turnkey drilling profits the company defers all turnkey drilling profit related to wells in which a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  challenger minerals inc cmi  was the operator and defers a portion of turnkey profit based on the share of cmi s costs in the case of properties in which cmi holds a working interest 
this turnkey profit is credited to the company s full cost pool of oil and gas properties and is then recognized through a lower depletion rate as reserves are produced 
revenue recognition the company s contract drilling business provides rigs and rig crews to customers on a dayrate basis 
dayrate contracts can be for a specified period of time or the time required to drill a specified well or number of wells 
revenues and expenses from dayrate drilling operations  which are classified under contract drilling services  are recognized on a per day basis as the work progresses 
lump sum fees received as compensation for the cost of relocating drilling rigs from one major operating area to another  whether received up front or upon termination of the drilling contract  are recognized as earned  which is generally over the term of the related drilling contract 
the company also designs and executes specific offshore drilling or well completion programs for customers at fixed prices under short term turnkey contracts 
revenues and expenses from turnkey 
table of contents contracts  which are classified under drilling management services  are earned and recognized upon completion of each contract 
the company recognizes revenue from oil and gas production at the time title transfers 
the company recognizes as revenue reimbursements referred to as reimbursable revenues received from customers for certain out of pocket expenses incurred by the company such expenses are referred to as reimbursable expenses 
reimbursable revenues have no effect on operating income 
income taxes the company is a cayman islands company 
the cayman islands does not impose corporate income taxes 
consequently  income taxes have been provided based on the tax laws and rates in effect in the countries in which operations are conducted and income is earned 
the company s ability to realize the benefit of its deferred tax assets requires that the company achieve certain future earnings levels prior to the expiration of its nol carryforwards 
the company has established a valuation allowance against the future tax benefit of a portion of its nol carryforwards and could be required to record an additional valuation allowance if market conditions deteriorate and future earnings are below  or are projected to be below  its current estimates 
the company has not provided for us deferred taxes on the unremitted earnings of its us subsidiaries and their foreign subsidiaries us subsidiaries that are permanently reinvested outside the us should the company make a distribution from the unremitted earnings of its us subsidiaries  the company would be required to record additional us deferred taxes 
taxes have not been provided for in circumstances where management expects that  due to the changing demands of the offshore drilling markets  the company s rigs are more likely than not to be redeployed to other locations before those rigs operate in certain jurisdictions long enough to give rise to future tax consequences 
should management s expectations change regarding the length of time other rigs will be operating in a given location  the company may be required to record additional deferred taxes that could have a material adverse effect on its financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
goodwill the company accounts for goodwill in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the company has defined reporting units within its contract drilling segment based upon economic and market characteristics of these units 
all of the goodwill recorded in connection with the merger has been allocated to the jackup drilling fleet reporting unit  as these rigs were the primary source of value in the merger discussions and negotiations 
the estimated fair value of this reporting unit for purposes of the company s annual goodwill impairment testing is based upon the present value of its estimated future net cash flows  utilizing a discount rate based upon the company s cost of capital 
at december   goodwill in the company s consolidated balance sheet totaled approximately million  substantially all of which was recorded in connection with the merger see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
goodwill decreased by million from million at december   due primarily to the adjustment during of certain pre merger foreign tax contingencies 
stock based compensation the company accounts for its stock option and stock based compensation plans using the intrinsic value method prescribed by accounting principles board apb opinion no 
accounting for stock issued to employees 
accordingly  the company computes compensation cost for each employee stock option granted as the amount by which the quoted market price of the company s common stock on the date of grant exceeds the amount the employee must pay to acquire the stock 
the amount of compensation cost  if any  is charged to expense over the vesting period 
no compensation cost has been recognized for any of the 
table of contents company s outstanding stock options  all of which have exercise prices equal to or greater than the market price of the stock on the date of grant 
statement of accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation an amendment to fas  however  requires the company to estimate the fair value of outstanding stock based compensation awards for its pro forma disclosures see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company uses an option pricing model black scholes to estimate the fair values of these awards  which requires various assumptions as to risk free interest rates  stock volatility  dividend yield and expected lives of awards 
self insurance accruals the company is self insured for certain losses related to workers compensation  employers liability  general liability  automobile liability and property damage 
the company maintains accruals in its consolidated balance sheet to cover the estimated self insurance retention 
these accruals are based on certain assumptions developed utilizing historical data to project future anticipated losses 
loss estimates in the calculation of these accruals are periodically adjusted based upon actual claims settlements and reported claims 
pension cost and other postretirement benefits the company s pension costs and liabilities are actuarially determined based on certain assumptions including expected long term rates of return on plan assets  rate of increase in future compensation levels and the discount rate used to compute future benefit obligations 
actual results could differ materially from these actuarially determined amounts 
the company uses a december measurement date for its pension and postretirement benefit plans 
the following weighted average assumptions were used to determine the company s pension benefit obligations december  december  us plans us plans us plans us plans discount rate rate of compensation increase the following weighted average assumptions were used to determine the company s net periodic pension cost year ended december  us plans us plans us plans us plans us plans us plans discount rate expected long term rate of return on plan assets rate of compensation increase the discount rate used to calculate the net present value of future benefit obligations at december  and  and pension costs for the years ended december   and  for the company s us plans is based on the average of current rates earned on long term bonds that receive a moody s rating of aa or better 
the company employs third party consultants for its us plans who use a portfolio return model to assess the initial reasonableness of the expected long term rate of return on plan assets assumption 
using asset class return  variance  and correlation assumptions  the model produces both the expected return and the distribution of possible returns at every fifth percentile for the chosen portfolio 
return assumptions developed by the company s consultants are forward looking gross returns 
the building block approach used by the portfolio return model begins with the current treasury yield curve  recognizing that expected returns 
table of contents on bonds are heavily influenced by the current level of yields 
the model then adds corporate bond spreads and equity risk premiums based on current market conditions  to develop the return expectations for each asset class based on the investment mix for the company s pension plans 
the volatility and correlation assumptions are also forward looking they take into account historical relationships  but are adjusted by the company s consultants to reflect expected capital market trends 
following is a summary of how changes in the assumed discount rate and expected return on assets  assuming all other factors remain unchanged  would affect the net periodic pension and postretirement benefit expense for and related pension and postretirement benefit obligations as of december  return on plan discount rate assets in millions net periodic pension cost us plans uk plans accumulated benefit obligation us plans n a n a uk plans n a n a projected benefit obligation us plans n a n a uk plans n a n a the calculation of the company s other postretirement benefits costs and liabilities includes the weighted average annual assumed rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered medical benefits 
this assumption is based on data available to management at the time the assumption is made 
for further discussion of the components of the company s net periodic pension cost and funded status of the company s pension plans  see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make certain estimates 
the company bases these estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that the company believes to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results  however  could differ from these estimates 
the following is a discussion of other critical accounting estimates  in addition to those discussed above allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company estimates its allowance for doubtful accounts based on analysis of historical collection activity 
factors that may affect this estimate include changes in the financial position of a major customer or significant changes in the prices of oil or natural gas 
turnkey drilling costs 
the company typically relies on detailed cost estimates created by project engineering staff to compute and record profits on turnkey drilling projects based on known revenues 
these cost estimates are adjusted when final actual project costs have been determined  which may result in adjustments to previously recorded amounts 
accrued claims and liabilities 
the company estimates its accrued claims and liabilities based on the facts and circumstances specific to the claims and past experience with similar claims 
the actual outcome of litigated claims could differ significantly from estimated amounts 
fair values of financial instruments 
the company estimates the fair values of its financial instruments based on available third party market quotes for its financial instruments or market quotes based on financial instruments with similar characteristics 
where market quotes are unavailable  the company bases its estimates of fair values on the net present value of estimated future cash flows 

table of contents future cash flows 
the company s estimates of future cash flows are based on the most recent currently available market and operating data for the applicable asset or reporting unit at the time the estimate is made 
in addition to goodwill or asset impairment analyses and fair value calculations discussed above  cash flow estimates are also used to determine certain tax related valuations 
merger with santa fe international restructuring costs on november   global marine merged with a subsidiary of santa fe international and became a wholly owned subsidiary of santa fe international  which was renamed globalsantafe corporation at the time of the merger 
in connection with the merger  the company implemented a restructuring program that included the consolidation of santa fe international s administrative office in dallas  texas  global marine s administrative office in lafayette  louisiana  and global marine s administrative office in houston  texas  into a single administrative office in houston  the consolidation of santa fe international s and global marine s north sea administrative offices in aberdeen  scotland  and the separation of employees from the company

current market conditions the drilling business has historically been cyclical  marked by periods of low demand  excess rig supply and low dayrates  followed by periods of high demand  short rig supply and increasing dayrates 
these cycles are volatile and have traditionally been influenced by a number of factors  including oil and gas prices  the spending plans of the company s customers and the highly competitive nature of the offshore drilling industry 
even when rig markets appear to have stabilized at a certain level of utilization and dayrates  these markets can change swiftly  making it difficult to predict trends or conditions in the market 
the relocation of rigs from weak markets to stable or strong markets may also have a significant impact on utilization and dayrates in the affected markets 
a summary of current market conditions in the company s areas of operations follows north sea 
the company s north sea fleet currently includes four semisubmersibles  four cantilevered heavy duty harsh environment hdhe jackups  three cantilevered jackups and a platform rig 
although the current industry utilization for semisubmersibles in the north sea is only slightly above  the company has been successful in securing contracts for two of its three idle semisubmersibles commencing late in the first quarter of while the company expects demand to increase during the spring  industry utilization is not expected to increase to a level that would support a material improvement in dayrates during the market for hdhe jackup rigs in the north sea has improved and the company has observed a number of recent tenders for hdhe work 
the gsf galaxy iii is contracted into early and is committed to another operator for hdhe work commencing in mid  continuing into early the gsf galaxy i and the gsf magellan each have contracts commencing in may  with both programs expected to extend into late third quarter the gsf monarch continues under a long term contract extending into late the standard specification jackups gsf labrador and gsf adriatic xi will both experience some idle time during the first quarter of with the gsf labrador commencing a one well contract in march the company expects the market for standard specification jackups to strengthen in the spring 
the britannia continues under a long term contract that extends into late us gulf of mexico 
the company currently operates ten cantilevered jackups and two semisubmersibles in the us gulf of mexico market 
with the mobilization of a number of jackups to other markets by industry participants  the supply and demand outlook for jackups is improving  although this market continues to be characterized by short term contracts 
during the fourth quarter of  the company experienced full employment of its jackup rig fleet in the us gulf of mexico while the industry utilization rate for all jackups in the area averaged for the same period 
average dayrates for the company s jackups increased approximately during the fourth quarter of from third quarter levels 
although the us gulf of mexico market for semisubmersibles is expected to remain weak through at least the first half of  the company was successful in securing a contract for the gsf celtic sea commencing in early march for an initial period of approximately five months 
the gsf arctic i commenced a new contract in october and the company expects the rig to remain under contact until the third quarter of ultra deepwater market 
industry wide  the ultra deepwater market has shown signs of improvement recently as evidenced by a number of contract awards for deepwater rigs in the us gulf of mexico and west africa 
for the past several quarters  this market has been characterized by shorter term work with the potential for downtime between contracts 
while this spot market softness still exists  the company believes that recent and prospective contract awards may lead to a better balance between supply and demand and consequently to greater backlog and higher dayrates for the premium equipment in this asset class later in and into the company currently operates three drillships in the ultra deepwater market  with all three of those rigs currently located in the us gulf of mexico 
upon completion of a contract in mauritania 
table of contents west africa  the glomar jack ryan mobilized to the us gulf of mexico in the first quarter of for a minimum one well contract 
following the project in the gulf of mexico  the rig is likely to move to brazil for a multiple well project 
the glomar explorer transferred from one customer to another in february for a one well contract  and while there are prospects for the rig following this commitment  none have yet developed into a contract 
the gsf cr luigs is expected to continue under contract with its current customer for the foreseeable future 
the company currently has two ultra deepwater semisubmersibles under construction 
the first of these  the gsf development driller i  is scheduled for delivery around the end of the second quarter of and the company is bidding the rig against several long term projects 
however  most of those opportunities have commencement dates in  so the company will be attempting to find shorter term work for the rig in the interim 
the second rig  the gsf development driller ii  is scheduled for delivery around the end of the first quarter of  after which it will mobilize to the gulf of mexico for a three year contract 
west africa 
the company currently operates two semisubmersibles and nine cantilevered jackups in this market 
both of the company s semisubmersibles in this market are contracted until mid the west africa jackup market continues to be heavily influenced by the level of rig demand in nigeria  traditionally the area with the largest concentration of rigs in this market 
utilization continued to decrease during the fourth quarter of mainly as a result of rigs coming off contracts in nigeria due to operators experiencing funding difficulties with their partner  the nigerian national oil company 
the industry utilization rate was only in january the company anticipates that the funding difficulties will be resolved and the west africa market will strengthen generally through the year 
notwithstanding the recent market weakness  the company has been successful in contracting its three idle jackups to return to work by the end of february in february  the company was awarded contracts for two jackups for a long term project in angola  utilizing one jackup from equatorial guinea and one from the us gulf of mexico 
the contracts are scheduled to commence in august with a duration of years each 
middle east and mediterranean 
the company currently operates six cantilevered jackups in the middle east region  three cantilevered jackups in the mediterranean region offshore north africa and has a moored drillship cold stacked in egypt 
given the relatively high level of demand for jackups in these regions  the company expects all nine of its jackups in these regions to be fully utilized throughout southeast asia 
utilization in this region has remained high and the company has observed an increase in dayrates with recent contract awards 
the company currently operates seven cantilevered jackups in this market 
the recently constructed gsf constellation i commenced a multi well contract in august but encountered difficulty in positioning near a platform due to seabed conditions 
the rig suffered leg damage and is currently undergoing repairs in singapore 
the rig will mobilize to trinidad during march the company s remaining six jackup rigs in this region are expected to be fully employed throughout other 
the company currently operates one semisubmersible and one hdhe jackup offshore eastern canada 
the semisubmersible commenced a two year contract in july the jackup is currently idle but is contracted to commence a two well contract in june in trinidad and tobago  the company expects both the gsf adriatic vii and the gsf monitor to remain under contract with their current customers for the balance of as discussed above  the gsf constellation i is expected to mobilize to trinidad in march for a three year contract 
a sister rig  the gsf constellation ii  is currently under construction in singapore and is scheduled for delivery around the end of the first quarter of upon delivery  the rig will mobilize to argentina for an approximate nine month contract 
land drilling fleet 
the company owns land drilling rigs  with of these located in the middle east rigs in kuwait  four in saudi arabia and three in oman  four in north africa and eight in venezuela 
seven of the company s land rigs in kuwait are currently operating  five of which are contracted into the third quarter of the company expects its four land rigs in egypt to be fully utilized through the third quarter of in oman  the company secured new four year term contracts for two of its three land rigs

reimbursable revenues represent reimbursements from customers for certain out of pocket expenses incurred and have no effect on operating income 
other revenues include rig mobilization fees and miscellaneous fees including labor  material  rental  handling and incentive bonuses 
the decreases attributable to the marine drilling fleet were due primarily to both lower dayrates and utilization for the north sea and west africa fleets  lower dayrates for the middle east drilling fleet and the gsf arctic i and the gsf c 
r 
luigs in the us gulf of mexico and lower utilization of the gsf grand banks off the east coast of canada  which was idle through the first half of these decreases in marine drilling revenues were offset in part by increases in both dayrates and utilization for the company s us gulf of mexico jackup fleet and by an increase in utilization for gsf rig in southeast asia  which was undergoing upgrades during a substantial portion of the decrease in utilization for the company s land fleet was due primarily to the company s rigs in venezuela  which were idle for substantially all of  along with lower utilization for the company s rigs in kuwait

year ended december   compared to year ended december  contract drilling revenues increased by million to  million in compared to million in due primarily to million from the addition of the santa fe international rigs to the company s drilling fleet  partially offset by lower dayrates and utilization in the us gulf of mexico 
the company s operating profit margin for contract drilling operations decreased to in from in due primarily to the addition of land drilling operations  which have historically operated at substantially lower margins than the company s offshore fleet  and lower average dayrates in the us gulf of mexico  along with an increase in depreciation expense due to the adjustment of the carrying values of the santa fe international rigs to their estimated market value in connection with the merger 
in addition  the company s contract drilling operating results for were impacted by accelerated repair and maintenance expenditures on several rigs that were relocating  undergoing upgrades or idle  as well as a painting and maintenance project on one of its semisubmersibles 
in accordance with its normal practice  the company took advantage of idle rig time in the north sea and elsewhere to perform repair  maintenance and upgrade work on several of its idle rigs 
the company also recorded approximately million of merger related transition expenses in its contract drilling operations during  which represent costs incurred as part of the integration of the operations of global marine and santa fe international and are not considered indicative of the company s ongoing operations 
drilling management services results of operations from the company s drilling management services may be limited by certain factors  in particular the ability of the company to find and retain qualified personnel  to hire suitable rigs at acceptable rates  and to obtain and successfully perform turnkey drilling contracts based on competitive bids 
the company s ability to obtain turnkey drilling contracts is largely dependent on the number of such contracts available for bid  which in turn is influenced by market prices for oil and gas  among other factors 
accordingly  results of the company s drilling management service operations may vary widely from quarter to quarter and from year to year 
year ended december   compared to year ended december  drilling management services revenues increased by million to million for the year ended december   from million in this increase in revenues consisted primarily of million attributable to a net increase in reimbursable revenues  million attributable to an increase in the number of turnkey projects performed and million attributable to increases in daywork and other revenues  offset in part by a million decrease attributable to lower average revenues per turnkey project 
reimbursable revenues represent reimbursements received from the client for certain out of pocket expenses and have no effect on operating income

transition expenses  which represent costs incurred as part of the integration of the operations of global marine and santa fe international  are not considered to be indicative of the company s ongoing operations 
pension expense included in general and administrative expenses increased to million in as compared to million in due primarily to the inclusion of expenses related to legacy santa fe international plans  lower returns on plan assets and plan changes to conform benefits under the legacy pension plans as a result of the merger 

table of contents other operating income for also includes a gain of million on the sale of the glomar beaufort sea i concrete island drilling system  which was sold in june other income and expense interest expense was million for  million for and million for the increase in interest expense in compared to was due primarily to the issuance of the notes on february   as discussed in liquidity and capital resources financing and investing activities  offset in part by the effects of fixed for floating interest rate swaps on a portion of the company s long term debt

the company capitalized million  million and million of interest costs in  and  respectively  in connection with the company s rig expansion program discussed in liquidity and capital resources financing and investing activities

other income totaled million in  due primarily to net gains totaling million recorded on embedded derivative financial instruments associated with two year variable dayrate contracts for two of the company s cantilevered jackups 
see discussion in item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk 
these net gains in were offset in part by a million loss on the sale of long term marketable securities related to one of the company s retirement plans 
income taxes the company s effective income tax rates for financial reporting purposes were approximately for the years ended december  and  and for the effective rate for was reduced by the effect of the million uncc settlements discussed above  partially offset by a net total of million of other discrete items 
the lower effective tax rates for and compared to were due in part to the addition of the santa fe international operations  which increased earnings in international jurisdictions that are taxed at generally lower rates  and a valuation allowance recorded against global marine s net operating loss nol carryforwards in  discussed below 
the and effective tax rates were further lowered by approximately million of reduced annual tax costs related to intercompany debt incurred in connection with the merger 
the company decreased its cumulative valuation allowance against its foreign nol carryforwards by million in  due to revised expectations with respect to future taxable income in various foreign jurisdictions 
in  the company recorded a valuation allowance against the nol carryforwards of global marine and its subsidiaries 
the effect of that valuation allowance was to increase tax expense by million 
the company s ability to realize the benefit of global marine s us nol carryforwards requires that the company achieve a certain level of future earnings in the united states prior to the expiration of its nol 
table of contents carryforwards 
reduced activity levels in the us gulf of mexico in contributed to a decrease in the expected future earnings of the company s us subsidiaries 
also  as a result of the merger  the expiration dates of the company s nol carryforwards were accelerated by one year  decreasing the number of years available to fully utilize the nol carryforwards before they expire 
based upon anticipated market conditions in the united states as of december  and  the company did not adjust the valuation allowance against the us nol carryforwards of global marine during or taxes have not been provided for in circumstances where management expects that  due to the changing demands of the offshore drilling markets  the company s rigs are more likely than not to be redeployed to other locations before those rigs operate in certain jurisdictions long enough to give rise to future tax consequences 
in  management revised its expectations relative to the continuing deployment and future tax consequences for one such rig and recorded a deferred tax liability of million due to this change in circumstance 
should management s expectations change regarding the length of time other rigs will be operating in a given location  the company may be required to record additional deferred taxes that could have a material adverse effect on its financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
the company intends to permanently reinvest all of the unremitted earnings of its us subsidiaries in their businesses 
as a result  the company has not provided for us deferred taxes on billion of cumulative unremitted earnings at december  should the company make a distribution from the unremitted earnings of its us subsidiaries  the company would be required under current law to record additional us deferred taxes that could have a material adverse effect on its financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
starting in  various changes to the us federal income tax code were proposed that  if enacted  could adversely affect the company s united states federal income tax position 
many of the proposed changes target united states corporations that have expatriated to foreign jurisdictions and would in certain cases treat such corporations as united states corporations for united states federal income tax purposes 
several of the proposals would have retroactive application and would treat the company as a united states corporation 
some of the proposals would impose additional limitations on the deductibility for united states federal income tax purposes of certain intercompany transactions  including intercompany interest expense 
these proposals would reduce or eliminate the company s ability to deduct interest expense on its intercompany debt  the benefit of which was discussed above 
the benefit is expected to be similar to that recorded in and at this time  it is impossible to predict what changes  if any  may be enacted and  if enacted  what effect such changes may have on the company 
however  there is a risk that changes to us tax laws could substantially increase the company s income tax costs 
if this were to occur  such changes could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position and future results of operations

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk two of the company s cantilevered jackup rigs are currently operating under similar dayrate contracts that expose the company to commodity price risk 
these two year agreements  expiring in may and october  respectively  each contain a variable dayrate formula linked to crude oil prices  whereby dayrates earned under these contracts increase or decrease in response to increases or decreases in oil prices 
dayrates under these agreements are calculated using a sliding scale formula based on the arithmetic average of the daily closing price of light sweet crude on the new york mercantile exchange nymex  subject to a maximum of per barrel and a minimum of per barrel 
the variable dayrate formula contained in these agreements consists of multiple embedded derivative financial instruments as defined in sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the net fair values  based upon market price  of the embedded derivatives in each of these contracts at december   were assets of approximately million and million  respectively  or million in the aggregate 
the fair values of these embedded derivatives fluctuate in response to changes in oil prices 
the company has engaged third party consultants to perform sensitivity analyses to assess the impact of these risks based on a hypothetical ten percent increase or decrease in nymex light sweet crude futures prices over the remaining lives of these agreements at december  oil prices are dependent on many factors that are impossible to forecast  and actual oil price increases or decreases could be greater than the hypothetical ten percent change 
based upon these analyses  a ten percent increase in average nymex oil prices over the remaining lives of these agreements would increase the net fair values of the embedded derivatives contained in these contracts by million and million  respectively 
conversely  a ten percent decrease in oil prices over the lives of these agreements would decrease the net fair value of the embedded derivatives by approximately million and million  respectively 
as part of the company s overall risk management strategy  the company has entered into a number of commodity caps  swaps and floors designed to mitigate its exposure to fluctuations in fair values of the embedded derivatives in these contracts resulting from changes in oil prices 
the net fair values of the derivative financial instruments at december   represented a total obligation of million 
these embedded derivative financial instruments and related commodity caps  swaps and floors have not been designated as hedges 
accordingly  all changes in the fair values of these instruments are recognized currently in earnings 
interest rate risk in  the company entered into fixed price contracts for the construction of two dynamically positioned  ultra deepwater drillships  the gsf cr luigs and the glomar jack ryan  which began operating in april and december  respectively 
pursuant to two year capital lease agreements  the company subsequently novated the construction contracts for the drillships to two financial institutions the lessors  which now own the drillships and lease them to the company 
the company has deposited with three large foreign banks the payment banks amounts equal to the progress payments that the lessors were required to make under the construction contracts  less a lease benefit of approximately million the defeasance payment 
in exchange for the deposits  the payment banks have assumed liability for making rental payments required under the leases and the lessors have legally released the company as the primary obligor of such rental payments 
accordingly  the company has recorded no capital lease obligations on its balance sheet with respect to the two drillships 
the company has interest rate risk in connection with these fully defeased financing leases for the glomar jack ryan and gsf c 
r 
luigs 
the defeasance payment earns interest based on the british pound sterling three month libor  which approximated at the time of the agreements 
should the defeasance payment earn less than the assumed rate of interest  the company will be required to make additional payments as necessary to augment the annual payments made by the payment banks pursuant to 
table of contents the agreements 
if the december   libor rate of were to continue over the next nine years  the company would be required to fund an additional estimated million during that period 
any additional payments made by the company pursuant to the financing leases would increase the carrying value of its leasehold interest in the rigs and therefore be reflected in higher depreciation expense over their then remaining useful lives 
the company does not expect that  if required  any additional payments made under these leases would be material to its financial position  results of operations or cash flows in any given year 
the company does not consider its exposure to interest rate fluctuations to be material to its financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
fair value risk investments 
the objectives of the company s investment strategy are safety of principal  liquidity maintenance  yield maximization and full investment of all available funds 
as a result  the company s short term investment portfolio at december   consisted primarily of high credit quality commercial paper  us treasury notes  eurodollar debt securities and money market funds  all with original maturities of less than twelve months 
the company believes that the carrying value of these investments approximated market value at december   due to the short term nature of these instruments 
the company also held approximately million of us treasury notes with remaining maturities of to months at december   that were classified as other assets on the consolidated balance sheets 
the fair value of these securities totaled million at december  long term debt 
the company s long term debt is subject to fair value risk due to changes in market interest rates 
in addition  the fair value of the company s zero coupon convertible debt is subject to changes in the market price of the company s ordinary shares

the company has engaged third party consultants to assess the impact of changes in interest rates and share prices on the fair values of its long term debt based on a hypothetical ten percent increase in market interest rates and a hypothetical ten percent decrease in the price of its ordinary shares 
market interest rate and share price volatility are dependent on many factors that are impossible to forecast  and actual interest rate increases and share price decreases could be more severe than the hypothetical ten percent change 
based upon these sensitivity analyses  if prevailing market interest rates had been ten percent higher at december   and all other factors affecting the company s debt remained the same  the fair value of the company s notes due  as determined on a present value basis using prevailing market interest rates  would have decreased by million or  the fair value of the notes due would have decreased by million or  and the fair values of the company s notes due and the company s zero coupon convertible debt would have decreased by less than one percent 
with respect to the company s zero coupon convertible debt  if the market price of the company s ordinary shares had been ten percent lower at december   and all other factors remained the same  the decrease in the fair value of the zero coupon convertible debt would have been less than one percent 
the company manages its fair value risk related to its long term debt by using interest rate swaps to convert a portion of its fixed rate debt into variable rate debt

in connection with the sensitivity analyses performed relative to the fair values of the company s long term debt discussed above  similar analyses were performed to assess the impact of market interest rate movements on the fair values of the fixed for floating swaps related to the notes 
based upon these analyses  if prevailing market interest rates had been ten percent higher at december   and all other factors affecting these swaps had remained the same  the aggregate fair value of the fixed for floating interest rate swaps  as determined on a present value basis using prevailing market interest rates  would have decreased by million or

this risk arises from holding net monetary assets cash and receivables in excess of payables denominated in foreign currencies during periods of a strengthening us dollar 
the company attempts to minimize this currency risk by seeking international drilling contracts payable in local currency in amounts equal to its estimated local currency based operating costs and in us dollars for the balance of the contract 
as a result of this strategy  the company has minimized its net asset or liability positions denominated in local currencies and has not experienced significant gains or losses associated with changes in currency exchange rates 
accordingly  the company has not entered into financial hedging transactions to manage risks relating to fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
the company may  however  enter into such transactions in the future should the company assume significant foreign currency risks
