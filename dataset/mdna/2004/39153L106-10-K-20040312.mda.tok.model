item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
we are a leading developer and manufacturer of batteries  capacitors  feedthroughs  enclosures  and other components used in implantable medical devices imds through our implantable medical components imc business 
we also leverage our core competencies in technology and manufacturing through our electrochem power solutions eps business to develop and produce batteries and battery packs for commercial applications that demand high performance and reliability  including oil and gas exploration  oceanographic equipment and aerospace 
most of the imc products that we sell are utilized by customers in cardiac rhythm management crm devices 
the crm market comprises devices utilizing high rate batteries and capacitors such as implantable cardioverter defibrillators icds and cardiac resynchronization therapy with backup defibrillation devices crt d and devices utilizing low or medium rate batteries but no capacitors pacemakers and crts 
all crm devices utilize other components such as enclosures and feedthroughs  and certain crm devices utilize electromagnetic interference emi filtering technology 
the nature and extent of our selling relationships with each crm customer are different in terms of component products purchased  selling prices  product volumes  ordering patterns and inventory management 
consequently  our sales and gross profit can be significantly affected by our customers actions 
our eps sales are derived primarily from sales of batteries and battery packs for use in oil and gas exploration 
we also supply batteries to nasa for its space shuttle program and other similarly demanding commercial applications 
a substantial part of our business is conducted with a limited number of customers 
our two largest customers accounted for approximately of consolidated sales in we have entered into long term supply agreements with some of our customers 
for each of our products  we recognize revenue when the products are shipped and title passes 
we utilize a fifty two  fifty three week fiscal year ending on the friday nearest december st 
for clarity of presentation  the company describes all periods as if the year end is december st 
fiscal included weeks 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures 
the methods  estimates and judgments we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our financial statements 
management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if o it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made  and o changes in the estimate or different estimates that could have been selected could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations  financial position  or cash flows 
our most critical accounting estimates are described below 
we also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies  such as our policies for revenue recognition  however  these policies do not meet the definition of critical accounting estimates  because they do not generally require us to make estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective 
balance sheet caption nature effect of variations on key of critical estimate item assumptions approach used assumptions used inventories inventory standard costing requires complex variations in methods could have calculations that include assumptions for a material impact on the inventories are stated at the overhead absorption  scrap and sample results 
if our demand forecast lower of cost  determined using calculations and manufacturing yield for specific products is greater the first in  first out method  estimates 
the valuation of inventory than actual demand and we fail or market 
requires us to estimate obsolete or excess to reduce manufacturing output inventory as well as inventory that is not of accordingly  we could be saleable quality 
required to record additional inventory reserves  which would have a negative impact on our gross margins 
goodwill and other indefinite we perform an annual review  or more we make certain estimates and lived assets frequently if indicators of potential assumptions that affect the impairment exist  to determine if the determination of the expected goodwill is initially recorded recorded goodwill and other indefinite lived future cash flows from our when the purchase price paid for assets are impaired 
we assess these assets goodwill and indefinite lived an acquisition exceeds the for impairment by comparing the fair value of assets 
these estimates and estimated fair value of the net the reporting units to their carrying value assumptions include sales growth identified tangible and to determine if there is potential projections  cost of capital intangible assets acquired 
impairment 
if the fair value of a reporting projections  and other key other indefinite lived assets unit is less than its carrying value  an indications of future cash such as trademark names are impairment loss is recorded to the extent flows 
significant changes in considered unamortizing that the implied fair value of the goodwill these estimates and assumptions intangible assets as they are within the reporting unit is less than its could create future impairment expected to generate cash flows carrying value 
fair values for goodwill are losses in either reporting unit 
indefinitely 
determined based on discounted cash flows  market multiples or appraised values as appropriate 
long lived assets we assess the impairment of long lived estimation of the useful lives assets when events or changes in of assets that are long lived property  plant and equipment  circumstances indicate that the carrying requires significant management definite lived intangible value of the assets may not be recoverable 
judgment 
events could occur  assets  and other long lived factors that we consider in deciding when to including changes in cash flow  assets are carried at cost 
perform an impairment review include that would materially affect our this cost is charged to significant under performance of a business estimates and assumptions depreciation or amortization or product line in relation to expectations  related to depreciation 
expense over the estimated life significant negative industry or economic unforeseen changes in operations of the operating assets trends  and significant changes or planned or technology could primarily using straight line changes in our use of the assets 
substantially alter the rates 
recoverability potential is measured by assumptions regarding the comparing the carrying amount of the asset ability to realize the return of to the related total future undiscounted our investment in operating cash flows 
if an asset s carrying value is assets and therefore the amount not recoverable through related cash flows  of depreciation expense to the asset is considered to be impaired 
charge against both current and impairment is measured by comparing the future sales 
also  as we make asset s carrying amount to its fair value  manufacturing process based on the best information available  conversions and other factory including market prices or discounted cash planning decisions  we must make flow analysis 
when it is determined that subjective judgments regarding useful lives of assets are shorter than the remaining useful lives of originally estimated  and there are assets  primarily manufacturing sufficient cash flows to support the equipment and building carrying value of the assets  we accelerate improvements 
the rate of depreciation in order to fully depreciate the assets over their new shorter useful lives 
provision for income taxes in relation to recording the provision for changes could occur that would income taxes  management must estimate the materially affect our estimates in accordance with the liability future tax rates applicable to the reversal and assumptions regarding method of accounting for income of tax differences  make certain assumptions deferred taxes 
changes in taxes specified in statement of regarding whether tax differences are current tax laws and tax rates financial accounting standards permanent or temporary and the related time could affect the valuation of no 
 accounting for income of expected reversal 
also  estimates are deferred tax assets and taxes  the provision for income made as to whether taxable operating income liabilities  thereby changing taxes is the sum of income taxes in future periods will be sufficient to fully the income tax provision 
also  both currently payable and recognize any gross deferred tax assets 
if significant declines in taxable deferred 
the changes in recovery is not likely  we must increase our income could materially impact deferred tax assets and provision for taxes by recording a valuation the realizable value of deferred liabilities are determined based allowance against the deferred tax assets tax assets 
at december  upon the changes in differences that we estimate will not ultimately be we had million of between the basis of assets and recoverable 
as of december  we deferred tax assets on our liabilities for financial believe that all of the deferred tax assets balance sheet 
a increase in reporting purposes and the basis recorded on our balance sheet except for the effective tax rate would of assets and liabilities as  will ultimately be recovered 
increase the current year measured by the enacted tax provision by   reducing rates that management estimates in addition  the calculation of our tax fully diluted earnings per share will be in effect when the liabilities involves dealing with by based on shares differences reverse 
uncertainties in the application of complex outstanding at december  tax regulations 
we recognize liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes will be due 
if we ultimately determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary  we reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit during the period in which we determine that the liability is no longer necessary 
we record an additional charge in our provision for taxes in the period in which we determine that the recorded tax liability is less than we expect the ultimate assessment to be 
overview during  there were many accomplishments that should further strengthen our position in the marketplace in and beyond 
o we achieved record financial results with sales growth of and earnings per share growth of 
o we successfully completed a million convertible subordinated notes offering 
o we improved our operating leverage as evidenced by the increase in our operating margins to in up from last year 
o we signed our third wet tantalum capacitor customer 
three of the five worldwide crm device manufacturers have now adopted our capacitor technology 
in  we continued to invest in a corporate realignment with the goal being to present a single face to our customers 
whereas in the past we have been organized as a group of individual operating units developing  manufacturing and selling discrete components  effective january   we are now comprised of two business units imc and eps 
on the new technologies front is our first generation quasar implantable power source 
this product offering further enhances our market position as a leading developer and manufacturer of implantable batteries for medical devices 
our new quasar technology  combined with our wet tantalum capacitor  should provide performance advantages our customers require 
our filtering inductor slab and integrated filtered feedthrough technologies provide enhanced protection from emi electro magnetic interference 
this supplies an important added measure of security in our customer s products 
we have under taken several initiatives to change and improve our infrastructure 
these initiatives  to date  have included additions to our management team  the commencement of the installation of a company wide integrated erp business platform  increased commitment to the expansion of the six sigma program  new lean manufacturing implementation  a philosophy and practice of continuous improvement and the certification of all company wide operations to iso standards 
as we look forward into next year  we will focus on a number of critical areas 
we will continue to address ways to expand our product offering and customer penetration 
our production operations will be expanded to meet increased capacitor demand and we will continue to focus our efforts on signing the remaining crm customers to this technology 
significant resources will be spent on our next generation quasar battery technology and we expect to begin product delivery by year end 
we will continue to leverage our infrastructure over a higher sales base resulting in improved operating margins 
the base implementation of our erp business platform at all locations is scheduled to be completed by the end of the year 
and finally  we will continue to look for acquisition opportunities that will strengthen our technological leadership or broaden our product offering 
our forecasted sales growth is estimated to be lower than experienced in the last two years 
in the company has begun to see downward pricing pressures on some of its products 
however  we expect to expand our operating margins based on increased sales volume  increased leverage of our infrastructure and manufacturing cost reductions 
partially offsetting this growth  are increased costs for the start up of our new medical production facility  increased cost to comply with the sarbanes oxley requirements  higher insurance premiums and the establishment of an internal audit function 
we anticipate that in we will incur additional capital costs primarily due to the build out of the medical production facility and from the continuation of the erp implementation 
we must continue to invest in research and development in order to maintain our competitive position 
in summary  our results for the full year reached record levels reflecting the continued robustness in the crm market 
our focus for will be in five critical areas o increasing our capacitor customer penetration  o identifying value add sales opportunities from our broad product offering  o delivering on our next generation quasar battery technology by year end  o improving our operating margin through leverage of our existing infrastructure and from manufacturing cost reductions  and o completing the implementation of the base erp system 
results of operations and financial condition the commentary that follows should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes 
results of operations year ended december  in thousands  except per share data change change change change imc icd batteries      pacemaker batteries      other batteries    icd capacitors      other components      royalties total imc      eps     total sales      cost of sales      gross profit      gross margin selling  general  and administrative expenses sg a      sg a as a of sales research  development and engineering costs  net rd e      rd e as a of sales intangible amortization     other operating expense     operating income      operating margin interest expense    interest income other income expense  net     provision for income taxes      effective tax rate net income      net margin diluted earnings per share fiscal compared with fiscal we achieved record sales performance in the increase in total sales for included a full year of sales of greatbatch globe  which we acquired in july sales imc 
the sales growth for imc was led by sales of icd batteries reflecting the strength of this market 
in addition  capacitor and components sales increased substantially over last year 
substantially all of the sales changes during were attributable to volume and sales mix 
looking at our overall sales mix  crm product sales increased over last year and now represent of our overall product mix  up from last year 
we remain very positive about the growth prospects of the crm market long term 
eps 
commercial sales increased modestly from a slight rise in volume of orders from oil and gas customers 
gross profit the decrease in gross margin is primarily due to the costs incurred to consolidate the eps plants  the start up costs from the implementation of lean manufacturing  the inclusion of the lower margin enclosure products for the full year  the costs for the hiring of new plant management personnel and changes in selling prices for certain medical components 
these factors contributed to a basis point reduction in gross margin on a year over year basis 
sg a expenses expenses increased compared to last year in absolute dollars  but declined as a percent of sales due to improved operating leverage 
the increase in absolute dollars is partially due to the hiring of additional senior management employees 
rd e expenses expenses increased compared to last year in absolute dollars  but decreased as a percent of sales compared to last year as sales growth has outpaced spending 
we expect to maintain our spending on rd e at a level that will support the new technologies demanded by the imd markets 
amortization expense the reduction in intangible amortization reflects the impact of the sale of certain intangible assets of the ceramic capacitor product line that was part of the sierra kd components acquisition in in addition  one of the patent licenses for wet tantalum capacitors was fully amortized during other operating expense the amount is primarily attributable to the write down of a manufacturing facility that became available as the result of a decision to purchase an additional manufacturing facility in new york 
interest expense and interest income interest expense was lower and interest income was higher primarily due to the issuance of the million convertible subordinated notes in may these securities allowed for the outstanding line of credit to be fully replaced at a lower rate of interest and additional funds to be invested on a short term basis 
provision for income taxes our effective tax rate declined primarily as a result of increased research and development credits  as well as the benefits of state tax planning strategies 
the impact of the lower effective tax rate during was approximately million 
the extraterritorial income exclusion eti provided approximately million of tax benefit in there is currently legislation in congress to repeal the eti provisions of the internal revenue code and to make numerous changes to the united states international tax regime and other laws affecting domestic businesses 
fiscal compared with fiscal the increase in total sales for included sales of greatbatch globe  which we acquired in july imc 
sales for imc increased mainly due to our customers increased demand for icd batteries in the crm market 
partially offsetting this increase was a decline in royalty revenues from medtronic on patents that had expired 
capacitor sales increased as a result of increased demand by the existing customer for capacitors in the increase in sales of medical components was primarily due to the inclusion of sales from our greatbatch sierra acquisition during the full year of and our greatbatch globe acquisition for the second half of substantially all of the revenue changes during were attributable to volume 
eps 
commercial battery and pack sales decreased principally due to a decreased level of exploration in the oil and gas industry in the first six months of compared to gross profit gross profit increased as a result of increased sales 
production yield issues for filtered feedthroughs  reduced royalty revenues in compared to  and the inclusion of lower margin greatbatch globe tool operations were the primary contributors to the reduced overall gross margin 
sg a expenses sg a expenses increased both in dollars and as a percentage of total sales 
the increase is primarily due to the inclusion of costs associated with the addition of greatbatch sierra for the last half of and the full year and greatbatch globe for the last half of  costs associated with our six sigma tm quality initiatives  the general development of our infrastructure to support our growth  and expenses related to ongoing patent activity 
rd e expenses rd e expenses increased in dollars  but as a percentage of total sales were at the same level for both years 
the decrease in the percentage of expenses as related to sales is primarily attributable to the low level of rd e expenses at greatbatch globe 
we expect to maintain our spending on rd e at a level that will support the new technologies demanded by the imd markets 
amortization expense intangible amortization decreased significantly due to the cessation of the amortization for goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives effective the beginning of our fiscal year if the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
had been implemented on january   income from continuing operations and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for would have been million and  respectively 
if sfas no 
had been implemented on january   net income and diluted earnings per share for would have been million and  respectively 
other expenses in  other operating expense included a non recurring charge of million representing the write off of a noncompete agreement after the passing of mr 
fred hittman 
interest expense declined as a result of reduced interest rates during the year 
the rate reductions arose from reduced market rates as well as contracted rate reductions due to the reduction in leverage measurements during the year 
interest income increased slightly as the company s investable cash was higher in than due to the timing of its follow on public offering and the acquisition of greatbatch globe 
in other expense included a non recurring charge of million representing the write off of the investment in an unrelated company based on an analysis of the financial viability of that company 
it was determined that the company s investment in the unrelated company had a fair value that is less than its carrying value 
in other expense included a charge for the early extinguishment of debt associated with the restructuring of our long term debt and the related write off of deferred financing fees  a call premium paid  and loan discounts associated with the previous long term debt 
provision for income taxes our effective tax rate declined primarily as a result of increased research and development credits  as well as the benefits of state tax planning strategies  net of anticipated increased state taxes related to the greatbatch globe acquisition 
the impact of the lower effective tax rate during was approximately million 
liquidity and capital resources our principal source of short term liquidity is our working capital of million at december  combined with our unused million credit line with our lending syndicate 
historically we have generated cash from operations sufficient to meet our capital expenditure and debt service needs  other than for acquisitions 
at december  our current ratio was  so short term liquidity is not an issue 
the company regularly engages in discussions relating to potential acquisitions and has identified possible acquisition opportunities and we may announce an acquisition transaction at any time 
at december   our capital structure consisted primarily of million of convertible subordinated notes and our million shares of common stock outstanding 
we have in excess of million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments and are in a position to facilitate future acquisitions if necessary 
we are also authorized to issue million shares of common stock and million shares of preferred stock 
the market value of our outstanding common stock since our ipo has exceeded our book value and the average daily trading volume of our common stock has also increased  accordingly  we believe that if needed we can access public markets to sell additional common or preferred stock assuming conditions are appropriate 
in addition to the improved working capital  capital spending of million in was lower than historical expenditure levels 
the majority of the current year spending was for maintenance capital 
in comparison  we spent million in  which included approximately million for new investment projects in addition to approximately million for maintenance capital 
in  we significantly enhanced our balance sheet through improved cash flow from operations and through the convertible note financing we completed in may 
this improved capital structure allows us to support our internal growth and provides liquidity for corporate development initiatives 
we anticipate that in we will incur additional capital costs primarily due to the build out of the medical production facility and from the continuation of the erp implementation 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements within the meaning of item a of regulation s k 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods 
payments due by period contractual obligations total less than years years more than year years long term debt obligations a convertible debentures   capital lease obligations  operating lease obligations b   purchase obligations c   total     a the current portion of these liabilities is included 
amounts do not include imputed interest 
see note debt of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in this form k for additional information about our long term obligations 
b see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in this form k for additional information about our operating lease obligations 
c purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of raw materials and other goods and services are not included in the table above 
for the purposes of this table  contractual obligations for purchase of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on the company and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
our purchase orders are normally based on our current manufacturing needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons 
we enter into blanket orders with vendors that have preferred pricing and terms  however these orders are normally cancelable by us without penalty 
we do not have significant agreements for the purchase of raw materials or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements in the short term 
we also enter into contracts for outsourced services  however  the obligations under these contracts were not significant and the contracts generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty 
inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a significant effect on our operations 
impact of recently issued accounting standards in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities 
fin requires disclosures about variable interest entities for which it is reasonably possible that we will be required to consolidate or disclose information when the interpretation becomes effective 
the provisions of fin are effective for us for the interim period ending april   or earlier in certain instances 
such instances did not have an effect on our consolidated financial statements in we have determined that it is not reasonably possible that we will be required to consolidate or disclose information about a variable interest entity in in may  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity sfas no 

sfas no 
establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
it requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability or an asset in some circumstances 
sfas no 
is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   except for mandatorily redeemable financial instruments subject to the provisions of this statement 
subsequent to the issuance of sfas no 
 the fasb decided to revise the effective dates of the application of certain provisions of the statement 
for mandatorily redeemable financial instruments that do not have a fixed redemption date or are not redeemable for a fixed or determinable amount the board agreed to defer application for an indefinite period of time 
the adoption of sfas no 
did not have an effect on our consolidated financial statements in item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk under our existing line of credit any borrowings bear interest at fluctuating market rates 
at december   we did not have any borrowings outstanding under our line of credit and thus no interest rate sensitive financial instruments
