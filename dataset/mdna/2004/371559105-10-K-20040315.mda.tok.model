the alice springs to darwin railway line was completed in the fourth quarter of the additional gain of million relating to the formation of arg represented an adjustment to the difference between the recorded balance of the company s previously wholly owned investment in australia  less investment amounts that the company estimated would be reimbursed by arg  and the value of those australian operations when arg was formed 
in the fourth quarter of  the company  arg and wesfarmers reached agreement as to the level of acquisition related costs to be reimbursed to both owners 
accordingly  the company recorded a  decrease to its previously recorded gain to reflect the lower than estimated reimbursed amount for acquisition related costs

table of contents mexican financings on december   one of the company s subsidiaries in mexico  servicios  entered into three promissory notes payable notes totaling million with variable interest rates based on libor plus percentage points 
two of the notes have an eight year term with principal payments of million due semi annually beginning march   through the maturity date of september  the third note has a nine year term with principal payments of  due semi annually beginning march   with a maturity date of september  the notes are secured by essentially all the assets of servicios and its subsidiary  compa a de ferrocarriles chiapas mayab  sa de sa  fccm  and a pledge of the company s shares of servicios and fccm 
the company is obligated to provide up to million of funding to its mexican subsidiaries  if necessary  to meet their investment or financial obligations prior to completing the investment phase of the project funded by the notes physical completion  consisting of several obligations related to capital investments  operating performance and management systems and controls 
in addition  the company is obligated to provide million in funding to servicios to meet its debt service obligations prior to completing the financial phase of the project financial completion  consisting of several financial performance thresholds 
at present  fccm has yet to achieve physical completion or financial completion 
based on current circumstances  it is reasonably likely that the company will have to fund a portion of its funding obligation in order to meet the future principal repayment obligations of the notes 
the notes contain certain financial covenants which servicios is in compliance with as of december  in conjunction with the refinancing of fccm and servicios  the international finance corporation ifc the primary lender to servicios invested million of equity for a indirect interest in fccm  through its parent company servicios see notes and to consolidated financial statements 
along with its equity investment  ifc received a put option exercisable in to sell its equity stake back to the company 
the put price will be based on a multiple of earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
the company increases its minority interest expense if the value of the put option exceeds the minority interest 
this put option may result in a future cash outflow of the company 
mexican fuel tax credits until january  as a railroad  fccm was permitted to apply diesel fuel tax credits it earned to a variety of its federal tax obligations  including income taxes  payroll taxes and value added taxes 
in  fccm utilized approximately million in such fuel tax credits 
however  in january  mexican tax authorities issued a ruling that allows railroads to apply these tax credits only to income tax related obligations 
company personnel are working with the secretary of communications and transportation and mexican tax authorities to attempt to change the recent tax ruling  but the company can offer no assurance that it will be successful 
if this ruling were to hold  fccm would face additional annual cash payment obligations for the next few years until it generates sufficient taxable income to utilize such credits 
this additional burden will make it more difficult for fccm and servicios to satisfy their debt obligations and increases the likelihood that the company will have to fund all or a portion of its funding obligation 
south america the company has a indirect ownership interest in empresa ferroviaria oriental  sa oriental which is located in eastern bolivia 
the company holds its equity interest in oriental through a number of intermediate holding companies  and the company accounts for its interest in oriental under the equity method of accounting 
the company indirectly holds a equity interest in oriental through an interest in genesee wyoming chile gwc  and the company holds its remaining equity interest in oriental through other companies 
gwc is an obligor of non recourse debt of million  which has an adjustable interest rate dependent on operating results of oriental 
this non recourse debt is secured by a lien over gwc s indirect equity interest in oriental 
this debt became due and payable on november  due to the political and economic unrest and uncertainties in bolivia  it has become difficult for gwc to refinance this debt and the company has chosen not to repay the non recourse obligation 
gwc entered into discussions with its creditors on plans to restructure the debt  and as a result of those discussions  gwc obtained a written waiver from the creditors which expired on january  negotiations with the creditors continue  and currently  none of gwc s creditors have commenced court proceedings to i collect on the debt or ii exercise their rights pursuant to the lien 
if the company were to lose its equity stake in oriental due to creditors exercising their lien on gwc s indirect equity interest in oriental  the company would record a  write off  the basis of its investment in oriental held through gwc 
because the million of debt is serviced by income received by gwc from oriental  the company s loss of the equity interest in oriental would not have a material adverse impact on the company s future equity income 
a default  acceleration or effort to foreclose on the lien under the non recourse debt will have no impact on the company s remaining equity interest in oriental  because that equity interest is held indirectly through holding companies outside of gwc s ownership in oriental 
the company plans to continue providing management resources to oriental and generates substantially all of its equity income through the ownership interest 
oriental has no obligations associated with the million of debt 
in addition  a default  acceleration or effort to foreclose on the lien under the non recourse debt would not result in a breach of a representation  warranty  covenant  cross default or acceleration under the company s senior credit facility

step compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount  goodwill would be considered impaired and step measures the goodwill impairment as the excess of recorded goodwill over its implied fair value 
the company tests impairment on an annual basis or when specific triggering events occur 
recoverability and realization of tangible assets the company continually evaluates whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate that its long lived tangible assets may not be recoverable 
when factors indicate that assets should be evaluated for possible impairment  the company uses an estimate of the related undiscounted future cash flows over the remaining lives of assets in measuring whether or not impairment has occurred 
if impairment is identified  a loss would be reported to the extent that the carrying value of the related assets exceeds the fair value of those assets as determined by valuation techniques available in the circumstances

general risks associated with the company if the company is unable to consummate additional acquisitions or investments  it may not be able to successfully implement its growth strategy 
the company s growth strategy is based on the company expanding through selective acquisitions of and investments in rail properties  both in new regions and in regions in which the company currently operates 
the success of the company s growth strategy will depend on  among other things the availability of suitable candidates  the level of competition from other companies for the purchase of available candidates  the company s ability to value those candidates accurately and negotiate favorable terms for those acquisitions and investments  the company s ability to identify and enter into mutually beneficial relationships with venture partners  and the availability of management resources to oversee the integration and operation of the acquired businesses 
if the company is not successful in implementing its growth strategy  the market price for the company s class a common stock may be adversely affected 
the company s inability to integrate acquired businesses successfully or to realize the anticipated cost savings and other benefits could have adverse consequences to the company s business 
the company has experienced significant growth through acquisitions and the company expects to continue to grow through additional acquisitions 
acquisitions generally result in increased operating and administrative costs and  to the extent financed with debt  additional interest costs 
the company may not be able to manage or integrate the acquired companies or businesses successfully 
the process of combining acquired businesses may be disruptive to the company s business and may cause an interruption or reduction of the company s business as a result of the following factors  among others loss of key employees or customers  possible inconsistencies in or conflicts between standards  controls  procedures and policies among the combined companies and the need to implement company wide financial  accounting  information technology and other systems  failure to maintain the quality of services that the companies have historically provided  integrating employees of rail lines acquired from class i railroads  governments or other entities into the company s regional railroad culture  failure to coordinate geographically diverse organizations  and the diversion of management s attention from the company s day to day business as a result of the need to manage any disruptions and difficulties and the need to add management resources to do so 
these disruptions and difficulties  if they occur  may cause the company to fail to realize the cost savings  revenue enhancements and other benefits that the company expects to result from integrating acquired companies  and may cause material adverse short and long term effects on the company s operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
even if the company is able to integrate the operations of acquired businesses into its operations  the company may not realize the full benefits of the cost savings  revenue enhancements or other benefits that it may have expected at the time of acquisition 
the expected revenue enhancements and cost savings are based on analyses completed by members of the company s management 
these analyses necessarily involve assumptions as to future events  including general business and industry conditions  operating costs and competitive factors  many of which are beyond the company s control and may not materialize 
while the company believes these analyses and their underlying assumptions to be reasonable  they are estimates which are necessarily speculative in nature 
in addition  even if the company achieves the expected benefits  it may not be able to achieve them within the anticipated time frame 
also  the cost savings and other synergies from these acquisitions may be offset by costs incurred in integrating the companies  increases in other expenses  operating losses or problems in the business unrelated to these acquisitions

table of contents because the company depends on class i railroads and other connecting carriers for its north american operations  the company s operating results  financial condition and liquidity may be adversely affected if the company s relationships with these carriers deteriorate 
the railroad industry in the us and canada is dominated by class i carriers that have substantial market control and negotiating leverage 
almost all of the traffic on the company s us and canadian railroads is interchanged with class i carriers 
a decision by any of these class i carriers to use alternate modes of transportation  such as motor carriers  could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
the company s ability to provide rail service to customers in the us and canada depends in large part upon the company s ability to maintain cooperative relationships with connecting carriers with respect to  among other matters  freight rates  revenue divisions  car supply  reciprocal switching  interchange and trackage rights 
a deterioration in the operations of  or service provided by  those connecting carriers  or in the company s relationship with those connecting carriers  would adversely affect the company s operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
in addition  much of the freight transported by its us and canadian railroads moves on railcars supplied by class i carriers 
if the number of railcars supplied by class i carriers is insufficient  the company might not be able to obtain replacement railcars on favorable terms or at all and shippers may seek alternate forms of transportation 
portions of the company s us and canadian rail properties are operated under leases  operating agreements or trackage rights agreements with class i carriers 
failure of the company s railroads to comply with the terms of these leases and agreements in all material respects could result in the loss of operating rights with respect to those rail properties  which would adversely affect the company s operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
class i carriers also have traditionally been significant sources of business for the company  as well as sources of potential acquisition candidates as they divest branch lines to smaller rail operators 
because the company depends on class i carriers for its us and canadian operations  the company s operating results  financial condition and liquidity may be adversely affected if the company s relationships with those carriers deteriorate 
while the majority of the company s mexican revenue originates and terminates on the company s railroad  the company is dependent on its relationship with a connecting carrier for the remainder of its revenue 
to the extent that the company experiences service disruptions with that connecting carrier  the company s ability to serve existing customers and expand its business will suffer 
the company faces competition from numerous sources  including those relating to geography  substitutable products  other types of transportation and other rail operators 
each of the company s railroads is typically the only rail carrier directly serving its customers 
the company s railroads  however  compete directly with other modes of transportation  principally motor carriers and  on some routes  ship  barge and pipeline operators 
the company is also subject to geographic and product competition 
for example  a customer could shift production to a region where the company does not have operations or could substitute one commodity for another commodity that is not transported by rail 
in either case  the company would lose a source of revenue  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
the extent of competition varies significantly among the company s railroads 
competition is based primarily upon the rate charged  the relative costs of substitutable products and the transit time required 
in addition  competition is based on the quality and reliability of the service provided 
because a large majority of the company s freight moves involve interchange with another carrier  the company has only limited control over the price  transit time or quality of such service 
any future improvements or expenditures materially increasing the quality of these alternative modes of transportation in the locations in which the company operates  or legislation granting materially greater latitude for motor carriers with respect to size or weight limitations  could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
in competing for the acquisition of rail properties  the company faces other acquirors that may have greater financial resources 
competition for rail properties is based primarily upon price  and the seller s assessment of the buyer s railroad operating expertise and financing capability 
the company s inability to successfully complete additional acquisitions will adversely affect the implementation of an important part of its growth strategy 
the company is subject to significant governmental regulation of its railroad operations 
the failure to comply with governmental regulations could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
the company is subject to governmental regulation in the us by a significant number of federal  state and local regulatory authorities  including the stb  the federal railroad administration and state departments of transportation  with respect to the company s railroad operations and a variety of health  safety  labor  environmental and other matters 
the company is also subject to regulatory authorities in the other countries in which it operates 
the company s failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
in addition  governments may change the regulatory framework within which the company operates without providing the company with any recourse for any adverse effects that the change may have on the company s operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
also  some of the regulations require the company to obtain and maintain various licenses  permits and other authorizations  and the company may not continue to be able to do so

table of contents the company could incur significant costs for violations of  or liability under  environmental laws and regulations 
the company s railroad operations and real estate ownership are subject to extensive foreign  federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations concerning  among other things  emissions to the air  discharges to waters  and the handling  storage  transportation and disposal of waste and other materials and cleanup of hazardous material or petroleum releases 
environmental liability to the company may arise from conditions or practices at properties previously owned or operated by the company  properties leased by the company  and other properties owned by third parties for example  properties at which hazardous substances or wastes for which the company is responsible have been treated  stored  spilled or disposed of  as well as at properties currently owned by the company 
under some environmental statutes  such liability may be without regard to whether the company was at fault  and may also be joint and several  whereby the company is responsible for all the liability at issue even though the company or the entity that gives rise to the company s liability was only one of a number of entities whose conduct contributed to the liability 
environmental liabilities may arise from claims asserted by owners or occupants of affected properties or other third parties affected by environmental conditions for example  contractors and current or former employees seeking to recover in connection with alleged damages to their property or with personal injury or death  as well as by governmental authorities seeking to remedy environmental conditions or to enforce environmental obligations 
environmental requirements and liabilities could obligate the company to incur significant costs  including significant expenses to investigate and remediate environmental contamination  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
some of the company s employees belong to labor unions  and strikes or work stoppages could adversely affect the company s operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
the company is a party to collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions in the united states  mexico  australia  canada  and bolivia 
in north america  the company is a party to twenty nine contracts with national labor organizations which have renewal dates ranging to the company is currently engaged in negotiations with respect to six of those agreements 
in south australia  arg has one collective bargaining agreement that expires in september arg is close to reaching agreement on a collective enterprise bargaining agreement covering the majority of western australian employees 
the company s inability to negotiate acceptable contracts with these unions could result in  among other things  strikes  work stoppages or other slowdowns by the affected workers 
if the unionized workers were to engage in a strike  work stoppage or other slowdown  or other employees were to become unionized or the terms and conditions in future labor agreements were renegotiated  the company could experience a significant disruption of its operations and or higher ongoing labor costs  which in either case could materially adversely affect the company s operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
the company is also subject to the risk of the unionization of its non unionized employees which could result in higher employee compensation and restrictive working condition demands that could increase the company s operating costs or constrain its operating flexibility 
in addition  work interruptions may be threatened which could cause cessation of operations with a corresponding adverse financial impact 
the company may be unable to employ a sufficient number of skilled workers 
the company believes that its success depends upon its ability to employ and retain skilled workers that posses the ability to operate and maintain the company s equipment and facilities 
the operation and maintenance of the company s equipment and facilities involve complex and specialized processes and often must be performed in harsh conditions 
in addition  the company s ability to expand its operations depends in part on its ability to increase its skilled labor force 
the demand for workers with these types of skills has recently become high  especially by class i railroads that can usually offer higher wages and better benefits  and the supply is limited 
moreover  a large portion of the company s current skilled workers will become retirement eligible over the next few years 
a significant increase in the wages paid by competing employers could result in a reduction of the company s skilled labor force  increases in the wage rates that the company must pay or both 
if either of these events were to occur  the company s cost structure could increase  the company s margins could decrease and the company s growth potential could be impaired  each of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
the company may face liability for casualty losses which is not covered by insurance 
the company has obtained for each of its railroads insurance coverage for losses arising from personal injury and for property damage in the event of derailments or other accidents or occurrences 
unexpected or catastrophic circumstances such as accidents involving passenger trains or spillage of hazardous materials could cause the company s liability to exceed its insurance limits 
insurance is available from only a very limited number of insurers and the company may not be able to obtain insurance protection at its current levels or obtain it on terms acceptable to the company 
in addition  subsequent adverse events directly and indirectly applicable to the company may result in additional increases in the company s insurance premiums and or its self insured retentions and could result in limitations to the coverage under its existing policies 
the occurrence of losses or other liabilities which are not covered by insurance or which exceed the company s insurance limits could materially adversely affect the company s operating results  financial condition and liquidity

table of contents rising fuel costs could materially adversely affect company s operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
fuel costs constitute a significant portion of the company s total operating expenses 
fuel costs were approximately of the company s operating expenses for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  fuel costs were approximately of arg s operating expenses for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  fuel prices and supplies are influenced significantly by factors beyond the company s and arg s control  such as international political and economic circumstances 
if diesel fuel prices increase dramatically or if a fuel supply shortage were to arise from production curtailments  a disruption of oil imports or otherwise  these events could have a material adverse effect on the company s and arg s operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
the loss of important customers or contracts may adversely affect the company s operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
in north america  the ten largest customers accounted for approximately  and of the company s operating revenues in  and  respectively 
in  and  the company s largest customer was a coal fired electricity generating plant which accounted for approximately  and respectively  of the company s operating revenues 
arg s ten largest customers accounted for approximately  and of its operating revenues in  and  respectively 
in  and  arg s largest customer was awb limited which accounted for approximately  and respectively  of arg s operating revenues 
the loss of one or more of the company s or arg s largest customers or the loss or material modification of one or more key contracts with such customers could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
the company s results of operations are susceptible to downturns in the general economy as well as to severe weather conditions 
in any given year  the company  like other railroads  is susceptible to changes in the economic conditions of the industries and geographic areas that produce and consume the freight the company transports 
in addition  many of the goods and commodities carried by the company experience cyclicality in their demand 
the company s results of operations can be expected to reflect this cyclicality because of the significant fixed costs inherent in railroad operations 
should an economic slowdown or recession occur in north america or in the other countries in which the company operates  the volume of rail shipments carried by the company is likely to be affected 
in addition to the inherent risks of the business cycle  the company is occasionally susceptible to adverse weather conditions 
for example arg s grain revenue may be reduced by drought drought conditions during the growing season resulted in a significant reduction in arg s grain shipments in  the company s coal revenue may be reduced by cold summers and warm winters  which lessen electricity demand  and the company s minerals and stone revenue  which includes salt  may be reduced by snow free and ice free winters in the northeastern united states  which lessens demand for road salt 
bad weather and natural disasters  such as blizzards in eastern canada and the northeastern united states and hurricanes in mexico  could also cause a shutdown or substantial disruption of operations which  in turn  could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
material adverse weather may not directly affect the company s operations but rather the operations of its customers or connecting carriers 
such weather conditions could reduce or suspend their operations  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s results  financial conditions and liquidity 
furthermore  the company s expenses could be adversely impacted by weather  including as a result of higher track maintenance and overtime costs in the winter in the company s new york pennsylvania and canada regions as well as by possible track washouts in mexico during the rainy season 
the development of some of the company s business could be hindered if it fails to maintain satisfactory working relationships with partners 
some of the company s operations are conducted through joint ventures  in which the company owns a significant  but less than a controlling  ownership interest 
in particular  the company owns a interest in arg and a interest in its bolivian operations 
in these operations  the company does not have absolute control over the operations of the venture 
the particular corporate governance provisions affecting the company s interests vary from venture to venture  but in general  the company must obtain the cooperation of its partners in order to implement and expand upon its business strategies 
any failure to maintain satisfactory working relationships with these partners or the need to expend significant management resources and time to align the company s interests with the interests of these partners could result in a material adverse effect on the company s operating results  financial condition and liquidity

table of contents additional risks associated with the company s foreign operations the company is subject to the risks of doing business in foreign countries 
some of the company s significant subsidiaries transact business in foreign countries  namely in canada and mexico  and the company has equity investments in australia and bolivia 
in addition  the company may consider acquisitions in other foreign countries in the future 
the risks of doing business in foreign countries include adverse renegotiation or modification of existing agreements or arrangements with governmental authorities  adverse changes or greater volatility in the economies of those countries  adverse effects of currency exchange controls  adverse changes to the regulatory environment of those countries  adverse changes to the tax laws and regulations of those countries  restrictions on the withdrawal of foreign investment and earnings  the nationalization of the businesses that the company operates  the actual or perceived failure by the company to fulfill commitments under concession agreements  the potential instability of foreign governments  including from domestic insurgency  and the challenge of managing a culturally and geographically diverse operation 
because some of the company s significant subsidiaries transact business in foreign currencies  and because a significant portion of the company s net income comes from the operations of its foreign subsidiaries  future exchange rate fluctuations may adversely affect the company s operating results  financial condition and liquidity and may affect the comparability of the company s results between financial periods 
the company s operations in mexico and canada accounted for and of consolidated revenues and arg accounting for of consolidated net income for the year ended december  the results of operations of the company s foreign operations are reported in the local currency the australian dollar  the canadian dollar and the mexican peso and then translated into us dollars at the applicable exchange rates for inclusion in the company s consolidated financial statements 
the functional currency of the company s bolivian operations is the us dollar 
the exchange rates between these currencies and the us dollar have fluctuated significantly in recent years and may continue to do so in the future 
in addition  because the company s financial statements are stated in us dollars  such fluctuations may affect the company s results of operations and financial position and may affect the comparability of the company s results between financial periods 
the company may not be able to effectively manage its exchange rate risks and the volatility in currency exchange rates may have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
failure to meet concession commitments with respect to operations of the company s rail lines could result in the loss of the company s investment and a related loss of revenues 
the company has entered into long term concession and or lease agreements with governmental authorities in mexico  bolivia  south australia and western australia 
these concession and lease agreements are subject to a number of conditions  including those relating to the maintenance of certain standards with respect to safety  service  price and the environment 
these concession and lease agreements also typically carry with them a commitment to maintain the condition of the railroad and to make a certain level of capital expenditures 
the company s failure to meet these commitments under the long term concession and lease agreements could result in the loss of those concession or lease agreements 
the loss of any concession or lease agreement could result in the loss of the company s entire investment relating to that concession or lease agreement and the related revenues and income 
australia s open access regime could lead to additional competition for arg s business and decreased revenues and profit margins 
australia s open access regime could lead to additional competition for arg s business  which could result in decreased revenues and profit margins 
the legislative and regulatory framework in australia allows third party rail operators to gain access to arg s railway infrastructure  and in turn governs arg s access to track owned by others 
arg currently operates on the commonwealth owned interstate network from sydney  new south wales and melbourne  victoria to kalgoorlie  western australia and on state owned track in new south wales 
access charges are paid for access onto the track of other companies  and access charges under state and federal regimes continue to evolve because privatization of railways in australia is recent 
where arg pays access fees to others  if those fees are increased  arg s operating margins could be negatively affected 
in addition  if the federal government or respective state regulators were to alter a regulatory regime or determine that access fees charged to current or prospective third party rail freight operators by arg in western australia or south australia do not meet competitive standards  then arg s income from those fees could be negatively affected 
genesee wyoming inc form k 
table of contents when arg operates over track networks owned by others  including commonwealth owned and state owned networks  the owners of the network rather than the operators are responsible for scheduling the use of the tracks as well as for determining the amount and timing of the expenditures necessary to maintain the network in satisfactory condition 
therefore  in areas where arg operates over tracks owned by others  it is subject to train scheduling set by the owners as well as the risk that the network is not adequately maintained 
either risk could affect arg s operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
arg may be adversely affected by unfavorable conditions in the australian agricultural industry because a substantial portion of arg s railroad traffic consists of agricultural commodities 
arg derives a significant portion of its rail freight revenues from shipments of grain 
for the years ended december   and  grain shipments in south australia and western australia generated approximately  and  respectively  of arg s operating revenues 
a decrease in grain shipments as a result of adverse weather or other negative agricultural conditions could have a material adverse effect on arg s operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
for example  drought conditions during the growing season resulted in a significant reduction in arg s grain shipments in arg may be subject to significant additional expenditures in order to comply with commonwealth and or state regulations 
in addition to the open access requirements described above  other aspects of rail operation are regulated  safety in particular  on both a commonwealth and a state by state basis 
arg has received safety regulatory approval to operate on commonwealth owned track  in the northern territory and in all states except queensland and tasmania 
changes in safety regulations or other regulations or the imposition of new regulations or conflicts among state and or commonwealth regulations could require arg to make significant expenditures and to incur significant expenses in order to comply with these regulations

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company actively monitors its exposure to interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate risks and uses derivative financial instruments to manage the impact of certain of these risks 
the company uses derivatives only for purposes of managing risk associated with underlying exposures 
the company does not trade or use instruments with the objective of earning financial gains on the interest rate or exchange rate fluctuations alone  nor does it use instruments where there are not underlying cash exposures
