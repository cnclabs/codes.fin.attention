the variety of services offered at the hotel 
rooms equipped with the company s digital system generate higher revenue than rooms equipped with the company s tape based system primarily because they offer a greater variety of services and content choices

seasonality the company s quarterly operating results are subject to fluctuation depending upon hotel occupancy rates and other factors 
typically  occupancy rates are higher during the second and third quarters due to seasonal travel patterns 
business risks dependence on performance of lodging industry 
the company s business is closely connected to the performance of the hotel industry where occupancy rates may fluctuate resulting from various factors 
reduction in hotel occupancy resulting from business  economic  or other events  such as hostilities in the middle east  other significant international crises  acts of terrorism  public health issues  or catastrophic events could adversely impact the company s results of operations 
the overall travel industry has been adversely affected by the weaker general economic climate 
occupancy rates of the properties served by the company during were basis points below the level experienced in while the average occupancy rate for the company s served hotels is typically higher than the average of the entire lodging industry  the company s business is clearly linked to the continued effects of changes in occupancy levels 
occupancy rates have been below the level experienced in and prior years 
if hotel occupancy rates were to decline significantly below current levels  the company s revenues would be adversely affected 
lodgenet entertainment corporation form k 
table of contents to help mitigate the impact of occupancy levels on operating income  the company continues to control operating expenses and capital spending 
the company plans to reassess its operating and capital expenditure plans periodically to respond to changes in the economic environment 
additionally  the company s room base is geographically diversified  with more than two thirds of properties served being in highway or suburban locations 
less than of the room base is concentrated in each of the top ten urban areas of the united states 
by serving a wide variety of geographically dispersed properties  the company mitigates reliance on any one geographic sector 
technological developments  developmental difficulties and delays 
the company s success depends on new product development 
the entertainment and communications industry is ever changing as new technologies are introduced 
technological advances may result in an adverse competitive situation for the company 
while the company mitigates risks by continually designing  engineering  and developing products and systems that can be upgraded to support new services or integrated with new technologies as they become economically viable  there can be no assurance that the company will continue to be successful in these efforts 
new technologies  including the expansion of digital distribution in our markets  may fundamentally change the method and cost of distributing content 
this may increase competition and result in a decrease in our revenue 
in addition  the company may experience difficulties and delays in developing new products and systems or in integrating the company s system with new technologies 
the company may have to incur significant capital expenditures in order to adapt to technological changes 
relationships with clients and property owners 
the company believes that its interactive hotel base is well diversified in terms of i location  ii demographics  and iii customer contracts 
the company provides its services to various corporate managed hotel chains such as baymont inns suites  delta hotels  doubletree  embassy suites  grand casinos  hampton inn  harrah s  hilton  homewood suites  laquinta  omni hotels  outrigger  red roof inn  ritz carlton  sheraton and wingate inn  plus major reits and management companies such as felcor  flagstone  interstate  kimpton  prime  westcoast hospitality  as well as many independent properties using the fairmont  holiday inn  inter continental  marriott  courtyard by marriott  prince  radisson  w hotel  westin and other trade names 
the company relies on its diverse hotel base and geographic diversity to mitigate these exposures  as well as the fact that the company s services are provided under long term contracts  nevertheless  the company s success depends on maintaining good relationships with the clients and property owners it serves 
during  hotels covered by the master services agreement with the hilton hotels corporation represented approximately of the company s consolidated revenue and at december  approximately of the company s total rooms served 
the loss of this customer  or any group of customers could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations and financial condition 
programming availability and quality 
the company depends upon major motion picture studios for its major motion picture programming content 
the company obtains non exclusive rights to recently released major motion pictures from motion picture studios pursuant to agreements with each studio 
the quality and popularity of the major motion pictures available at any given time and from year to year can vary widely 
generally the more popular titles at the box office will also be more popular with hotel guests 
the company also obtains independent films  most of which are non rated and intended for mature audiences  from distributors and studios 
the company provides music services through an agreement with a third party vendor 
the company provides nintendo video game services through an agreement with nintendo 
the company s success depends upon its ability to provide content that hotel guests are willing to pay to view 
however  the company cannot predict the future popularity or quality of the movies  music  games or other content that the company provides or may provide in the future 
if  for any reason  such content became less popular than it is currently or if any negative publicity  lawsuits  or boycotts by opponents of the mature themed programming content distributed by the company had a negative impact on the willingness of the hotel industry generally to offer such content to guests  then such events could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
in addition  if any significant portion of the content the company provides to hotel guests were to become unavailable  for reasons which could include licensing difficulties  governmental regulation or issues of community standards  the company s business could be adversely impacted 
additionally  the company is dependent on others for its programming content  and increases in its costs or license fees to obtain such programming could reduce its cash flow and profitability 
availability of capital to finance growth 
the company believes that its operating cash flows and funding availability under its credit facility will be sufficient to fund the company s future growth  its financing obligations  and lodgenet entertainment corporation form k 
table of contents its negative working capital 
if however  operating cash flows are significantly below the amount anticipated in its current business plan  the company expects to cover the short fall through any combination of additional borrowings available under its credit facility  a reduction in capital spending  and or a reduction in operating expenses 
if the company were to reduce its projected capital spending significantly  the company s growth would be adversely affected 
while the company is currently in compliance with all of the covenants in its credit facility  and believes its business plan allows it to remain in compliance  if the lodging industry were to suffer a dramatic decrease in occupancy rates  due to an extraordinary event such as war or acts of terrorism  the resulting impact on the company s business could result in a violation of one or more financial covenants 
while the company believes it could renegotiate its bank covenants  there is no assurance that this could be accomplished  nor can it determine at this time the financial cost of such a renegotiation  or that refinancing  if required would be available on terms favorable to the company
