critical accounting estimates and judgments the consolidated financial statements include amounts based on informed estimates and judgments of management for those transactions that are not yet complete 
such estimates and judgments affect the reported amounts in the financial statements 
those estimates and judgments that were most critical to the preparation of the financial statements involved the adequacy of loss reserves and the recoverability of related reinsurance recoverables  the fair value of future obligations under financial products contracts and the recoverability of the carrying value of real estate properties 
these estimates and judgments  which are discussed within the following analysis of our results of operations  require the use of assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain and therefore are subject to change as facts and circumstances develop

this summary should be read in conjunction with the other sections of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
net income was million in compared with million in and million in the fundamentals of our property and casualty insurance business are strong 
premium growth was in and in rate increases have been substantial in recent years  often with more favorable policy terms and conditions 
our underwriting results in the past three years were adversely affected by losses related to asbestos and toxic waste claims  the september  attack in the united states and surety losses arising from the bankruptcy of enron corp 
asbestos and toxic waste losses were million in  million in and million in results in were adversely affected by net costs of million related to the september attack 
results in were adversely affected by net surety losses of million related to enron 
results in and benefited from reductions in net surety losses related to enron of million and million  respectively 
our combined loss and expense ratio  as adjusted to exclude the effects of asbestos and toxic waste losses  the september attack and the enron surety losses and related benefits  was in compared with in and in during  we experienced overall unfavorable development of million on loss reserves established as of the previous year end  due primarily to two factors 
we strengthened asbestos loss reserves by million in the fourth quarter 
we experienced unfavorable development of about million in our executive protection classes  principally directors and officers liability and errors and omissions liability  as adverse loss trends in recent accident years related to corporate failures and allegations of management misconduct and accounting irregularities more than offset favorable loss experience in older accident years 
property and casualty investment income after taxes increased by in compared with growth of in the non insurance business of chubb financial solutions cfs produced a loss before taxes of million in compared with a loss of million in and income of million in as announced in april  we are exiting this business and are running off the financial products portfolio of cfs 
we reduced our aggregate notional exposure by billion during to approximately billion at year end 
because of substantially improved results in chubb europe throughout  we eliminated a million tax valuation allowance in the fourth quarter that was established in the fourth quarter of we began expensing the cost of stock options in  which resulted in a reduction in net income of million 
a summary of our results is as follows years ended december in millions property and casualty insurance underwriting net premiums written increase in unearned premiums premiums earned losses and loss expenses operating costs and expenses increase in deferred policy acquisition costs dividends to policyholders underwriting income loss investments investment income before expenses investment expenses investment income other charges property and casualty income loss chubb financial solutions non insurance business corporate and other realized investment gains consolidated income loss before income tax federal and foreign income tax credit consolidated net income property and casualty investment income after income tax net income included realized investment gains after taxes of million in  million in and million in decisions to sell securities are governed principally by considerations of investment opportunities and tax consequences 
as a result  realized gains and losses on the sale of investments may vary significantly from period to period 
property and casualty insurance results our property and casualty business produced income before taxes of  million in compared with income of million in and a loss of million in asbestos and toxic waste losses  costs related to the september attack and enron related surety losses and related benefits are significant components in understanding and assessing our financial performance 
however  these items  which are discussed below  had a distorting effect on our results 
the following summary adjusts our reported property and casualty income or loss before taxes to exclude the impact of these items 
in millions property and casualty income loss before tax  as reported asbestos and toxic waste losses net costs related to the september attack surety bond losses benefit related to enron property and casualty income before tax  as adjusted as adjusted  property and casualty earnings in were significantly higher than in the prior two years due primarily to a substantial improvement in underwriting results 
earnings in also benefited from a significant increase in investment income 
the profitability of the property and casualty insurance business depends on the results of both underwriting operations and investments  which we view as two distinctive operations 
the underwriting functions are managed separately from the investment function 
accordingly  in assessing our performance  we evaluate underwriting results separately from investment results 
underwriting results we evaluate the underwriting results of our property and casualty insurance business in the aggregate and also for each of our three separate business units personal insurance  commercial insurance and specialty insurance 
the combined loss and expense ratio  expressed as a percentage  is the key measure of underwriting profitability traditionally used in the property and casualty business 
we evaluate the performance of our underwriting operations and of each of our business units using the combined loss and expense ratio calculated in accordance with statutory accounting principles 
it is the sum of the ratio of losses to premiums earned loss ratio plus the ratio of underwriting expenses to premiums written expense ratio after reducing both premium amounts by dividends to policyholders 
when the combined ratio is under  underwriting results are generally considered profitable  when the combined ratio is over  underwriting results are generally considered unprofitable 
statutory accounting principles differ in certain respects from generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
under statutory accounting principles applicable to property and casualty insurance companies  policy acquisition and other underwriting expenses are recognized immediately  not at the time premiums are earned 
we use underwriting results determined in accordance with gaap  among other measures  to assess the overall performance of the underwriting operations 
to convert underwriting results to a gaap basis  policy acquisition expenses are deferred and amortized over the period in which the related premiums are earned 
underwriting income loss determined in accordance with gaap is defined as premiums earned less losses incurred and gaap underwriting expenses incurred 
net premiums written net premiums written amounted to billion in  an increase of over net premiums written increased in compared with premiums written in included net reinsurance reinstatement premium revenue of million related to the september attack 
about of our net premiums written are in the united states 
premium growth in the us was in and in substantial premium growth was also achieved outside the united states in and reported non us premiums grew in and in in local currencies  such premiums grew and in and  respectively 
net premiums written by business unit were as follows years ended december in millions personal insurance automobile homeowners other total personal commercial insurance multiple peril casualty workers compensation property and marine total commercial specialty insurance executive protection financial institutions other total specialty total premium growth in and in all segments of our business was due primarily to higher rates 
premium growth was particularly strong in the commercial and specialty classes 
premium growth in our other specialty insurance business was primarily from chubb re  our reinsurance business that began operations in in the wake of heavy insurance industry losses in recent years  exacerbated by the tragic event of september   many insurance companies sought substantial price increases  raised deductibles  reduced coverage limits or declined outright to renew coverage 
in this environment  we have taken advantage of the opportunities to write new business and have retained more of our existing accounts 
during  we experienced substantial rate increases on business we wrote  often with more favorable policy terms and conditions 
in  we continued to get rate increases on much of the business we wrote  although the size of such increases decelerated throughout the year 
we expect that rate increases will continue into  although the size of rate increases will continue to decelerate 
reinsurance our premiums written are net of amounts ceded to reinsurers who assume a portion of the risk under the insurance policies that are subject to the reinsurance 
as a result of the substantial losses incurred by reinsurers in recent years  the cost of reinsurance in the marketplace has increased significantly and reinsurance capacity for certain coverages  such as terrorism  is limited and expensive 
in  we did not renew a workers compensation catastrophe treaty that had substantially reduced our net losses from the september attack because the terms and price that were offered were uneconomical 
our property reinsurance program renews each april 
the renewal of the property per risk treaty and property catastrophe treaties in the aggregate cost approximately million more on an annualized basis  with more restrictive terms  including terrorism exclusions 
our property per risk retention increased from million to million 
our catastrophe treaty for events in the united states was modified to increase our initial retention  to increase the reinsurance coverage at the top and to reduce our participation in certain layers of the program 
our reinsurance program was similar to that in reinsurance costs increased in line with the higher premiums on the policies reinsured 
we discontinued some lower limit treaties that we believed were no longer economical and increased our participation in certain layers of the treaties renewed 
our property catastrophe treaty for events in the united states was again modified in to increase the reinsurance coverage at the top due to our increased exposure in certain catastrophe exposed areas 
the program now provides coverage for individual catastrophe events of approximately of losses between million and million  with additional coverage above million that varies depending on geographic location 
it is expected that reinsurance costs will increase in in line with the higher premiums on the policies reinsured 
in january  we discontinued a casualty per risk treaty that responded primarily to excess liability exposures over million  due to a reduction in the number of such exposures that we believed made this treaty no longer economical 
our executive protection per risk treaty was renewed on terms similar to the prior year  except our initial deductible on directors and officers liability losses was increased 
profitability underwriting results in  and were adversely affected by incurred losses of million  million and million  respectively  related to asbestos and toxic waste claims 
underwriting results in were adversely affected by net costs of million related to the september attack and enron related surety losses of million 
results in and benefited from reductions in surety losses related to enron of million and million  respectively 
the combined loss and expense ratio  as reported and as adjusted to exclude the effects of the asbestos and toxic waste losses  the september attack and the enron surety losses and related benefits  was as follows years ended december as reported loss ratio expense ratio combined ratio as adjusted loss ratio expense ratio combined ratio the loss ratio  as adjusted  improved in despite higher catastrophe losses  reflecting the favorable experience resulting from our disciplined underwriting standards in recent years 
losses from catastrophes other than the september attack were million in which represented percentage points of the loss ratio compared with million or percentage points in and million or percentage points in other than reinsurance recoveries related to the september attack  we did not have any recoveries from our catastrophe reinsurance program during the three year period since there were no other individual catastrophes for which our losses exceeded the initial retention 
our initial retention level for each catastrophic event in the united states was increased from million to million during our initial retention is generally million outside the united states 
our expense ratio decreased in and again in due in large part to premiums written growing at a substantially higher rate than overhead expenses 
the improvement in was achieved despite an approximate of a percentage point adverse impact of expensing stock options 
asbestos and toxic waste losses 
in october  our actuaries and claim personnel together with our outside actuarial consultants completed their periodic ground up exposure based analysis of our asbestos related liabilities 
upon completion of the analysis and assessment of the results  we increased our net loss reserves by million in the third quarter 
in the fourth quarter of  we reduced our previous estimate of reinsurance recoverable on potential asbestos claims  resulting in an additional increase in our net loss reserves of million 
prior to the completion of the analysis  we had incurred asbestos and toxic waste net losses of million in the first half of and million during all of in the fourth quarter of  our actuaries and claim personnel together with our outside actuarial consultants performed a rigorous update of the ground up analysis of our asbestos related liabilities 
upon completion of the update  we increased our net loss reserves by an additional million 
our asbestos and toxic waste exposure is further discussed under loss reserves 
enron related surety losses 
our surety losses arising from the enron bankruptcy relate to bonds issued to various obligees in connection with enron commitments 
although certain of these surety bonds were the subject of litigation  we recognized our maximum exposure of million  net of reinsurance  in the fourth quarter of as of the end of  the litigation was settled  resulting in an million reduction in our surety net loss reserves 
results in benefited from a million recovery from the sale of a bankruptcy claim against various enron entities 
september attack 
the pre tax costs of million related to the september attack had three components 
first  in our insurance business  we incurred estimated net losses and loss expenses of million plus reinsurance reinstatement costs of million  for an aggregate cost of million 
each of our underwriting segments was affected by the september attack 
however  the impact was by far the greatest on our financial institutions business 
second  in our reinsurance business written through chubb re  we incurred estimated net losses and loss expenses of million and recognized reinstatement premium revenue of million  for a net cost of million 
finally  we recorded a million charge  included in other charges  as our share of the losses publicly estimated by hiscox plc  a uk insurer in which we had a interest during we estimate that our gross losses and loss expenses from the september attack were about billion 
most of the losses were from property exposure and business interruption losses 
we also had significant workers compensation losses 
our net losses and loss expenses of million were significantly lower than the gross amount due to various reinsurance agreements 
our property exposures were protected by facultative reinsurance  property per risk treaties that limited our net loss per risk  and our property catastrophe treaties 
our workers compensation losses were protected by a casualty catastrophe treaty and a casualty clash treaty that operates like a catastrophe treaty 
certain of our reinsurers questioned our interpretation and or application of some provisions of our property per risk reinsurance agreements with regard to the september losses 
the questions raised generally involved the applicable limit of reinsurance coverage available to us  the definition of what constitutes one risk  our accumulation of exposure in the various buildings destroyed or damaged and our adherence to our underwriting guidelines 
during  we resolved all of the questions that had been raised by our property per risk reinsurers 
that resolution will result in our collecting an amount of reinsurance that confirms our estimate of net costs of million related to the september attack 
it is possible that our estimate of ultimate losses related to the september attack may change in the future  and that the change in estimate could have a material effect on the corporation s results of operations 
however  we do not expect that any such change would have a material effect on the corporation s financial condition or liquidity 
review of underwriting results by business unit personal insurance net premiums from personal insurance  which represent of the premiums written by our property and casualty subsidiaries  increased by in compared with a increase in in both years  premium growth occurred in all classes 
premium growth was particularly significant in our homeowners business due primarily to higher rates and increased insurance to value 
homeowners premiums were up and in and  respectively  while the in force policy count remained flat in after being up slightly in our personal insurance business produced modestly profitable underwriting results in and compared with slightly unprofitable results in results in included net costs of million related to the september attack 
the combined loss and expense ratios for the classes of business within the personal insurance segment  as reported and as adjusted to exclude the effects of the september attack  were as follows years ended december as reported automobile homeowners other total personal as adjusted automobile homeowners other total personal homeowners results were similarly unprofitable in and as higher catastrophe losses in were offset by a decrease in non catastrophe losses and the impact of improved pricing 
results in benefited from a decline in fire and water damage losses 
results improved in compared with the improvement in was due to a decrease in the frequency of both catastrophe and non catastrophe losses 
results in and were adversely affected by an increase in the severity of water damage claims  including those related to mold  particularly in texas 
losses from catastrophes other than the september attack represented percentage points of the loss ratio for this class in compared with percentage points in and percentage points in homeowners results were modestly profitable in europe in compared with unprofitable results in and we are in the process of exiting our personal lines business in continental europe  with the exception of the ultra high net worth market segment 
our remediation plan relating to our homeowners business in the united states  which began in the latter part of  is on track 
we have made substantial progress in implementing rate increases in states where rates have been deficient 
while the impact of losses related to water damage  including mold  decreased in compared with the prior two years  we remain concerned about the potential for such claims 
we have made regulatory filings in most states to introduce contract changes that would enable us to treat mold as a separate peril available at an appropriate price 
these changes have been implemented in states  including texas  california  florida and new york  and approved in four other states 
our personal automobile business was modestly profitable in each of the last three years 
results in each year benefited from stable loss severity 
other personal coverages  which include insurance for personal valuable articles and excess liability  produced highly profitable results in each of the past three years  as favorable loss experience has continued 
commercial insurance net premiums from commercial insurance  which represent of our total writings  increased by in compared with a increase in the substantial premium growth in both years  which occurred in all segments of this business  was due in large part to significantly higher rates as well as an increase in our in force policy count 
rates increased substantially in and  although the level of rate increases in declined from levels as we experienced more competition in the us marketplace across most lines of business 
despite this  retention levels have remained steady 
new business accelerated toward the end of during  we wrote more than two dollars of new business for every dollar of business we lost  during  this ratio was about to the substantial growth in new business was produced with the same tightened underwriting discipline that existed over the past several years 
we expect that rates will continue to rise but that the level of rate increases will continue to decline 
our commercial insurance results were adversely affected by incurred losses of million in  million in and million in related to asbestos and toxic waste claims 
results in were also adversely affected by net costs of million related to the september attack 
the combined loss and expense ratios for the classes of business within commercial insurance  as reported and as adjusted to exclude the effects of the asbestos and toxic waste losses and the september attack  were as follows years ended december as reported multiple peril casualty workers compensation property and marine total commercial as adjusted multiple peril casualty workers compensation property and marine total commercial on an as adjusted basis  our commercial insurance business produced highly profitable results in and compared with unprofitable results in results  as adjusted  have shown substantial improvement in each succeeding year 
the improvement has been due in large part to the cumulative effect of price increases  better terms and conditions and more stringent risk selection in recent years 
multiple peril results were highly profitable in compared with near breakeven results in the improved results were driven by the property component of this business where incurred losses were flat 
results in showed modest improvement over results  as adjusted  due to highly profitable overseas results 
losses from catastrophes other than the september attack represented percentage points of the loss ratio for this class in compared with percentage points in and percentage points in results for our casualty business  as adjusted  were highly profitable in and compared with unprofitable results in the improvement was due to higher rates and the culling of business where we could not attain price adequacy 
in particular  the automobile component showed substantial improvement  producing highly profitable results in and compared with unprofitable results in results for the primary liability component were profitable in all three years  improving in each succeeding year 
the excess liability component produced near breakeven results in and compared with unprofitable results in workers compensation results were profitable in each of the past three years 
the strong results were due to higher rates as well as our disciplined risk selection during the past several years 
property and marine results were highly profitable in and compared with highly unprofitable results in results in and benefited from improved pricing  higher deductibles  better terms and conditions and a low number of severe losses 
the strong results in were achieved despite a million loss that resulted from an adverse arbitration decision rendered against an insurance pool in which we were formerly a participant 
the decision related to a fire that occurred in results in were adversely affected by a high frequency of large losses  both in the united states and overseas 
losses from catastrophes other than the september attack represented percentage points of the loss ratio for this class in compared with percentage points in and percentage points in specialty insurance net premiums from specialty insurance  which represent of our total writings  increased by in compared with a increase in premiums in included net reinsurance reinstatement premiums of million related to the september attack  primarily consisting of million of premium revenue in our reinsurance business offset in part by costs of million in our financial institutions business 
the growth in and in executive protection and the professional liability component of our financial institutions business was primarily attributable to higher rates 
in response to claim severity trends  we initiated a program in the latter half of to increase pricing and improve policy terms and to not renew business that did not meet our underwriting criteria 
we have implemented tighter terms and conditions  including lower policy limits and higher deductibles 
we have continued to reprofile our book of business  generating most of our new business from small and middle market customers 
rate increases moderated during the latter half of due to increased competition in the marketplace 
in the fidelity and standard commercial components of our financial institutions business  rate increases have begun to moderate as well 
growth in our other specialty insurance business was primarily from chubb re  our reinsurance assumed business 
we write only treaty reinsurance  primarily casualty reinsurance 
premiums produced by chubb re amounted to million in compared with million in and million in  excluding the net reinstatement premium revenue of million 
our specialty insurance results in were adversely affected by net costs of million related to the september attack and enron related surety losses of million 
results in and benefited from reductions in surety losses related to enron of million and million  respectively 
the combined loss and expense ratios for the classes of business within specialty insurance  as reported and as adjusted to exclude the effects of the september attack and the enron surety losses and related benefits  were as follows years ended december as reported executive protection financial institutions other total specialty as adjusted executive protection financial institutions other total specialty our specialty insurance underwriting results  as adjusted  were near breakeven in compared with unprofitable results in and profitable results in executive protection results were unprofitable in and compared with profitable results in results in and were adversely affected by directors and officers liability and errors and omissions liability claim experience  particularly from claims that have arisen due to the corporate failures and allegations of management misconduct and accounting irregularities in recent years 
the improvement in was in our european operations where results in were particularly unprofitable due to deteriorating loss trends caused by an increase in litigation  often involving european companies being sued in us courts for securities fraud 
our financial institutions business produced similarly unprofitable results in and results in  as adjusted  were profitable 
the fidelity component of this business was highly profitable in each of the last three years due to favorable loss experience 
results for the professional liability component were highly unprofitable in and compared with modestly unprofitable results in the deterioration was due to the same adverse directors and officers liability and errors and omissions liability claim trends experienced in our executive protection business 
financial institutions continue to be the focus of scrutiny by regulators and the plaintiffs bar related to investment banking and mutual fund scandals 
the standard commercial business written on financial institutions produced profitable results in all three years  reflecting the rate increases and more stringent risk selection in recent years 
other specialty results  as adjusted  were highly profitable in and compared with near breakeven results in as adjusted  our surety results were highly profitable in each of the past three years 
our reinsurance assumed business generated by chubb re and our accident business were both profitable in and compared with modestly unprofitable results in as a result of disarray in the surety reinsurance market caused by several years of declining prices and high losses  the availability of surety reinsurance in the near term has been significantly reduced 
as a result  our future surety results could be more volatile 
our surety business tends to be characterized by infrequent but potentially high severity losses 
since the end of  we have been reducing our exposure on an absolute basis and by specific bond type 
the majority of our obligations are intended to be performance based guarantees 
when losses occur  they are mitigated by the customer s balance sheet  contract proceeds and bankruptcy recovery 
notwithstanding our efforts to manage and reduce our surety exposure  we continue to have substantial commercial surety exposure for outstanding bonds 
in that regard  we have exposures related to commercial surety bonds issued on behalf of companies that have experienced deterioration in creditworthiness  including several gas forward purchase surety bonds 
we therefore may experience an increase in filed claims and may incur high severity losses 
such losses would be recorded if and when claims are filed and determined to be valid  and could have a material adverse effect on the corporation s results of operations and liquidity 
in particular  we have in force million of gas forward purchase surety bonds with one principal  aquila  inc our exposure under these bonds will decline over the terms of the bonds  which extend until these surety bonds  which are uncollateralized  secure aquila s obligation to supply gas under long term forward purchase agreements 
under the terms of these bonds  our entire obligation to pay could be triggered if aquila failed to provide gas under its forward purchase contracts or was the subject of a bankruptcy filing 
there is currently no reinsurance in place covering our exposure under these bonds 
aquila continues to perform its obligations under the related gas forward purchase agreements 
a property and casualty subsidiary issued a reinsurance contract to an insurer who provides financial guarantees on debt obligations 
at december   the amount of aggregate principal commitments related to this contract was approximately million  net of reinsurance 
these commitments expire by loss reserves loss reserves  which are our property and casualty subsidiaries largest liability  include significant amounts related to asbestos and toxic waste claims  the september attack and our enron surety exposure 
the components of our loss reserves were as follows december in millions gross loss reserves total  per balance sheet less related to asbestos and toxic waste claims related to september attack related to enron surety exposure total  as adjusted reinsurance recoverable total  per balance sheet less related to asbestos and toxic waste claims related to september attack related to enron surety exposure total  as adjusted net loss reserves total total  as adjusted the loss reserves related to asbestos and toxic waste claims  the september attack and our enron surety exposure are significant components of our total loss reserves  but they distort the growth trend in our loss reserves 
adjusted to exclude such loss reserves  our loss reserves  net of reinsurance recoverable  increased by  million or in compared with  million or in net loss reserves  as adjusted  by segment were as follows december in millions personal insurance commercial insurance specialty insurance net loss reserves  as adjusted loss reserves for each of our business segments increased in and again in the increase was most significant in specialty insurance  due in large part to directors and officers and errors and omissions claim activity and the strong growth in our reinsurance assumed business 
there was minimal loss reserve growth in commercial insurance in  reflecting the exposure reductions over the several years prior to loss reserves include estimates for claims that have been reported and claims that have not been reported and include estimates of all expenses associated with settling those claims 
estimates are based upon past claim experience modified for current trends as well as prevailing economic  legal and social conditions 
we continually review and update our loss reserves 
based on all information currently available  we believe that the aggregate loss reserves of the property and casualty subsidiaries at december  were adequate to cover claims for losses that had occurred  including both those known to us and those yet to be reported 
in establishing such reserves  we consider facts currently known and the present state of the law and coverage litigation 
however  given the judicial decisions and legislative actions that have broadened the scope of coverage and expanded theories of liability in the past and the possibilities of similar interpretations in the future  particularly as they relate to asbestos claims and  to a lesser extent  toxic waste claims  additional liabilities may emerge in future periods for amounts in excess of carried reserves 
such increases in estimates could have a material adverse effect on the corporation s future operating results 
however  management does not expect that any such increases would have a material effect on the corporation s consolidated financial condition or liquidity 
prior year loss development because loss reserve estimates are subject to the outcome of future events  changes in estimates are unavoidable given that loss trends vary and time is required for changes in trends to be recognized and confirmed 
as a result  the actual emergence of losses could vary  perhaps substantially  from the estimate of losses included in our financial statements  particularly when settlements may not occur until well into the future 
estimates are continually reviewed and updated as loss experience develops and new information becomes available 
any changes in estimates are reflected in operating results in the period in which the estimates are changed 
reserve changes that increase previous estimates of ultimate cost are referred to as unfavorable or adverse development or reserve strengthening 
reserve changes that decrease previous estimates of ultimate cost are referred to as favorable development or reserve releases 
a reconciliation of the beginning and ending loss reserves  net of reinsurance  for the three years ended december  is as follows in millions net loss reserves  beginning of year net incurred losses and loss expenses related to current year prior years net payments for losses and loss expenses related to current year prior years net loss reserves  end of year during  we experienced overall unfavorable development of million on loss reserves established as of the previous year end 
this compares with unfavorable one year development of million in and favorable development of million in such development was reflected in operating results in these respective years 
the unfavorable development in was due primarily to two factors 
first  we strengthened asbestos loss reserves by million in the fourth quarter 
second  we experienced unfavorable development of about million in our executive protection classes  principally directors and officers liability and errors and omissions liability  as adverse loss trends in recent accident years more than offset favorable loss experience in older accident years 
the adverse development was due in large part to claims related to the corporate failures and allegations of management misconduct and accounting irregularities in recent years 
the unfavorable development in was due primarily to our strengthening asbestos and toxic waste loss reserves by million during the year 
in addition  we experienced unfavorable development of about million in the homeowners class due to the increase in the severity of water damage and related mold claims 
in the executive protection classes  the adverse loss trends in europe and the united states in the more recent accident years more than offset favorable loss experience in the united states in older accident years  resulting in unfavorable development of about million during offsetting the unfavorable development somewhat was the million reduction in surety loss reserves related to the enron settlement 
the favorable development in was due primarily to favorable loss experience in our commercial excess liability and executive protection coverages  offset in part by losses incurred related to asbestos and toxic waste claims 
in item of this report  we present an analysis of our consolidated loss reserve development on a calendar year basis for each of the ten years prior to our us property and casualty subsidiaries are required to file annual statements with insurance regulatory authorities prepared on an accounting basis prescribed or permitted by such authorities 
these annual statements include an analysis of loss reserves  referred to as schedule p  that presents accident year loss development information by line of business for the nine years prior to it is our intention to post the schedule p for our combined us property and casualty subsidiaries on our website as soon as it becomes available 
estimates and uncertainties the process of establishing loss reserves is complex and imprecise as it must take into consideration many variables that are subject to the outcome of future events 
as a result  subjective judgments as to our ultimate exposure to losses are an integral component of our loss reserving process 
we analyze loss reserves in two components reserves relating to all claims other than asbestos and toxic waste claims and reserves relating to asbestos and toxic waste claims 
within the first component  we review each of the numerous classes of business as part of our overall analysis of loss reserves  taking into consideration the variety of trends that impact the ultimate settlement of claims in each particular class of business 
due to the multitude of such classes and the volume of detail for each  it would not be possible to provide complete quantitative actuarial claim data for all such classes  nor do we believe that such disclosure by class of business would be meaningful or useful to the reader 
reserves relating to claims other than asbestos and toxic waste claims 
our loss reserves include amounts related to short tail and long tail classes of business 
short tail classes consist principally of homeowners  commercial property and marine business 
for these classes  the estimation of loss reserves is less complex because claims are generally reported and settled shortly after the loss occurs and the claims relate to tangible property 
long tail classes include directors and officers liability  errors and omissions liability and other executive protection coverages  commercial excess liability  and other liability classes 
most of our loss reserves relate to long tail liability classes of business 
for many liability claims significant periods of time  ranging up to several years or more  may elapse between the occurrence of the loss  the reporting of the loss and the settlement of the claim 
the longer the time span between the incidence of a loss and the settlement of the claim  the more the ultimate settlement amount can vary 
for the long tail liability classes  a relatively small proportion of net losses in the more recent accident years are reported claims and an even smaller proportion are paid losses 
therefore  a relatively large proportion of our net losses for these classes are reserves for incurred but not reported ibnr losses claims that had not yet been reported to us  some of which were not yet known to the insured  and future development on reported claims 
in fact  approximately of our aggregate net loss reserves at december  were for ibnr 
to estimate loss reserves  we use a variety of complex actuarial methods that analyze experience trends and other relevant factors 
these methods generally utilize analyses of historical patterns of the development of paid and reported losses by accident year by class of business 
this process relies on the basic assumption that past experience  adjusted for the effects of current developments and likely trends  is an appropriate basis for predicting future outcomes 
for certain long tail classes of business where anticipated loss experience is less predictable because of the small number of claims and or erratic claim severity patterns  estimates are based on both expected losses and actual reported losses 
these classes include directors and officers liability  errors and omissions liability and commercial excess liability  among others 
for these classes  we judgmentally set ultimate losses for each accident year based on our evaluation of loss trends and the current risk environment 
the expected ultimate losses are adjusted as the accident years mature 
our loss reserve review process does not calculate a range of loss reserve estimates 
using the various complex actuarial methods and different underlying assumptions  management selects the carried reserve for each class of business 
the inherent uncertainty in the process of establishing loss reserves arises from a number of factors 
these factors include but are not limited to changes in the inflation rate for goods and services related to covered damages such as medical care and home repair costs  changes in the judicial environment regarding the interpretation of policy provisions relating to the determination of coverage  changes in the general attitude of juries in the determination of liability and damages  changes in our estimates of the number and or severity of claims that have been incurred but not reported as of the date of the financial statements  changes in our underwriting standards and any changes in our claim handling procedures 
in addition  we must consider the uncertain effects of emerging or potential claims and coverage issues 
these issues can have a negative effect on our loss reserves by either extending coverage beyond the original underwriting intent or by increasing the number or size of claims 
examples of emerging or potential claims and coverage issues include increases in the number and size of water damage claims related to remediation of mold conditions and increases in the number and size of directors and officers liability and errors and omissions liability claims arising out of investment banking practices and accounting and other corporate malfeasance 
as a result of issues such as these  the uncertainties inherent in estimating ultimate claim costs on the basis of past experience have become increasingly unpredictable  further complicating the already complex loss reserving process 
the future impact of these issues and other unforeseen emerging or potential claims and coverage issues is extremely hard to predict and could materially adversely affect the adequacy of our loss reserves 
reserves relating to asbestos and toxic waste claims 
the uncertainties relating to asbestos and toxic waste claims on insurance policies written many years ago are exacerbated by inconsistent court decisions as well as judicial interpretations and legislative actions that in some cases have tended to broaden coverage beyond the original intent of such policies and in others have expanded theories of liability 
the industry as a whole is engaged in extensive litigation over these coverage and liability issues and is thus confronted with a continuing uncertainty in its efforts to quantify these exposures 
reserves for asbestos and toxic waste claims cannot be estimated with traditional actuarial techniques that rely on historical accident year loss development factors 
quantitative techniques have to be supplemented by subjective considerations including management judgment 
it is therefore not possible to determine the future development of asbestos and toxic waste claims with the same degree of reliability as is the case for other types of claims 
such development will be affected by the extent to which courts and legislatures continue to expand the intent of the policies and the scope of the coverage 
we establish case reserves and expense reserves for costs of related litigation where sufficient information has been developed to indicate the involvement of a specific insurance policy 
in addition  ibnr reserves are established to cover additional exposures on both known and unasserted claims 
asbestos reserves 
asbestos remains the most significant and difficult mass tort for the insurance industry in terms of claims volume and dollar exposure 
asbestos claims relate primarily to bodily injuries asserted by those who came in contact with asbestos or products containing asbestos 
early court cases established the continuous trigger theory with respect to insurance coverage 
under this theory  insurance coverage is deemed to be triggered from the time a claimant is first exposed to asbestos until the manifestation of any disease 
this interpretation of a policy trigger can involve insurance companies over many years and increases their exposure to liability 
the plaintiffs bar continues to solicit new claimants through extensive advertising and through asbestos medical screenings 
litigation is then initiated even though many of the claimants do not show any signs of asbestos related disease 
thus  new asbestos claims and new exposures on existing claims have continued unabated despite the fact that usage of asbestos has declined since the mid s 
based on published projections  we expect that we will continue receiving asbestos claims at the current rate for at least the next several years 
to date  approximately manufacturers and distributors of asbestos products have filed for bankruptcy protection as a result of asbestos liabilities 
the rapid increase in both the frequency and severity of claims in recent years accelerated the pace at which these bankruptcies were filed 
our most significant individual asbestos exposures involve product liability on the part of traditional defendants who manufactured  distributed or installed asbestos products 
we wrote excess liability and or general liability coverages for these insureds 
while these insureds are relatively few in number  such exposure has increased in recent years due to the increased volume of claims  the erosion of much of the underlying limits and the bankruptcies of target defendants 
our other asbestos exposures involve product and non product liability on the part of peripheral defendants  including a mix of manufacturers  distributors and installers of certain products that contain asbestos in small quantities and owners of properties on which asbestos exists 
generally  these insureds are named defendants on a regional rather than a nationwide basis 
as the financial resources of traditional asbestos defendants have been depleted  plaintiffs are targeting these viable peripheral parties with greater frequency and  in many cases  for larger awards 
asbestos claims against the major manufacturers  distributors or installers of asbestos products were presented under the products liability section of primary general liability policies as well as under excess liability policies  both of which typically had aggregate limits that capped an insurer s liability 
in recent years  a number of asbestos claims by insureds are being presented as non products claims  such as those by installers of asbestos products and by property owners who allegedly had asbestos on their property  under the premises or operations section of primary general liability policies 
unlike products exposures  these non products exposures typically had no aggregate limits  creating potentially greater exposure 
further  in an effort to seek additional insurance coverage  some insureds with installation activities who have substantially eroded their products coverage are presenting new asbestos claims as non products operations claims or attempting to reclassify previously settled products claims as non products claims to restore a portion of previously exhausted products aggregate limits 
it is difficult to predict whether insureds will be successful in asserting claims under non products coverage or whether insurers will be successful in asserting additional defenses 
therefore  the impact of such efforts on insurers is uncertain 
the expanded focus of asbestos litigation beyond asbestos manufacturers and distributors to installers and premises owners has created  in some instances  conflicts among insureds  primary insurers and excess insurers  mainly involving questions regarding allocation of indemnity and expense costs and exhaustion of policy limits 
these issues are generating costly coverage litigation with the potential for inconsistent results 
in establishing our asbestos reserves  we evaluate the exposure presented by each insured 
as part of this evaluation  we consider the available insurance coverage  limits and deductibles  the jurisdictions involved  past settlement values of similar claims  the potential role of other insurance  particularly underlying coverage below our excess liability policies  and applicable coverage defenses  including asbestos exclusions 
we have assumed a continuing unfavorable legal environment with no benefit from any federal asbestos reform legislation 
a recent proposal  which envisioned a sizable trust funded primarily by defendants and insurers  appears highly unlikely to pass 
in the third quarter of  our actuaries and claim personnel together with our outside actuarial consultants commenced their periodic ground up exposure based analysis of our asbestos related liabilities 
as part of this analysis  they considered the following adverse trends estimates of the ultimate liabilities for traditional asbestos defendants have increased as the number of plaintiff claims has surged over the past few years 
the notable increase in claimants as well as potential future claimants has resulted in large settlements of asbestos related litigation 
as a result  it now appears more likely that many of these traditional defendants will access higher excess layers of insurance coverage as well as more years of coverage than previously anticipated 
claims have been more aggressively pursued against peripheral asbestos defendants in recent years  partly in response to the bankruptcy or exhaustion of insurance coverage for many of the major traditional defendants 
the number of claims filed under the non aggregate premises or operations section of general liability policies has increased  creating potentially greater exposure 
the litigation environment has become increasingly adverse 
more than half of lawsuits filed in recent years have been filed in five plaintiff oriented states  where significant verdicts historically have been rendered against commercial defendants 
the number of asbestos defendants in bankruptcy has increased  resulting in an increase in the number and cost of declaratory judgment lawsuits to resolve coverage disputes and to effect settlements in the bankruptcy courts 
upon completion of the analysis and assessment of the results  we increased our net asbestos loss reserves by million in the third quarter of following a thorough review in the fourth quarter by our internal actuarial  claim and reinsurance personnel  we reduced our estimate of reinsurance recoverable on potential asbestos claims 
as a result  our net asbestos loss reserves increased by an additional million 
in the fourth quarter of  our actuaries and claim personnel together with our outside actuarial consultants performed a rigorous update of their ground up exposure based analysis of our asbestos related liabilities 
the review noted the same adverse trends observed during the analysis  particularly a further increase in estimates of the ultimate liabilities for several of our traditional asbestos defendants 
in addition  the number of insureds for whom we established reserves and the average severity of claims were both higher than anticipated 
upon completion of the update  we increased our net asbestos loss reserves by million 
the following table presents a reconciliation of the beginning and ending loss reserves related to asbestos claims 
years ended december in millions gross loss reserves  beginning of year reinsurance recoverable  beginning of year net loss reserves  beginning of year net incurred losses net losses paid net loss reserves  end of year reinsurance recoverable  end of year gross loss reserves  end of year significant uncertainty remains as to our ultimate liability relating to asbestos related claims 
this uncertainty is due to such factors as the long latency period between asbestos exposure and disease manifestation and the resulting potential for involvement of multiple policy periods for individual claims as well as the increase in the volume of claims by unimpaired plaintiffs and the increase in claims filed under the non aggregate premises or operations section of general liability policies 
there is also the possibility  however remote  of federal legislation that would address the asbestos problem 
toxic waste reserves 
toxic waste claims relate primarily to pollution and related cleanup costs 
our insureds have two potential areas of exposure hazardous waste dump sites and pollution at the insured site primarily from underground storage tanks and manufacturing processes 
under the federal superfund law and similar state statutes  when potentially responsible parties prps fail to handle the clean up at a hazardous waste site  regulators have the work done and then attempt to establish legal liability against the prps 
most sites have multiple prps 
most prps named to date are parties who have been generators  transporters  past or present landowners or past or present site operators 
the prps disposed of toxic materials at a waste dump site or transported the materials to the site 
these prps had proper government authorization in many instances 
insurance policies issued to prps were not intended to cover the clean up costs of pollution and  in many cases  did not intend to cover the pollution itself 
pollution was not a recognized hazard at the time many of these policies were written 
in more recent years  however  policies specifically exclude such exposures 
as the costs of environmental clean up became substantial  prps and others increasingly filed claims with their insurance carriers 
litigation against insurers extends to issues of liability  coverage and other policy provisions 
there is substantial uncertainty involved in estimating our liabilities related to these claims 
first  the liabilities of the claimants are extremely difficult to estimate 
at any given site  the allocation of remediation costs among governmental authorities and the prps varies greatly depending on a variety of factors 
second  different courts have addressed liability and coverage issues regarding pollution claims and have reached inconsistent conclusions in their interpretation of several issues 
these significant uncertainties are not likely to be resolved definitively in the near future 
uncertainties also remain as to the superfund law itself 
superfund s taxing authority expired on december  and has not been re enacted 
federal legislation appears to be at a standstill 
at this time  it is not possible to predict the direction that any reforms may take  when they may occur or the effect that any changes may have on the insurance industry 
without federal movement on superfund reform  the enforcement of superfund liability is shifting to the states 
states are being forced to reconsider state level cleanup statutes and regulations 
as individual states move forward  the potential for conflicting state regulation becomes greater 
significant uncertainty remains as to the cost of remediating the state sites 
because of the large number of state sites  such sites could prove even more costly in the aggregate than superfund sites 
in establishing our toxic waste reserves  we evaluate the exposure presented by each insured 
as part of this evaluation  we consider the probable liability  available insurance coverage  past settlement values of similar exposures as well as facts that are unique to each insured 
uncertainty remains as to our ultimate liability relating to toxic waste claims 
however  toxic waste losses appear to be developing as expected due to relatively stable claim trends 
in many cases  claims are being settled for less than initially anticipated due to more efficient site remediation efforts 
in other cases  we have been successful at buying back our policies 
despite the stable claim trends  we increased our toxic waste loss reserves by million in the third quarter of based on the estimate of our actuaries and actuarial consultants as to our ultimate exposure 
the following table presents a reconciliation of the beginning and ending loss reserves  net of reinsurance recoverable  related to toxic waste claims 
there are virtually no reinsurance recoveries related to these claims 
years ended december in millions reserves  beginning of year incurred losses losses paid reserves  end of year catastrophe risk management our property and casualty subsidiaries have exposure to losses caused by hurricanes  earthquakes  winter storms  windstorms and other natural catastrophic events 
the frequency and severity of natural catastrophes are unpredictable 
the extent of losses from a catastrophe is a function of both the total amount of insured exposure in an area affected by the event and the severity of the event 
we continually assess our concentration of underwriting exposures in catastrophe prone areas globally and develop strategies to manage this exposure through individual risk selection  subject to regulatory constraints  and through the purchase of catastrophe reinsurance 
in recent years  we have invested in modeling technologies and concentration management tools that allow us to better monitor and control our accumulations of potential losses from catastrophe exposures 
we maintain records showing concentrations of risk in catastrophe exposed areas such as california earthquake and brush fires and the gulf and east coasts of the united states hurricanes 
we also continue to explore and analyze credible scientific evidence  including the impact of global climate change  that may affect our potential exposure under insurance policies 
despite these efforts  the occurrence of one or more severe catastrophic events in heavily populated areas could have a material adverse effect on the corporation s results of operations  financial condition or liquidity 
terrorism risk and legislation the tragic event of september changed the way the property and casualty insurance industry views catastrophic risk 
numerous classes of business have become exposed to terrorism related catastrophic risks in addition to the catastrophic risks related to natural occurrences 
this has required us to change how we identify and evaluate risk accumulations 
we have changed our underwriting protocols to address terrorism and the limited availability of terrorism reinsurance 
however  given the uncertainty of the potential threats  we cannot be sure that we have addressed all the possibilities 
the terrorism risk insurance act of the terrorism act was signed into law on november  the terrorism act established a temporary program under which the federal government will share the risk of loss from certain acts of international terrorism with the insurance industry 
the program terminates on december  the terrorism act is applicable to almost all commercial lines of insurance 
insurance companies with direct commercial insurance exposure in the united states are required to participate in the program 
each insurer has a separate deductible in the event of an act of terrorism before federal assistance becomes available 
the deductible is based on a percentage of direct commercial earned premiums from the previous calendar year 
for  that deductible is of direct commercial premiums earned in for losses above the deductible  the federal government will pay for of covered losses  while the insurer contributes 
there is a combined annual aggregate limit for the federal government and all insurers of billion  above this amount  insurers are not liable for covered losses 
for certain classes of business  such as workers compensation  terrorism coverage is mandatory 
for those classes of business where it is not mandatory  insureds may choose not to accept the terrorism coverage  which would reduce our exposure 
while the provisions of the terrorism act will serve to mitigate our exposure in the event of a large scale terrorist attack  our deductible is substantial  approximating million in therefore  we are making a concerted effort to monitor and control terrorism risk aggregations 
however  our future operating results could be more volatile due to the limited terrorism coverage in our reinsurance program 
we also have exposure outside the united states to risk of loss from acts of terrorism 
in some jurisdictions  we have access to government mechanisms that would mitigate our exposure 
investment results property and casualty investment income before taxes increased by in compared with and by in compared with growth in both years was due to an increase in invested assets  which reflected substantial cash flow from operations over the period 
growth in also benefited from capital contributions to the property and casualty subsidiaries by the corporation of billion in the fourth quarter of and million in the second quarter of growth in benefited from a capital contribution in the fourth quarter of that added million to the invested assets of the property and casualty subsidiaries 
lower available reinvestment rates on fixed maturities that matured in each year dampened growth in investment income 
the effective tax rate on our investment income was in compared with in and in the effective tax rate increased each year as a result of our holding a smaller proportion of our investment portfolio in tax exempt securities 
on an after tax basis  property and casualty investment income increased by in and in management uses property and casualty investment income after tax  a non gaap financial measure  to evaluate its investment performance because it reflects the impact of any change in the proportion of the investment portfolio invested in tax exempt securities and is therefore more meaningful for analysis purposes than investment income before income tax 
other charges other charges include miscellaneous income and expenses of the property and casualty subsidiaries 
other charges in included expenses of million related to the restructuring of our operations in continental europe 
the restructuring costs consist primarily of severance costs related to branch closings and work force reductions 
other charges in included goodwill amortization of approximately million 
the accounting for goodwill was changed in as discussed further under changes in accounting principles 
as a result  there was no goodwill amortization in and other charges in also included the million charge for our share of the losses of hiscox plc from the september attack 
chubb financial solutions chubb financial solutions cfs was organized in to develop and provide customized products to address specific financial needs of corporate clients 
cfs operated through both the capital and insurance markets 
the insurance and reinsurance solutions were written by our property and casualty subsidiaries  and the results of such business are included within our underwriting results 
in april  the corporation announced its intention to exit cfs s non insurance business and to run off the existing financial products portfolio 
our objective is to exit this business as quickly as possible while minimizing the potential of a large payment due to an unexpected credit event over the next few years 
cfs s non insurance business was primarily structured credit derivatives  principally as a counterparty in portfolio credit default swap contracts 
the corporation guaranteed all of these obligations 
in a typical portfolio credit default swap  cfs participated in the senior layer of a structure designed to replicate the performance of a portfolio of corporate securities  a portfolio of asset backed securities or a specified pool of loans 
the structure of these portfolio credit default swaps generally requires cfs to make payment to counterparties to the extent cumulative losses  related to numerous credit events  exceed a specified threshold 
the risk below that threshold  referred to as subordination  is assumed by other parties with the primary risk layer sometimes retained by the buyer 
the amount of subordination for each contract varies based on the credit quality of the underlying portfolio and the term to maturity of the contract 
credit events generally arise when one of the referenced entities within a portfolio becomes bankrupt  undergoes a debt restructuring or fails to make timely interest or principal payments 
portfolio credit default swaps are derivatives and are carried in the financial statements at estimated fair value  which represents management s best estimate of the cost to exit our positions 
most of these credit default swaps tend to be unique transactions and there is no traded market for such exposures 
to estimate the fair value of the obligation in each credit default swap  we use internal valuation models that are similar to external valuation models 
the fair value of our credit default swaps is subject to fluctuations arising from  among other factors  changes in credit spreads  the financial ratings of referenced asset backed securities  actual credit events reducing subordination  credit correlation within a portfolio  anticipated recovery rates related to potential defaults and changes in interest rates 
changes in fair value are included in income in the period of the change 
thus  cfs s results are subject to volatility  which has had a significant effect on the corporation s results of operations from period to period 
the market risks associated with our obligations under portfolio credit default swaps are discussed under the financial products section of quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
the non insurance business of cfs produced a loss before taxes of million in compared with a loss of million in and income of million in the loss in was due to adverse movement in the mark to market adjustment  which resulted in an increase in the fair value of our future obligations related to the portfolio credit default swaps 
of the increase in the fair value of our obligations  million was due to downgrades in the financial ratings of certain referenced securities underlying two of our asset backed portfolio credit default swaps 
other factors contributing to the increase were a widening of market credit spreads and  for one credit default swap  erosion in the risk layers that are subordinate to the cfs risk layer due to actual losses in those subordinate layers 
the substantial loss in was due to further deterioration in the credit quality of certain referenced securities underlying the two asset backed credit default swaps 
in the first nine months of the year  the fair value of our future obligations related to these two swaps increased by million 
then  in the fourth quarter  as described below  we terminated the two swaps and replaced them with a principal and interest guarantee agreement  which resulted in an additional loss of million 
the losses related to these two asset backed swaps were partially offset by mark to market gains during the year on our corporate credit default swaps 
revenues from the non insurance business of cfs  primarily consisting of the change in fair value of derivatives contracts  were negative million in  negative million in and positive million in revenues were negative in and due to the adverse impact of changes in fair value in both years and the impact in of the agreement to terminate the two asset backed portfolio credit default swaps and replace them with a principal and interest guarantee 
cfs s aggregate exposure  or retained risk  from its in force portfolio credit default swaps is referred to as notional amount 
notional amounts are used to express the extent of involvement in swap transactions 
these amounts are used to calculate the exchange of contractual cash flows and are not necessarily representative of the potential for gain or loss 
the notional amounts are not recorded on the balance sheet 
at december   the notional amount of cfs s credit default swaps was approximately billion  of which billion related to the two asset backed swaps that had experienced deterioration in credit quality 
in connection with our plan to exit the credit derivatives business  we have accelerated the reduction of our notional exposure 
in the fourth quarter of  cfs paid million to terminate the two asset backed portfolio credit default swaps that had experienced deterioration in credit quality and simultaneously entered into a new contract that guarantees principal and interest obligations on only billion of the original billion notional amount 
the corporation has guaranteed cfs s obligations under the new contract 
cfs s potential payment obligations have been extended from the original termination dates of and to the date when the last of the underlying obligations expire 
under the new agreement  cfs s maximum payment obligation is limited to million regardless of the amount of losses that might be incurred on the billion of referenced securities 
moreover  if losses are incurred  cfs s payment obligations are limited to an extended payment schedule under which no payment would be due until at the earliest 
cfs established a liability of million related to the new principal and interest contract  which represented the estimated fair value of the guarantee at its inception 
at the same time  cfs eliminated the carried liability of million on the two swaps that were terminated 
the principal and interest guarantee is not a derivative contract 
therefore  the liability related to this contract will not be marked to market each period 
due to the nature of the guarantee  we will reduce this liability only upon either the expiration or settlement of the guarantee 
if actual losses are incurred  a liability for the losses will be established  and a portion of the guarantee liability will be released 
the amount released will depend on our evaluation of expected ultimate loss experience 
during  cfs terminated its obligations under certain other portfolio credit default swaps 
in addition  cfs entered into a portfolio credit default swap that exactly offsets the provisions of an in force credit default swap with a notional exposure of million 
these transactions had almost no impact on cfs s results of operations 
as a result of these transactions  the notional amount of cfs s credit default swaps was reduced to billion at december  our realistic loss exposure is a very small portion of the billion notional amount due to several factors 
our position is senior to subordinated interests of billion in the aggregate 
of the billion of subordination  there were only million of defaults through december   none of which has pierced the subordination limits of any of our contracts 
in addition  using our internal ratings models  we estimate that the credit ratings of the individual portfolio credit default swaps at december  were either aaa or aa 
in addition to portfolio credit default swaps  cfs entered into a derivative contract linked to an equity market index and a few other insignificant non insurance transactions 
the notional amount and fair value of our future obligations under derivative contracts by type of risk were as follows december notional amount fair value in billions in millions credit default swaps corporate securities asset backed securities loan portfolios other corporate and other corporate and other includes investment income earned on corporate invested assets  interest expense and other expenses not allocated to the operating subsidiaries  and the results of our real estate and other non insurance subsidiaries 
corporate and other produced a loss before taxes of million in compared with losses of million and million in and  respectively 
the increasingly higher loss in and was due to an increase in interest expense and a decrease in investment income in each of the years compared with the prior year 
interest expense increased in due to the issuance of million of debt in the fourth quarter of  million of debt in the first quarter of and million of debt in the second quarter of the higher interest expense in was due to the issuance of million of debt in the fourth quarter of the decrease in investment income in and again in was due to lower average corporate invested assets resulting from the capital contributions to the property and casualty subsidiaries 
results in included a loss at the chubb institute  inc  our post secondary educational subsidiary  which provides programs primarily relating to information technology 
as part of our focus on our core insurance business  we are analyzing our alternatives with respect to chubb institute 
the effect of this loss on results was substantially offset by income from our investment in allied world assurance company  ltd 
real estate real estate operations resulted in a loss before taxes of million in compared with losses of million in and million in these amounts are included in the corporate and other results 
in each year  we sold selected commercial properties as well as residential properties 
real estate revenues were million in  million in and million in we own approximately million of land which we expect will be developed in the future 
in addition  our real estate assets include approximately million of commercial properties and land parcels under lease  of which million related to a variable interest entity in which we are the primary beneficiary 
we are continuing to explore the sale of certain of our remaining properties 
the recoverability of the carrying value of our real estate assets is assessed based on our ability to fully recover costs through a future revenue stream 
the assumptions used reflect future improvement in demand for office space  an increase in rental rates and the ability and intent to obtain financing in order to hold and develop such remaining properties and protect our interests over the long term 
management believes that it has made adequate provisions for impairment of real estate assets 
however  if the assets are not sold or developed or if leased properties do not perform as presently contemplated  it is possible that additional impairment losses may be recognized that would have a material adverse effect on the corporation s results of operations 
realized investment gains and losses net investment gains realized were as follows years ended december in millions net gains on sales equity securities fixed maturities other than temporary impairment equity securities fixed maturities realized investment gains before tax realized investment gains after tax a primary reason for the sale of fixed maturities in each of the last three years has been to improve our after tax portfolio return without sacrificing quality where market opportunities have existed to do so 
we regularly review our invested assets with a fair value below cost to determine if an other than temporary decline in value has occurred 
in evaluating whether a decline in value of any investment is other than temporary  we consider various quantitative and qualitative factors including the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than the cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  whether the debtor is current on contractually obligated interest and principal payments  and our intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow us to recover our cost 
if a decline in the fair value of an individual security is deemed to be other than temporary  the difference between cost and estimated fair value is charged to income as a realized investment loss 
the fair value of the investment becomes its new cost basis 
the writedowns of fixed maturities in were primarily due to collateral deterioration of several asset backed securities and price declines of a few corporate credits in the airline and energy sectors 
the writedowns in and were primarily due to credit deterioration and corporate failures of several issuers  particularly in the telecommunications and  to a lesser extent  energy related industries 
income taxes we establish deferred income taxes on the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries 
similarly  we establish deferred tax assets related to the expected future us tax benefit of losses and foreign taxes incurred by our foreign subsidiaries 
to evaluate the realization of the future tax benefit of these deferred tax assets  management must consider whether it is more likely than not that sufficient taxable income will be generated 
management s judgment is based on its assessment of business plans and related projections of future taxable income that reflect assumptions about increased premium volume  higher rates and improved policy terms as well as available tax planning strategies 
the tax loss carryforwards and foreign tax credits have no expiration 
however  we are required under generally accepted accounting principles to consider a relatively near term horizon when we evaluate the likelihood of realizing future tax benefits 
during the years through  chubb insurance company of europe chubb europe incurred substantial losses 
these losses were the result of underwriting losses during the period due to inadequate prices and adverse claims trends  particularly for directors and officers liability and errors and omissions liability coverages 
at december   the deferred income tax asset related to the expected future us tax benefit of the losses and foreign taxes incurred by chubb europe was million 
during the fourth quarter of  we established a valuation allowance of million for the portion of these tax assets that we could not recognize for accounting purposes due to the requirement to evaluate realization over a near term horizon 
due to profitable results in chubb europe during  as of december   the deferred income tax asset related to the expected future us tax benefit of the losses and foreign taxes incurred by chubb europe had been reduced to million 
as a result  in the fourth quarter of  we concluded that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized over a near term horizon and we eliminated the valuation allowance 
capital resources and liquidity capital resources and liquidity represent the overall financial strength of the corporation and its ability to generate cash flows from its operating subsidiaries  borrow funds at competitive rates and raise new capital to meet operating and growth needs 
capital resources capital resources provide protection for policyholders  furnish the financial strength to support the business of underwriting insurance risks and facilitate continued business growth 
at december   the corporation had shareholders equity of billion and total debt of billion 
in february  million of notes were paid when due 
in march  the corporation issued million of unsecured notes due in and million of unsecured notes due in net proceeds from the issuance of the notes were million 
in june  a shelf registration statement that the corporation filed in march was declared effective by the securities and exchange commission 
under the registration statement  up to billion of various types of securities may be issued 
at december   the corporation had approximately million remaining under the shelf registration statement 
in june  the corporation sold  shares of common stock 
net proceeds from the sale of the shares were million 
concurrently  the corporation issued million of unsecured senior notes due in and million purchase contracts 
the senior notes and purchase contracts were issued together in the form of equity units  each of which initially represents principal amount of senior notes and one purchase contract 
the net proceeds from this offering were million 
each purchase contract obligates the investor to purchase for a variable number of shares of the corporation s common stock on august  the number of shares to be purchased will be determined based on a formula that considers the market price of our common stock immediately prior to the time of settlement in relation to the per share sale price of our common stock at the time the equity units were offered 
upon settlement of the purchase contracts  the corporation will receive proceeds of approximately million and will issue between approximately  and  shares of common stock 
in  the corporation issued million of unsecured senior notes due in and million mandatorily exercisable warrants to purchase the corporation s common stock 
the senior notes and warrants were issued together in the form of equity units  each of which initially represents principal amount of senior notes and one warrant 
the net proceeds were million 
each warrant obligates the investor to purchase for a variable number of shares of the corporation s common stock on or before november  the number of shares to be purchased will be determined based on a formula that considers the market price of our common stock immediately prior to the time of settlement in relation to the per share sale price of our common stock at the time the equity units were offered 
upon settlement of the warrants  the corporation will receive proceeds of approximately million and will issue between approximately  and  shares of common stock 
the equity units are further described in notes a and c of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the proceeds from the issuance of the notes  the common stock and the equity units are being used for general corporate purposes  including capital contributions to our property and casualty subsidiaries to support growth

the sole assets of the trust are debentures issued by chubb executive risk 
the capital securities are subject to mandatory redemption in upon repayment of the debentures 
the capital securities are also subject to mandatory redemption under certain circumstances beginning in the corporation has guaranteed the unsecured notes and the capital securities 
management continuously monitors the amount of capital resources that the corporation maintains both for itself and its operating subsidiaries 
in connection with our long term capital strategy  the corporation from time to time contributes capital to its property and casualty subsidiaries 
in addition  in order to satisfy its capital needs as a result of any rating agency capital adequacy or other future rating issues  or in the event the corporation were to need additional capital to make strategic investments in light of market opportunities  the corporation may take a variety of actions  which could include the issuance of additional debt and or equity securities 
in july  the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to  shares of the corporation s common stock 
in june  the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional  shares 
the authorization has no expiration  the authorization expired on june  as of december    shares remained under the share repurchase authorization 
the corporation made no share repurchases during the corporation repurchased  shares in open market transactions in at a cost of million and  shares in at a cost of million 
we do not anticipate that we will repurchase any shares of our common stock in ratings the corporation and its insurance subsidiaries are rated by major rating agencies 
these ratings reflect the rating agency s opinion of our financial strength  operating performance  strategic position and ability to meet our obligations to policyholders 
standard poor s ratings services lowered certain of our ratings in the first quarter of following the announcement of our fourth quarter earnings  which included charges taken to strengthen our asbestos loss reserves and to limit our exposure on the two credit default swaps written by cfs that had experienced deterioration in credit quality  moody s investors service lowered our debt ratings and changed to negative the outlook for our ratings 
the following table summarizes the corporation s credit ratings from the major independent rating organizations as of march  am best standard poor s moody s fitch senior unsecured debt rating aa a a a preferred stock rating a bbb baa commercial paper amb a p f counterparty credit rating a the following table summarizes our property and casualty subsidiaries financial strength ratings from the major independent rating organizations as of march  am best standard poor s moody s fitch financial strength a aa aa aa ratings are an important factor in establishing our competitive position in our operating businesses 
there can be no assurance that our ratings will continue for any given period of time or that they will not be changed 
further reductions in our ratings could adversely affect the competitive position of our operating businesses 
it is possible that positive or negative ratings actions may occur in the future 
if our ratings were downgraded  the corporation may incur higher borrowing costs and may have more limited means to access capital 
contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements the following table provides our future payments due by period under contractual obligations as of december   aggregated by type of obligation 
there after total in millions principal due under long term debt interest  warrant fee and contract adjustment payments on long term debt and equity units future minimum rental payments under operating leases total the corporation had certain commitments totaling million at december  to fund limited partnership investments 
these capital commitments can be called by the partnerships during the commitment period on average  years to fund working capital needs or the purchase of new investments 
the corporation does not have any material off balance sheet arrangements  except as discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
liquidity liquidity is a measure of our ability to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the short and long term cash requirements of our business operations 
our property and casualty operations provide liquidity in that premiums are generally received months or even years before losses are paid under the policies purchased by such premiums 
historically  cash receipts from operations  consisting of insurance premiums and investment income  have provided more than sufficient funds to pay losses  operating expenses and dividends to the corporation 
after satisfying our cash requirements  excess cash flows are used to build the investment portfolio and thereby increase future investment income 
new cash from operations available for investment by the property and casualty subsidiaries was approximately billion in compared with billion in and million in new cash available in was higher than in due to the substantial growth in premium receipts in without a commensurate increase in paid losses or operating expenses 
the increase in new cash in was due to the significant growth in premium receipts while paid losses were similar in and in addition to the cash from operations  the property and casualty subsidiaries received capital contributions from the corporation of million in the second quarter of  billion in the fourth quarter of and million in the fourth quarter of in  million was used by a property and casualty subsidiary to fund the purchase of a interest in allied world assurance holdings  ltd  a newly formed bermuda based insurer 
in  the interest in allied world assurance holdings was transferred as a dividend from the property and casualty subsidiary to the corporation 
our property and casualty subsidiaries maintain investments in highly liquid  short term and other marketable securities to provide for immediate cash needs 
the corporation s liquidity requirements in the past have been met by dividends from its property and casualty subsidiaries and the issuance of commercial paper and debt and equity securities 
liquidity requirements in the future will be met by these sources of funds as well as borrowings from its credit facilities 
the declaration and payment of future dividends to the corporation s shareholders will be at the discretion of the corporation s board of directors and will depend upon many factors  including our operating results  financial condition  capital requirements and any regulatory constraints 
as a holding company  the corporation s ability to continue to pay dividends to shareholders and to satisfy its obligations  including the payment of interest and principal on debt obligations  relies on the availability of liquid assets in the corporation  which is dependent in large part on the dividend paying ability of its property and casualty subsidiaries 
various state insurance laws restrict the corporation s property and casualty subsidiaries as to the amount of dividends they may pay without the prior approval of regulatory authorities 
the restrictions are generally based on net income and on certain levels of policyholders surplus as determined in accordance with statutory accounting practices 
dividends in excess of such thresholds are considered extraordinary and require prior regulatory approval 
during  these subsidiaries paid cash dividends to the corporation totaling million 
the maximum dividend distribution that may be made by the property and casualty subsidiaries to the corporation during without prior approval is approximately million 
we believe that our strong financial position and conservative debt level provide us with the flexibility and capacity to obtain funds externally through debt or equity financings on both a short term and long term basis 
however  should our ratings be downgraded  our ability to access the markets to satisfy our liquidity requirements could be adversely affected 
the corporation has two credit agreements with a group of banks that provide for unsecured borrowings of up to million in the aggregate 
the million short term revolving credit facility  which was to have terminated on june   was extended to june  and may be renewed or replaced 
the million medium term revolving credit facility terminates on june  on the respective termination dates for these agreements  any loans then outstanding become payable 
there have been no borrowings under these agreements 
various interest rate options are available to the corporation  all of which are based on market interest rates 
the facilities are available for general corporate purposes and to support the corporation s commercial paper borrowing arrangement 
invested assets the main objectives in managing our investment portfolios are to maximize after tax investment income and total investment returns while minimizing credit risks in order to provide maximum support to the insurance underwriting operations 
investment strategies are developed based on many factors including underwriting results and our resulting tax position  regulatory requirements  fluctuations in interest rates and consideration of other market risks 
investment decisions are centrally managed by investment professionals based on guidelines established by management and approved by the boards of directors 
our investment portfolio is primarily comprised of high quality bonds  principally tax exempt  us treasury and government agency  mortgage backed securities and corporate issues as well as foreign bonds that support our international operations 
in addition  the portfolio includes equity securities held primarily with the objective of capital appreciation 
in  we invested new cash in tax exempt bonds and taxable bonds and  to a lesser extent  equity securities 
the taxable bonds were primarily mortgage backed securities  foreign government bonds and us treasury securities 
in  we invested new cash in mortgage backed securities and  to a lesser extent  us treasury securities 
in  we invested new cash primarily in corporate bonds 
our objective is to achieve the appropriate mix of taxable and tax exempt securities in our portfolio to balance both investment and tax strategies 
at december   of our fixed maturity portfolio was invested in tax exempt bonds compared with at december  and at december  fixed maturity securities that we have the ability and intent to hold to maturity are classified as held to maturity 
the remaining fixed maturities  which may be sold prior to maturity to support our investment strategies  such as in response to changes in interest rates and the yield curve or to maximize after tax returns  are classified as available for sale 
fixed maturities classified as held to maturity are carried at amortized cost while fixed maturities classified as available for sale are carried at market value 
at december   of the fixed maturity portfolio was classified as held to maturity compared with at december  and at december  changes in the general interest rate environment affect the returns available on new fixed maturity investments 
while a rising interest rate environment enhances the returns available  it reduces the market value of existing fixed maturity investments and thus the availability of gains on disposition 
a decline in interest rates reduces the returns available on new investments but increases the market value of existing investments  creating the opportunity for realized investment gains on disposition 
the unrealized appreciation before tax of investments carried at market value  which includes fixed maturities classified as available for sale and equity securities  was  million  million and million at december   and  respectively 
such unrealized appreciation is reflected in a separate component of other comprehensive income  net of applicable deferred income tax 
the unrealized market appreciation before tax of those fixed maturities carried at amortized cost was million  million and million at december   and  respectively 
such unrealized appreciation was not reflected in the consolidated financial statements 
changes in unrealized market appreciation or depreciation of fixed maturities were due primarily to fluctuations in interest rates 
changes in accounting principles effective january   the corporation adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
may not be applied retroactively to financial statements of prior periods 
under sfas no 
 goodwill is no longer amortized 
goodwill amortization was approximately million in effective january   the corporation adopted the fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation plans  which is the method of accounting defined in sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
under the fair value method of accounting  compensation cost is measured based on the fair value of the award at the grant date and recognized over the service period 
prior period financial statements were not restated 
the adoption of the fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation plans resulted in a reduction in net income of approximately million in in the fourth quarter of  the corporation adopted financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
fin requires that a variable interest entity be consolidated by its primary beneficiary 
as a result of its variable interests in a real estate partnership  our real estate subsidiary is the primary beneficiary of the partnership 
we applied fin by retroactively restating prior year financial statements with a cumulative effect adjustment as of the beginning of the first year restated 
the effect of the restatement on previously reported december  shareholders equity was a decrease of million 
the effect on net income for and  as previously reported  and on net income for was immaterial 
these changes in accounting are discussed further in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the potential for loss due to adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments 
our primary exposure to market risks relates to our investment portfolio  which is sensitive to changes in interest rates and  to a lesser extent  credit quality  prepayment  foreign currency exchange rates and equity prices 
we also have exposure to market risks through cfs s financial products portfolio and our debt obligations 
analytical tools and monitoring systems are in place to assess each of these elements of market risk 
investment portfolio interest rate risk is the price sensitivity of a security that promises a fixed return to changes in interest rates 
changes in market interest rates directly affect the market value of our fixed income securities 
we view the potential changes in price of our fixed income investments within the overall context of asset and liability management 
our actuaries estimate the payout pattern of our liabilities  primarily our property and casualty loss reserves  to determine their duration  which is the present value of the weighted average payments expressed in years 
we set duration targets for our fixed income investment portfolios after consideration of the duration of these liabilities and other factors  which we believe mitigates the overall effect of interest rate risk for the corporation 
the following table provides information about our fixed maturity investments  which are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the table presents cash flows of principal amounts and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates at december  and the cash flows are based on the earlier of the call date or the maturity date or  for mortgage backed securities  expected payment patterns 
actual cash flows could differ from the expected amounts 
at december  total estimated there amortized market after cost value in millions tax exempt average interest rate taxable other than mortgage backed securities average interest rate mortgage backed securities average interest rate total at december  total estimated there amortized market after cost value in millions tax exempt average interest rate taxable other than mortgage backed securities average interest rate mortgage backed securities average interest rate total we have consistently invested in high quality marketable securities 
as a result  we believe that we have minimal credit quality risk 
approximately of the taxable bonds in our portfolio are issued by the us treasury or us government agencies or rated aa or better by moody s or standard and poor s 
of the tax exempt bonds  more than are rated aa or better with about rated aaa 
approximately of our bond portfolio is below investment grade 
our taxable bonds have an average maturity of five years  while our tax exempt bonds mature on average in nine years 
prepayment risk refers to the changes in prepayment patterns related to decreases and increases in interest rates that can either shorten or lengthen the expected timing of the principal repayments and thus the average life of a security  potentially reducing or increasing its effective yield 
such risk exists primarily within our portfolio of mortgage backed securities 
we monitor such risk regularly and invest primarily in those classes of mortgage backed securities that are less subject to prepayment risk 
mortgage backed securities comprised and of our taxable bond portfolio at year end and  respectively 
about of our mortgage backed securities holdings at december  related to residential mortgages consisting of government agency pass through securities  government agency collateralized mortgage obligations cmos and aaa rated non agency cmos backed by government agency collateral or single family home mortgages 
the majority of the cmos are actively traded in liquid markets and market value information is readily available from broker dealers 
an additional of our mortgage backed securities were call protected aaa rated commercial mortgage backed securities 
the remaining mortgage backed holdings were in investment grade commercial mortgage backed securities 
foreign currency risk is the sensitivity to foreign exchange rate fluctuations of the market value and investment income related to foreign currency denominated financial instruments 
the functional currency of our foreign operations is generally the currency of the local operating environment since business is primarily transacted in such local currency 
we reduce the risks relating to currency fluctuations by maintaining investments in those foreign currencies in which our property and casualty subsidiaries have loss reserves and other liabilities 
such investments have characteristics similar to our liabilities in those currencies 
at december   the property and casualty subsidiaries held non us investments of billion supporting their international operations 
these investments have quality and maturity characteristics similar to our domestic portfolio 
the principal currencies creating foreign exchange rate risk for the property and casualty subsidiaries are the british pound sterling  the euro and the canadian dollar 
the following table provides information about those fixed maturity investments that are denominated in these currencies 
the table presents cash flows of principal amounts in us dollar equivalents by expected maturity dates at december  and actual cash flows could differ from the expected amounts 
at december  total estimated there amortized market after cost value in millions british pound sterling euro canadian dollar at december  total estimated there amortized market after cost value in millions british pound sterling euro canadian dollar equity price risk is the potential loss in market value of our equity securities resulting from adverse changes in stock prices 
in general  equities have more year to year price variability than intermediate term high grade bonds 
however  returns over longer time frames have been consistently higher 
our publicly traded equity securities are high quality  diversified across industries and readily marketable 
our portfolio also includes alternative investments  primarily investment partnerships 
these investments by their nature are less liquid than other investments 
we actively manage our market risk by allocating a comparatively small amount of funds to alternative investments  performing extensive research prior to investing in a new investment and monitoring the performance of the entities in which we have invested 
a hypothetical decrease of in the market price of each of the equity securities held at december  and would have resulted in a decrease of million and million  respectively  in the fair value of the equity securities portfolio 
all of the above risks are monitored on an ongoing basis 
a combination of in house systems and proprietary models and externally licensed software are used to analyze individual securities as well as each portfolio 
these tools provide the portfolio managers with information to assist them in the evaluation of the market risks of the portfolio 
financial products the corporation  through cfs s business  assumed exposure to credit risk through portfolio credit default swaps 
in a typical portfolio credit default swap  the occurrence of certain defined credit events related to referenced entities within a specified portfolio will result in a deterioration of the subordination 
when losses related to cumulative credit events exceed the subordination  the contract requires cfs to make payment to its counterparty 
these obligations are guaranteed by the corporation 
as discussed in the chubb financial solutions section of md a  we have exited this business and are running off cfs s remaining portfolio credit default swaps 
valuation models are used to estimate the fair value of our obligation in each credit default swap 
within these models  credit spreads are a critical input used to estimate the probability of the occurrence of credit events 
the fair value of a portfolio credit default swap is also a function of the financial ratings of referenced asset backed securities  actual credit events reducing subordination  credit correlation within a portfolio  anticipated recovery rates related to potential defaults and changes in interest rates 
at december   our in force corporate portfolio credit default swaps have final maturities within two to nine years  with an expected average remaining life of four years 
our in force asset backed portfolio credit default swaps have final maturities that range from to however  due to amortization of the underlying assets and other terms related to those swaps  the expected average remaining life is seven years

the notional exposure under the guarantee is billion 
however  cfs s maximum payment obligation is limited to million 
at the inception of the agreement  cfs established a liability of million for the estimated fair value of the guarantee 
debt we also have interest rate risk on our debt obligations
