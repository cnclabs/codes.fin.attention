item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations cautionary statement certain statements in this report are forward looking statements that are subject to certain risks and uncertainties 
our business is highly dependent upon two large automotive customers and specific makes and models of automobiles 
therefore  our financial results will be subject to many of the same risks that apply to the automotive industry  such as general economic conditions  interest rates and consumer spending patterns 
a significant portion of the balance of our business relates to the computer and telecommunication industries which are subject to many of the same risks facing the automotive industry as well as fast moving technological change 
other factors which may result in materially different results for future periods include actual performance in our various markets  operating costs  currency exchange rates and devaluations  delays in development  production and marketing of new products  and other factors set forth from time to time in our reports filed with the securities and exchange commission 
any of these factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward looking statements 
the forward looking statements in this report are intended to be subject to the safe harbor protection provided under the securities laws 
overview we are a global manufacturer of component and subsystem devices with manufacturing  design and testing facilities in the united states  mexico  malta  united kingdom  germany  czech republic  singapore  and china 
we design  manufacture and market devices employing electrical  electronic  wireless  sensing and optical technologies 
our business is managed on a technology product basis  with those technology segments being electronic  optical and other 
the business units whose results are identified in the electronic segment principally employ electronic processes to control and convey signals 
the business units whose results are identified in the optical segment principally employ light to control and convey signals 
the other segment includes a manufacturer of current carrying bus devices and independent laboratories that provide services for qualification testing and failure analysis 
our components are found in the primary end markets of the automotive  communications including information processing and storage  networking equipment  wireless and terrestrial voice data systems  aerospace  rail and other transportation industries  and the consumer and industrial equipment markets 
recent trends in the industries that we serve include increasing pressure by automobile manufacturers on automotive suppliers to reduce selling prices  growth of north american subsidiaries of foreign based automobile manufacturers  more automotive supplier funded design  engineering and tooling costs previously funded directly by the automobile manufacturers  and continued customer migration to low cost eastern european and asian suppliers 
in response to pricing pressures  we continue to transition to lean manufacturing processes and invest in  and implement techniques such as flexible automated manufacturing cells to lower our costs to maintain or improve margins 
we also have become more selective with regard to programs in which we participate in order to reduce our exposure to low profit programs 
our transition to lean manufacturing has helped us obtain our first contract to supply components to a north american plant of a major japanese automobile manufacturer  expected to launch in fiscal the continued price erosion in the fiber optic and copper cable assembly business as well as sales lost to lower cost eastern european and asian suppliers had rendered our copper cable assembly facility in ireland and our 
table of contents fiber optic manufacturing facility in the united kingdom unsustainable 
in the second half of fiscal  we transferred a portion of the fiber optic cable business to our czech republic facility and closed the plants in ireland and the united kingdom resulting in a net charge to earnings of million 
in an effort to better compete with low cost manufacturers and expand our business in the asian marketplace  we are in the process of transferring production from our singapore facility to our new shanghai  china plant where we expect to begin manufacturing in the late summer or early fall of singapore will remain our asia pacific headquarters and also house sales  design engineering and finance operations 
during fiscal  we successfully completed our strategic plan to establish a more conventional corporate governance structure by eliminating our dual class stock structure and vesting control of the company in its owners in proportion to their investments in the company 
we used million of cash to purchase and eliminate all of our outstanding class b common stock 
in addition  we incurred a net charge to fiscal earnings of million for costs associated with this transaction and a related unsolicited tender offer for our class b common stock 
business outlook sales in fiscal are expected to improve slightly 
we expect to realize increased business from our network bus unit because of additional orders from the computer and military industries 
the automotive safety technology business is expected to increase as automakers ramp up to meet the federal requirement to provide passive occupant detection for front passenger airbag deployment on all vehicles by model year these increases will be partially offset by expected pricing pressures and potential lower sales from methode s traditional north american automotive oems as we continue to transition away from less profitable programs 
we also anticipate weaker us sales in commodity electronic components  however  production in china will help boost sales in asia  thus slowing the decline of business from customers expressly seeking a low cost provider

net sales to the automotive industry  which represented of the electronic segment net sales in fiscal  up from in fiscal  decreased compared with last year 
the net effect of the decline in customer paid tooling and foreign currency translation reduced automotive industry net sales by 
strong sales growth at our automotive safety technology ast business and european automotive electronics controls group were offset by the decline in unit sales experienced by our traditional north american automotive customers in fiscal the net decline in product sales to north american automotive customers in fiscal reflects both price concessions and reduced unit sales due to lost market share by these customers 
sales for the balance of the electronic segment in fiscal were down compared to last year  reflecting the continued weakness in the telecommunication market and increased competition from low cost eastern european and asian manufacturers 
price erosion and lost sales to lower cost eastern european and asian suppliers led to our decision to close our ireland copper cable assembly business in fiscal resulting in a million charge to earnings see note to the consolidated financial statements 
optical segment net sales represented of consolidated net sales for both fiscal years and net sales of the optical segment in fiscal  which reflect a million increase in sales due to the effects of foreign currency translation  remained flat at million compared to million in fiscal net sales at our domestic subsidiary that provides custom installation of fiber optic cable assemblies primarily to data centers increased for the year to million 
the sales increase at this business unit was attributable to general market improvement and the addition of a substantial new customer 
net sales for our united kingdom optical cable assembly operation fell more than in fiscal due to the continued weakness in the telecommunication market  price erosion and lost sales to lower cost eastern european and asian suppliers 
we determined that the united kingdom unit could not compete in this environment and at the end of fiscal  we closed this operation  transferring some production to our czech republic fiber optic facility and executing an agreement to sell the balance to local management for cash of million  resulting in a net charge to earnings of million see note to the consolidated financial statements 
other segment net sales represented of consolidated net sales in fiscal compared with last year 
net sales of the other segment increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the sales increase in this segment is primarily due to new product offerings at our network bus business and an expanded customer base for its products 
other income 
other income consisted primarily of earnings from our automotive joint venture  license fees  royalties  and in fiscal  engineering design fees 
the increase in other income was primarily due to the design fees earned in fiscal other income in fiscal was reduced because the automotive joint venture experienced lower income due to quality issues 
cost of products sold 
cost of products sold  as a percentage of net sales  was in fiscal compared with in fiscal gross margins on product sales of the electronic segment decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal the decline in gross margins was primarily due to the decline in unit sales experienced by the company s traditional north american automotive customers  price concessions given to these automotive customers that were not completely recovered by cost cutting programs  and increased costs for employee medical in fiscal our scotland automotive plant also contributed to the decline in margins as it experienced a disruption in production due to a fire  and costs due to challenges launching several new products that increased its sales by in fiscal the closing of the ireland cable assembly operation resulted in a million charge to cost of sales in and reduced the gross margin by percentage points 
margins improved in the fourth quarter of fiscal as our transition to lean manufacturing helped reduce our manufacturing costs in north america and our product mix improved 
gross margins of the optical segment decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal the decline in margins was due to a million charge to cost of sales for the divestiture of our uk fiber optic operation and higher costs for inventory obsolescence at our fiber optic cable custom installation operation 

table of contents gross margins of the other segment increased to in fiscal from in fiscal the margin improvement was primarily the result of the increased sales volume at both our network bus unit and our test laboratories  with lower incremental fixed costs

in fiscal  selling and administrative expenses included a million credit for the reversal of restructuring and other reserves relating to a subsidiary sold in april amortization of intangibles 
amortization of intangibles relates primarily to intangible assets acquired in the january  acquisition of kill bolton associates kba and the august  acquisition of ast see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the increase in amortization expense in is primarily due to a full year of amortization of the kba intangible assets compared with amortization of just one quarter in fiscal interest  net 
interest income  net of interest expense  declined in fiscal compared with fiscal interest income declined due to significantly lower short term interest rates during fiscal and the june  maturity of the million note receivable from a related party that accrued interest at during fiscal and the first two months of fiscal see note to the consolidated financial statements

increased shipments of sensor pads for passenger occupancy detection systems by ast were responsible for of the increase in fiscal the balance of the increase was due to volume gains primarily the result of new product launches and stable vehicle production schedules 
net sales for the balance of the electronic segment for fiscal were down  net of a gain from foreign currency translation  compared to the previous year reflecting the continued weakness in the computer and telecommunication markets and increased competition from low cost asian manufacturers 
optical segment net sales represented of consolidated net sales for fiscal compared with 
table of contents for fiscal net sales of the optical segment in fiscal decreased to million from million the previous year  and reflects a increase in sales due to the effects of foreign currency translation 
all of our optical businesses experienced sales volume declines and price erosion as a result of the continued weakness in the computer and telecommunication markets 
other segment net sales represented of consolidated net sales in fiscal compared with in net sales of the other segment increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal new bus device programs increased shipments in by over the prior year 
this increase in net sales of bus devices was partially offset by a decline of test laboratory sales of 
other income

the remaining margin improvement is the result of improved margins at our fiber optic cable assembly operation in the czech republic where new business with the czech military and a local utility helped boost margins 
gross margins of the other segment decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal the margin declines were primarily the result of the sales declines at our test laboratories 
the increase in sales of current carrying bus devices did not significantly improve margins because we chose to use aggressive pricing strategies to gain new customers and increase market share for our current carrying bus devices

financial condition  liquidity and capital resources we have historically financed our cash requirements through cash flows from operations 
our future capital requirements will depend on a number of factors  including our future net sales and the timing and rate of expansion of our business 
cash on deposit in foreign accounts totaled million at april  income taxes would be payable if this cash were repatriated see note to the consolidated financial statements 
we believe our current cash balances together with the cash flow expected to be generated from future domestic and foreign operations will be sufficient to support operations for the foreseeable future without the need for repatriation of foreign cash balances 
we have an agreement with our primary bank for a committed million revolving credit facility to provide ready financing for general corporate purposes  including acquisition opportunities that may become available 
the bank credit agreement requires maintenance of certain financial ratios and a minimum net worth level 
at april   the company was in compliance with these covenants and there were no borrowings against this credit facility

off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial position and results of operations is based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  however  we do not believe that it is reasonably likely that changes will occur 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments 
the amount of the allowance is based on the age of unpaid amounts  information about the creditworthiness of customers  and other relevant information 
estimates of uncollectible amounts are revised each period  and changes are recorded in the period they become known 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
in addition  our revenues and accounts receivable are concentrated in a relatively few number of customers 
a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of any one of these customers or a deterioration in the economic environment or automotive industry  in general  could have a material adverse impact on the collectability of our accounts receivable and our future operating results  including a reduction in future revenues and additional allowances for doubtful accounts 
allowance for excess and obsolete inventory 
inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market value and have been reduced by allowances for excess and obsolete inventories 
the estimated allowances are based on management s review of inventories on hand compared to estimated future usage and sales  using assumptions about future product life cycles  product demand and market conditions 
if actual product life cycles  product demand and market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
intangible assets 
we have significant intangible assets related to goodwill and other acquired intangibles 

table of contents the determination of related estimated useful lives and whether these assets are impaired involves significant judgment 
in assessing the recoverability of our intangibles  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  on may  the company ceased amortizing goodwill 
in lieu of amortization  we are required to perform an annual impairment review see note to the consolidated financial statements 
income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  management is required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which the company operates 
the process involves estimating actual current tax expense along with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for book and tax purposes 
these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we have considered future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
contingencies 
the company is subject to various investigations  claims  legal and administrative proceedings covering a wide range of matters that arise in the ordinary course of business activities 
a significant amount of judgment and use of estimates is required to quantify our ultimate exposure in these matters 
for those matters that management can estimate a range of loss  we have established reserves at levels within that range to provide for the most likely scenario based upon available information 
the valuation of reserves for contingencies is reviewed on a quarterly basis to assure that the company is properly reserved 
reserve balances are adjusted to account for changes in circumstances for ongoing issues and the establishment of additional reserves for emerging issues 
while we believe that the current level of reserves is adequate  changes in the future could impact these determinations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk certain of our foreign subsidiaries enter into transactions in currencies other than their functional currency  primarily the us dollar and the euro 
a change in foreign currency exchange rates from balance sheet date levels could impact our income before income taxes by million and million at april  and april   respectively 
we also have foreign currency exposure arising from the translation of our net equity investment in our foreign subsidiaries to us dollars 
we generally view as long term our investments in foreign subsidiaries with functional currencies other than the us dollar 
the primary currencies to which we are exposed are the british pound  czech koruna  euro  maltese lira  and singapore dollar 
a change in foreign currency exchange rates from balance sheet date levels could impact our net foreign investments by million and million at april  and april   respectively
