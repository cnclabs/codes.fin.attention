table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview in fiscal we undertook a significant change in our strategic plan and related business operations by exiting the chewing gum business and refocusing entirely on the development  production and sale of over the counter pharmaceutical products 
in july  we sold substantially all of our assets and business related to our chewing gum operations to wrigley 
in december  we acquired the remaining interest of gel tech  making it a wholly owned subsidiary of matrixx 
in july  the name gel tech  llc was changed to zicam  llc 
our financial results reflect our former chewing gum operations as discontinued operations  and consequently these operations are not reflected in the following discussion and analysis 
we report zicam  llc s financial results on a consolidated basis 
we owned of zicam prior to december  and on and subsequent to that date 
our restructuring process continued in as we reincorporated in delaware  changed our name to matrixx initiatives  inc and consolidated our operations in our phoenix office 
moreover  as part of our focus on over the counter pharmaceutical products  we introduced five new zicam nasal gel products in  improved package graphics for the entire zicam product line and engaged a new sales team to represent our products to retailers 
we continued to expand the zicam product line in by introducing three zicam cold remedy oral products chewables  rapidmelts and oral mist 
executive summary net sales for increased to approximately million  or above net sales in approximately one half of the increase was attributable to increased sales of zicam cold remedy nasal gel products and approximately of the increase was attributable to the three new zicam cold remedy oral products introduced in september net sales in were impacted by a severe cold season that peaked in december however  we expect this trend of increasing net sales to continue as we improve consumer awareness of our products  increase distribution of our products  and introduce new products 
net income for was approximately million 
net income in was million including a one time tax benefit of approximately million 
net income in future periods will be significantly affected by the level of sales  and the timing and amount of our advertising and research and development expenses 
expenditures for advertising and research and development will vary by quarter throughout the year and could be significantly different in than the amounts incurred in the same periods in earlier years 
we expect that advertising expenses will be highest in the fourth and first quarters in conjunction with the cough and cold season 
the company s management reviews several key performance indicators 
first  we compare our annual sales and net income performance against our stated goal of annual growth for each 
for  we exceeded both goals ignoring the one time tax benefit in 
we also monitor our share of the cough and cold market 
for the twelve months ended december   sales of our products achieved a share of about of the entire cough and cold market compared to a share of a year ago 
we also measure our ability to maintain strong gross margins on our products 
during  our products averaged a gross margin of  which was slightly below our target minimum of due to the higher cost of the old swab product 
in  our gross margin averaged 
in addition  we evaluate our operating performance by reviewing  over time  our ability to decrease administrative and general costs as a percentage of net sales 
in  our administrative and general costs were of our net sales compared to for finally  we review the distribution of our products by key national 
table of contents retailers 
in  our largest customers carried  on average  six of our zicam products compared to three of our seven products in we expect to expand the distribution of our existing products among these retailers during the next year 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles applied on a consistent basis 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
we regularly evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that we use to prepare our consolidated financial statements 
in general  management s estimates are based on historical experience  on information from third party professionals and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances 
actual results could differ from those estimates made by management 
we believe that our critical accounting policies and estimates include the accounting for intangible assets and goodwill  accounting for income taxes  accounting for returns and allowances associated with our products and accounting for legal contingencies 
intangible assets and goodwill we recorded approximately million in goodwill in connection with the zicam  llc interest that we acquired from zensano  inc in december under sfas  goodwill must be tested annually to identify a potential impairment and the amount of any impairment loss 
factors that could affect this analysis would be significant loss of market share  a general decline in zicam product sales  higher than expected increases in expenses and various other matters 
any change in key assumptions about the business or prospects of zicam  llc  or any change in market conditions or other externalities affecting zicam  llc  could result in an impairment charge  and such a charge could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
the goodwill was recently evaluated in the third quarter of by an independent valuation firm and no impairment was found 
accounting for income taxes due to our significant operating losses prior to  we possess a sizeable tax loss carry forward which can be used to reduce our taxable income in future periods 
due to our history of operating losses  we recorded a deferred tax valuation allowance in and prior years to offset the entire deferred tax asset arising from our tax loss carry forward 
however  due to the significant improvement in our net income in  together with our expectation of continuing profitability in future years  we determined that we are more likely than not to realize the tax benefit associated with our tax loss carry forward 
consequently  we reduced the deferred tax valuation allowance and recorded a large portion of the deferred tax asset in the effect of this change was a decrease in our income tax expense of approximately million in in  we recorded income tax expense based on our estimated effective income tax rate for the year and will continue to do so in future periods 
in addition  we will continue to evaluate the deferred tax valuation allowance regularly and adjust the amount to reflect our expectation of our ability to realize the tax benefit arising from our tax loss carry forward on a quarterly basis 
should there be a significant change in our expectations of future income  the impact of adjusting the deferred tax valuation allowance could be significant which would negatively impact our earnings 

table of contents accounting for customer returns and allowances we recognize revenues on the sale of our products when they are shipped from our warehouse facility  and at that time record a provision for estimated product returns 
the estimate for product returns is based on our historical experience of sales to retailers and is reviewed regularly to ensure that it reflects the liability associated with product returns 
to date  our sales returns experience has been consistent with our estimate for returns  except for returns of outdated products arising from excess production during the introduction of zicam cold remedy in the cold season  which resulted in out of date product two years later 
currently  we are recording a provision of of gross sales for the seven zicam products introduced in or earlier for potential returns and allowances 
in establishing the appropriate reserve level for the three new zicam products introduced in the third quarter of  we reviewed the similarities and differences of the three products relative to the seven zicam products for which we now have several years of product return experience 
based on that review  we are recording a provision of gross sales for these products 
we will review the return provision regularly and adjust these reserve amounts as actual product return experience continues to develop 
should the actual level of product returns vary significantly from our estimates  our operating and financial results would be materially affected 
in addition  we expect that a higher sales returns allowance will be recorded in the future for any other new products that we introduce until such products achieve market acceptance 
legal contingencies we are subject to lawsuits  investigations and claims arising out of the normal conduct of our business 
while the outcome of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty  loss provisions arising from such matters will be recorded when a loss outcome is probable and can be reasonably estimated  to the extent not provided for through insurance or otherwise 
at present  we have not been able to determine the probability of a loss outcome in any of the litigation to which we are currently subject 
accordingly  we have not recorded any loss provisions related to such litigation 
results of operations for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  certain information is set forth below for our operations expressed in dollars and as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated 
table of contents years ended december  net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses research and development income loss from operations interest and other income net interest expense income before income taxes provision benefit for income taxes net income net sales 
net sales for increased to approximately million  or above net sales in approximately one half of the million increase in net sales was attributable to increases in sales of zicam cold remedy nasal gel products  particularly the swab products  approximately of the increase was due to the three new zicam cold remedy oral products introduced in  and the remainder of the increase was due to increased sales of zicam extreme congestion relief 
sales of zicam cold remedy nasal swab products increased due to the greater distribution and availability of supply in and a severe cold season 
zicam extreme congestion relief sales increased due to greater retail distribution of the product in sales of all of the products increased due to greater brand awareness resulting from our increased marketing efforts 
on average  our top customers  which account for approximately of our sales  carried six of our products in compared to three of our seven products in we expect to expand the distribution of our existing products in our principal sales focus is to secure additional retail acceptance  particularly among the major national drug  food and mass market retailers of all of our products 
we expect sales increases in future periods from continued  albeit lower  growth rates for our existing products and from the sale of new products that we plan to introduce in and future years 
we ended the year with a backlog in orders of million for our adult swab product 
in anticipation of year end demand  we built inventory of adult swab products starting in april  but it was not sufficient as demand for all of our products  including the swab products  spiked in december due to the severe cold season 
in february  we began shipping our new swab product  while we also continued to ship our old swab product 
as a result  we have eliminated the backlog for our adult swab product that existed in december and continued through february we will continue to ship the old swab product through the end of march we believe the new swab product can be produced at a higher rate than was possible for the old swab product and consequently we anticipate being able to avoid swab backlog issues in the cold season 

table of contents cost of sales the cost of sales for increased approximately million or over the increase was primarily due to an increase in unit sales 
the higher per unit cost of the swab products  including the higher cost agreed to in our previously announced settlement with innovative swab technologies  the manufacturer of the old swab product  contributed to the increase in cost of sales 
we expect that the cost of the new swab product that we introduced in the first quarter of will result in a lower per unit cost of that product in the future 
gross profit gross profit for increased to approximately million  or above the level  due to the higher sales level 
offsetting the higher sales was the higher unit cost of sales  primarily due to the higher cost of the swab products  which is reflected in a decrease in gross profit percentage of sales to in from in operating expenses operating expenses increased from approximately million in to million in the increase is largely due to higher advertising expense million in compared to million in  higher sales commission expense of million related to the increase in sales  and higher labor costs of million 
we believe that expense levels in future periods will be primarily affected by the timing and amount of advertising expenses and costs associated with new product introductions 
also  as a result of the recent litigation against the company described in more detail in item of this annual report on form k  we expect our insurance costs will increase when our product liability insurance policy is up for renewal in april research and development research and development expense amounted to million for compared to  for  reflecting costs associated with the three new zicam products that were introduced in  development cost of the new swab product  and research expense of product concepts that we expect to introduce in and beyond 
we expect to continue to invest approximately of net sales in research and development activities in order to continue to introduce new products in the future 
interest and other income net interest and other income for amounted to approximately  or approximately  less than the level 
approximately  of the decrease is due to a decline in royalty income associated with a gum product marketed by wrigley and  is due to a decrease in interest income from a lower invested cash balance 
interest expense interest expense decreased to approximately  for from approximately  in the decrease is entirely attributable to the repayment of the debt incurred with our acquisition of the interest in zicam  llc in december we currently have no debt outstanding 

table of contents income loss from continuing operations before income tax and minority interest our income before income taxes and minority interest in was approximately million  an increase of approximately million from the million reported for the increase is due to a higher gross profit resulting from higher net sales 
we expect that net income in future periods will be significantly impacted by the success of our current products  new product introductions including new products that we plan to introduce in and year over year changes in our advertising and research and development budgets 
provision for income tax expense due to the income we recorded in and our expectation of net income in future periods  we concluded that  more likely than not  we will be able to utilize the accumulated tax loss carry forward that had been generated in prior years but not reflected as an asset 
based on this determination  we recorded a decrease in the provision for income taxes of almost million in the income tax expense in reflects a full provision for income tax expenses at our combined federal and state tax rates 
results of operations for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  certain information is set forth below for our operations expressed in dollars and as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated years ended december  net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses research and development income loss from operations interest and other income net interest expense income loss before provision benefit income taxes and minority interest provision for income taxes minority interest net income loss from continuing operations net sales net sales for increased to approximately million  or above the sales level 
approximately one third of the million increase in net sales is attributable to increases in sales of zicam cold remedy and allergy relief  and the remaining two thirds to sales of the five new zicam products introduced in late sales of zicam cold remedy and allergy relief increased due 
table of contents primarily to increased sales to end use customers  and additionally  with respect to sales of the cold remedy product  to the addition of sales to two major club warehouse outlets 
we introduced five new zicam products in the third quarter of cold remedy swabs  cold remedy swabs kids size  extreme congestion relief  sinus relief and nasal moisturizer 
the swab products in december were in a back order situation due to the inability of our supplier to increase production  and to higher than expected demand for the adult swab product 
cost of sales the cost of sales for increased approximately million or over the increase was primarily due to a increase in unit sales 
the higher per unit cost of the swab products and premium production cost associated with the two swab products contributed to the increase in cost of sales 
a decrease in manufacturing costs of zicam cold remedy and zicam allergy relief partially offset this increase from the swab products 
gross profit gross profit for increased to approximately million  or above the level  due to the higher sales level 
offsetting the higher sales was the higher unit cost of sales  primarily due to the new swab products  which is reflected in a decrease in gross profit percentage of sales to in from in operating expenses operating expenses decreased from approximately million in to million in the decrease is largely due to the settlement and legal expenses of million that we incurred in related to a patent infringement lawsuit filed against the company by the quigley corporation 
our royalty obligations to quigley  which formed part of the settlement  ended in march a decrease in advertising and public relations expenses of approximately million between the two years also contributed to our lower operating expenses in offsetting these decreases were increased sales commission expense of  related to the higher level of sales  an increase of quality control expenses primarily due to the new product analysis  an increase in total labor expense of  higher rent expense of  reflecting a full year at our new corporate office location and higher depreciation and amortization of  research and development research and development expense amounted to  for  reflecting costs associated with the five new zicam products that were introduced in the year 
expenses in primarily reflect costs associated with our nicotine gum development which we undertook in conjunction with swedish match ab swedish match 
this development was terminated in the third quarter of following our exit from the gum business 
interest and other income net interest and other income for amounted to approximately  or approximately  above approximately  of the amount is royalty income and the remainder is largely interest income on our invested cash 
virtually all of the income was interest income reduced by a  write down of an investment in a company that matrixx had evaluated and rejected as a possible acquisition candidate 

table of contents our interest income is largely due to the company s invested cash position arising from the sale of our gum business in july to wrigley  reduced in by payments made in conjunction with our acquisition of the remaining interest in zicam  llc 
royalty income is from a dental gum product sold by wrigley 
we entered into the royalty agreement with wrigley in conjunction with the sale of our gum assets in july interest expense interest expense increased to approximately  for from approximately  in the increase is entirely attributable to imputed interest accrued under the note that we issued to zensano  inc now zengen  inc in connection with our acquisition of zensano s interest in zicam  llc in december income loss from continuing operations before income tax and minority interest our income before income taxes and minority interest in was approximately million  an increase of more than million from the net loss of million reported for the increase is due to a higher gross profit resulting from higher net sales and a decrease in operating expenses 
provision for income tax expense due to the income we recorded in and our expectation of net income in future periods  we concluded that  more likely than not  we will be able to utilize the accumulated tax loss carry forward that had been generated in prior years but not reflected as an asset 
based on this determination  we recorded a decrease in the provision for income taxes of almost million in income tax expense was further reduced in the period by an income tax refund of approximately  related to a change in tax laws in liquidity and capital resources our working capital increased million to approximately million at december  from approximately million at december   due primarily to cash provided from operations 
during  we experienced an increase in cash from operations of million due to an increase in net income of million  and various non cash charges to income of million including million of deferred income tax expense 
also contributing to the increase in cash from operations was an increase in accounts payable of million and sales returns and allowances of million 
these increases in cash were offset by an increase in accounts receivable of million and inventories of million 
cash flows from investing activities used million of cash due principally to tooling costs and prepayment for production of our new swab product 
cash flows from financing activities used million due to the repayment of our outstanding debt 
we have very little capital expenditures since we rely on contract manufacturers to produce our products 
therefore  to the extent our operations are profitable  our business is cash flow positive 
additionally  due to our sizeable tax loss carryforward  we are able to avoid sizeable income tax payments 
we expect that this ability to avoid large tax payments should continue through and we do have working capital requirements arising from the increase of inventory and accounts 
table of contents receivable in excess of the increase in accounts payable  but these vary throughout the year reflecting the seasonal nature of our business 
currently  we do not have any debt outstanding and do not have plans to incur additional debt in the future 
we have a million credit facility in place with comerica bank which was renewed for a two year term in may we do not currently have any borrowings outstanding under the facility and  due to our cash position  do not anticipate borrowing under the facility to meet our working capital requirements 
we are in compliance with the earnings and financial covenants contained in our credit agreement 
we believe that our existing capital resources and our credit line are sufficient to fund our operations and capital requirements for the next twelve months 
contractual obligations we have entered into certain long term contractual obligations that will require various payments over future periods as follows contractual cash obligations in thousands of dollars payments due by period as of december  less than after total year years years years long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term liabilities reflected on the company s balance sheet under gaap total recently issued accounting standards in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no

risk factors our new business focus means we have a limited operating history on which to assess our current and prospective performance although we have been in operations for a number of years  the significant change of direction and focus in our business that we made in by exiting the chewing gum business and refocusing entirely on the development  production and sale of over the counter pharmaceutical products presents a limited operating history upon which you may evaluate our current and prospective performance 
the possibility of our future success must be considered relative to the problems  challenges  complications 
table of contents and delays frequently encountered in connection with the development and operation of a new business  and the development and marketing of relatively new products such as the zicam products 
if our zicam products do not gain widespread market acceptance  our anticipated sales and results of operations will suffer although we believe that each of our products  and in particular our zicam cold remedy nasal products  offer unique benefits to consumers  we cannot be certain that any of these products will achieve widespread acceptance by the market 
in addition  given their recent introduction in late  our three new oral zicam products have not yet reached the level of market recognition achieved by the original zicam cold remedy nasal gel pump or swab products 
while we are working to increase the market presence of all of our products  we cannot be certain that demand for these products will grow 
if any unanticipated problem arises concerning the efficacy or safety of any of our products  or if any of our products fails to achieve widespread market acceptance for any other reason  our operating results and prospects would be materially adversely affected 
unanticipated problems associated with product development and commercialization could adversely affect our operating results our successful development of existing and new products is subject to the risks of failure and delay inherent in the development and commercialization of products based on innovative technologies 
these risks include the possibilities that we may experience unanticipated or otherwise negative research and development results  existing or proposed products may be found to be ineffective or unsafe  or may otherwise fail to receive required regulatory clearances or approvals  we may find that existing or proposed products  while effective  are uneconomical to commercialize or market  we may be unable to produce sufficient product inventories to meet customer demand  existing or proposed products do not achieve broad market acceptance  or proprietary rights held by third parties preclude us from developing or marketing existing or proposed products 
our inability to develop and commercialize our existing products or any new products on a timely basis and within our financial budgets could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and future prospects 
our inability to provide scientific proof for product claims may adversely affect our sales the marketing of our zicam products involves claims that these products assist in reducing the duration and severity of the common cold in the case of zicam cold remedy products and controlling allergy symptoms in the case of zicam allergy relief 
under fda and ftc rules  we are required to obtain scientific data to support any health claims we make concerning our products 
although we have neither provided nor been requested to provide any scientific data to the fda or ftc in support of claims regarding our zicam products  we have obtained scientific data for our products 
we cannot be certain  however  that the scientific data we have obtained in support of our claims will be deemed acceptable to 
table of contents the fda or ftc  should either agency request any such data in the future 
if the fda or the ftc requests any supporting information  and we are unable to provide support that is acceptable to the fda or the ftc  either agency could force us to stop making the claims in question or restrict us from selling the affected products 
fda and other government regulation may restrict our ability to sell our products we are subject to various federal  state and local laws and regulations affecting our business 
our zicam products are subject to regulation by the fda  including regulations with respect to labeling of products  approval of ingredients in products  claims made regarding the products  and disclosure of product ingredients 
if we do not comply with these regulations  the fda could force us to stop selling the affected products or require us to incur substantial costs in adopting measures to maintain compliance with these regulations 
our advertising claims regarding our products are subject to the jurisdiction of the ftc as well as the fda 
in both cases we are required to obtain scientific data to support any advertising or labeling health claims we make concerning our products  although no pre clearance or filing is required to be made with either agency 
if we are unable to provide the required support for such claims  the ftc may stop us from making such claims or require us to stop selling the affected products 
we may fail to compete effectively  particularly against larger  more established pharmaceutical and health products companies  causing our business and operating results to suffer the consumer health products industry is highly competitive 
we compete with companies in the united states and abroad that are engaged in the development of both traditional and innovative healthcare products 
many of these companies have much greater financial and technical resources and production and marketing capabilities than we do 
as well  many of these companies have already achieved significant product acceptance and brand recognition with respect to products that compete directly with our zicam products 
our competitors may successfully develop and market superior or less expensive products which could render our zicam and other future products less valuable or unmarketable 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property or if we infringe the intellectual property of others  our financial condition and future prospects could be materially harmed we rely significantly on the protections afforded by patent and trademark registrations that we routinely seek from the us patent and trademark office uspto and from similar agencies in foreign countries 
we cannot be certain that any patent or trademark application that we file will be approved by the uspto or other foreign agencies 
in addition  we cannot be certain that we will be able to successfully defend any trademark  trade name or patent that we hold against claims from  or use by  competitors or other third parties 
no consistent policy has emerged from the uspto or the courts regarding the breadth of claims allowed or the degree of protection afforded under biotechnology and similar patents 
our future success will depend on our ability to prevent others from infringing on our proprietary rights  as well as our ability to operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others 
we may be required at times to take legal action to protect our proprietary rights and  despite our best efforts  we may be sued for infringing on the patent rights of others 
patent litigation is costly and  even if we prevail  the cost of such litigation could adversely affect our financial condition 
if we do not prevail  in addition to any damages we might have to pay  we could be required to stop the infringing activity or obtain a license 
we cannot be certain that any required license would be available to us on acceptable terms  or at all 
if we fail to obtain a license  our business might be materially adversely affected 
in addition to seeking patent protection  we rely upon a combination of non disclosure agreements  other contractual restrictions and trade secrecy laws to protect proprietary information 
there can be no assurance that these steps will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of our proprietary information or 
table of contents that our competitors will not independently develop technology or trade secrets that compete with our proprietary information 
we may incur significant costs resulting from product liability claims we are subject to significant liability should use or consumption of our products cause injury  illness or death 
although we carry product liability insurance  we cannot be sure that our insurance will be adequate to protect us against product liability claims or that insurance coverage will continue to be available on reasonable terms 
in such regard  we may be required to structure self insurance against product liability claims 
any substantial increase in insurance premiums and or the costs of any such self insurance program would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
a product liability claim  such as those described above in this report on form k  even if without merit or for which we have substantial coverage  could result in significant legal defense costs  thereby increasing our expenses and lowering our earnings 
such a claim  whether or not proven to be valid  could have a material adverse effect on our product branding and goodwill  resulting in reduced market acceptance of our products 
this in turn could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
we do not have manufacturing capabilities of our own we currently do not have the physical or human resources to independently manufacture our zicam products or any other products that we may develop 
we currently outsource all of our product manufacturing and packaging operations and intend to continue this outsourcing for the foreseeable future 
if we are unable to enter into cost effective or otherwise suitable arrangements for manufacturing of our zicam products or any other products  or if our third party contractors fail to adequately perform their manufacturing operations as occurred with our old swab products  our sales and related financial results could be materially adversely affected 
if  in the future  we decide to establish our own manufacturing facilities  we will require substantial additional funds and significant additional personnel to undertake such operations 
we cannot be certain that such funding or a sufficient number of such qualified persons will be available for such an undertaking 
we may continue to experience product backlogs at the end of fiscal  we had approximately million in backlog of swab orders and at the end of fiscal  we had approximately million in backlog of swab orders 
we have undertaken significant measures to remedy the manufacturing problems that led to our backlog in and  including replacing our swab manufacturer and redesigning our swab product to permit higher volume production 
we also intend to build a substantial inventory of swab products to reduce the likelihood of any backlog of swab products occurring in the cough and cold season 
however  we cannot be certain that these measures will be sufficient to prevent future backlog of these products or that other product backlogs will not occur in the future 
any such future backlogs will potentially result in higher production costs  higher freight costs to expedite shipment of raw materials and finished goods  fines from certain retailers  cancelled orders and lost opportunity costs 
these in turn could materially affect our results of operations and financial condition our board of directors is authorized to issue shares of preferred stock that could have rights superior to our outstanding shares of common stock  and  if issued  could adversely impact the value of our common stock our certificate of incorporation permits our board of directors  in its sole discretion  to issue up to  shares of authorized but unissued preferred stock 
these shares may be issued by our board without further action by our shareholders  and may include any of the following rights among others as our board may determine  which rights may be superior to the rights of our outstanding common stock 
table of contents voting rights  including the right to vote as a class on particular matters  preferences as to dividends and liquidation rights  conversion rights  anti dilution protections  and redemption rights 
since our board of directors has the authority to determine  from time to time  the terms of our authorized preferred stock  there is no limit on the amount of common stock that could be issuable upon conversion of any future series of preferred stock that may be issued 
the rights of holders of our common stock will be subject to  and may be adversely affected by  the rights of the holders of any series of preferred stock that may be issued in the future 
in addition  the market price of our common stock may be adversely affected by the issuance of any series of preferred stock with voting or other rights superior to those of our common stock 
the issuance of any series of preferred stock could also have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding common stock 
the price of our stock may continue to be volatile the market price of our common stock  which is quoted for trading on the nasdaq national market  has been highly volatile and may continue to be volatile in the future 
any or a combination of the following factors could cause the market value of our common stock to decline quickly operating results that differ from market expectations  negative or other unanticipated results of clinical trials or other testing  delays in product development  technological innovations or commercial product introductions by our competitors  changes in government regulations  developments concerning proprietary rights  including pending or threatened patent litigation  public concerns regarding the safety of any of our products and general economic and stock market conditions 
these fluctuations have particularly affected the market prices of equity securities of small capitalization companies  like matrixx 
often  the effect on the price of such securities is disproportionate to the operating performance of such companies 
in our case  such broad market fluctuations may adversely affect our stockholders ability to dispose of their shares of matrixx at a price equal to or above the price at which they purchased such shares 
in addition  we believe our stock price has been impacted by a sizeable short position and resulting covering by investors with a short position in our stock 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary market risk exposure relates to our variable rate revolving line of credit with comerica bank california  which is described in the notes to our consolidated financial statements contained in this form k 
as of december   we did not have any outstanding balance against this line of credit 
during fiscal  the average outstanding balance on our prior line of credit on a daily basis was approximately  assuming future borrowings consistent with our average borrowings in  a hypothetical interest rate change of would increase our interest expense approximately  per year from the expense levels that we experienced in consequently  we believe that moderate interest rate increases will not have a material adverse impact on our results of operations or financial position in the foreseeable future 
as of december   we did not participate in any market risk sensitive commodity instruments for which fair value disclosure would be required under statement of financial accounting 
table of contents standards no 
we presently hold approximately million in short term us treasury securities which are not subject to material risk 
we believe that we are not subject in any material way to other forms of market risk  such as foreign currency exchange risk or foreign customer purchases of which there were none in or commodity price risk
