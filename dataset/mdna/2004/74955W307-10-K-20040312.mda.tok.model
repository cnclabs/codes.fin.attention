in connection with the spa acquisition  we incurred a significant amount of debt 
to take advantage of favorable market conditions and to ensure the timely consummation of the spa acquisition  we issued preferred stock in november and borrowed funds under certain debt instruments in december therefore  our cash and debt balances were unusually high at december  as compared to prior periods 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this item should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto that are included in item unless otherwise indicated  the terms company  donnelley  rhd  we  us and our refer to rh donnelley corporation and its direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries 
corporate overview we are the sixth largest directory publisher in the united states based on revenue 
we have been in the yellow pages business in various capacities for over years 
we now publish sprint branded  revenue generating yellow pages directories in states and have a total circulation of approximately million  serving approximately  local and  national advertisers 
through the dontech ii partnership dontech  our partnership with an affiliate of sbc communications inc sbc  we sell advertising for an additional sbc branded directories in illinois and northwest indiana with a total circulation of approximately million  serving approximately  local advertisers 
many local advertisers rely on the yellow pages directories as their primary or sole method of advertising 
on january   we acquired all the outstanding common stock of the various entities comprising sprint publishing and advertising spa  sprint corporation s sprint directory publishing business 
see spa acquisition below for a further description of the acquisition 
the acquisition transformed donnelley from a sales agent and pre press vendor into a leading publisher of yellow pages directories 
prior to the spa acquisition  we were one of the largest independent sales agents and pre press vendors for yellow pages advertising in the united states 
commencing in  our operating and financial results reflect our yellow pages publishing business  rather than our former business as a sales agent and pre press vendor for yellow pages advertising on behalf of other publishers  including spa 
as a publisher  we report the full value of advertising sales and certain direct costs under the deferral and amortization method 
as a sales agent and pre press vendor for yellow pages advertising  in and our revenue reflected sales commissions and pre press fees from  or other transactions with  our business partners  including spa  and our expenses were charged to earnings as incurred 
dontech remained unchanged following the spa acquisition  and our financial presentation of dontech is consistent for all periods presented in this annual report 
forward looking information certain statements contained in this annual report on form k regarding donnelley s future operating results  performance  business plans or prospects and any other statements not constituting historical fact are forward looking statements subject to the safe harbor created by the private securities litigation reform act of where possible  words such as believe  expect  anticipate  should  will  would  planned  estimates  potential  goal  outlook  may  predicts  could  or the negative of those words and other comparable expressions  are used to identify such forward looking statements 
actual events or results may differ materially 
in evaluating those statements  you should specially consider various factors  including the risks and uncertainties discussed below 
those factors may cause our actual results to differ materially from any of rhd s forward looking statements 
all forward looking statements attributable to us or a person on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement 
all forward looking statements reflect only our current beliefs and assumptions with respect to our future results  business plans  and prospects  and are based solely on information currently available to us 
although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward looking statements are reasonable  we cannot guarantee future results  levels of activity or performance 
these forward looking statements are made as of the date of this annual report and  except as required under the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations of the sec  we assume no obligation to update or revise them or to provide reasons why actual results may differ 
such risks  uncertainties and contingencies include  without limitation  the following our ability to meet substantial debt service obligations we have a substantial amount of debt and significant debt service obligations in and thereafter 
as of december   we had total outstanding debt of  million 
see liquidity and capital resources below for further details regarding our debt obligations and instruments 
as a result of our significant amount of debt and debt service obligations  we face increasing risks associated with  but not limited to  the following our ability to obtain additional financing in excess of the borrowing capacity under our million revolving credit facility the revolver on satisfactory terms to fund working capital requirements  capital expenditures  acquisitions  investments  debt service requirements and other general corporate requirements is limited  we are more vulnerable to general economic downturns  competition and industry conditions  which could place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that are less leveraged  we face increased exposure to rising interest rates as a portion of our debt is at variable interest rates  we have reduced availability of cash flow to fund working capital requirements  capital expenditures  acquisitions  investments and other general corporate requirements because a substantial portion of our cash flow will be needed to service our debt obligations  and we have limited flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry in which we operate 
our ability to pay principal and interest on our debt obligations will depend upon our future operating performance and our ability to refinance debt 
if we are unable to service our debt and fund our business  we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures  seek additional debt financing or equity capital  restructure or refinance our debt or sell assets 
we cannot assure you that we would be able to obtain additional financing  refinance existing debt or sell assets on satisfactory terms or at all 
restrictive covenants under our debt and preferred stock agreements the indentures governing our senior notes senior notes due and senior subordinated notes subordinated notes due collectively  the notes and our senior secured credit facility  as amended credit facility  include a number of significant restrictive covenants 
see liquidity and capital resources below for further details regarding our debt instruments 
these covenants could adversely affect us by limiting our ability to plan for or react to market conditions or to meet our capital needs 
these covenants  among other things  restrict our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur additional debt  pay dividends on our equity interests or repurchase equity interests  make certain investments  enter into certain types of transactions with affiliates  limit dividends or other payments by our restricted subsidiaries to us  use assets as security in other transactions  and sell certain assets or merge with or into other companies 
in addition  the credit facility includes other and more restrictive covenants and prohibits us from prepaying the notes while borrowings under the credit facility are outstanding 
the credit facility also requires us to maintain certain financial ratios and meet other financial tests 
the failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default  which  if not cured or waived  could require us to repay these borrowings before their scheduled due date 
if we were unable to make this repayment or otherwise refinance these borrowings  the lenders under the credit facility could foreclose on our assets  substantially all of which have been subjected to security interests in favor of the lenders under the credit facility 
in addition  these lenders could elect to declare all amounts borrowed under the credit facility  together with accrued interest  to be due and payable  which  in some instances  would be an event of default under the indentures governing the notes 
if we were unable to refinance these borrowings on favorable terms  our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted by increased costs and less favorable terms  including rates and covenants 
any future refinancing of the credit facility is likely to contain similar restrictive covenants 
furthermore  the terms of the purchase agreement with respect to our redeemable  convertible  cumulative preferred stock preferred stock  among other things  restricts our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur additional debt  enter into major corporate transactions  pay dividends on shares of our common stock or repurchase shares of our common stock  enter into certain types of transactions with affiliates  and sell or acquire certain assets 
our failure to comply with these terms would result in a breach of this agreement  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
in addition  without the consent of the holders of our preferred stock  we cannot issue shares of common stock for months following the spa acquisition  which could adversely affect our liquidity see liquidity and capital resources for a further description of the preferred stock 
usage of print yellow pages directories and changes in technology from to  overall references to print yellow pages directories in the united states declined  however  overall references to print yellow pages directories have remained stable over the past three years 
we believe the past decline was primarily a result of demographic shifts among consumers  particularly the increase of households in which english was not the primary language spoken 
we also believe that the past decline was attributable to increased usage of internet based directory products  particularly in business to business and retail categories  as well as the proliferation of very large retail stores for which consumers and businesses may not reference the yellow pages 
any declines in usage could impair our ability to maintain or increase advertising prices  cause businesses that purchase advertising in our yellow pages directories to reduce or discontinue those purchases  and discourage businesses that do not purchase advertising in our yellow pages directories from doing so 
any of the factors that may contribute to a decline in usage of our print directories  or a combination of them  could impair our revenues and have a material adverse effect on our business 
the yellow pages directory advertising business is subject to changes arising from developments in technology  including information distribution methods and users technological preferences 
the use of the internet by consumers as a means to transact commerce may result in new technologies being developed and services being provided that could compete with our products and services 
as a result of these factors  our growth and future financial performance may depend on our ability to develop and market new products and services and create new distribution channels  while enhancing existing products  services and distribution channels  to incorporate the latest technological advances and accommodate changing user preferences  including the use of the internet 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to provide services over the internet successfully or that we will be able to compete successfully with other internet based directory services 
in addition  if we fail to anticipate or respond adequately to changes in technology and user preferences or are unable to finance the capital expenditures necessary to respond to such changes  our results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
sbc s or dontech s actions could adversely impact our business dontech is donnelley s perpetual partnership with an affiliate of sbc 
donnelley and dontech have a variety of perpetual contractual relationships with sbc 
pursuant to the partnership agreement and the other existing contractual arrangements  dontech is the exclusive sales agent in perpetuity for the yellow pages directories published by sbc in illinois and northwest indiana 
donnelley s income with respect to dontech is comprised of two components our interest in the net profits of dontech and revenue participation income received from an affiliate of sbc 
our partnership income related to dontech is expected to represent approximately to of our total operating income 
as the exclusive sales agent for local advertising  dontech is responsible for the management of its sales force  including compensation  recruiting and training and other sales related matters 
as the publisher  sbc has responsibility for and control over all other matters  including  without limitation  product development  national advertising  print and distribution  pricing  scheduling  marketing and advertising  billing  collections  credit and customer service 
while we believe that dontech and its economic interests are generally aligned with those of sbc with respect to sbc s yellow pages directory operations  sbc could implement policies and decisions in which dontech or we would likely have little or no participation or influence and or perform its obligations in a manner that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition and  potentially  on our relationship with sbc 
we cannot assure you that any such policies or decisions would not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition or our relationship with sbc 
we also maintain a large receivable balance from sbc  which was million as of december   and any liquidity difficulties that sbc may experience could materially impact our results of operations or financial condition and liquidity 
the dontech partnership agreement and related sbc contractual arrangements have perpetual terms 
these arrangements only terminate upon the occurrence of certain enumerated events  including  without limitation  the unremedied breaches of certain material provisions thereof  the mutual agreement of the parties  the bankruptcy of a partner or parent or a change in control of a partner excluding a change in control of the ultimate parent company of the partner 
in addition  under applicable law  the contractual arrangements potentially may not remain in effect in perpetuity 
we cannot assure you that the dontech relationship will remain in full force and effect into perpetuity  without material modification or at all  that dontech and sbc will perform all of their respective material obligations particularly payment obligations under these agreements or that sbc will not seek to terminate these arrangements 
in the event any such party seeks to terminate these contractual arrangements  the other party may dispute such attempted termination and  in such case  a court or arbitrator may be required to determine the appropriateness of any such attempted termination  and we cannot assure you as to the outcome of any such proceeding 
any such termination or material modification of the agreements or failure by sbc or dontech to perform their respective material obligations would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
competition the united states directory advertising industry is highly competitive 
approximately of total united states directory advertising sales are attributable to regional bell operating company rboc directory publishers that typically publish directories where they offer local phone service 
in addition  more than independent publishers operating in the united states compete with those rboc publishers 
in nearly all markets  we compete with one or more yellow pages directory publishers  which are predominantly independent publishers 
in some markets  we compete on a limited basis with rboc directory publishers in adjacent markets 
one of these publishers  verizon information services  the directory business affiliated with verizon communications  inc  has begun to publish directories and offer local internet directory services in markets beyond where verizon communications offers local phone service  including certain markets where we publish directories 
effectively  verizon information services is competing as an independent publisher in those markets 
while no other rboc publisher has announced similar plans  no assurance can be given that other rboc publishers will not do so in the future 
many of these rboc publishers are larger than us and have greater financial resources than we have 
no assurances can be given that we will be able to compete effectively with these other publishers for advertising sales or acquisitions in the future 
we also compete for advertising sales with other media  including newspapers  magazines  radio  direct mail  the internet and television 
additionally  advances in technology have brought new participants  new products and new channels to the industry  including increasing use of electronic delivery of traditional directory information eg  yahoo yellow pages and electronic search engines services eg  google as an advertising medium 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully in responding to any such developments 
many of these competitors are larger than us and have greater financial resources than we have 
in addition  the telecommunications act of opened local telephone markets to increased competition  which may adversely impact the market position of the telephone utilities  including sprint and sbc 
in addition  federal communication commission rules regarding local number portability  advances in communications technology such as wireless devices and voice over internet protocol and demographic factors potential shifts in younger generations away from wireline telephone communications towards wireless or other communications technologies may further erode the market position of telephone utilities  including sprint and sbc 
as a result  we cannot assure you that sprint or sbc will remain the primary local telephone service provider in its local service areas 
if sprint were no longer the primary local telephone service provider in any particular local service area  our license to be the exclusive publisher in its markets and to use the sprint brand name on our directories in those markets may not be as valuable as we presently anticipate  and we may not realize some of the anticipated benefits under our commercial arrangements with sprint 
if sbc were no longer the primary local telephone service provider in any dontech service area  the financial results we recognize from dontech could be adversely affected 
reliance on  and extension of credit to  small and medium sized businesses approximately of our directory advertising revenue is derived from selling advertising to small and medium sized businesses 
in the ordinary course of our yellow pages publishing business  we extend credit to these advertisers for advertising purchases 
small and medium sized businesses  however  tend to have fewer financial resources and higher failure rates than large businesses 
the proliferation of very large retail stores may continue to harm small and medium sized businesses 
we believe these limitations are significant contributing factors to having advertisers in any given year not renew their advertising in the following year 
in addition  full or partial collection of delinquent accounts can take an extended period of time 
consequently  we could be adversely affected by our dependence on and our extension of credit to small and medium sized businesses 
dependence on third party providers of printing  distribution and delivery services we depend on third parties for the printing and distribution of our directories 
we are a party to two contracts with rr donnelley for the printing of our directories 
printing is one of our largest costs items accounting for approximately of our total operating and general and administrative expenses 
although these contracts do not expire until december and december  because of the large print volume and specialized binding of directories  there are a limited number of companies capable of servicing our printing needs 
accordingly  the inability or unwillingness of rr donnelley to provide printing services to us on acceptable terms or at all could have a material adverse effect on our business 
no common ownership or other business affiliation exists between rr donnelley and us 
we are a party to contracts with two companies for the distribution of our directories 
although these contracts are scheduled to expire in february  either vendor may terminate its contract with us upon days written notice 
there are a limited number of companies capable of servicing our delivery needs 
accordingly  the inability or unwillingness of our current vendors to provide delivery services to us on acceptable terms or at all could have a material adverse effect on our business 
general economic factors our business results could be adversely affected by a prolonged national or regional economic recession 
we derive substantially all of our revenue from the sale of advertising in directories 
typically  our advertising revenues  as well as those of yellow pages publishers in general  do not fluctuate widely with economic cycles 
however  a prolonged national or regional economic recession could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
as a result  we may experience lower than expected revenues for our business in the future 
in addition  any residual economic effects of  and uncertainties regarding the terrorist attacks that occurred on september   the general possibility  express threat or future occurrence of similar terrorist or other related disruptive events  and the united states involvement in military conflict especially with respect to the major markets in which we operate that depend heavily upon travel  tourism or the military  could also adversely affect our business 
fluctuations in the price and availability of paper our principal raw material is paper 
we currently have one contract for the purchasing of paper 
this agreement is effective through december  and can be terminated by either party if a material breach of the agreement occurs and is not cured by the breaching party within days of written notice 
the price of the paper was set at inception and increases at various dates during the term of the agreement 
should the market price of the paper drop below the set prices  both parties are obligated to negotiate in good faith a lower paper price 
we are subject to delays in receiving this principal raw material 
further  changes in the supply of  or demand for  paper could affect market prices or delivery times 
paper is one of our largest cost items accounting for approximately to of our total operating and general and administrative expenses 
we cannot assure you that we will have available necessary raw materials at reasonable prices or that any increases in paper costs would not have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
the sale of advertising to national accounts is coordinated by third parties that we do not control approximately of our directory advertising revenues are derived from the sale of advertising to national or large regional companies  such as rental car companies  automobile repair shops and pizza delivery businesses  each of whom generally purchases advertising in several of our directories 
substantially all of the revenue derived from national accounts is serviced through certified marketing representatives cmrs with whom we contract 
cmrs are independent third parties that act as agents for national companies and design their advertisements  arrange for the placement of those advertisements in directories and provide billing services 
as a result  our relationships with these national advertisers depend significantly on the performance of these third party cmrs whom we do not control 
although we believe that our relationships with these cmrs have been mutually beneficial  if some or all of the cmrs with whom we have established relationships were unable or unwilling to provide services to us on acceptable terms or at all  such inability or unwillingness could materially adversely affect our business 
during  we began acting as a cmr directly placing certain national advertising 
no assurance can be given that such development will not adversely impact our relationships with cmrs or expose us to possible legal claims from cmrs 
we are also subject to credit risk with cmrs with whom we contract 
turnover among our sales force or key management our ability to achieve our business plan depends to a significant extent on our ability to identify  hire  train and retain qualified sales personnel in each of the regions in which we operate 
we expend a significant amount of resources and management time on identifying and training our account executives 
our ability to attract and retain qualified sales personnel depends on numerous factors  including some outside of our control  such as conditions in the local employment markets in which we operate 
a decrease in the number of account executives could adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition and liquidity  as well as our ability to service our debt 
furthermore  we depend on the continued services of key personnel  including our experienced senior management team as well as our regional sales management personnel 
although we believe that we could replace our senior management team and other key employees within a reasonable time period should the need arise  the loss of these key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business 
the loss of important intellectual property rights some trademarks such as the sprint and donnelley brand names and other intellectual property rights are important to our business 
we rely upon a combination of copyright and trademark laws as well as contractual arrangements  including licensing agreements  particularly with respect to sprint markets  to establish and protect our intellectual property rights 
we are required from time to time to bring lawsuits against third parties to protect our intellectual property rights 
similarly  from time to time  we are party to proceedings whereby third parties challenge our rights 
we cannot be sure that any lawsuits or other actions brought by us will be successful or that we will not be found to infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties 
although we are not aware of any material infringements of any trademark rights that are significant to our business  any lawsuits  regardless of their outcome  could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
in addition  we only have rights to use the sprint name and diamond logo in certain markets 
the loss of important intellectual property rights such as trademarks could have a material adverse effect upon our business  financial condition and results of operations 
impact of bankruptcy proceedings against sprint or its affiliates during the term of the commercial arrangements contract rights under the directory services license agreement  trademark license agreement and non competition agreement with sprint and its affiliates constitute a substantial portion of our commercial arrangements with sprint and its affiliates 
pursuant to these commercial arrangements  we are the exclusive directory publisher for sprint in the markets where sprint provided telephone service at the time of the agreements 
if a bankruptcy case were to be commenced by or against sprint  it is possible that all or part of the directory services license agreement and or non competition agreement could be considered an executory contract and could therefore be subject to rejection by sprint or a trustee appointed in a bankruptcy case pursuant to section or section of the united states bankruptcy code 
if one or more of these agreements were rejected  the applicable agreement may not be specifically enforceable  in which case we would have only an unsecured claim for damages against sprint for the breach of contract resulting from the rejection 
if the directory services license agreement were rejected  we would  among other things  no longer be entitled to be sprint s exclusive publisher of telephone directories in the affected markets 
we could also lose our right to enforce the provisions of the agreement under which we have the right to license trademarks of successor local exchange carriers in the sprint markets 
if the non competition agreement were rejected and specific enforcement were not available  sprint would  among other things  no longer be precluded from publishing print telephone directories or selling local directory advertising in the applicable restricted markets 
in connection with the spa acquisition  sprint created a bankruptcy remote special purpose vehicle in the form of a limited liability company and contributed and assigned the trademarks being licensed to us under the trademark license agreement to this limited liability company 
the operating agreements of this limited liability company require  among other things  that the board of managers of this entity include one independent manager that is unaffiliated with sprint 
the consent of this independent manager is required for the entity to take certain actions  including  among other things  commencement of a bankruptcy proceeding 
because the trademarks were contributed to this limited liability company  our rights under the trademark license agreement are not subject to rejection in the event of a bankruptcy proceeding involving sprint unless there is also a bankruptcy proceeding involving this limited liability company 
although we believe that the likelihood of this entity being the subject of a bankruptcy proceeding is limited by this structure and the governing provisions of the operating agreement  if the trademark license agreement were rejected in a bankruptcy proceeding  we would lose the right to use the sprint brand name for the former spa directories we now publish in those markets 
we cannot assure you that any loss of rights under certain of these arrangements with sprint and its affiliates would not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
our inability to enforce the non competition agreement with sprint in connection with the spa acquisition  sprint entered into a non competition agreement with us 
the non competition agreement prohibits sprint in the markets where sprint provided local telephone service at the time of the transaction from selling local directory advertising or producing  publishing and distributing print directories  with certain limited exceptions 
however  under state and federal law  a covenant not to compete is only enforceable to the extent it is necessary to protect a legitimate business interest of the party seeking enforcement  if it does not unreasonably restrain the party against whom enforcement is sought  and if it is not contrary to the public interest 
enforceability of a non competition covenant is determined by a court based on all of the facts and circumstances of the specific case at the time enforcement is sought 
for this reason  it is not possible for us to predict whether  or to what extent  a court will enforce sprint s covenants not to compete against us during the term of the non competition agreement 
if a court were to determine that the non competition agreement is unenforceable  sprint could compete directly against us in the directory publishing business in the previously restricted markets 
we cannot assure you that our inability to enforce the non competition agreement with sprint would not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
spa acquisition on january   we completed the acquisition of spa for billion in cash  including post acquisition working capital adjustments 
to finance the acquisition  we entered into a new  million credit facility  consisting of a million term loan a  a million term loan b and a million revolver 
we also issued million senior notes and million senior subordinated notes 
additionally  we issued million of preferred stock and warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock to partnerships affiliated with the goldman sachs group  inc collectively  the gs funds 
to take advantage of favorable market conditions and to ensure the timely consummation of the spa acquisition  we issued the notes and borrowed the term loan b in december the total gross proceeds of  million were deposited and held in escrow pending the spa acquisition closing 
we issued million of preferred stock and warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock  with an exercise price of per share in november to the gs funds 
at the closing of the spa acquisition  we issued an additional million of preferred stock and warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock  with an exercise price of per share to the gs funds 
additionally  we borrowed the term loan a and million under the revolver on the closing date 
in connection with the transaction  we entered into a directory services license agreement  a trademark license agreement and a non competition agreement with sprint 
the directory services license agreement gives us the exclusive right to produce  publish and distribute directories for sprint in the markets where sprint provided local telephone service 
the trademark license agreement gives us the exclusive right to use certain sprint trademarks  including the sprint diamond logo  in those markets 
the non competition agreement prohibits sprint in those markets from selling local directory advertising or producing  publishing and distributing print directories  with certain limited exceptions 
these agreements are all interrelated and each has initial terms of years  subject to earlier termination under specified circumstances 
prior to the acquisition  we provided sales agency and pre press publishing services to spa and received a priority distribution from cendon llc  a partnership between us and centel directory company centel an affiliate of sprint 
accordingly  at december   we had an aggregate receivable of million for commissions  pre press publishing fees and priority distribution income from spa 
as a result of the acquisition  these receivables became part of the purchase price 
also  other long term liabilities at december  included an amount due to sprint of million  which we paid in cash at the closing 
the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase business combination and the purchase price was allocated to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values on the acquisition date 
the results of the former spa business are included in our consolidated results from and after january  the allocation of the purchase price to the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is shown in the table below 
the purchase price allocation below reflects the initial allocation and subsequent purchase price adjustments made in amounts in millions calculation of allocable purchase price cash allocable transaction costs total allocable purchase price allocation of purchase price directory services agreements customer relationships trade names spa net assets acquired fair value adjustments reverse pre acquisition deferred revenue reverse deferred allowance for doubtful accounts and sales claims included in spa s opening deferred revenue reverse deferred directory costs associated with directories published pre acquisition eliminate spa historical deferred tax and goodwill other fair value of tangible net assets acquired goodwill total cash purchase price allocable transaction costs total allocable purchase price segment reporting we revised our historical segment reporting in the first quarter of to reflect the change in the business that resulted from the spa acquisition and to reflect the way management now reviews and analyzes the business 
our reportable operating segments are now donnelley and dontech 
the donnelley segment includes the revenue from our sprint branded yellow pages directories and our pre press publishing services  and all operating and administrative expenses 
the dontech segment includes revenue participation income and our interest in the net profits of dontech 
donnelley as the publisher of yellow pages directories  directory revenue is recognized under the deferral and amortization method based on the annual billing value of the advertisements sold in a directory publication sales  subject to a provision for sales claims and allowances 
revenue from the sale of such advertising is deferred when a directory is published and recognized ratably over the life of a directory  which is typically months 
certain costs directly related to selling and production of directories are also deferred when incurred and recognized ratably over the life of a directory 
these costs include sales commissions and print  paper and initial distribution costs 
we also earn revenue from pre press publishing and billing services provided to sbc for the yellow pages directories for which dontech sells advertising and from sbc for sales related computer application services provided to dontech 
the fees received for these services are included in our donnelley segment  as they relate more to our pre press publishing services than dontech sales activities 
dontech dontech is a perpetual partnership with an operating unit of sbc 
dontech acts as the exclusive sales agent for yellow pages directories published by sbc in illinois and northwest indiana and earns a commission from sbc at the time a sales contract is signed 
we account for our investment in dontech under the equity method and record our income from dontech as partnership income 
our reported income from dontech is comprised of our interest in the net profits of dontech and revenue participation income received directly from an affiliate of sbc 
revenue participation income is based on a percentage of dontech advertising sales and comprises approximately to of the total annual income related to dontech 
total income from dontech accounted for  and of total operating income before depreciation and amortization for the years ended december   and  respectively 
certain general and administrative expenses incurred to support this business are not allocated to the dontech segment  but we believe such expenses are not material to our segment reporting 
prospectively  because of the acquisition  dontech income is expected to represent approximately to of our total operating income 
as income from dontech accounts for a significant portion of our operating income  a material decline in the advertising sales of dontech would likely have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
we also provide certain pre press publishing services for those sbc directories for which dontech sells advertising  the income from which is included in our donnelley segment as described above 
the dontech partnership is considered a separate operating segment because  among other things  the partnership has its own board of directors and the employees of dontech  including its officers and managers  are not our employees 
the spa transaction did not affect our partnership with sbc  and dontech continues to act as a sales agent for sbc 
further  we have consistently accounted for our partnership interest in dontech under the equity method 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires management to estimate the effect of various matters that are inherently uncertain as of the date of the financial statements 
each of these estimates varies in regard to the level of judgment involved and its potential impact on the company s reported financial results 
estimates are deemed critical when a different estimate could have reasonably been used or when changes in the estimate are reasonably likely to occur from period to period  and could materially impact the company s financial condition  changes in financial condition or results of operations 
the company s significant accounting polices are discussed in note of the consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report 
the critical estimates inherent in these accounting polices are discussed below 
allowance for doubtful accounts and sales claims we record our revenue net of an allowance for sales claims 
in addition  we record a provision for bad debts 
the provision for bad debts and allowance for sales claims is estimated for each directory based on historical experience 
we also evaluate the current condition of our customer balances  bankruptcy filings  historical charge off patterns  recovery rates and other data when determining our allowance for doubtful accounts reserve 
we review these estimates periodically to assess whether additional adjustment is needed based on economic events or other circumstances  including actual experience at the end of the billing and collection cycle with respect to each directory 
we believe that the allowance for doubtful accounts and sales claims is adequate to cover anticipated losses under current conditions  however  significant deterioration in any of the factors noted above or in the overall economy could materially change these expectations 
the provisions for sales claims and doubtful accounts are estimated based on a percentage of revenue 
accordingly  an additional change in either of these allowance percentages would impact net income by approximately million annually 
pension benefits our pension plan obligations and related assets of our defined benefit retirement plans are presented in note to our consolidated financial statements 
plan assets consist primarily of marketable equity and debt instruments and are valued using market quotations 
plan obligations and annual pension expense are determined by independent actuaries and through the use of a number of assumptions 
key assumptions in measuring the plan obligations include the discount rate  the rate of future salary increases and the long term expected return on plan assets 
in determining the discount rate  we look at yields on high quality  fixed income investments with maturities corresponding to the anticipated timing of the benefit payments 
salary increase assumptions are based upon historical experience and anticipated future management actions 
asset returns are based upon the anticipated average rate of earnings expected on invested funds of the plan over the long run 
at december   the weighted average actuarial assumptions were discount rate of  long term rate of return on plan assets of  and assumed salary increases of 
net periodic pension costs recognized in were million 
a change in the discount rate would affect net income by approximately million  a change in the long term rate of return on plan assets would affect net income by approximately million  and a change in assumed salary increases would affect net income by approximately million 
intangible assets and goodwill valuation and amortization our intangible assets consist of directory service agreements between the company and sprint  established customer relationships  trade names  all resulting from the spa acquisition 
the intangible assets are being amortized over the period the assets are expected to contribute to the cash flow of the company  which reflect the expected pattern of benefit 
our recorded goodwill resulted from the spa acquisition and is not subjected to amortization 
the intangible assets are subject to an impairment test in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas  and the goodwill is subject to an impairment test in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
the company reviews the carrying value of its intangible assets for impairment at least annually or sooner whenever events or circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable 
the impairment test for the intangible assets is performed by comparing the carrying amount of the intangible assets to the sum of the undiscounted expected future cash flows 
in accordance with sfas  impairment exists if the sum of the future undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the intangible asset  or to its related group of assets 
impairment would result in a write down of the intangible asset to its estimated fair value based on the discounted future cash flows 
goodwill is tested for impairment by comparing the carrying amount of the reporting unit to which it was assigned to the estimated fair value of the reporting unit 
in accordance with sfas  impairment exists if the carrying amount of the reporting unit is less than its estimated fair value 
impairment would result in a write down equal to the difference between the carrying amount and the estimated fair value of the reporting unit 
we used certain estimates and assumptions in our impairment evaluation  including  but not limited to  projected future cash flows  revenue growth  customer attrition levels  and estimated write offs 
as of december   management believes that there was no impairment to the intangible assets or goodwill 
however  significant deterioration in our business  the assumptions underlying the impairment evaluations  or in the overall economy  could result in impairment charges in future reporting periods 
had the aggregate net book value of the intangible assets as of december  been impaired by  net income would have been impacted by approximately million 
additionally  management must assess whether the remaining useful lives of the intangible assets represent the period that the intangible assets are expected to contribute to the cash flow of the company 
in our assessment process  we used certain estimates and assumptions  including projected future cash flows  customer attrition levels and industry and economic conditions 
in accordance with sfas  we evaluate the remaining useful lives annually to determine whether events or circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization 
if the estimated remaining useful lives change  the remaining carrying amount of the intangible asset would be amortized prospectively over that revised remaining useful life 
for the year ended december   amortization of intangible assets was approximately million 
should the remaining useful lives of the intangible assets be shortened by  net income would be impacted by approximately million 
each of these critical accounting estimates pertains only to the donnelley segment  as further described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report 
we do not believe we make any critical accounting estimates with respect to our dontech segment 
management believes the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate these amounts in the company s consolidated financial statements are appropriate 
new accounting pronouncements in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity sfas 
this statement established standards for the classification and measurement of certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
the statement was effective july  our preferred stock represents a financial instrument with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
we have applied the provisions of sfas and determined that the classification and measurement of our preferred stock is appropriate 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin 
in general  a variable interest entity is a corporation  partnership  trust or any other legal structure used for business purposes that either a does not have equity investors with voting rights or b has equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities 
fin requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
the consolidation requirements of fin apply immediately to variable interest entities created after january  we adopted the provisions of fin effective february  and such adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements because we currently have no variable interest entities 
in december  the fasb issued fin r with respect to variable interest entities created before january   which  among other things  revised the implementation date to the first fiscal year or interim period ending after march   with the exception of special purpose entities spe 
the consolidation requirements apply to all spes in the first fiscal year or interim period ending after december  we adopted the provisions of fin r effective december and such adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements because we currently have no spes

 amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
sfas amends and clarifies accounting for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities under sfas sfas is effective for contracts and hedging relationships entered into or modified after june  we adopted the provisions of sfas effective june  and such adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements

 interim financial reporting apb  to require disclosures about such effects in interim financial information 
we adopted the disclosure provisions of sfas in the first quarter of on december   the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of the act was signed into law 
the act introduces prescription drug care benefits under medicare and also allows for certain sponsors of postretirement benefit plans with a drug benefit to receive a non taxable federal subsidy if certain criteria are met 
in response to the passage of this legislation  on january   the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp no 
fas  accounting and disclosure requirements related to the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of the fsp permits employers that sponsor postretirement benefit plans that provide prescription drug benefits to retirees to make a one time election to defer accounting for any effects of the act 
in accordance with the fsp  donnelley has elected to defer accounting for any effects of the act and accordingly  any measures of the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation or net periodic postretirement benefit cost in the financial statements and as disclosed in note benefits plans do not reflect the effects of the act on donnelley s plans 
authoritative guidance on the accounting for the federal subsidy is currently being considered by the fasb that  when issued  could require us to change previously reported information 
in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no

revised as of december  results of operations year ended december  compared to the year ended december  factors affecting comparability spa acquisition because of the spa acquisition  the related financing and associated accounting  our results prepared in accordance with gaap are not comparable to our gaap results previously reported 
also  because purchase accounting rules precluded us from recognizing revenue and certain expenses for those directories that published prior to the acquisition  including all january published directories  revenue and certain expenses reported in are not representative of revenue and certain expenses that would have been reported in absent these purchase accounting adjustments 
accordingly  in addition to a discussion of the reported gaap results compared to the reported gaap results  we are also providing a comparison of adjusted results  which  among other things  exclude the effect of purchase accounting on deferred revenue and certain expenses  to adjusted pro forma results  which assumes the acquisition occurred on january  for a detailed discussion of adjusted revenue and certain expenses versus adjusted pro forma revenue and certain expenses  which are more comparable to each other  as well as a detailed discussion of advertising sales  which drive revenue  see adjusted and pro forma amounts and other non gaap measures below

see results of operations year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  below for a further description of these amounts 
net revenue the components of our net revenue in and were as follows amounts in millions change directory advertising revenue advertising sales commission revenue sales allowances net directory revenue pre press publishing fees other revenue total revenue is derived entirely from our donnelley segment since dontech is accounted for under the equity method 
subsequent to the acquisition of spa  revenue from directory advertising sales is recognized under the deferral and amortization method  whereby revenue from advertising sales is initially deferred when the directory is published and recognized ratably over the directory s life  which is typically months 
pre press publishing fees and other revenue are recognized when earned 
total net revenue in was million as compared to million in the increase in total net revenue in is a result of the spa acquisition 
from the date of the acquisition on january   our revenue was earned primarily from the sale of advertising in yellow pages directories we published in  totaling million  net of sales allowances 
as a result of the acquisition  we became the publisher of sprint branded directories 
as the publisher  we earn the entire value of the sales contract with the advertiser  subject to an allowance for sales claims 
prior to the acquisition  we were a sales agent and earned only a commission on the advertising sales contract that was recognized when the advertiser signed the contract and we earned this revenue on directories as opposed to the directories we now publish 
during  our net revenue represented only the commissions we earned as a sales agent on advertising sales made on behalf of spa totaling million  net of allowances for sales claims 
revenue from pre press publishing services was million in as compared to million in the decrease of million is primarily due to the consolidation of spa s operating results with ours beginning in and the expiration of a contract with a third party directory publisher that ceased outsourcing its pre press publishing services to us in the first quarter of during  we earned million in fees for pre press services provided to spa and earned million from that third party pre press publishing contract that expired 
we continued to provide transition services to the third party publisher through march and recognized million of revenue in other revenue in and included fees for sales related computer application services rendered to dontech on behalf of sbc 
as a result of the spa acquisition in  we also began recording revenue for late fees paid on outstanding customer balances  sales of directories and fees from telephone companies for publishing of information pages 
these activities account for the difference in other revenue between and expenses the components of our total expenses for and were as follows amounts in millions change operating expenses g a expenses d a expense total all reported expenses are derived entirely from our donnelley segment since dontech is accounted for under the equity method 
certain costs directly related to the selling and production of directories are initially deferred and recognized ratably over the life of the directory 
operating expenses total operating expenses in were million as compared to million in the increase in operating expenses is primarily a result of the operating expenses of the spa business  that we acquired 
the operating expenses include our results as a publisher of directories  whereas expenses include those expenses incurred in our prior role as a sales agent for directories 
the expenses we incur as a publisher of directories are significantly greater than the expenses that we incurred as a sales agent 
however  due to the elimination of spa s deferred revenue and deferred costs for and january directories as required by purchase accounting  our reported expenses in do not include certain expenses associated with those directories 
therefore  our operating expenses prospectively will be higher than they were in in addition  our direct sales costs in were million higher than in due to an increase in the number of sales offices  size of our local sales force and our national sales operations 
as a publisher  we also now incur costs related to the printing and distribution of directories  purchasing of paper  and marketing  advertising and customer service that we did not incur when we were a sales agent in expenses for these functions were million higher than in publishing and information technology expenses in were million higher than in due to the production of the additional spa directories related to the acquisition and the larger workforce 
in addition  expenses include million of costs related to the consolidation of our publishing and technology operations  sales offices and administrative staff 
bad debt expense in was lower than in principally due to better than expected collections as a result of significant process improvements in billings and collections  partially offset by bad debt expense recognized as a publisher 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative g a expenses in were million as compared to million in the increase in general and administrative expenses is primarily attributable to incremental costs related to the former spa business of million  costs relating to the relocation of our corporate offices to cary  north carolina of million and the higher corporate costs for the larger organization of million due to higher insurance premiums  compensation and governance 
general and administrative expenses in reflect a net benefit of million from the reversal of remaining restructuring reserves initially recorded in see results of operations year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  below for a further description of these prior year amounts 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization d a in was million as compared to million in the increase in is primarily a result of the amortization  totaling million  of the intangible assets acquired in the spa acquisition 
in  donnelley did not have significant intangible assets and therefore did not incur significant amortization expense 
depreciation of fixed assets and amortization of computer software was million in and million in this increase is due to the depreciation associated with the depreciable assets acquired in the spa acquisition 
partnership income partnership income in includes our share of the net income of dontech accounted for under the equity method and revenue participation income from sbc 
as a sales agent for sbc  dontech earns commission revenue based on the annual value of sales contracts executed during the period calendar sales 
we also earn revenue participation income based on the amount of calendar sales during the period 
partnership income in also included a priority distribution on our membership interest in cendon  llc cendon 
as a result of the spa acquisition  we acquired the remaining membership interests in cendon and accordingly  become the sole owner of cendon 
we no longer receive priority distribution income  rather results from cendon have been included in our consolidated statements of operations 
partnership income was million in as compared to million in  of which million was from dontech and million was priority distribution income from cendon  which at the time was a part of our das segment 
the decrease in partnership income from dontech was due to a slow economic recovery  stagnant job growth and a competitive local media environment in the chicagoland markets 
operating income operating income by segment for the years ended december  and was as follows amounts in millions donnelley dontech total reported operating income in of million decreased million as compared to operating income of million in the decline in operating income was due largely to higher operating and g a expenses as mentioned above as well as higher d a expense due to amortization of intangible assets resulting from the spa acquisition 
operating income also declined due to the decline in income from dontech of million 
interest expense  net net interest expense in was million compared to million in interest expense in was significantly higher as a result of the substantial debt incurred in connection with the spa acquisition 
see liquidity and capital resources for a further description of our debt obligations and the provisions of the related debt instruments 
interest expense for includes million of non cash amortization of deferred financing costs  consisting of million in deferred costs that were expensed in connection with pre acquisition debt that was extinguished in and million of amortized deferred costs related to our current outstanding debt  of which million related to accelerated principal payments in net interest expense in of million included million of interest incurred on  million in debt raised in contemplation of the spa acquisition 
excluding this amount  interest expense was million reflective of our outstanding pre acquisition debt during other income expense  net other income in represents a million gain on hedging activities 
at december   our million notional value interest rate swap did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment due to the then pending repayment of existing variable rate debt in connection with the spa acquisition 
in december  a charge of million was recorded to reclassify to earnings the cumulative change in the fair value of the swap that was previously recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss on the balance sheet 
due to the loss of hedge accounting treatment  a gain of million was recognized in earnings in at the time the swap matured 
other expense in consists of the million charge related to the interest rate swap agreement  net of a million reversal of remaining reserves related to the disposition of businesses in see item a  qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk for additional information about our interest rate swap agreements 
benefit provision for income taxes the tax benefit is based on an effective tax rate of and results from the tax benefit generated in attributable to a net operating loss of approximately million related to tax deductions in connection with the acquisition of the spa business 
the effective tax rate reflects an increase in the state and local tax rate as a result of the acquisition of spa  combined with the favorable settlement in of certain prior year state and local tax audits 
the tax provision is based on an effective tax rate of  which was adversely impacted by the chinabig investment impairment charge that was not deductible against income for tax purposes 
this charge represents a capital loss  which can only be offset against capital gains 
this charge also gave rise to a deferred tax asset that can only be realized by offsetting future capital gains 
given our current business portfolio and projections of future results  we believe that the probability of generating future capital gains to realize this asset is remote 
accordingly  a valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset relating to the chinabig investment was established 
net loss income  loss income available to common shareholders and loss earnings per share the net loss in was million as compared to net income of million in our operating results for reflect lower operating income as described previously and higher interest expense and d a as a result of the spa acquisition 
the dividend on the preferred stock increases the net loss or reduces net income  resulting in loss income available to common shareholders from which earnings per share amounts are calculated 
the amount of the preferred stock dividend includes the stated dividend  plus a deemed dividend for a beneficial conversion feature bcf 
the bcf is a function of the conversion price of the preferred stock  the fair value of the warrants issued with the preferred stock weighted average of per warrant based on the black scholes model and exercise prices of for the warrants issued in november and for the warrants issued in january  and the fair market value of the common stock on january   the date the preferred stock was issued 
the full amount of the bcf is treated as a deemed dividend because the preferred stock was convertible into common stock immediately after issuance in november and january the preferred stock dividend in and of million and million  respectively  consisted of the stated dividend of million and million  respectively  and a bcf of million and million  respectively 
the resulting loss income available to common shareholders was million and million in and  respectively 
basic earnings per common share eps are generally calculated by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding 
however  because our preferred stock contains certain participation rights  eitf topic d  effect of participating securities on the computation of basic earnings per share topic d  requires that the dilutive effect of those securities be included in the weighted average number of shares outstanding 
furthermore  topic d requires that the dilutive effect to be included in basic eps may be calculated using either the if converted method or the two class method 
however  the dilutive effect of the preferred stock cannot be less than that which would result from the application of the two class method 
we have elected to use the if converted method in calculating basic eps 
however  during  we have reported eps calculated using the two class method because it has been less than eps calculated using the if converted method 
diluted eps equals income available to common shareholders divided by the weighted average common shares outstanding plus common share equivalents 
common share equivalents include stock options and warrants  the dilutive effect of which is calculated using the treasury stock method  and preferred stock  the potential dilutive effect of which is calculated using the if converted method 
the calculation of basic and diluted eps for and is presented below year ended year ended in thousands  except per share data december  december  basic eps if converted method loss income available to common shareholders preferred stock dividend net loss income weighted average common shares outstanding weighted average common shares assuming conversion of preferred stock weighted average common equivalent shares assuming conversion of preferred stock basic loss earnings per share if converted method basic eps two class method loss income available to common shareholders amount allocable to common shares rights to undistributed loss income weighted average common shares outstanding basic loss earnings per share two class method diluted eps loss income available to common shareholders weighted average common shares outstanding dilutive effect of stock options dilutive effect of preferred stock assuming conversion weighted average diluted shares outstanding diluted loss earnings per share at december   the preferred stock was convertible into  shares of common stock 
however  since million of the preferred stock was issued in november  the number of common share equivalents included in the eps calculation has been weighted for the actual time the preferred stock was outstanding during the year 
   for the year ended december  and   for the year ended december  basic eps calculated under the two class method was a loss of for the year ended december  however  where there is a net loss in a period  the application of the two class method is anti dilutive 
accordingly  reported basic eps are calculated as loss available to common shareholders divided by the weighted average basic shares outstanding 
the effect of stock options in and the assumed conversion of the preferred stock in and were anti dilutive and therefore are not included in the calculation of diluted eps 
adjusted and pro forma amounts and other non gaap measures as a result of the spa acquisition  our results prepared in accordance with gaap are not comparable to our reported gaap results 
under our deferral and amortization revenue recognition method  certain directories published in would have been recognized as revenue in however  purchase accounting considerations precluded us from recognizing directory revenue and certain expenses associated with directories that published prior to the acquisition  including all january published directories 
accordingly  our reported gaap results are not indicative of our underlying operations and financial performance 
accordingly  management is presenting adjusted results for that  among other things  eliminate the purchase accounting impact on revenue and certain expenses and adjusted pro forma information for that assumes the acquisition and related financing occurred on january  management believes that the presentation of this adjusted and adjusted pro forma information will help readers better and more easily compare current period underlying operating results against what the combined company performance would likely have been in the comparable prior period 
all of the following adjusted and pro forma amounts are non gaap measures  which are reconciled to the most comparable gaap measures below 
gaap reported adjustments adjusted amounts in millions year ended december  net revenue expenses  other than depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization partnership income operating income gaap adjusted pro reported adjustments forma amounts in millions year ended december  net revenue expenses  other than depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization partnership income operating income represents revenue for directories that published prior to the acquisition  including all january published directories  that would have been recognized during the period had it not been for purchase accounting adjustments required under gaap 
represents expenses for directories that published prior to the acquisition  including all january published directories  that would have been recognized during the period had it not been for purchase accounting adjustments required under gaap  and the effect of differences in the application of accounting policies between legacy spa and donnelley 
represents revenue recognized by spa in million less our commission revenue and pre press publishing revenue from spa included in our reported gaap amounts million  which would have been eliminated as intercompany revenues had the acquisition occurred on january  represents expenses recognized by spa in million less commission and pre press publishing expenses for services provided by us million  which would have been eliminated as intercompany expenses had the acquisition occurred on january   plus the additional expense million related to a required purchase accounting adjustment recorded to increase acquired deferred directory costs to fair value 
the adjusted pro forma amounts also exclude a million restructuring reserve reversal and an investment impairment charge of million 
represents depreciation and amortization expense recognized by spa in million plus amortization expense for intangible assets acquired in the acquisition assuming it occurred on january  million 
represents income from cendon recognized by donnelley and included in reported gaap amounts  which would have been eliminated as intercompany income had the acquisition occurred on january  adjusted revenue and expenses compared to adjusted pro forma revenue and expenses the components of adjusted revenue and adjusted pro forma revenue are as follows amounts in millions change change gross directory advertising revenue sales claims and allowances net directory advertising revenue pre press publishing fees other revenue net revenue total adjusted net revenue in was million  an increase of million or from adjusted pro forma net revenue of million in under the deferral and amortization method of revenue recognition  revenue from directory advertising sales is initially deferred when a directory is published and recognized ratably over the life of the directory  which is typically months 
the increase in adjusted gross directory advertising revenue is a result of higher advertiser renewal rates and solid performance in two of our major markets  nevada and southwest florida  offset by weaker performance in military markets due to the iraqi conflict and generally weak regional economic conditions during much of the year 
in addition  due to the deferral and amortization method  sales growth in published directories are amortized to revenue over the life of the directory  which delays recognition of publication sales as recorded revenue 
the reduction in sales claims and allowances is a result of improved processes between the sales organization and pre press services 
the decrease in pre press publishing fees of million is a result of the expiration of a third party pre press publishing contract for whom we ceased providing services in the first quarter adjusted operating and g a expenses in were million  down million or from pro forma operating and g a expenses of million in similar to the deferral and amortization method of revenue recognition  certain costs directly related to the selling and production of our directories are initially deferred when incurred and recognized ratably over the life a directory 
the decrease in adjusted expenses in is primarily due to lower bad debt expense of million resulting from better than expected collections due to certain process improvements  synergy savings from the combination of the spa operations with donnelley s in of million  and lower print  paper and distribution costs of million due to lower paper prices  printing expenses and vendor costs 
these decreases were offset by million in increased corporate costs  due to higher insurance premiums  compensation and governance costs related to the larger organization  million of costs to achieve synergies from the consolidation of our publishing and technology operations  sales offices and administrative functions  million related to the headquarters relocation and million due to increased advertising in order to bring advertising levels for the sprint branded directories back to historical levels before adjusted partnership income in was million  a decrease of million or from adjusted pro forma partnership income in of million 
the decrease in partnership income reflects the decrease in income from dontech previously discussed 
adjusted operating income in was million  an increase of million or from adjusted pro forma operating income in of million 
donnelley advertising sales publication sales management reviews and evaluates the value of advertising sales in directories that published during the period publication sales as its primary sales performance measure 
directory advertising revenue is driven by publication sales 
management believes that a comparison of publication sales for the same directories from one period to another gives a better indication of underlying sales trends  economic conditions and business confidence than a comparison of directory revenue recognized using the deferral and amortization method 
because we recognize directory revenue ratably over the life of a directory  the amount of revenue recognized during a period is not directly related to the sales trends  economic conditions and business confidence during that period 
publication sales are comparable to a same store sales measure and are utilized and disclosed by many directory publishers  thus facilitating comparison of sales performance among publishers 
publication sales in for the donnelley segment were million  up million or from pro forma publication sales for the donnelley segment of million in the increase in publication sales resulted from higher advertiser renewal rates and solid performance in two of our major markets  nevada and southwest florida 
these results were partially offset by regional economic weakness  and weaker performance in several military markets due to troop deployment in connection with the iraqi conflict 
publication sales are a non gaap measure for which the most comparable gaap measure related to the donnelley segment is net revenue 
a reconciliation of publication sales to net revenue reported in accordance with gaap is presented below for the year ended december  amounts in millions publication sales donnelley segment less publication sales for january directories not recognized as revenue due to purchase accounting less current period publication sales deferred and not recognized as revenue in current period less publication sales for those spa directories not sold by donnelley publication sales reported by donnelley in less sales contracts executed in prior periods and reported as calendar sales in prior periods plus contracts executed during the period to be reported as publication sales in future periods calendar sales in net directory advertising revenue on above advertising sales plus net commission revenue on calendar sales plus pre press publishing revenue plus other revenue net revenue gaap dontech advertising sales calendar and publication sales calendar sales as a sales agent for sbc  dontech recognizes commission revenue based on the annual value of a sales contract calendar sales in the period the contract is executed 
management reviews calendar sales for dontech because this is a primary driver of our income from dontech 
dontech manages the sale of advertising to customers on a directory by directory basis or project basis a project consists of two or more directories in a geographic area and organizes the sales into directories as a sales campaign 
accordingly  changes in the beginning and ending dates of a sales campaign and the actual sales recorded at any point during the campaign can vary from one period to the next 
these variations  or timing factors  can cause calendar sales  and thus partnership income  to be materially different from the prior comparative period 
income from dontech consisted of the following years ended december  amounts in millions share of dontech net profits revenue participation income total dontech income dontech partnership income in of million decreased million or from million in  mainly due to lower calendar sales 
dontech calendar sales in were million  lower than calendar sales in of million  as a result of a continued weak economy in the midwest during and competition in the local media market 
our share of dontech s net income decreased million from million to million 
in addition  revenue participation income received from sbc decreased million or to million in from million in each of these decreases is a direct result of the reduction in dontech s calendar sales from which our share of dontech s net income and revenue participation is derived 
publication sales management also utilizes publication sales to evaluate the sales performance of dontech because management believes that this measure provides a better indication of underlying sales trends  economic conditions and business confidence in the dontech markets than a comparison of partnership income from dontech 
publication sales at dontech represent the annual billing value of the sbc directories published during the period for which dontech sells advertising 
publication sales in were million  down million or from publication sales of million 
this decrease is a result of a continued weak economy in the midwest  stagnant job growth and competition in the local media market 
calendar sales and publication sales are non gaap measures for which the most comparable gaap measures related to dontech is partnership income 
a reconciliation of publication sales and calendar sales to partnership income is provided below 
for the year ended december  amounts in millions dontech publication sales less the value of contracts executed and reported as calendar sales in prior periods plus the value of contracts executed during the period to be reported as publication sales in future periods dontech calendar sales commission revenue from above calendar sales partnership net expenses partnership profit donnelley s share of partnership profits revenue participation income on above calendar sales total income from dontech priority distribution income from cendon partnership income gaap year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  the company prior to the spa acquisition the discussion below relates to the results of the company for the years ended december  and during this period  we were a leading independent sales agent and pre press vendor for yellow pages advertising services in the united states

the dontech segment was not affected by the spa acquisition 
for a further description of the dontech segment  see segment reporting above 
historical directory advertising services within our das segment  we sold yellow pages advertising for affiliated entities of sprint and performed pre press publishing services for yellow pages directories 
we were the exclusive sales agent in the greater orlando  florida market central florida for an operating unit of sprint and the exclusive sales agent in nevada  florida  virginia and north carolina for cendon  a joint venture with centel  a subsidiary of sprint 
other sprint affiliates sold yellow pages advertising in other markets in these states 
we received sales commissions on all advertising sold for sprint and cendon and a priority distribution on our membership interest in cendon 
the amount of priority distribution earned was based on a percentage of cendon advertising sales 
a material decline in advertising sales in these markets could have had a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
the das segment also included pre press publishing services provided to sbc and sprint for their respective yellow pages directories for which we sold advertising under separately negotiated contracts 
the agreement with sbc extends through prior to the spa acquisition  our agreement with sprint was scheduled to expire in we also provided pre press publishing services to an unaffiliated third party under an agreement that expired at the end of to whom we provided transition services of million in revenue from our pre press publishing services operation accounted for approximately and of total consolidated revenue in and  respectively 
das also included all information technology costs 
factors affecting comparability chinabig investment and impairment charge we have a interest in chinabig  which publishes yellow pages directories and offers internet directory services in the people s republic of china 
in november  we received an independent third party valuation of chinabig s current business plan  capital needs and outlook for profitability and cash flow 
this report was commissioned by chinabig 
the valuation was conducted in connection with a proposed equity financing 
the results of the valuation provided a range of possible estimated fair values for chinabig  all of which implied that the fair value of this investment was substantially lower than the carrying value of million 
accordingly  an impairment charge of million was recorded in to write this investment down to an amount that we believed was the best estimate of the current fair value of the investment at that time 
after reviewing chinabig s operating results  we determined that sufficient evidence did not exist to support the carrying value of this investment and that the probability of realizing any value from this investment in the foreseeable future was remote 
accordingly  in an additional impairment charge of million was recorded to write off the remaining book value of the investment 
restructuring and special charge in  a restructuring and special charge of million was recorded in connection with executive management employment transition arrangements and the expiration of a pre press publishing contract  which was expected to result in the elimination of approximately positions during the charge included million associated with executive management transition arrangements  including severance  accrued pension benefits and other related costs  million for other employee severance and related costs  million for idle leased space in the morrisville publishing facility and planned relocation of the corporate headquarters due to excess capacity  and million for professional fees and the write off of assets no longer considered useable 
as a result of the spa acquisition  we determined that certain costs originally anticipated in the restructuring charge would not be incurred 
specifically  idle leased space in the morrisville publishing facility would subsequently be utilized  planned severance and other related costs would be significantly less and the corporate headquarters was not expected at that time to be relocated 
accordingly  income of million was recognized in from the reversal of million of the original reserve  partially offset by a charge of million for additional costs paid in connection with the executive management transition 
net revenue during and  revenue was derived entirely from our das segment 
as a sales agent for sprint  we earned commission revenue based on the annual billing value of advertisements sold for sprint directories in the period sprint calendar sales 
sales commission revenue was recorded net of an estimate for potential claims allowances 
we also earned revenue from providing pre press publishing services 
the amount of commission revenue recognized was directly correlated to sprint calendar sales recorded during each period 
we managed the sale of advertising on a directory by directory basis and organized each directory into a sales campaign 
a typical sales campaign lasts two to five months and ends approximately two months before a directory is scheduled to be published 
therefore  changes in the beginning and ending dates of a sales campaign and the actual sales recorded at any point during the campaign can vary from one period to the next 
these variations could have caused sales commission revenue in the period to be materially different from the prior comparative period 
the components of our net revenue for and are as follows amounts in millions change change commission revenue sales allowances n m net commission revenue pre press publishing fees other revenue total net revenue in was million as compared to million in net commission revenue decreased million in compared to primarily due to the reversal of million of sales claims allowances in fees from pre press publishing services declined million primarily due to a reduction in volumes resulting from the expiration of a pre press publishing contract in december other revenue in and included fees for billing services provided to sbc and sales related computer application services provided to dontech 
calendar advertising sales commission revenue  priority distribution income from sprint  and revenue participation income from sbc are directly correlated to the value of advertising sales made during the period 
the table below sets forth the value of advertising that we sold on behalf of sprint and that dontech sold on behalf of sbc during the periods noted 
dontech manages its selling process in a manner similar to how we manage our selling process 
accordingly  the annual billing value of advertisements sold for sbc directories in the period dontech calendar sales can vary from one period to the next due to changes in the beginning and ending dates of a sales campaign and the actual sales recorded at any point during the campaign 
see below for a reconciliation of calendar sales  a non gaap measure  to net revenue  the most comparable gaap measure with respect to das results  and partnership income  the most comparable gaap measure with respect to dontech results 
calendar advertising sales by segment for and were as follows amounts in millions change change dontech das total calendar sales in were million as compared to million in dontech calendar sales declined in the decline in dontech calendar sales reflected continued advertiser uncertainty from weak economic conditions  competition and changes in the servicing of sales campaigns to call on customers closer to the time when directories publish 
das calendar sales increased slightly during compared to as we began to see signs that these markets may be trending back towards historical growth levels 
publication advertising sales during and  management also reviewed and analyzed the value of advertising sales on behalf of sprint and by dontech on behalf of sbc in directories that published during the period 
we compared publication sales for the period against publication sales for the same directories published in the prior year period a same store sales type metric 
we believed that a comparison of publication sales from one period to another gave an indication of underlying sales growth in directories as this metric removed the timing factors associated with a sales campaign 
however  publication sales did not have a direct correlation to our reported revenue or profitability in the indicated period because calendar sales drive revenue and profitability and occur prior to publication dates 
see below for a reconciliation of publication sales  a non gaap measure  to net revenue  the most comparable gaap measure with respect to das results  and partnership income  the most comparable gaap measure with respect to dontech results 
publication advertising sales by segment for and were as follows amounts in millions change change dontech das total publication sales in were million as compared to million in for  publication sales at dontech declined and publication sales at das declined compared to these declines were due to difficult economic conditions  reduced spending by advertisers and uncertainty and caution in the small business market following the events of september  two of our largest sales campaigns  sprint s las vegas and sbc s chicago consumer directories  were in their peak selling period immediately after september th 
both these directories published in early with the advertising sales value of the publications being substantially below the value of the publications 
however  since our revenue and profitability were driven by calendar sales  the shortfall in the las vegas and chicago consumer directories was reflected in our results and did not directly impact our revenue or profitability in reconciliation of advertising sales to net revenue reported in accordance with gaap both calendar advertising sales and publication sales are non gaap financial measures 
the most comparable gaap measure for das calendar sales and publication sales is net revenue 
as previously described  our net revenue and priority distribution income reported in and in accordance with gaap were directly correlated to das calendar sales 
publication sales on the other hand give an indication of the underlying growth in directories but had no direct correlation to our reported net revenue or priority distribution income

in  we settled cendon partnership accounts receivable issues for approximately million less than the amount reserved in our financial statements to cover potential losses 
the remaining million benefit was recognized as partnership income 
we established reserves for these receivable issues over time as we became aware of relevant facts and circumstances 
while we were a party to the cendon partnership  the reserves established were offset against partnership income 
subsequent to further cendon restructuring  the reserves established were charged to expense 
accordingly  the reversal of the reserves established was recorded to the same accounts to which the original reserve was recorded 
g a expenses were million in as compared to million in g a expenses in include a restructuring and special charge of million and an investment impairment charge of million 
g a expenses in include a net reversal of the previously recognized restructuring and special charges of million and an additional investment impairment charge of million 
see factors affecting comparability restructuring and special charge and chinabig investment and impairment charge for a discussion of these amounts 
excluding these items  g a expense in was million compared to million in g a benefited in from lower salary and benefit costs due to the executive management transition  but these savings were offset by million of expenses incurred in connection with the spa acquisition 
the majority of acquisition related expenses were capitalized as part of the acquisition 
depreciation and amortization expense was million as compared to million in and  respectively 
depreciation and amortization expense had been steadily declining through as a result of reduced capital spending  including software development  the write off of assets from the disposition of businesses and significant software development costs incurred in our morrisville pre press publishing operation in and becoming fully amortized during partnership income during and  partnership income included our share of the net income of dontech  revenue participation income from sbc and the priority distribution on our membership interest in cendon 
partnership income was as follows amounts in millions change change dontech cendon total partnership income in was million as compared to million in partnership income from dontech decreased million in primarily due to the decline in dontech calendar sales of during that year 
as previously stated  dontech calendar sales have declined due to a weakening economy  low consumer confidence in certain markets and competition 
partnership income from cendon increased million in partially due to the increase in calendar sales coupled with an increase in the priority distribution rate in from to 
partnership income for also included a million benefit from the cendon settlement 
operating income operating income from dontech includes our share of the net profits of dontech and revenue participation income from sbc 
operating income from das included the results of  and those costs directly incurred by  each constituent business unit  less an allocation of certain shared expenses based on estimated business usage 
general and corporate represents overhead and administrative costs that were not allocated to the das business units 
operating income by segment for and was as follows amounts in millions change change dontech das general and corporate segment operating income restructuring and special charge n m investment impairment charge n m total operating income in was million as compared to million in operating income from dontech decreased million in and million in see partnership income above for further details of the decrease in dontech operating income 
operating income from das increased million in compared to due to higher sales at sprint  the contractual increase in the priority distribution rate and the benefit from the cendon settlement 
this increase was partially offset by a reversal of million of sales claims allowances in das operating income also benefited from lower software amortization expense as the significant amount of investment in software development made at the morrisville publishing facility in and was fully amortized during general and corporate costs in were consistent with as lower salary and benefit costs from the executive management transition in were offset by million of costs related to the acquisition of spa 
interest and taxes net interest expense was million as compared to million in and  respectively 
interest expense for included million of interest incurred on the  million of proceeds from term loan b and the notes that were held in escrow in december in anticipation of the spa acquisition 
interest expense  excluding the interest on the funds in escrow  was million  million lower than due to lower outstanding borrowings and lower interest rates 
interest income in of million included million of income on the funds held in escrow 
interest expense in and benefited from prepayments of million of debt in and million of debt in the effective tax rate for and was and  respectively  and was adversely impacted by the chinabig investment impairment charges that were not deductible against income for tax purposes 
these charges represented capital losses and can only be offset against capital gains 
these charges also gave rise to a deferred tax asset that can only be realized by offsetting future capital gains 
given our then current business portfolio and projections of future results  we believed that the probability of generating future capital gains to realize this asset was remote 
accordingly  a valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset relating to the chinabig investment was established 
other expense income other expense income in consisted of a million charge related to our interest rate swap and a million reversal of remaining reserves related to the disposition of businesses in as a result of the then pending repayment of existing variable rate debt in connection with the spa acquisition  our interest rate swap no longer qualified for hedge accounting treatment at december  accordingly  a charge of million  previously recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss on the balance sheet  was taken against earnings in the calculation of the gain recorded in for the disposition of businesses included certain reserves established in connection with the termination of the certain agreements with bell atlantic 
these reserves were based on the best information available to us at the time of the transaction 
at december   we believed that sufficient time had elapsed since the transaction and that no additional costs would be incurred 
accordingly  remaining reserves of million were reversed into income in net income and income available to common shareholders net income was million as compared to million in and  respectively 
the dividend on the preferred stock  whether paid in cash or allowed to accrue  reduces net income  resulting in net income available to common shareholders 
for  net income was reduced by a preferred stock dividend of million to derive income available to common shareholders of million 
the amount of the preferred stock dividend includes the stated dividend of million pro rata for the period outstanding and a deemed dividend for a beneficial conversion feature of million 
the bcf is a function of the conversion price of the preferred stock  the fair value of the warrants million based on the black scholes model and an exercise price of and the fair market value of the underlying common stock on the date of issuance 
the full amount of the bcf is treated as a deemed dividend in as the preferred stock was convertible into common stock immediately after issuance 
an additional bcf of million resulted from the issuance of  additional shares of preferred stock to the gs funds in january  which was recorded as a deemed dividend in the first quarter earnings per share basic earnings per common share are generally calculated by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding 
however  because the preferred stock contains certain participation rights  topic d requires that the dilutive effect of those securities be included in the weighted average number of shares outstanding 
furthermore  topic d requires that the dilutive effect included in basic eps may be calculated using either the if converted method or the two class method 
however  the dilutive effect of the preferred stock cannot be less than that which would result from the application of the two class method 
diluted eps are calculated by dividing net income by the weighted average common shares outstanding plus common share equivalents 
common share equivalents include stock options and warrants  the dilutive effect of which is calculated using the treasury stock method  and preferred stock  the potential dilutive effect of which is calculated using the if converted method 
the calculation of eps for the year ended is as follows in thousands  except per share data basic eps if converted method income available to common shareholders preferred stock dividend net income weighted average common shares outstanding weighted average common equivalent shares assuming conversion of preferred stock weighted average common shares outstanding and common stock equivalents basic earnings per share if converted method in thousands  except per share data basic eps two class method income available to common shareholders and common equivalent amount allocable to common shares rights to undistributed earnings weighted average common shares outstanding basic earnings per share two class method diluted eps income available to common shareholders weighted average common shares outstanding dilutive effect of stock options dilutive effect of preferred stock assuming conversion weighted average common and common equivalent shares outstanding diluted eps at december   the preferred stock was convertible into  shares of common stock 
however  since million of the preferred stock was issued in november  the number of common share equivalents included in the eps calculation has been weighted for the actual time the preferred stock was outstanding during the year 
the conversion of the preferred stock was not reflected in the calculation of diluted eps because the effect was anti dilutive 
for the year ended december   basic earnings per share was calculated by dividing net income by the weighted average common shares outstanding during the year  and diluted earnings per share was calculated by dividing net income by the weighted average common shares outstanding plus potentially dilutive common shares  primarily stock options  calculated using the treasury stock method 
the calculation of eps for the year ended december  is as follows in thousands  except per share data income available to common shareholders weighted average common shares outstanding dilutive effect of stock options weighted average common and common equivalent shares outstanding earnings per share basic diluted liquidity and capital resources in connection with the spa acquisition  we entered into a new  million credit facility  consisting of a million term loan a  a million term loan b and a million revolver  issued million senior notes  and million senior subordinated notes  and issued million of preferred stock to the gs funds 
these funds were used to acquire spa  pay transaction costs  repurchase a portion of the existing senior subordinated notes due pre acquisition notes pursuant to a tender offer and repay former term facilities 
to take advantage of favorable market conditions and to ensure the timely consummation of the spa acquisition  in december  we incurred debt under and received gross proceeds of the term loan b and the notes 
the total gross proceeds of  million were deposited and held in escrow pending the closing of the spa acquisition 
additionally  in november  we issued  shares of preferred stock and warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock to the gs funds for gross proceeds of million 
on january   we borrowed an additional million consisting of million term loan a proceeds and million under the revolver 
we also received the proceeds of  million held in escrow and issued to the gs funds the remaining million of preferred stock and warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock 
these proceeds were used to acquire the common stock of spa  repay existing debt and pay transaction costs 
the sources and uses of funds in connection with the acquisition are summarized as follows amounts in millions sources proceeds from the credit facility proceeds from the notes proceeds from the sale of convertible preferred stock and warrants available cash total sources uses purchase price payment of cendon obligations repay existing debt  including accrued interest fees and expenses total uses calculated prior to the application of a closing payment and other fees 
on december   we amended our credit facility  to accomplish the following objectives obtain more favorable pricing on our variable rate debt  adjust non financial covenants to make them less restrictive for corporate operating flexibility  obtain the cash resources and the consent for us to redeem the remaining outstanding pre acquisition notes  and obtain consent for a new term loan c for potential borrowings up to million  such proceeds  if borrowed  to be used to fund acquisitions and retirement of notes and redemption of equity  subject to certain limitations 
the amendment to our credit facility created a new term loan a  replacing the initial term loan a and created a new term loan b replacing the initial term loan b 
in connection with the amendment  we borrowed an additional million under the term loan b these proceeds were used to redeem the balance of the pre acquisition notes and pay transaction costs  including a prepayment premium of million representing of the term loan b balance outstanding on the date of the amendment 
the amendment to the credit facility was accounted for as a modification of the underlying debt instruments 
the weighted average interest rate of outstanding debt under the credit facility was at december  and under the former term facilities was during as amended  our credit facility bears interest  at our option at either the higher of i a base rate as determined by deutsche bank securities inc  salomon smith barney inc 
or bear  stearns co 
inc  plus a margin on the revolver and a margin on term loans a and b and ii the federal funds effective rate as defined plus of  plus a margin on the revolver and a margin on term loans a and b  or libor rate plus a margin on the revolver and a margin on term loans a and b we may elect interest periods of     or months for libor borrowings 
the credit facility  as amended  and the indentures governing the notes contain usual and customary negative covenants that  among other things  place limitations on our ability to i incur additional indebtedness  including capital leases and liens  ii pay dividends and repurchase our capital stock  iii enter into mergers  consolidations  acquisitions  asset dispositions and sale leaseback transactions  iv make capital expenditures  and v issue capital stock of our subsidiaries 
the credit facility also contains financial covenants relating to maximum consolidated leverage  minimum interest coverage  minimum fixed charge coverage and maximum senior secured leverage as defined therein 
the revolver and term loan a mature in december  and term loan b matures in june substantially all of our assets  including the capital stock of our subsidiaries  are pledged to secure our obligations under the credit facility 
on january   in connection with a tender offer and exit consent solicitation  million of the pre acquisition notes were repurchased 
we borrowed an initial  million under the credit facility contingent upon our repurchase of the entire million aggregate principal amount of the pre acquisition notes 
any proceeds that were not used to repurchase the pre acquisition notes were required to be repaid to the lenders under the credit facility 
accordingly  million  representing the amount of pre acquisition notes that remained outstanding following the tender offer and exit consent solicitation  was repaid to the lenders under the credit facility shortly after the consummation of the acquisition 
on february   utilizing the proceeds from term loan b  we redeemed the remaining aggregate principal amount of the pre acquisition notes  totaling million at a redemption price of of the principal amount thereof  plus accrued and unpaid interest 
a loss of approximately million will be recorded in the first quarter of consisting of the premium over par value paid at redemption of million  plus the write off of million of deferred financing costs 
the preferred stock is convertible at any time at a price of 
the cumulative dividend of is compounded quarterly 
only with the consent of a majority of the holders of the convertible preferred stock may we pay any dividends in cash prior to october  subsequent to october   dividends on the preferred stock may be paid in cash  subject to any limitations under the credit facility  or allowed to accrue  at our option 
the credit facility may significantly limit our ability to pay the dividends on the preferred stock in cash 
the warrants issued in november have an exercise price of  and the warrants issued in january have an exercise price of 
these warrants can be exercised at any time before they expire on january  we intend to issue treasury stock to satisfy conversion of the preferred sock and exercise of warrants 
we may redeem the preferred stock in cash at any time on or after january  if the market price as defined of our common stock exceeds of the conversion price for of trading days 
the preferred stock is redeemable in cash by us at any time on or after january  the preferred stock is redeemable in cash at the option of the gs funds in the event of a change in control as defined 
at december   the redemption value of the preferred stock was million and it was convertible into  shares of common stock 
as a result of the spa acquisition  we have a significant amount of debt  and our debt service requirements are significantly higher than in prior years 
aggregate outstanding debt as of december  was  million 
term loans a and b require quarterly principal and interest payments through their maturity and the notes require semi annual interest payments 
during the year ended december   we made scheduled principal payments of million and prepaid an additional million in principal under our credit facility 
it is management s present intention to continue to utilize excess free cash flow to pay down on an accelerated basis our debt obligations under the credit facility 
for the year ended december   we had aggregate cash interest payments of million 
at december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents before checks not yet presented for payment of million  and available borrowings under the revolver of million 
during  we periodically utilized the revolver as a financing resource to balance the timing of our periodic and accelerated payments made under the credit facility and interest payments on the notes with the timing of cash receipts from operations 
our present intention is to repay borrowings on the revolver in a timely manner and keep any outstanding amounts to a minimum 
our primary source of liquidity will continue to be cash flows from operations as well as available borrowing capacity under the revolver 
our primary liquidity requirement will be to fund operations and for principal and interest payments on our debt 
our ability to meet our debt service requirements will depend on our ability to generate cash flow in the future 
our primary sources of cash flow will consist mainly of cash receipts from the sale of advertising in our yellow pages directories and revenue participation payments and other cash distributions related to dontech 
these sources are directly dependent on the value of yellow pages advertising sold and can be impacted by  among other factors  general economic conditions  competition from other yellow pages directory publishers and other alternative products  consumer confidence and the level of demand for yellow pages advertising 
we believe that cash flows from operations  along with borrowing capacity under the revolver  will be adequate to fund our operations and capital expenditures and to meet our debt service requirements for at least the next to months 
however  we make no assurances that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that sufficient borrowing will be available under the revolver to enable us to fund our operations  capital expenditures and meet all debt service requirements  or for other purposes 
cash provided by operating activities in was million  an increase of million over cash provided by operating activities of million in the prior year 
the increase is primarily a result of the spa acquisition 
as a publisher of over revenue generating directories  our cash flows from operating activities have significantly increased in key contributors to cash flows from operating activities in include the following million from a decrease in accounts receivable and an increase in deferred directory revenue 
we analyze the change in deferred revenue and accounts receivable together because when a directory is published  the annual billing value of that directory is initially deferred and unbilled accounts receivable are established 
each month thereafter  one twelfth of the billing value is recognized as revenue and billed to customers 
in connection with the spa acquisition  while we did not record the unrecognized revenue for directories published prior to the acquisition and during january due to purchase accounting  we did acquire the associated unbilled receivables and the rights to bill and collect these receivables  which totaled approximately million 
other components adding to generating cash flows include lower bad debts and sales claims  as well as improvements in the collection of past due balances 
million increase in cash received from partnerships in excess of recorded partnership income representing a source of cash 
partnership income and cash received in consists of our interest in dontech s net income and the revenue participation income from sbc 
we receive cash from dontech and sbc subsequent to the time we record the associated partnership income  therefore  in periods of declining dontech partnership income  cash received related to prior periods will exceed the income recognized from the current period 
partially offsetting these sources of cash was the following uses of cash million increase in other assets  primarily comprised of deferred directory costs 
deferred directory costs represent cash payments for certain costs associated with the publication of directories 
since deferred directory costs are initially deferred when incurred  the cash payments are made prior to the expense being recognized 
cash used in investing activities in was million and consists of the following  million in cash payments to acquire spa and pay transaction costs 
see the table detailing the sources and uses of funds in connection with the spa acquisition presented above 
 million decrease in restricted cash that was recorded at december  this amount is comprised of funds that we raised in the last quarter of that were placed in escrow pending the spa acquisition 
of this amount  million was raised from term loan b under the credit facility  million was raised from the notes and in net proceeds was raised from the issuance of our preferred stock to the gs funds 
million was used to purchase fixed assets  primarily computer equipment and computer software 
cash provided by financing activities in was million and includes the following million in net borrowings under the million term loan a under the credit facility on january  the other funds raised under the credit facility to finance the spa acquisition and re finance existing debt were received in december and held in escrow until january  million in net proceeds from the issuance of our preferred stock with a stated value of million and related warrants to the gs funds on january  the gs funds invested a total stated amount of million in connection with the spa acquisition 
the initial investment of million was made in november million in principal payments on pre acquisition debt 
proceeds from our credit facility  notes and preferred stock were used in january to repay million in variable rate bank debt and redeem of the pre acquisition notes pursuant to a tender offer 
million in principal payments on debt borrowed under the credit facility 
of this amount  million represents scheduled quarterly payments and million represents principal payments made on an accelerated basis  at our option  from excess cash flow generated from operations 
million in borrowings under the revolver 
million in proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options 
the contractual obligations table presented below sets forth our annual commitments as of december  for principal payments on our debt  as well as other cash obligations for the next five years and thereafter 
the debt repayments as presented in this table include only the scheduled principal payments under our current debt agreements and do not include any anticipated prepayments or interest charges 
payment due by period amounts in millions less than after contractual obligations total year years years years long term debt operating leases unconditional purchase obligations other long term liabilities total contractual obligations included in long term debt are amounts owed under our credit facility  the notes and the pre acquisition notes 
the pre acquisition notes were redeemed in full on february  these borrowings are further explained in note to our consolidated financial statements included in item in this annual report 
we enter into operating leases in the normal course of business 
substantially all lease agreements have fixed payment terms based on the passage of time 
some lease agreements provide us with renewal or early termination options 
our future operating lease obligations would change if we exercised these renewal or early termination options and if we entered into additional operating lease agreements 
the amounts in the table assume we do not exercise any such renewal or early termination options 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report 
we have an unconditional purchase obligation with one vendor regarding the purchase of paper that extends through the end of our purchase obligations are based on annual minimum quantities at pre established pricing 
amounts in the table above reflect such pricing and minimum quantities under this contract 
should the market price of the paper drop below the pre established pricing  our vendor is obligated to negotiate with us a lower paper price 
any quantities used above the contractual minimums would increase our payment obligations 
we have no contractual obligations beyond we have a defined benefit plan covering substantially all employees 
our funding policy is to contribute an amount at least equal to the minimum legal funding requirement 
no contributions were required in the three year period ended december  based on past performance and the uncertainty of the dollar amounts to be paid  if any  we have excluded such amounts from the above table 
we have an unfunded postretirement plan that provides certain healthcare and life insurance benefits to those full time employees who reach retirement age while working for the company 
those expected future benefit payments  including administrative expenses  net of employee contributions  are included in the table above 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate risk and risk management the credit facility bears interest at variable rates  and accordingly  our earnings and cash flow are affected by changes in interest rates 
the credit facility requires that we maintain hedge agreements to provide either a fixed interest rate or interest rate protection on at least of our total outstanding debt 
on march   we entered into three interest rate swap agreements with a total notional value of million 
these interest rate swaps effectively convert million of variable debt to fixed rate debt 
under the terms of these agreements  we receive variable interest based on three month libor and pay a fixed rate of 
the swaps mature on march  on october   we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a total notional value of million 
this interest rate swap effectively converts million of variable debt to fixed rate debt 
under the terms of this agreement  we receive variable interest based on three month libor and pay a fixed rate of 
this swap agreement matures on october  based on the initial terms of the swap agreements  the annual cost of these swap arrangements will be approximately million 
the actual cost of the swaps will depend on the variable rate payments received 
assuming an increase in the interest rate associated with the borrowings under the credit facility after giving effect to the interest rate swaps  interest expense would increase million on an annual basis 
after the effect of the interest rate swap agreements discussed above  total fixed rate debt comprises approximately of our total debt portfolio as of december  the outstanding interest rate swaps expose us to credit risk in the event that the counterparties to the agreements do not or cannot meet their obligations 
the notional amount is used to measure interest to be paid or received and does not represent the amount of exposure to credit loss 
the loss would be limited to the amount that would have been received  if any  over the remaining life of the swap agreements 
the counterparties to the swaps are major financial institutions  and we expect the counterparties to be able to perform their obligations under the swaps 
we use derivative financial instruments for hedging purposes only and not for trading or speculative purposes 
a discussion of our accounting policies and further disclosure relating to these financial instruments is included in note to our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended december   which are included in item in this annual report 
market risk sensitive instruments the interest rate swap agreements have been designated as cash flow hedges 
in accordance with the provisions of sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended by sfas and fas  the swaps are recorded at fair value
