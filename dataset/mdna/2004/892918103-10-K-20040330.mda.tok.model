overview the year was a pivotal  and successful  year for transact  highlighted by the following achievements increased revenues by  or over increased operating income by  reported our first profitable year since with net income of  repaid all our revolving bank borrowings we continue to focus on sales growth in our two core markets  point of sale and banking pos and gaming and lottery  to drive increased profitability 
during  our total net sales grew by over to approximately  see the table below for a breakdown of our sales 
year ended year ended change in thousands december  december  printers pos    printers gaming and lottery    subtotal printers    services and consumables    total net sales    the pos market remained soft in due to continued lower capital spending by users of pos products and overall economic weakness  primarily in the us we expect to see some improvement in the pos market during  although not until the second half of despite weakness of the market in  our pos printer sales increased by due primarily to growing sales of our posjet r and bankjet r line of inkjet printers 
during  we announced wins from two major financial services companies for shipments of over  bankjet r printers to upgrade bank teller applications  which we began to ship in and expect to complete shipping during given our success in and in light of the renewed focus we see banks placing on branch banking  we plan to more proactively seek opportunities with other banks for upgrading bank teller systems  if and when they arise 
our long term strategy in the pos market is to capture at least market share  or approximately million in sales  primarily through increasing and enhancing our product portfolio  increasing geographic coverage  and growing our customer base 
our focus in the gaming and lottery market is two fold 
on the lottery side  we continue to hold a leading position based on our long term purchase agreements with gtech corporation gtech  our largest customer and the world s largest provider of lottery terminals  with an approximately market share 
gtech has been our customer since  and we continue to maintain a good relationship with them 
currently  we fulfill substantially all of gtech s printer requirements for lottery terminal installations and upgrades 
during  total sales to gtech were approximately  representing a decrease of approximately from based on existing orders and expected future demand based on input from gtech  we expect overall sales to gtech in to be slightly below the level 
our sales to gtech each year are directly dependent on the timing and number of new and upgraded lottery terminal installations gtech performs 
on the gaming side  our focus lies primarily in supplying printers for use in slot machines in casinos 
during  we benefited from the increasing number of casinos that began to convert traditional coin issuing slot machines into ticket issuing slot machines 
as a result  sales of our gaming and lottery printers increased by over 
we expect this trend to continue into  as more casinos convert their slot machines 
the adoption and rollout of the ticket in ticket out initiative is happening and we expect all  slot machines in north america to be fitted with a printer within the next two to four years 
we also expect growth from gaming sales internationally  beginning in late  as markets such as australia and europe evaluate the use of this technology for their slot machines 
our services and consumables products  which include the repair of printers and the sale of spare parts and consumables paper  ribbons and inkjet cartridges  offer a substantial growth opportunity and recurring revenue stream for transact 
our services and consumables products revenue has grown to  and of net sales in  an increase of over from during  we plan to more actively promote and dedicate increased resources to our services products in an effort to substantially increase the volume of sales 
we have implemented a specialized software system  improved our sales lead tracking and prospecting processes  and instituted incentive schemes for our sales people to enable us to better cross sell our services products to our customers 
we also believe that the increasing sales of our inkjet printers will drive substantially higher inkjet cartridge sales in and beyond 
operationally  gross margin and operating margin were significantly improved 
we expect to see further gross margin and operating margin improvement in as the volume of sales increases and we continue to focus on controlling expenses 
we reported net income for the first time since we also generated sufficient cash during to repay all outstanding revolving borrowings under our credit facility  and had almost  of cash on our balance sheet as of december  critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared by us in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
these principles require the use of estimates  judgments and assumptions 
such estimates and judgments are based upon historical experience and certain assumptions that are believed to be reasonable in the particular circumstances 
those judgments affect both balance sheet items and income statement categories 
our estimates include those related to revenue recognition  inventory obsolescence  the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities  depreciable lives of equipment  warranty obligations  and restructuring accruals 
we evaluate our assumptions on an ongoing basis by comparing actual results with our estimates 
actual results may differ from the original estimates 
the following accounting policies are those that we believe to be most critical in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition our typical contracts include the sale of printers  which are sometimes accompanied by separately priced extended warranty contracts 
we also sell spare parts  consumables  and other repair services sometimes pursuant to multi year product maintenance contracts which are not included in the original printer sale and are ordered by the customer as needed 
we recognize revenue pursuant to the guidance within sab  revenue recognition 
specifically  revenue is recognized when evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery based on shipping terms which are generally fob shipping point has occurred  the selling price is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we provide for an estimate of product returns and price protection based on historical experience at the time of revenue recognition 
revenue related to extended warranty and product maintenance contracts is recognized pursuant to fasb technical bulletin ftb  accounting for separately priced extended warranty and product maintenance contracts 
pursuant to ftb  revenue related to separately priced product maintenance contract is deferred and recognized over the term of the maintenance period 
we record deferred revenue for amounts received from customers for maintenance contracts prior to the maintenance period 
our customers have the right to return products that do not function properly within a limited time after delivery 
we monitor and track product returns and record a provision for the estimated future returns based on historical experience 
returns have historically been within expectations and the provisions established  but we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience return rates consistent with historical patterns 
we offer some of our customers price protection as an incentive to carry inventory of our product 
these price protection plans provide that if we lower prices  we will credit them for the price decrease on inventory they hold 
our customers typically carry limited amounts of inventory  and we infrequently lower prices on current products 
as a result  the amounts paid under these plans have been minimal 
however  we cannot guarantee that this minimal level will continue 
accounts receivable we have standardized credit granting and review policies and procedures for all customer accounts  including credit reviews of all new customer accounts  ongoing credit evaluations of current customers  credit limits and payment terms based on available credit information  and adjustments to credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness 
we also provide an estimate of doubtful accounts based on historical experience and specific customer collection issues 
our allowance for doubtful accounts as of december  was  or of outstanding accounts receivable  which we feel is appropriate considering the overall quality of the accounts receivable 
while credit losses have historically been within expectations and the reserves established  we cannot guarantee that our credit loss experience will continue to be consistent with historical experience 
as of december   we had an accounts receivable balance due from harrah s casinos of of the total balance due 
no other customer accounts receivable balance exceeded 
inventory our inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
we assess market value based on historical usage and estimates of future demand 
assumptions are reviewed at least quarterly and adjustments are made  as necessary  to reflect changed market conditions 
should circumstances change and we determine that additional inventory is subject to obsolescence  additional write downs of inventory could result in a charge to income 
as of december   our net inventory included a reserve to write inventory down to lower of cost or market of  or of gross inventory 
reserves increased significantly in and remained at that level during due to several products that were discontinued during that time period 
income taxes in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this involves estimating the actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences between the tax basis of certain assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements  as well as net operating losses  tax credits and other carryforwards 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheets 
we then assess the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be realized from future taxable income  and to the extent that we believe that realization is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance 
significant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and  in particular  any valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets 
on a quarterly basis  we evaluate the recoverability of our deferred tax assets based upon historical results and forecasted taxable income over future years  and match this forecast against the basis differences  deductions available in future years and the limitations allowed for net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards to ensure that there is adequate support for the realization of the deferred tax assets 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged as a reduction to income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would be able to realize future deferred tax assets in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase net income in the period such determination was made 
as of december   we recorded a net deferred tax asset of approximately  and a valuation allowance of  primarily on a portion of our foreign tax credits  research and development credits and certain state net operating loss carryforwards 
we will need to recognize approximately million in future taxable income in order to realize all of our deferred tax assets at december  based on our projection of future taxable income  no additional valuation allowance is considered necessary 
should circumstances change and we determine that some or all of the deferred taxes would not be realized  a valuation allowance would be recorded resulting in a charge to income in the period the determination is made 
goodwill we test the impairment of goodwill each year  or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
we completed our last assessment as of december  factors considered that may trigger an impairment review are significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of acquired assets or the strategy for the overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  and significant decline in market capitalization relative to net book value 
goodwill amounted to  at december  restructuring in february  we announced plans to establish a global engineering and manufacturing center at our ithaca  ny facility 
as part of this strategic decision  we undertook a plan to consolidate all manufacturing and engineering into our existing ithaca  ny facility and close our wallingford  ct manufacturing facility the consolidation 
however  our company headquarters remains in wallingford  ct 
our technology shift to inkjet and thermal printing from dot matrix impact printing has dramatically reduced the labor content in our printers  and therefore  lowered the required production capacity 
as of december   we successfully transferred substantially all our wallingford product lines to ithaca  ny  with the exception of a small service depot that remains in connecticut 
the closing of the wallingford manufacturing facility resulted in the termination of employment of approximately production  administrative and management employees 
through december   we have incurred approximately million of expenses associated with the consolidation  including severance pay  stay bonuses  employee benefits  moving expenses  non cancelable lease payments  and other costs  of which approximately million  million and million were recognized in  and  respectively 
we do not expect to incur any additional restructuring expenses related to the consolidation beyond see the liquidity and capital resources section for a discussion of the expected impact of the consolidation on our future results of operations and cash flows 
in connection with the consolidation of manufacturing facilities in  we recorded significant accruals 
these accruals comprised severance pay  stay bonuses  employee benefits  non cancelable lease payments and certain other expenses 
management has made reasonable estimates of such costs and expenses 
however  if actual costs differ from the estimates  charges or credits to income could result in the period the adjustments are determined 
in and  we changed our estimate of sublease income on the wallingford  ct facility  resulting in additional restructuring expense 
warranty we generally warranty our products for up to months and record the estimated cost of such product warranties at the time the sale is recorded 
estimated warranty costs are based upon actual past experience of product returns and the related estimated cost of labor and material to make the necessary repairs 
if actual future product return rates or the actual costs of material and labor differ from the estimates  adjustments to the accrued warranty liability would be made 
contingencies we record an estimated liability related to contingencies based on our estimates of the probable outcomes 
on a quarterly basis  we assess the potential liability related to pending litigation  audits and other contingencies and confirm or revise estimates and reserves as appropriate 
in november  we were advised that certain pos printers sold by us since late may use technology covered by recently issued patents of a third party competitor 
in an effort to resolve this matter  we originally offered to pay approximately  while the other party sought payment of up to  we recorded a charge of  in cost of sales in the fourth quarter of related to this matter 
based on the likely outcome of current negotiations  we recorded an additional charge of  in the fourth quarter of related to usage prior to january  although settlement negotiations are continuing  we believe that the total accrual of  the patent resolution payment reflects the best estimate of the expense related to the pre usage of this third party patented technology 
we also accrued estimated royalty payments for usage of this technology after january  accumulated other comprehensive income stockholders equity contains certain items classified as other comprehensive income  including foreign currency translation adjustments related to our non us subsidiary company that has a designated functional currency other than the us dollar 
we are required to translate the subsidiary functional currency financial statements to us dollars using a combination of historical  month end and weighted average foreign exchange rates 
this combination of rates creates the foreign currency translation adjustments component of other comprehensive income 
a results of operations i year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales 
net sales by market for the years ended december  and were as follows year ended year ended change in thousands december  december  point of sale and banking    gaming and lottery    international   net sales for increased  or  from largely due to significantly higher shipments into our gaming and lottery market  as well as increased shipments into our pos market 
overall  international sales remained relatively flat in compared to point of sale and banking sales of our pos products worldwide increased approximately  or  from year ended year ended change in thousands december  december  domestic    international   domestic pos revenue increased due largely to significantly higher sales of our posjet r and bankjet r lines of inkjet printers 
sales of such inkjet printers increased by approximately in compared to the overall increase in domestic pos revenue is largely attributable to shipments of our bankjet r line of inkjet printers to two major financial services companies to upgrade bank teller stations  increased shipments of our posjet r line of inkjet printers  including shipments to one of the world s largest casual dining restaurant chains for use in their food and beverage service operations  and significantly higher service  spare parts and consumables mostly replacement inkjet cartridges revenue 
international pos revenue decreased due primarily to lower sales of our thermal fiscal printers in europe approximately 
lower thermal fiscal printer sales were largely offset by higher sales approximately  through our expanding network of international distributors and higher service  spare parts and consumables revenue approximately  largely resulting from a service contract related to printers shipped for the british post office in prior years 
such service contract expires in the second quarter of  and provides quarterly revenue of approximately  we are currently negotiating for the renewal of this contract upon its expiration  however  there can be no assurance that we will be successful 
we also continue to actively seek additional distribution partners in both latin america and europe in order to increase our breadth of coverage and future sales in these regions 
we expect sales into the pos market for the first quarter of to be consistent with those reported for the fourth quarter of however  we expect full year sales for to be modestly higher than those reported during gaming and lottery sales of our gaming and lottery products increased by  or  from  primarily due to significantly stronger sales of our slot machine and video lottery terminal vlt printers  somewhat offset by lower sales of lottery printers to gtech 
year ended year ended change in thousands december  december  domestic    international year ended year ended change in thousands december  december  gaming    lottery   sales of our gaming products  which include video lottery terminal vlt and slot machine printers used in casinos and racetracks racinos  and related spare parts and repairs  more than doubled from this increase resulted primarily from significantly increased installations of our casino printers  primarily for use in slot machines at casinos throughout north america that print receipts instead of issuing coins ticket in  ticket out or tito 
based on existing orders and sales opportunities for tito printers  we expect sales of our casino printers to continue to increase in  as more regulatory approvals for racinos are expected to be obtained and more casinos are expected to convert to ticket in  ticket out slot machines 
also  due to government budget shortfalls  many states have approved such as new york and oklahoma or are considering vlt initiatives as a means of raising revenue 
as such  we also expect sales of our vlt printers to increase in compared to due to these initiatives 
total sales to gtech  which included impact and thermal on line lottery printers  impact in lane lottery printers primarily found at checkout counters of certain grocery stores  and spare parts revenue  decreased by  to approximately  or of net sales  in  compared to  or of net sales  in see the table below for an analysis of revenues from gtech 
year ended in thousands  except december  impact on line lottery printers and spare parts   thermal on line lottery printers  in lane lottery printers of consolidated net sales sales to gtech of impact on line lottery printers and spare parts totaled approximately  in  compared to  in we have approximately  of orders from gtech for impact on line lottery printers for delivery in the second and third quarters of because our thermal on line lottery printer is a replacement for our impact on line lottery printer  we do not expect any further shipments of impact on line lottery printers in beyond the third quarter 
shipments of in lane lottery printers totaled approximately  in compared to  in since sales of in lane lottery printers are project oriented  we cannot predict if and when future sales may occur 
in july  we entered into a year agreement with gtech to provide a newly designed thermal on line lottery printer 
during  we shipped approximately  of these printers 
we made no shipments of thermal on line lottery printers during based on existing orders and expected future demand based on input from gtech  we expect sales of our thermal on line lottery printers in to be slightly less than those reported in international gaming and lottery product sales increased slightly from such sales represented less than of total sales into this market during and however  we expect growth in international gaming revenue  beginning in late  as markets such as australia and europe evaluate the use of this technology for their slot machines 
gross profit 
gross profit increased by  or  to  and gross margin increased to from 
both gross profit and gross margin for benefited from a substantial increase in the volume of sales and a more favorable sales mix  including increased sales of higher margin gaming and lottery printers in compared to gross profit included a charge of  or of net sales  and  or of net sales  related to the patent resolution payment see contingent liabilities in liquidity and capital resources in and  respectively 
we expect gross margin for to be approximately  as we gain operating leverage on higher expected sales volume in compared to engineering and product development 
engineering  design and product development expenses primarily include salary and payroll related expenses for our engineering staff  depreciation and design expenses including prototype printer expense  outside design and testing services and supplies 
such expenses increased  or  to  primarily due to higher compensation related expenses approximately  and expenses including travel related largely to the development of our new thermal on line lottery printer for gtech and our itherm tm thermal pos printer 
engineering and product development expenses decreased as a percentage of net sales to from  primarily due to significantly higher sales volume in compared to we expect engineering and product development expenses to increase in as we plan to add staff to continue increasing product development to expand our families of inkjet printers for the pos market and ticket issuing printers for the casino market 
selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses primarily include salaries and payroll related expenses for our sales and marketing staff  sales commissions  travel expenses  expenses associated with the lease of sales offices  advertising  trade show expenses and other promotional marketing expenses 
selling and marketing expenses increased by  or  to  due primarily to higher sales commissions resulting from increased sales in compared to approximately  compensation related expenses  including additional sales staff and expenses associated with the opening of a new sales office in las vegas  to support our growing gaming printer sales approximately  selling expenses at our uk facility due largely to the unfavorable impact of exchange rates in the period approximately  and marketing expenses approximately 
selling and marketing expenses decreased as a percentage of net sales to from  due primarily to higher volume of sales in compared to we expect selling and marketing expenses to increase modestly in  as we plan to add sales staff to help grow our sales and increase our breadth of coverage in our markets 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses primarily include salaries and payroll related expenses for our executive  accounting  human resource and information technology staff  expenses for our corporate headquarters  professional and legal expenses  and telecommunication expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased by  or  to  during we incurred higher legal expenses approximately  related to our growing patent portfolio and the patent resolution payment 
in addition  incentive compensation increased by approximately  these increases were somewhat offset by staff reductions resulting from the consolidation approximately 
general and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of net sales to from  due primarily to higher volume of sales in compared to we expect general and administrative expenses to increase somewhat in  due largely to planned expenses related to required compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of and additional finance staff related to our cfo transition plan and growth in our overall business 
business consolidation and restructuring 
we incurred  and  of expenses related to the consolidation in and  respectively 
these expenses were substantially the result of revisions to our original estimate for non cancelable lease payments included in the restructuring accrual 
during the third quarter of  based on regional softness in demand in the commercial real estate market  we increased our restructuring accrual by  to reflect the longer period of time then projected to sublease our wallingford  ct facility 
the accrual at december  reflected estimated sublease income after september  after expanded efforts during  we determined that because of the continuing regional decline in the commercial real estate market in  it was unlikely that we would be able to sublease our wallingford  ct facility 
as such  we increased our restructuring accrual  which represents the reversal of estimated sublease income  in the fourth quarter of by  to provide for the remaining non cancelable lease payments and other related costs for this facility through the expiration of the lease march  
we do not expect to incur any further restructuring expenses related to the consolidation beyond see consolidation expenses in liquidity and capital resources 
operating income loss 
during  we reported operating income of  or of net sales  compared to an operating loss of  or of net sales  in the significant increase in our operating income was due largely to higher gross profit on higher sales  partially offset by higher operating expenses primarily selling and marketing expenses in compared to operating income loss for and included charges related to the consolidation  and  respectively and the patent resolution payment  and  respectively 
interest 
we reported interest expense of  in compared to  in interest income decreased by  to  in the decrease in interest income was largely attributable to a higher level of invested cash in resulting from the receipt of an advance payment of approximately million  from a major customer in advance of printer shipments  the proceeds of which were used to repay outstanding revolving borrowings in at december   we had no outstanding revolving borrowings and  outstanding under a term loan  that we repaid during january we expect to generate cash during  and  as a result  expect to report interest income on our available cash in see liquidity and capital resources below for more information 
write off of deferred financing costs 
in august  we entered into a new credit facility with banknorth na  which replaced an existing facility with lasalle business credit  inc lasalle 
we recorded a charge of approximately  in the third quarter of related to the write off of unamortized deferred financing costs from our prior credit facility with lasalle 
our new credit facility with banknorth contains more favorable terms that those contained in our prior facility with lasalle  which we believe will result in significant costs savings during the term of the new credit facility 
other income expense 
other expense for primarily included transaction exchange loss recorded by our uk subsidiary 
other income for included a one time gain of  resulting from the receipt of  shares of common stock from our health insurance company  anthem  inc  upon its demutualization 
we sold these shares during the third quarter of this gain was partially offset by approximately  of transaction exchange loss recorded by our uk subsidiary during  due to the strengthening of the british pound against the dollar 
income taxes 
we recorded an income tax provision of  at an effective rate of in  and an income tax benefit of  at an effective rate of in the lower effective rate in reflects a favorable outcome of a state tax audit  benefits from certain tax credits  and utilization of state net operating loss carryforwards not previously anticipated 
we expect to record income taxes at an effective rate of approximately during net income loss 
we reported net income in of  or per share diluted after giving effect to  of dividends and accretion charges on preferred stock 
this compares to a net loss in of  or per share diluted after giving effect to  of dividends and accretion charges on preferred stock 
both per share amounts are after giving effect to  of dividends and accretion charges on preferred stock 
in future quarters  dividends and accretion charges on preferred stock will be approximately  before the effect of any conversion or redemption of the preferred stock 
ii year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales 
net sales by market for the years ended december  and were as follows year ended year ended change in thousands december  december  point of sale and banking    gaming and lottery    international    net sales for decreased  or  from largely due to lower shipments into our pos market  partially offset by higher sales into our gaming and lottery market 
overall  international sales decreased by  or  primarily due a reduction in revenue related to the british post office project approximately  kiosk printer shipments for use in a canadian government application approximately  shipments of our thermal fiscal printer in europe approximately  and pos revenue through distribution in europe and latin america approximately  partially offset by an increase in international sales of our gaming and lottery printers approximately 
point of sale and banking sales of our pos products worldwide decreased approximately  or 
year ended year ended change in thousands december  december  domestic    international    domestic pos product revenue decreased  or  as we experienced softness in demand from our domestic distributors  particularly in the first and third quarters of sales of our kiosk and atm printers and related spare parts also declined by approximately  due to steadily declining sales and low anticipated future sales  we decided to no longer sell such printers after sales in included increasing sales of our posjet line of inkjet printers 
international pos printer shipments decreased approximately for several reasons 
first  sales to icl pathway for the british post office project  which included printer shipments  spare parts and service revenue  declined by approximately  to  in we completed shipping printers for the british post office project during the first quarter of  and expect no future sales for this project  other than spare parts and service 
secondly  shipments of our thermal fiscal printer in europe declined by approximately  to  in thirdly  during  we shipped approximately  of our thermal kiosk printers for use in a canadian government application 
we made no shipments of these printers in we do not expect to make any future shipments for this application 
lastly  we experienced a decrease of approximately  in sales through distribution  primarily in latin america  and to a lesser extent  in europe 
gaming and lottery sales into the gaming and lottery market increased by  or  from  primarily due to stronger sales of our video lottery terminal vlt and slot machine printers  largely offset by lower sales of lottery printers to gtech 
year ended year ended change in thousands december  december  domestic   international year ended year ended change in thousands december  december  gaming    lottery    sales of our gaming printers  which included vlt and slot machine printers  and related spare parts and repairs  increased by approximately  or 
the increase in gaming printer sales resulted from two factors  increased installations of our vlt printers in west virginia and other states  including approximately  of sales of a custom printer to one customer and increased sales of our casino printers  primarily for use in slot machines at casinos throughout north america that print receipts instead of issuing coins ticket in  ticket out 
shipments to gtech  which included on line and in lane lottery printers and spare parts revenue  decreased  or 
see the table below for an analysis of revenues from gtech 
since sales of in lane lottery printers are project oriented  we cannot predict if and when future sales may occur 
year ended in thousands  except december  impact on line lottery printers and spare parts   in lane lottery printers of consolidated net sales gross profit 
gross profit increased by  or  to  and the gross margin also increased to from 
both gross profit and gross margin for benefited from improved sales mix and cost reductions resulting from the consolidation 
engineering and product development 
engineering  design and product development expenses decreased  or  to  and also decreased as a percentage of net sales to from 
this decrease is primarily due to a reduction in engineering staff at our wallingford  ct facility due to the consolidation 
selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses decreased  or  to  and decreased as a percentage of net sales to from 
such expenses decreased mostly due to lower planned promotional and advertising expenses and staff reductions resulting from the consolidation 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses decreased by  or  to  and decreased as a percentage of net sales to from 
the decrease primarily resulted from staff reductions resulting from the consolidation and the inclusion in of  of accelerated depreciation on certain assets located at the company s wallingford  ct facility primarily leasehold improvements and computer equipment whose useful lives were shortened as a result of the consolidation 
business consolidation and restructuring 
we incurred  of expenses related to the consolidation in these expenses were substantially the result of a revision to our estimate for non cancelable lease payments included in the restructuring accrual at september  based on regional softness in demand in the commercial real estate market  we increased our restructuring accrual by  to reflect the longer period of time then projected to sublease our wallingford  ct facility 
the accrual at december  reflected estimated sublease income after september  during  we incurred approximately  of consolidation expenses  which primarily included a portion of employee severance and termination related expenses and facility closure and consolidation expenses including moving expenses  estimated non cancelable lease payments and other costs 
see consolidation expenses in liquidity and capital resources 
operating loss 
during  we reported an operating loss of  or of net sales  compared to an operating loss of  or of net sales  in the reduction in our operating loss was due to significantly reduced operating expenses as a direct result of the consolidation  lower consolidation expenses and higher gross margin 
interest 
net interest expense decreased by  to  in  due largely to a significant reduction in our average outstanding borrowings under our revolving bank facility resulting from significantly lower inventories approximately  receipt of an advance payment from a customer  and to a lesser extent  lower interest rates 
other income 
other income for includes a one time gain of  resulting from the receipt of  shares of common stock from our health insurance company  anthem  inc  upon its demutualization 
we sold these shares during the third quarter of this gain was partially offset by approximately  of transaction exchange loss recorded by our uk subsidiary during  due to the strengthening of the british pound against the dollar  mostly in the second quarter of income taxes 
we recorded an income tax benefit of  and  in and  respectively  at an effective rate of approximately in each period 
net loss 
we reported a net loss in of  or per share basic and diluted after giving effect to  of dividends and accretion charges on preferred stock 
this compares to a net loss of  or per share basic and diluted after giving effect to  of dividends and accretion charges on preferred stock in in future quarters  dividends and accretion charges on preferred stock will be approximately  before the effect of any conversion or redemption of the preferred stock 
b liquidity and capital resources cash flow overview during  we significantly improved our operating results 
we reported our first profitable year since and as of december  reported no revolving bank debt 
looking forward  we expect to generate approximately to million in cash from operations during and have between and million of cash on our balance sheet at the end of we also expect to earn interest income on our available cash balance throughout operating activities the following significant factors affected our cash provided by operations of  in we reported net income of  we recorded depreciation  amortization and non cash compensation expense of  accounts receivable increased by  because of significantly higher sales in the fourth quarter of compared to the fourth quarter of inventories decreased by  despite a significant increase in sales  due to improved inventory management 
accounts payable increased by  due to the timing of payments and increased inventory purchases resulting from a higher volume of sales 
accrued liabilities increased by  primarily due to higher compensation related accruals and an increase in deferred revenue on extended warranty contracts and other customer prepayments 
accrued license fees increased by  related to the patent resolution payment see contingent liabilities below 
accrued restructuring expenses increased by  see consolidation expenses below 
investing activities we used approximately  of cash for investing activities in compared to using  in our capital expenditures were approximately  and  in and  respectively 
expenditures in primarily included new product tooling largely for our new thermal on line lottery printer for gtech and our newly introduced itherm tm thermal pos printer  and to a lesser extent  computer equipment 
we expect capital expenditures for to be approximately  primarily for tooling for new products and enhanced versions of our existing products 
during the second quarter of  we received cash proceeds of  plus accrued interest  from an officer of the company in repayment of an outstanding loan

in an effort to resolve this matter  we originally offered to pay approximately  while the other party sought payment of up to  we recorded a charge of  in cost of sales in the fourth quarter of related to this matter 
based on the likely outcome of current negotiations  we recorded an additional charge of  in the fourth quarter of related to usage prior to january  although settlement negotiations are continuing  we believe that the total accrual of  the patent resolution payment reflects the best estimate of the expense related to the pre usage of this third party patented technology 
we also accrued estimated royalty payments for usage of this technology after january  credit facility and borrowings on august   we entered into a new million credit facility the banknorth credit facility with banknorth na the banknorth credit facility replaced our prior credit facility the lasalle credit facility with lasalle business credit  inc lasalle

we recorded a charge of approximately  in the third quarter of related to the write off of unamortized deferred financing costs from our prior credit facility with lasalle 
our new credit facility with banknorth contains more favorable terms than those contained in our prior facility with lasalle 
as of december   we had no outstanding borrowings on the revolving credit line and  outstanding under the term loan 
undrawn commitments under the banknorth credit facility were approximately  at december  however  our maximum additional available borrowings under the facility were limited to approximately  at december  based on the borrowing base of our collateral 
annual principal payments on the term loan are  we repaid the remaining balance on the term loan in january we were in compliance with all financial covenants of the banknorth credit facility at december  prior to the banknorth credit facility  we operated under a three year  million credit facility the lasalle credit facility with lasalle which was scheduled to expire on may  the lasalle credit facility provided a million revolving credit line  a million term loan and a million equipment loan facility

on july   the holders exercised their  warrants 
in lieu of cash consideration  we canceled  of their warrants in exchange for the issuance of  shares of common stock 
shareholders equity shareholders equity increased by  to  at december  from  at december  the increase was primarily due to the following for the year ended december  net income available to common shareholders of  the repayment by an officer of an outstanding loan of  proceeds of approximately  from the issuance of approximately  shares of common stock from stock option exercises and purchase from our employee stock purchase plan  an increase in additional paid in capital of approximately  resulting from the recording of a deferred tax asset from tax deductions arising from stock option exercises and an increase in accumulated other comprehensive income of  due to translation adjustments from our uk subsidiary 
consolidation expenses during  we incurred approximately  of business consolidation  restructuring and related charges as a result of the consolidation 
these expenses primarily included employee severance and termination related expenses  facility closure and consolidation expenses including moving expenses  estimated non cancelable lease payments and other costs and accelerated depreciation and asset disposal losses on certain leasehold improvements and other fixed assets 
although the consolidation was substantially completed in  we incurred an additional  expenses associated with the consolidation during during  we revised our original estimate for future sublease payments included in the restructuring accrual 
based on regional softness in demand in the commercial real estate market  we increased the restructuring accrual by  to reflect the longer period of time then projected to sublease our wallingford  ct facility 
after expanded efforts in  we determined that because of the continuing regional decline in the commercial real estate market during  it was unlikely that we would be able to sublease our wallingford  ct manufacturing facility  which has a lease term that expires in march as a result  during the fourth quarter of  we increased our restructuring accrual by  to provide for the remaining non cancelable lease payments and related costs associated with the manufacturing facility 
this increase represented the reversal of estimated sublease income for the remainder of the lease term 
in addition  we determined that we will not terminate several employees originally included in the consolidation 
as a result  we reversed the remaining  of accrued restructuring expenses in related to employee severance and termination expenses  as we completed all required payments for such expenses by december as a result of the consolidation  we significantly lowered our cost structure in and  with annual cost savings of over million compared to we believe such cost savings will continue to contribute to additional operating leverage in we do not expect to incur any additional restructuring expense related to the consolidation beyond see note to the consolidated financial statements for further detail 
of the total of  of consolidation expenses  approximately  required or will require cash outlays 
we paid approximately   and  of these costs in  and  respectively

resource sufficiency we believe that cash flows generated from operations and borrowings available under the banknorth credit facility will provide sufficient resources to meet our working capital needs  including costs associated with the consolidation and the patent resolution payment  to finance our capital expenditures and meet our liquidity requirements through at least december  our series b preferred stock is redeemable at the option of the holders on or after april  for an aggregate of  we believe that cash flows generated from operations and borrowings available under the banknorth credit facility will also provide sufficient resources to satisfy redemption of the preferred stock in  if it were to occur 
however  we may also consider additional financing sources as appropriate  including raising additional equity capital

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
these borrowings bear interest at variable rates and the fair value of this indebtedness is not significantly affected by changes in market interest rates 
an effective increase or decrease of in the current effective interest rates under our credit facility would not have a material effect on our results of operations or cash flows 
foreign currency exchange risk a substantial portion of our sales are denominated in us dollars and  as a result  we have relatively little exposure to foreign currency exchange risk with respect to sales made 
this exposure may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results in the future 
we do not use forward exchange contracts to hedge exposures denominated in foreign currencies or any other derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the effect of an immediate change in exchange rates would not have a material impact on our future results of operations or cash flows
