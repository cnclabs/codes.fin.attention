summary and outlook redwood trust is a financial institution located in mill valley  california 
we invest in real estate loans and securities created from real estate loans 
our largest investment is in high quality jumbo residential real estate loans and related real estate loan securities 
we also invest in commercial real estate loans and various other types of residential and commercial real estate loan securities 
we acquire a majority of our residential real estate loans from well established real estate loan origination companies throughout the united states 
we fund the majority of our investments with securitized long term debt 
our primary financial goal is to maintain steady regular dividend payments to our shareholders 
our primary source of revenue is interest income consisting of the monthly loan payments made by homeowners and commercial property owners on their loans 
our expenses consist primarily of interest expense on our debt and operating expenses 
redwood trust is structured as a real estate investment trust reit 
as a reit  we are required to distribute to shareholders as dividends the majority of the reit taxable income our taxable income excluding income earned in non reit taxable subsidiaries that we earn 
during we earned an estimated million of taxable income  of which million was reit taxable income 
our gaap earnings as calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles totaled million or per share for  as compared to million or per share for  and million or per share for our results were driven by the quality of our existing real estate loan investments  a favorable operating environment  excellent credit results  favorable prepayment patterns  increased capital efficiencies  and income generated from discount securities that were called during at full face value 
during  we continued to satisfy our dividend distribution requirements as a reit 
our regular dividend rate during was per share per quarter 
for the full year of  we declared regular common dividends of per share and a special dividend of per share 
in and  we declared regular common dividends of and per share and special dividends of and per share  respectively 
in march  our board of directors declared a first quarter regular dividend of per share and a special dividend of per share  payable on april  to 
table of contents shareholders of record on march  looking ahead  we believe our earnings will continue to benefit from the quality of our existing assets 
however  the extraordinary market conditions of the last few years that increased our realized yields on our seasoned assets attractive acquisition pricing  excellent credit results  and favorable prepayment rate patterns are unlikely to continue or to be repeated 
we also expect to face increased competition  higher acquisition pricing  and a reduced supply of acquisition opportunities 
the volume of fixed and hybrid securitizations has decreased as banks and other financial institutions purchase residential real estate loans and hold these assets unsecuritized  and we expect that this increased competition will continue 
as our existing earning assets pay down  we will continue to acquire new assets 
we believe we can source new assets with attractive return potential  but we do not expect these new assets to generate the same level of yields we are currently enjoying on our more seasoned assets 
improvements in our return on equity  earnings  and dividends have been driven in part by increased capital efficiencies that we have realized through selling or resecuritizing assets 
in achieving these capital efficiencies  we have increased potential earnings sensitivities with respect to credit risk and certain types of prepayment risks 
as of the end of  we believe we have completed most of the reallocating and recycling of capital that we intend to undertake  and we believe there are unlikely to be further significant gains in return on equity from our current capital efficiency initiatives 
overall  we believe we will continue to be a leading competitor as a result of our operating efficiencies  our intense and specialized business focus  and the relationships we have developed with our business partners 
although we believe it is unlikely we will be able to sustain our earnings and special dividend distributions on a per share basis at s extraordinary levels  we believe we will continue to generate earnings sufficient to sustain our regular dividend rate in the near future 
first quarter update the share of residential originations in the overall jumbo real estate loan market that are adjustable rate has been rising  so origination volumes of the loans we generally acquire have remained strong 
we have agreed to acquire billion of these loans year to date through march  we continue to increase the number of origination companies we acquire loans from as more companies start to originate libor adjustable rate loans 
competition to acquire these loans continues to increase  and prices continue to rise 
as a result  our new investments in these assets are unlikely to earn yields as high as our existing portfolio is earning currently  and our exposure to an increase in prepayment rates of adjustable rate loans is increasing 
we have completed two sequoia program securitizations of residential loans thus far in the first quarter 
we were able to issue securities at tighter spreads to libor than in the past  tighter spreads reduce our cost of funds and partially offset the effect of the higher prices we are paying for loans 
also  as part of our on going efforts to recycle capital to improve capital efficiency  we completed a re securitization of interest only securities retained from our sequoia securitizations  thus freeing million of equity capital for reinvestment 
we continue to acquire residential loan credit enhancement securities at a pace consistent with  agreeing to acquire million in market value of these securities year to date through march  in january  we sold residential loan credit enhancement securities with a principal value of million originally rated bb  some have been upgraded that had significantly appreciated  generating a gaap gain of million 
after this sale  almost all of our bb rated residential credit enhancement securities have been sold  called  or re securitized via our acacia cdo program 
the remainder of our residential loan credit enhancement portfolio is rated single b or is unrated  we hold these securities with equity capital without leverage 
in january and february  residential loan credit enhancement securities with a principal value of million were called  generating a gaap gain of million 
rapid prepayments  strong credit results  and rising housing prices continue to benefit this portfolio 
we continue to acquire commercial real estate loans securities for our acacia cdo program  and we have commenced acquisitions of unrated and single b rated commercial credit enhancement securities 

table of contents we intend to price our fourth acacia cdo securitization during the first quarter of year to date through march  we agreed to acquire million diverse real estate securities as collateral for our acacia program 
we are buying residential and commercial real estate loan securities for this transaction at significantly tighter spreads effectively  lower yields and higher prices than in the past 
competition for these assets is increasing as new entrants and established competitors in the real estate cdo market seek to accumulate assets 
we expect our returns from our retained equity in acacia cdo will be attractive despite higher acquisition pricing for the underlying assets  as spreads over libor for the cdo securities we intend to issue to fund these assets have also tightened 
new mortgage reits are being formed and are seeking equity capital  and some residential real estate loan originators are converting to mortgage reits 
some of these firms will likely compete with us in the future 
meanwhile  banks continue to acquire and retain significant amounts of loans for their balance sheets  thus reducing the amount of real estate loans  credit enhancement securities  and securities suitable for acacia that we have the opportunity to acquire 
although asset acquisition prices continue to increase and the opportunity to generate extraordinary returns from real estate assets has lessened  we continue to create new investments that we believe will be generally attractive to shareholders over time 
to fund our anticipated acquisitions  we currently plan to continue to issue new common shares during the year through our direct stock purchase and dividend reinvestment plan and also through one or more equity offerings 
to the extent stock issuance occurs at prices in excess of book value per share  earnings and dividends per share in the future may benefit because we will have a greater amount of cash equity per share available to generate cash flow 
stock issuance may  however  reduce the amount of special dividends on a per share basis that would otherwise be payable in and or in the event that we have a strong year of taxable income generation in supplemental financial data supplemental financial data and additional financial measures regarding our operations are available on our web site at www

critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of certain assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of certain revenues and expenses during the reported period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the critical accounting policies and how changes in estimates might affect our financial results and statements are discussed below 
management discusses the ongoing development and selection of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors  and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosures provided in this form k 
establishing valuations and accounting for changes in valuations we estimate the fair value of certain assets and interest rate agreements using available market information and other appropriate valuation methodologies 
valuations of our residential real estate loans held for sale are generally done on a pool basis while valuations of our commercial real estate loans held for sale  and securities available for sale are done on an asset specific basis 
we believe the estimates we use reflect the values we may be able to receive should we choose to sell them 
our estimates are inherently subjective in nature and involve matters of uncertainty and judgment to interpret relevant market and other data 
many factors are necessary to estimate market values  including  but not limited to interest rates  prepayment rates  amount and timing of credit losses  supply and demand  liquidity  and other market factors 
in addition to our valuation processes  we are active acquirers and occasional sellers of the assets and interest rate agreements we own 
thus  we have the ability to understand and determine changes in assumptions that are taking place in the marketplace and make appropriate changes in our assumptions for valuing assets in our portfolio 
in addition  we generally use third party sources to validate our estimates 

table of contents valuation adjustments to our real estate loans held for sale and our trading securities are reported as net unrealized and realized market value gains on our consolidated statements of income in the applicable period of the adjustment 
in general  adjustments to the fair value of our securities available for sale are reported through our balance sheet as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders equity within the cumulative unrealized gains and losses classified as accumulated other comprehensive income 
the exception to this treatment of our securities available for sale is when a specific impairment is identified or a decrease in fair value results from a decline in estimated cash flows that may be considered an other than temporary change 
in such cases  the resulting decrease in fair value is recorded in net unrealized and realized market value gains losses on our consolidated statements of income in the applicable period of the adjustment 
we review our fair value calculations on an ongoing basis 
we monitor the critical performance factors for each loan and security 
our expectations of future performance are shaped by input and analyses received from external sources  internal models  and our own judgment and experience 
we constantly review our existing assumptions relative to our and the market s expectations of future events and make adjustments to the assumptions that may change our market values and yields 
changes in perceptions regarding future events can have a material impact on the value of our assets 
should such changes  or other factors  result in significant changes in the market values  our net income and or book value could be adversely affected 
revenue recognition when recognizing revenue on our earning assets  we employ the effective yield method to account for purchase premiums  discounts  and other net capitalized fees or costs associated with purchasing and financing our real estate loans and securities 
the use of this method requires us to project cash flows over the remaining life of each asset and certain liabilities 
these projections include assumptions about interest rates  prepayment rates  timing and amount of credit losses  when certain tests will be met that may allow for changes in payments made under the structure of securities  estimates regarding the likelihood and timing of calls of securities at par  and other factors 
we review our cash flow projections on an ongoing basis and monitor these projections based on input and analyses received from external sources  internal models  and our own judgment and experience 
we constantly review our assumptions and make adjustments to the cash flows as deemed necessary 
there can be no assurance that our assumptions used to generate future cash flows  or the current period s yield for each asset  will prove to be accurate 
under the effective yield method  decreases in our credit loss assumptions imbedded in our cash flow forecasts could result in increasing yields being recognized from our current portfolio of residential loan credit enhancement securities 
in addition  faster than anticipated prepayment rates would also tend to increase realized yields over the remaining life of the asset 
in contrast  increases in our credit loss assumptions and or slower than anticipated prepayment rates could result in lower yields being recognized under the effective yield method and may represent a permanent impairment  in which case the asset may be written down to its fair value through the consolidated statement of income 
credit reserves the credit reserve for our residential real estate loans is adjusted by taking credit provisions through our consolidated statements of income 
the reserves are the result of estimates of collective loan impairment considering historical loss experience including industry and rating agency data  current conditions  and adjustments to historic conditions 
our collective loan impairment evaluation may consider several components including  but not limited to  such factors as the age of loans  underwriting standards  business climate  economic conditions  geographic considerations  past performance of similar loans and other observable data including our extensive industry experience 
the amount of credit protection for our residential loan credit enhancement securities is a designated component of the purchase discount 
our residential loan credit enhancement securities have below investment grade credit ratings and represent subordinated interests in pools of high quality jumbo residential real estate loans 
as a result of these characteristics  we purchase credit enhancement securities at a discount 
a portion of the purchase discount is subsequently accreted as interest income under the effective yield method while the remaining portion of the purchase discount is considered credit 
table of contents protection 
the amount of credit protection is based upon our assessment of various factors affecting our assets  including economic conditions  characteristics of the underlying loans  delinquency status  past performance of similar loans  and external credit protection 
we use a variety of internal and external credit risk  cash flow modeling  and portfolio analytical tools to assist us in our assessment 
the credit reserve for our commercial loans is established based on expected credit losses associated with individually impaired loans at the time an expected loss becomes probable and can be reasonably estimated 
for certain commercial loans purchased at a discount to the face value of the loan  the credit reserve is a designated component of the purchase discount calculated at the time of purchase  subject to ongoing review 
many of the assets in our securities portfolio benefit from material forms of credit enhancement  and  thus no credit reserves have been established to date for these assets 
unrealized losses on these securities are reported as a component of net unrealized and realized market value gains in our consolidated statements of income if the decline in value is considered to represent a permanent impairment 
for all of our earning assets  actual credit losses and the timing of these losses may differ from our estimated losses 
although we continually review and update  as appropriate  all of our assumptions  there can be no assurance that our assumptions used to estimate credit losses  cash flows  fair values  and effective yields will prove to be correct as interest rates  economic conditions  real estate conditions  and the market s perception of the future constantly change 
accounting for derivatives instruments interest rate agreements we incorporate the use of derivative instruments to manage certain risks such as market value risk and interest rate risk 
the derivative instruments we employ may include  but are not limited to  interest rate swaps  interest rate options  options on swaps  futures contracts  options on futures contracts  options on forward purchases  and other similar derivatives 
we collectively refer to these derivative instruments as interest rate agreements 
on the date the interest rate agreement is entered into  we designate the interest rate agreement as either a hedge of the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or of an unrecognized firm commitment fair value hedge  a hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability cash flow hedge  or held for trading trading instrument 
prior to the fourth quarter of  we chose not to seek hedge accounting treatment for any of our interest rate agreements and therefore all of our derivative instruments were designated as trading instruments and were recorded at their estimated fair market value with changes in their fair value reported in current period earnings in net unrealized and realized market value gains on our consolidated statements of income 
in the fourth quarter of  we began electing hedge accounting for certain of our interest rate agreements 
certain interest rate agreements we enter into are accounted for as cash flow hedges  are recorded at their estimated fair market value  and changes in their fair value are generally reported in accumulated other comprehensive income on our consolidated balance sheets 
any ineffective portions of the cash flow hedges are included in our consolidated statements of income 
we may discontinue hedge accounting prospectively when we determine that the derivative is no longer effective in offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows of a hedged item  it is no longer probable that the forecasted transaction will occur  a hedged firm commitment no longer meets the definition of a firm commitment  or that designating the derivative as a hedging instrument is no longer appropriate 
results of operations our earnings for were million  or per share  an increase from the per share and the per share we earned in and  respectively

beginning in the fourth quarter of  we expanded our use of interest rate agreements due to asset growth  changes in risk exposures  and other factors 
we use these interest rate agreements in an effort to reduce earnings volatility that may arise from our variable rate liabilities 
we utilize cash flow hedge accounting treatment for many of redwood s interest rate agreements and for sequoia and acacia interest rate agreements consolidated onto our balance sheet 
under this accounting treatment  interest 
table of contents rate agreements are reported at fair market value through our consolidated balance sheet  with any ineffective portion of the hedges reflected in our consolidated statements of income through interest expense

a significant portion of our operating expenses reflect variable performance based compensation  primarily employee bonus and dividend equivalent rights der expenses 
these costs were significantly higher in as compared to prior years due to stronger financial results 
for the years ended december    and  we accrued bonus and der expenses of million  million  and million  respectively 
our operating expenses include the expenses associated with a portion of our stock options that require variable accounting treatment 
this expense represents the change in the in the money amount stock price less strike price  times number of options outstanding of a portion of our outstanding stock options 
this is not a cash expense 
we incur this expense when our stock price increases 
during  we recognized in operating expenses a variable stock option expense of million  as compared to million in  and million in in the fourth quarter of  we adopted  effective january   the fair value method of accounting for stock options expense and related items for all stock options granted since january  for the stock options granted during  the estimated fair value of these options will be amortized as an operating expense on our consolidated statements of income over the options related vesting period 
any future cash dividend equivalent right der payments on these stock options will be recorded as a payment of dividends and a reduction of retained earnings

net unrealized and realized market value gains and losses certain assets are marked to market through accumulated other comprehensive income  these adjustments affect our book value but not our net income 
for  we reported a net increase in accumulated other comprehensive income of million  as compared to an increase of million during and an increase of million during changes in this account may reflect increases or decreases in the fair value of our earning assets or interest rate agreements during the period  and may also reflect changes due to calls of our securities  write downs to fair value of a portion of our securities  premium or discount amortization of our securities  or amortization of realized gains and losses on our interest rate agreements 
fluctuations in the market value of certain of our real estate loan assets and interest rate agreements may also affect our net income 
the million of net unrealized and realized market value gains reported during on our consolidated statements of income was comprised of million of net realized gains related to redemptions calls of our credit enhancement securities and other security sales and million of net realized gains related to the sale of residential and commercial real estate loans held for sale  offset by million of net unrealized losses related to valuation adjustments to our interest rate agreements accounted for as trading instruments and fair value adjustments of a portion of our securities totaling million

common dividends and taxable income our primary financial goal is to pay a steady regular dividend to our shareholders 
although there are circumstances under which the board of directors may decide that it is in the best interest of redwood trust and its shareholders to reduce our regular dividend  our current outlook is that our current regular dividend rate is reasonably sustainable  given our current expectations for cash flow generation and other factors 
we estimate that our taxable income totaled million for of the estimated million in total taxable income we earned in  million was reit taxable income  and million was earned at our taxable reit subsidiary  holdings

our income from call activity was long term capital gain income for tax 
during approximately of our dividends distributed were characterized as a distribution of long term capital gain income  and the remaining were characterized as a distribution of ordinary income 
our tax paying shareholders may benefit to the degree they can take advantage of the lower tax rate on capital gains versus ordinary income 
our taxable income differs from our gaap income for many reasons 
for example  our gaap income is reduced by credit expenses accrued in anticipation of credit losses while taxable income is reduced by credit losses only when they are realized 
additionally  unrealized mark to market fluctuations are generally not included in taxable income  and certain compensation related items are treated differently for gaap and tax both in terms of timing and also total expenses over time

we plan to continue to expand our relationships with originators and to expand the types of residential loans we

redwood plans to continue selling its residential loans to sequoia  and sequoia intends to continue securitizing these loans

at december  and  the adjusted cost basis of our residential loan credit enhancement securities was million and million  respectively 
we mark these securities to market on our consolidated balance sheets 
the million and million difference between our adjusted cost basis and our carrying value represents net unrealized market value gains at december  and  respectively 
of the million difference between the principal value and adjusted cost basis of these residential loan credit enhancement securities at december   we designated million as internal credit protection reflecting our estimate of likely credit losses on the underlying loans over the life of these securities  with the remaining million representing a purchase discount to be accreted into income over time 
during  we acquired residential loan credit enhancement securities with a principal value of million and we experienced principal payments  including calls  of million 
we intend to continue to invest in these securities in the total loans underlying these residential loan credit enhancement securities increased from billion on december  to billion on december  although the loans we credit enhance increased in total  rapid prepayments of these underlying loans throughout reduced the amount of loans credit enhanced by each individual security  and thus reduced potential credit risk for each of the securities 
residential loan credit enhancement securities become callable as they season  usually when the current balance of the underlying loans declines under of the original securitized loan balance 
calls are usually beneficial for us in the near term  as we receive a payment for the full principal value of an asset that  in general  we acquired at a discount to the principal value 
calls typically diminish on going earnings per share  however  as it is usually our highest yielding assets that get called 
during  residential loan credit enhancement securities with a principal value of million were called  resulting in net realized gains of million 
of the million of net realized gains related to redemptions calls of our credit enhancement securities recognized on our consolidated statements of income during  million had been recognized as unrealized gains in accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders equity through december  on our consolidated balance sheet 
we expect to realize additional call income in from the million principal value of residential credit enhancement securities we owned as of december  that were callable and from other securities that will become callable during we do not have an accurate way  however  to determine when or if these callable securities will be called 
commercial real estate loans our commercial real estate loan portfolio decreased during from million at december  to million at december  we structured and acquired six commercial loan subordinated participations totaling million during we sold a million senior loan participation in one of our commercial whole loans we accounted for this sale as the issuance of long term debt 
during  we received principal payments totaling million for the payoff of four commercial loans 
we plan to continue to invest in more commercial loans and commercial loan participations in the future 

table of contents securities portfolio we continue to acquire diverse residential real estate loan securities  commercial real estate loan securities  interests in real estate oriented collateralized debt obligations cdos  and corporate bonds issued by reits  in each case primarily rated aa  a  bbb  and bb 
we transfer the securities we acquire to acacia bankruptcy remote securitization trusts 
acacia issues cdo asset backed securities to fund the acquisition of these assets 
we consolidate acacia s assets  and we reflect acacia s issuance of cdo asset backed securities as non recourse long term debt on our consolidated balance sheet 
our consolidated securities portfolio totaled million in carrying value on december   of which million were owned by acacia securitization trusts 
during  we acquired securities totaling million and received payments of principal totaling million  as a result  our consolidated securities portfolio grew significantly from the million of securities we reported on a consolidated basis on december  prior to the transfer of our securities to acacia  we finance our acquisitions of securities with short term recourse debt typically through a third party warehouse agreement 
at december   we had million of short term debt outstanding collateralized by our securities portfolio 
reserves for credit losses and credit results residential real estate loans the reserve for credit losses on our residential real estate loans is included as a component of our residential real estate loans on our consolidated balance sheet 
the balance of this reserve represents estimated losses as of december  and our residential real estate loan reserve balance was of the current balance of this portfolio as of december   as compared to of the current balance of this portfolio as of december  during   and  the provision for credit losses recorded on our consolidated statements on income was million  million  and million  respectively 
charge offs recorded in this portfolio totaled million  million  and million during   and  respectively 
charge offs on our residential real estate loan portfolio remained at an annualized rate of less than basis point during delinquencies increased from million at december  to million at december  delinquencies include loans delinquent more than days  in bankruptcy  in foreclosure  and real estate owned 
as a percentage of our loan portfolio  delinquencies remained at low levels relative to the us residential real estate loans as a whole and stood at of our current loan balances at december  although our recent credit results were favorable  probable losses exist in the portfolio as of december  and we expect delinquencies and charge offs of our current residential loans to increase from current levels 
residential loan credit enhancement securities credit losses on residential loans that we credit enhance through our ownership of residential loan credit enhancement securities totaled million during the annualized rate of credit loss was less than basis point of the billion of underlying loans we credit enhanced at december  some of our residential loan credit enhancement securities benefit from first or second loss interests held by others external credit enhancement 
of the million total credit losses to the underlying loans during  million were borne by external credit enhancement while million were incurred by us reducing the principal value of our residential loan credit enhancement securities by million 
delinquencies over days  foreclosure  bankruptcy  and reo in the underlying portfolio of residential loans that we credit enhance were million at december  and million at december  delinquencies as a percentage of the residential loans we credit enhance decreased from at december  to at december  we expect delinquencies and losses for our existing residential loan credit enhancement securities to increase further from their current modest levels  given a weaker economy and the natural seasoning pattern of these loans 
at december   we had million of external credit enhancement and million of internally designated credit protection for this portfolio as compared to million of external credit enhancement and million of internally designated credit protection as of december  external credit 
table of contents protection serves to protect us from credit losses on a specific asset basis and represents the principal value of interests that are junior to us and are owned by others 
the combined balance of external and internally designated credit protection represented basis points of the billion of loans underlying our credit enhancement portfolio 
the amount of credit protection and the related risks are specific to each credit enhancement interest 
commercial real estate loans we have been investing in commercial real estate loans since our first commercial real estate loan became delinquent in the fourth quarter of we estimated that the net realizable value of this million face value loan was approximately  and we wrote down the loan in  anticipating a  loss 
we received a payoff of this loan during the third quarter of totaling certain business and economic factors as well as factors particular to each of our other commercial loans could cause credit concerns and issues on other loans in our portfolio in the future 
if this occurs  we may need to provide for future losses on our commercial loans held for investment or reduce the reported value for commercial loans held for sale 
during the fourth quarter of  we wrote down the reported value of a commercial loan held for sale by  in addition  we established a credit reserve of  on a commercial loan classified as held for investment 
in both cases  the actions were precipitated by vacancies at the underlying properties 
securities portfolio the securities portfolio consists of real estate loan securities including prime residential  sub prime residential  manufactured housing  second lien residential  diverse commercial real estate  real estate cdo securities and equity  and corporate debt issued by reits that own commercial real estate properties 
as investors in these generally investment grade and bb rated securities  we are typically exposed to the credit risk of the underlying real estate loans but we also benefit for most of our assets from some credit enhancement that the rating agencies require in order to give these securities an investment grade or bb rating 
we have had no credit losses from this portfolio during the year ended december  however  we incurred unrealized market value write downs of million on this portfolio during which are reflected as a component of net unrealized and realized market value gains on the consolidated statements of income 
these write downs were primarily due to increased delinquencies of manufactured housing loans underlying manufactured housing securities in this portfolio 
the market values of these securities have declined  and their credit ratings have been downgraded 
short term debt short term debt was million at december  and million at december  these borrowings have maturities of less than one year and interest rates that change monthly based upon a margin over the one month libor 
our strategy is to use short term debt to fund the accumulation of assets prior to the transfer to sequoia or acacia for securitization 
our levels of short term debt vary from quarter to quarter based on the timing of our asset accumulation activities  and the timing of transfer of assets to sequoia and acacia 
we believe our short term debt balances are most likely to remain between and billion 
long term debt we currently fund our operations with equity and with short term debt used to temporarily finance assets prior to their transfer to securitization trusts 
the long term debt on our consolidated balance sheet represents obligations that will be repaid exclusively from the cash flows from the assets that have been transferred to the securitization trusts 
we own subordinated interests in sequoia and acacia securitization trusts 
these entities issue mortgage and asset backed securities that are obligations of the securitization trust and are non recourse to redwood 
we consolidate the securities issued by these trusts onto our balance sheet as long term debt 
long term debt consolidated in this manner totaled billion at december  and 
table of contents billion at december  the majority of the securities that sequoia and acacia issue pay a coupon rate that adjusts every month  every three months  or every six months to either one  three  or six month libor plus a margin 
sequoia trusts issue mortgage backed securities to finance residential real estate loans 
sequoia had billion of mortgage backed securities outstanding at december  versus billion at december  during  sequoia issued billion of mortgage backed securities 
acacia trusts issue asset backed securities of a type known as collateralized debt obligations cdo to fund their acquisition of real estate securities 
acacia cdo issuance outstanding principal value was million and million as of december  and  respectively 
acacia issued million principal value of cdo securities during equity capital our common equity base increased  from million at december  to million at december  as a result of million in earnings  million in stock issuance and stock option exercises  a million conversion of preferred stock to common stock in may  and a million net increase in the values of certain assets marked to market through our consolidated balance sheet  as offset by million in dividends paid or declared during we intend to raise additional equity capital in the future when opportunities to expand our business are attractive and when we believe such issuance is likely to benefit long term earnings and dividends per share 
cash requirements and sources of cash we require cash to fund our investing and operating activities  service our debt  and fund our dividend distributions 
our primary sources of cash are short term borrowings  the issuance of mortgage backed securities accounted for as long term debt  investment proceeds including principal and interest payments from our real estate loan investments  and the issuance of common stock 
we purchase real estate loan investments with cash sourced from short term borrowings prior to financing these assets to maturity with long term non recourse debt through sequoia and acacia bankruptcy remote securitization trusts 
our sources of short term borrowings include repurchase agreements  bank borrowings  and other forms of collateralized short term borrowings 
after the accumulation period  we finance to maturity our residential real estate loans and certain other real estate securities we have accumulated for acacia with long term non recourse debt by issuing securities through our sequoia and acacia securitization trusts 
these trusts issue non recourse mortgage backed and asset backed security obligations primarily in a senior subordinated structure to provide credit enhancement to the senior security interests in the pool 
our business depends upon being able to access both the short term debt market and mortgage backed and asset backed securities markets to fund investments in real estate 
if these markets are not available in the future  we would only be able to fund new assets to the extent we had equity capital 
our long term financed assets would not be affected by a lack of liquidity in the debt markets since these assets are financed with securities that are not only non recourse  but also have payments tied to the related pledged assets 
if the securitization markets were not available and financing from short term debt was not available  assets previously held with short term debt would have to be sold to the extent we could not finance them with available equity capital 
as required by the governing documents related to each series of securities issuance  the sequoia and acacia bond collateral is held in the custody of trustees 
trustees collect principal and interest payments less servicing and related fees on the bond collateral and make corresponding principal and interest payments on the securities 
these payments are reflected on our consolidated statement of cash flows under cash flows from financing activities but are restricted to the payment of securities accounted for as long term debt on a series by series basis 
accordingly  such cash flows from one series are not available for payments on any other series or for general corporate purposes 
obligations under our long term debt are payable 
table of contents solely from the bond collateral and are otherwise non recourse to redwood trust 
typically  cash from the underlying assets is first distributed to the senior securities while any credit losses in the loan pool first reduces the principal of the subordinated interests 
at any point in time  a portion of the other assets reported on our consolidated balance sheets includes restricted cash held by securitization trusts to pay holders of sequoia and acacia securities 
off balance sheet commitments the majority of our assets are funded with long term debt issued in securitizations 
we consolidate the assets and liabilities of these securitizations and therefore these transactions do not create off balance sheet commitments 
our only category of off balance sheet commitments are the forward purchase commitments we enter into to purchase real estate loan assets 
at december   pursuant to the ordinary course of business  we had commitments to purchase million real estate loan investments which settled in january the fair value remained unchanged from commitment through settlement date 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we seek to manage the risks inherent in our business including credit risk  liquidity risk  interest rate risk  prepayment risk  market value risk  reinvestment risk  and capital risk in a prudent manner designed to insure redwood s longevity 
at the same time  we endeavor  to the best of our ability  to provide our shareholders a steady regular dividend 
in general  we seek to assume risks that can be quantified from historical experience  to actively manage such risks  to earn sufficient compensation to justify the taking of such risks  and to maintain capital levels consistent with the risks we do take 
credit risk the majority of our credit risk comes from high quality residential real estate loans 
this includes residential real estate loans and loans we effectively guarantee or insure through the acquisitions of residential loan credit enhancement securities 
we are also exposed to credit risks in our commercial real estate loan portfolio  our residential and commercial real estate securities portfolio  and with counterparties with whom we do business 
the method that we use to account for future credit losses depends upon the type of asset that we own 
for our residential real estate loans  we establish a credit reserve based on an estimate of credit losses by taking credit provisions through our consolidated statements of income 
for our residential loan credit enhancement securities  we designate a portion of the purchased discount as a credit reserve upon the acquisition of such assets 
in addition  first loss and other credit enhancement interests that we do not own that are junior to our positions act as a form of external credit protection for us on a specific asset basis for some of our assets  these interests junior to ours absorb credit losses in specific pools of underlying real estate loans before our interest in that pool of loans will experience losses 
for our commercial real estate loans  we establish a credit reserve or mark the loan to estimated realizable value when a loan becomes delinquent 
many of the assets in the securities portfolio benefit from material forms of external credit enhancement  and  thus no credit reserves have been established to date for these assets 
unrealized losses on these securities are reported as a component of net unrealized and realized market value gains in our consolidated statements of income if the decline in value is considered to represent a permanent impairment 
see critical accounting policies  credit reserves above 
the establishment of a credit reserve for loans and our credit loss assumptions for securities to calculate long term yields under the effective yield method under gaap accounting does not reduce our taxable income or our dividend payment obligations as a reit 
for taxable income  many of our credit expenses will be recognized only as the underlying loans are charged off 
thus  the timing and recognition of credit losses for gaap and tax  and for our earnings and our dividends  may differ 
an increase in realized credit losses may not affect our gaap income due to our anticipation of such losses and our credit reserves 
they could  however  materially reduce our reit taxable income and  therefore  our dividend payment obligations 
conversely  our dividend payment obligations may remain high even during periods when future credit losses are expected but have not yet been realized 
liquidity risk our short term debt obligations were million at december  these debt obligations were secured by assets accumulated for future transfer to sequoia and acacia bankruptcy remote securitization trusts 
the assets securing this debt were high quality residential real estate loans and investment grade and bb rated real estate loan securities 

table of contents in periods of reduced liquidity in capital markets  or for other reasons  we may not be able to roll over our maturing short term debt obligations 
in addition  falling asset prices may trigger margin calls 
we believe that in most markets we could readily sell these assets to satisfy our debt obligations to meet margin calls or other liquidity needs related to this debt 
in an adverse market for these assets  however  any such sale of assets may fail to satisfy our debt obligations or liquidity requirements 
at this time  we see no material negative trends that we believe would affect our access to sufficient short term borrowings or the valuation of the assets we use to secure these borrowings 
we plan to continue to utilize short term borrowings to accumulate real estate loan assets prior to their permanent financing through long term debt issued from securitization trusts 
we own interests in securitization trusts such as sequoia and acacia that issue non recourse mortgage backed and asset backed security obligations 
payments of principal and interest by these trusts to the holders of securities issued by these trusts are not the legal obligation of redwood trust 
we could lose the entire investment we have made in these trusts  but we will not be required to provide any liquidity in the event of a default of one of these trusts on the trust s obligations 
furthermore  redwood has not pledged the interests it has retained in these trusts to secure short term borrowings 
as the seller of assets to these trusts prior to securitization  in some cases we have the obligation under representation and warranty provisions to repurchase assets from the trusts in limited circumstances such as fraud 
we have obtained  however  similar representations and warranties from the companies from whom we acquired the assets 
as a result  redwood s liquidity risk from representations and warranties should be minimal as long as our counterparties meet their obligations 
we believe our ownership of interests in these trusts is unlikely to be a source of potential liquidity risk for redwood 
the table below presents our contractual obligations and commitments as of december   as well as the consolidated obligations of the securitization trusts in which we own an interest 
the reported debt appears on our consolidated balance sheet 
the operating leases are commitments that are expensed based on the terms of the related contracts 
additional information on these obligations is presented in our notes to consolidated financial statements 
table contractual obligations and commitments as of december  dollars in thousands payments due or commitment expiration by period less than after total year years years short term debt long term debt  residential long term debt  commercial operating leases note all of our debt is collateralized by our assets and  although the stated maturity is as shown  the liabilities will pay down as the principal of the associated real estate loans or securities pay down 
at december   we had million of unrestricted cash and highly liquid unpledged assets available to meet potential liquidity needs 
thus  total available liquidity equaled of our short term debt balances 
at december   we had million of liquid assets  equaling of our short term debt balances 
the decrease in this ratio in was primarily the result of the timing of transfers of assets to securitization trusts 
in each of these periods we had additional borrowing capacity available on short notice if required to provide additional liquidity 
while we anticipate maintaining a strong liquidity position  our ratio of liquid assets to short term debt will fluctuate from quarter to quarter as we continue to fund our residential real estate loans and other securities with short term borrowings prior to securitization 
at this time  we see no indications or materially negative trends that we believe would be likely to cause us a liquidity shortage 
covenants associated with a portion of our short term debt generally relate to our tangible net worth  liquidity reserves  and leverage requirements 
we have not had  nor do we currently anticipate having  any problems in meeting these covenants 
however  many factors  including ones external to us  may affect our ability to meet these covenants and may affect our liquidity in the future 

table of contents interest rate risk our strategy is to maintain an asset liability posture on a consolidated basis including assets owned by and the mortgage and asset backed debt securities issued by securitization trusts that is effectively match funded so that the achievement of our long term goals is unlikely to be affected by changes in interest rates  yield curves  or loan prepayment rates 
in general  the interest rate characteristics of the mortgage and asset backed securities issued by consolidated securitization trusts  as adjusted for outstanding interest rate agreements  closely matches the interest rate characteristics of the assets owned by those trusts 
at december   on a consolidated basis  we reported billion of adjustable rate debt funding adjustable rate assets and billion of fixed hybrid debt funding a portion of our consolidated fixed hybrid assets 
the remainder of our assets mostly variable rate assets  but also some hybrid and fixed rate assets were funded with equity 
in the past  as a part of our asset liability strategy  we maintained a slight mismatch between the interest rate adjustment periods of our consolidated adjustable rate debt and our consolidated adjustable rate assets a portion of the six month adjustable assets were funded with one month adjustable debt 
we have been progressively reducing the amount of this mismatch 
sequoia has been issuing a greater amount of six month adjustable mortgage backed securities in order to better match its assets 
we have been increasing our hedging activities with the goal of reducing remaining mismatches on a consolidated basis to a non material amount 
this increase in hedging activities is likely to benefit us as compared to our prior level of hedging should short term interest rates rise 
if short term interest rates increase  the cost of our hedging activities will likely increase 
in a flat or falling short term interest rate environment  our newly increased hedging activities will likely increase our interest expense as compared to our prior practice 
unlike many financial institutions  we do not own  on a consolidated basis  fixed rate or hybrid assets funded with variable rate short term debt 
prepayment risk we seek to maintain an asset liability posture that mitigates the effects loan prepayment trends may have on our ability to achieve our long term objectives 
for the development of our business  there are both positive and negative aspects to both slower prepayment rate environments and to faster prepayment rate environments 
prepayments affect earnings in the near term primarily through amortization of purchase premium and discount 
amortization income from discount assets may not necessarily offset amortization expenses from premium assets  and vice versa 
variations in current and projected prepayment rates for individual assets and changes in short term interest rates as they affect projected coupons on adjustable rate mortgages  and thus change effective yield calculations may cause net premium amortization expense or net discount amortization income to vary substantially from quarter to quarter 
current prepayment trends slow prepayments on adjustable rate loans and fast prepayments on fixed rate and hybrid loans have been highly favorable for generating economic returns from our existing consolidated assets 
in general  higher long term interest rates leading to slower fixed rate loan prepayments and or a flatter or inverted yield curve short term interest rates rising relative to long term rates  leading to faster adjustable rate loan prepayments would be less favorable for current economic returns from our existing assets 
in the longer term  prepayments affect reinvestment risk and opportunity 
we spend considerable effort acquiring and creating new real estate loan assets for our securitization trusts  sequoia and acacia 
most of our ownership interests in securitizations are structured to be long term typically to year assets even if the underlying loan collateral prepays quickly 
nevertheless  if fast prepayment rates persist over long periods of time  we will have more capital returned to us sooner than would otherwise be the case 

table of contents we will then need to reinvest this capital  and the assets we acquire and create at that time may be more or less attractive than the assets that generated the principal repayments 
many of our assets are callable when a sufficient amount of the loans underlying a securitization have refinanced or paid down 
as a result of recent rapid prepayment speeds  an increasing number of our assets are callable or are likely to become callable in the next two years 
we own most of these assets at a discount  so if they are called we may realize a substantial amount of gain on sale for gaap and capital gain income for tax 
in order to maintain core income at current levels over time  however  we would need to reinvest the portion of the proceeds that we retain after dividends in assets with equivalent earning power 
market value risk at december   we reported on a consolidated basis billion of assets that were marked to market through our balance sheet but not through our income statement 
of these assets  had adjustable rate coupons  were hybrid loans  and the remaining had fixed rate coupons 
market value fluctuations of these assets can affect the value of our stockholders equity base 
at december   we reported on a consolidated basis real estate loans totaling million that we account for on a lower of cost or market basis for purposes of determining earnings 
all these assets had adjustable rate coupons 
market value fluctuations for our assets can affect not only our earnings and book value  but also our liquidity  especially to the extent these assets may be funded with short term borrowings prior to securitization 
most of our real estate assets are loans accounted for as held for investment and reported at cost 
as these loans are generally transferred to sequoia at securitization  changes in the market value of the loans do not have an impact on our liquidity 
recently  we have been increasing the amount of interest rate agreements we own 
please see our discussion above under interest rate risk and in our notes to our consolidated financial statements for a more detailed description of our interest rate agreements 
our interest rate agreements are reported at market value  with any periodic changes reported through either our income statement or in our balance sheet 
adverse changes in the market values of our interest rate agreements which would generally be caused by falling interest rates may require us to devote additional amounts of cash to margin calls 
inflation risk virtually all of our consolidated assets and liabilities are financial in nature 
as a result  interest rates  changes in interest rates  and other factors drive our performance far more than does inflation 
changes in interest rates do not necessarily correlate with inflation rates or changes in inflation rates 
our financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap and  as a reit  our dividends must equal at least of our net reit taxable income as calculated for tax purposes 
in each case  our activities and balance sheet are measured with reference to historical cost or fair market value without considering inflation 
quantitative information about market risk the table below incorporates information that may be useful in analyzing certain market value risks on our balance sheet 
one scenario regarding potential future principal prepayments and interest rates of our assets and liabilities is presented in this table 
there are many assumptions used to generate this information and there can be no assurance that assumed events will occur as anticipated 
future sales  principal repayments  acquisitions  calls  and restructuring could materially change our interest rate risk profile 

table of contents for our interest rate sensitive assets  the table presents principal cash flows and related average interest rates by year of maturity 
the forward curve future interest rates as implied by the yield structure of debt markets as of december  was used to project the average coupon rates for each year presented  based on the existing characteristics of our portfolio 
the timing of principal cash flows includes assumptions on the prepayment speeds of these assets based on their recent prepayment performance and future prepayment performance consistent with this interest rate scenario  actual prepayment speeds will likely vary significantly from these assumptions 
furthermore  this table does not include anticipated credit losses and assumes all of the principal we are entitled to receive will be received 
the actual amount and timing of credit losses will affect the principal payments and effective rates during all periods 
as discussed throughout this form k our future earnings are sensitive to a number of factors and changes in these factors may have a variety of secondary effects that  in turn  will also impact our earnings 
in addition  one of the key factors in projecting our income is the reinvestment rate on new assets and there is no reinvestment assumed in this table 
the information provided in this table is based on our existing portfolio at december  under one set of assumptions
