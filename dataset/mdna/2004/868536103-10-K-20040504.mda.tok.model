item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview supervalu is one of the largest grocery companies in the united states 
we operate within two complementary businesses in the grocery food industry  grocery retail and food distribution 
at february   we conducted our retail operations through a total of  stores  including licensed locations 
principal formats include extreme value stores  regional price superstores and regional supermarkets 
our food distribution operations network spans states and we serve as primary grocery supplier to approximately  stores  in addition to our own regional banner store network  as well as serving as secondary grocery supplier to approximately stores 
for the past several years  the approximate billion revenue grocery food industry has been consolidating 
as a result  market share has been concentrated in the larger grocery food companies 
we participated in that consolidation through selective acquisition activities and the exit of certain markets 
based on revenues today  we would be ranked as the largest extreme value food retailer  th largest grocery retailer  and largest public company food wholesaler in the united states 
in addition to consolidation activities  the grocery industry has experienced store saturation driven primarily by the continued increase in square footage devoted to food in supercenters  club stores  mass merchandisers  dollar stores  drug stores and other alternate formats as well as organic growth by traditional supermarket operators 
as a result  same store sales growth for the industry has been soft  pressuring profitability levels in the industry as operating costs continue to rise at a rate faster than sales growth 
we expect this industry environment to continue for the foreseeable future 
in fiscal  our businesses benefited from the bankruptcy of fleming companies  inc  formerly one of our largest food wholesale competitors 
by entering into an asset exchange with c s  we were able to affiliate certain former fleming distribution operations in the midwest in exchange for our new england operations 
even though overall revenues declined  approximately million on an annual basis  as a result of the asset exchange  the efficiencies of our remaining operations were greatly enhanced as volume was concentrated in our existing facilities 
it is expected that this transaction will provide incremental net earnings per share in fiscal of 
to 
per share 
the grocery industry is also affected by the general economic environment and its impact on consumer spending behavior 
in fiscal  we experienced moderate deflation in our product costs in a weak economic environment 
we would characterize fiscal as a year with a modestly improving economy and more normal levels of consumer spending and product cost inflation 
for fiscal  we expect a modest inflationary environment and further economic recovery 
in fiscal  most us businesses  including the labor intensive grocery industry were impacted by another year of rapidly rising health care and pension costs 
these rising costs impacted the overall profitability levels of the food industry and have become a pivotal issue in labor negotiations for unionized employees who bargain for health and retirement benefits in addition to wages 
approximately of supervalu s employees are unionized 
in the st 
louis market  where we operate regional supermarkets  we experienced a day strike in the third quarter of fiscal the st 
louis strike 
approximately of our unionized workforce are represented by contracts that are up for renewal in fiscal all of these industry factors impact our food distribution customer base 
as a result  we continue to experience revenue attrition in our food distribution operations in a historical range of approximately to 
all the above factors will continue to impact our industry and our company in fiscal we believe we can be successful against this industry backdrop with our regional retail formats that focus on local execution  merchandising  and consumer knowledge 
in addition  our operations benefit from our efficient and low cost supply chain and economies of scale as we leverage our retail and distribution operations 
save a lot  our extreme value format  has nationwide potential  and currently operates in states 
after our fiscal acquisition of deals  we tested in fiscal several new prototypes of an extreme value combination store  offering both food and dollar general merchandise 
we are pleased with the performance of the new prototypes and the majority of our new extreme value food stores will be a type of combination store in the future 
we plan to expand regional retail banner square footage through selective new store growth in key markets where we have significant market share 
in addition  we will supplement regional retail store growth with continued focus on remodel activities 
given the life cycle maturity of our distribution business with its inherent attrition rate  future growth in food distribution will be modest and primarily achieved through serving new independent customers  net growth from existing customers and further consolidation opportunities 
we will remain committed to streamlining our operations and improving our return on invested capital through a variety of initiatives

actual results could differ from those estimates 
significant accounting policies are discussed in the summary of significant accounting policies in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements 
management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect its more subjective or complex judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements 
lifo and retail inventory method for a significant portion of the company s inventory  cost is determined through use of the last in  first out lifo method 
the company utilized lifo to value approximately percent and percent of the company s consolidated inventories for fiscal and  respectively 
the retail inventory method rim is used to value retail inventory 
the valuation of inventories are at cost and the resulting gross margins are calculated by applying a calculated cost to retail ratio to the retail value of inventories 
rim is an averaging method that has been widely used in the retail industry due to its practicality 
inherent in the rim calculations are certain significant management judgments and estimates  including shrinkage  which significantly impact the ending inventory valuation at cost  as well as the resulting gross margins 
these judgments and estimates  coupled with the fact that the rim is an averaging process  can  under certain circumstances  produce results which differ from actual 
management believes that the company s rim provides an inventory valuation which reasonably approximates cost and results in carrying inventory at the lower of cost or market 
allowances for losses on receivables management makes estimates of the uncollectibility of its accounts and notes receivable portfolios 
in determining the adequacy of the allowances  management analyzes the value of the collateral  customer financial statements  historical collection experience  aging of receivables and other economic and industry factors 
although risk management practices and methodologies are utilized to determine the adequacy of the allowance  it is possible that the accuracy of the estimation process could be materially impacted by different judgments as to collectibility based on the information considered and further deterioration of accounts 
reserves for closed properties and asset impairment charges the company maintains reserves for estimated losses on retail stores  distribution warehouses and other properties that are no longer being utilized in current operations 
the company provides for closed property lease liabilities using a discount rate to calculate the present value of the remaining noncancellable lease payments after the closing date  net of estimated subtenant income 
the closed property lease liabilities usually are paid over the remaining lease terms  which generally range from one to years 
the company estimates subtenant income and future cash flows based on the company s experience and knowledge of the market in which the closed property is located  the company s previous efforts to dispose of similar assets and current economic conditions 
owned properties that are closed are reduced to their estimated net realizable value 
costs to reduce the carrying values of property  equipment and leasehold improvements are accounted for in accordance with our policy on impairment of long lived assets 
impairment charges on long lived assets are recognized when expected net future cash flows are less than the assets carrying value 
the company estimates net future cash flows based on its experience and knowledge of the market in which the closed property is located and  when necessary  utilizes local real estate brokers 
adjustments to closed property reserves primarily relate to changes in subtenant income or actual exit costs differing from original estimates 
adjustments are made for changes in estimates in the period in which the changes become known 
closed property reserves are reviewed quarterly to ensure that any accrued amount that is not a sufficient estimate of future costs  or that no longer is needed for its originally intended purpose  is adjusted to income in the proper period 
the expectations on timing of disposition or sublease and the estimated sales price or sublease income associated with closed properties are impacted by variable factors such as inflation  the general health of the economy  resultant demand for commercial property  the ability to secure subleases  the creditworthiness of sublessees and the company s success at negotiating early termination agreements with lessors 
while management believes the current estimates on closed properties are adequate  it is possible that continued weakness in the real estate market could cause changes in the company s assumptions and may require additional reserves and asset impairment charges to be recorded 
reserves for self insurance the company is primarily self insured for workers compensation and general and automobile liability costs 
it is the company s policy to record its self insurance liabilities based on claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported  discounted at a risk free interest rate 
any projection of losses concerning workers compensation and general and automobile liability is subject to a considerable degree of variability 
among the causes of this variability are unpredictable external factors affecting future inflation rates  discount rates  litigation trends  legal interpretations  benefit level changes and claim settlement patterns 
a basis point change in discount rates  based on changes in market rates would increase the company s liability by approximately million 
retirement plans the company sponsors non union pension and other post retirement plans in various forms covering substantially all employees who meet eligibility requirements 
the determination of the company s obligation and expense for non union pension and other post retirement benefits is dependent  in part  on management s selection of certain assumptions used by its actuaries in calculating these amounts 
these assumptions include  among other things  the discount rate  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and the rates of increase in compensation and health care costs 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  actual results that differ from the company s assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and  therefore  affect its recognized expense and recorded obligation in such future periods 
while the company believes that its assumptions are appropriate  significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions may materially impact pension and other post retirement obligations and future expenses 
the company lowered its expected return on plan assets used for fiscal pension expense by basis points to percent and by an additional basis points to percent for fiscal pension expense 
the company also lowered its discount rate by basis points to percent for fiscal pension expense 
for fiscal  when not considering other changes in assumptions  the impact to pension expense of each basis point reduction in the discount rate is to increase pension expense by approximately million and the impact of each basis point reduction in expected return on plan assets is to increase pension expense by approximately million 
the assumed health care cost trend rate used in measuring the accumulated post retirement benefit obligation was percent in fiscal the assumed health care cost trend rate will decrease by one percent each year for the next three years until it reaches the ultimate trend rate of percent 
the health care cost trend rate assumption has a significant impact on the amounts reported 
a one percent increase in the trend rate would increase the accumulated post retirement benefit obligation by million and the net periodic cost by million in fiscal in contrast  a one percent decrease in the trend rate would decrease the accumulated post retirement benefit obligation by million and the net periodic cost by million in fiscal the weighted average discount rates used in determining the benefit obligation were and for fiscal and  respectively 
the actuarial assumptions used by the company may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower withdrawal rates  and longer or shorter life spans of participants 
goodwill management assesses the valuation of goodwill for each of the company s reporting units on an annual basis through the comparison of the fair value of the respective reporting unit with its carrying value 
fair value is determined primarily based on valuation studies performed by the company  which utilize a discounted cash flow methodology 
valuation analysis requires significant judgments and estimates to be made by management 
the company s estimates could be materially impacted by factors such as competitive forces  customer behaviors  changes in growth trends and specific industry conditions 
liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities was million  million  and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the increase in cash from operating activities in fiscal from fiscal is primarily related to changes in assets and liabilities reflecting changes in working capital including timing differences for tax payments and increases in the minimum pension liability

on april   the company completed the sale of its minority ownership interest in winco foods  inc  a privately held regional grocery chain that operates stores in idaho  oregon  nevada  washington and california 
the company received after tax proceeds of approximately million on the sale of winco 
see subsequent events note on page f of the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements 
the impact of this transaction to fiscal is estimated to reduce net earnings by approximately per share  reflecting the elimination of winco s non cash equity earnings and increase net earnings by approximately per share for the one time after tax gain on the sale 
management expects that the company will continue to replenish operating assets with internally generated funds 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company s business will continue to generate cash flow at current levels 
the company will continue to obtain short term financing from its revolving credit agreement with various financial institutions  as well as through its accounts receivable securitization program 
long term financing will be maintained through existing and new debt issuances 
the company s short term and long term financing abilities are believed to be adequate as a supplement to internally generated cash flows to fund its capital expenditures and acquisitions as opportunities arise 
maturities of debt issued will depend on management s views with respect to the relative attractiveness of interest rates at the time of issuance and other debt maturities

the company may pay contingent cash interest for the six month period commencing november   and for any six month period thereafter if the average market price of the debentures for a five trading day measurement period preceding the applicable six month period equals or more of the sum of the issue price and accrued original issue discount for the debentures 
the debentures are classified as long term debt based on the company s ability and intent to refinance the obligation with long term debt if the company is required to repurchase the debentures

sfas no 
does not provide specific guidance as to whether a sponsor should recognize the effects of the prescription drug act in its financial statements 
the prescription drug act introduces two new features to medicare that must be considered when measuring accumulated postretirement benefit costs 
the new features include a subsidy to the plan sponsors that is based on of an individual beneficiary s annual prescription drug costs between and  and an opportunity for a retiree to obtain a prescription drug benefit under medicare 
the prescription drug act is not expected to reduce the company s net postretirement benefit costs 
the company has elected to defer adoption of sfas no 
due to the lack of specific guidance 
therefore  the net postretirement benefit costs disclosed in the company s financial statements do not reflect the impacts of the prescription drug act on the plans 
the deferral will continue to apply until specific authoritative accounting guidance for the federal subsidy is issued 
authoritative guidance on the accounting for the federal subsidy is pending and  when issued  could require information previously reported in the company s financial statements to change

the following is a summary of certain factors  the results of which could cause our future results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward looking statements contained in this report 
these factors are in addition to any other cautionary statements  written or oral  which may be made or referred to in connection with any such forward looking statement  however  they should not be construed as exhaustive 
economic conditions 
the food industry is sensitive to a number of economic conditions such as i food price deflation or inflation  ii softness in local and national economies  iii increases in commodity prices  iv the availability of favorable credit and trade terms  and v other economic conditions that may affect consumer buying habits 
any one or more of these economic conditions can affect our retail sales  the demand for products we distribute to our retailer customers  our operating costs and other aspects of our businesses 
competition 
the industries in which we compete are extremely competitive 
both our retail food and food distribution businesses are subject to competitive practices that may affect i the prices at which we are able to sell products at our retail locations  ii sales volume  iii the ability of our distribution customers to sell products we supply  which may affect future orders  and iv our ability to attract and retain customers 
in addition  the nature and extent of consolidation in the retail food and food distribution industries could affect our competitive position or that of our distribution customers in the markets we serve 
our retail food business faces competition from other retail chains  supercenters  non traditional competitors and emerging alterative formats in the markets where we have retail operations 
in our food distributions business  our success depends in part on the ability of our independent retailer customers to compete with these same formats  our ability to attract new customers  and our ability to supply products in a cost effective manner 
declines in the level of retail sales activity of our distribution customers due to competition  consolidations of retailers or competitors  increased self distribution by our customers  or the entry of new or non traditional distribution systems into the industry may adversely affect our revenues 
labor relations and employee benefit costs 
potential work disruptions from labor disputes may affect sales at our stores as well as our ability to distribute products 
we contribute to various multi employer healthcare and pension plans covering certain union represented employees in both our retail and distribution operations 
approximately one third of the employees in our total workforce are participants in multi employer plans 
the costs of providing benefits through such plans have escalated rapidly in recent years 
based upon information available to us  we believe certain of these multi employer plans are underfunded 
the decline in the value of assets supporting these plans  in addition to the high level of benefits generally provided  has led to the underfunding 
as a result  contributions to these plans will continue to increase and the benefit levels and related issues will continue to create collective bargaining challenges 
expansion and acquisitions 
while we intend to continue to expand our retail and distribution businesses through new store openings  new affiliations and acquisitions  expansion is subject to a number of risks  including the adequacy of our capital resources  the location of suitable store or distribution center sites and the negotiation of acceptable purchase or lease terms  and the ability to hire and train employees 
acquisitions may involve a number of special risks  including making acquisitions at acceptable rates of return  the diversion of management s attention to the assimilation of the operations and integration of personnel of the acquired business  costs and other risks associated with integrating or adapting operating systems  and potential adverse effects on our operating results 
liquidity 
we expect to continue to replenish operating assets with internally generated funds 
however  if our capital spending significantly exceeds anticipated capital needs  additional funding could be required from other sources including borrowing under our bank credit lines or through debt issuances 
in addition  acquisitions could affect our borrowing costs and future financial flexibility 
domestic security 
wartime activities  threats  and acts of terror directed at the food industry as well as related security costs can affect consumer behavior and spending as well as customer orders
