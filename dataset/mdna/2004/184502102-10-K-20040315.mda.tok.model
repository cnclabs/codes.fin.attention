item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition overview management s discussion and analysis of our results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related footnotes 
our discussion is presented on both a consolidated and segment basis 
corporate expenses  interest expense  gain loss on sale of marketable securities  equity in earnings of nonconsolidated affiliates  other income expense net  and income tax expense are managed on a total company basis and are  therefore  reflected only in our discussion of consolidated results 
we manage our operating segments primarily on their operating income 
therefore  our discussion of the results of operations of our operating segments focuses on their operating income 
our reportable operating segments are radio broadcasting  which includes our national syndication business  outdoor advertising and live entertainment 
included in the other segment are television broadcasting  sports representation and our media representation business  katz media 
radio broadcasting our local radio markets control the formats they select for their programming 
the formats are designed to reach audiences with targeted demographic characteristics that appeal to our advertisers 
our advertising rates are principally based on how many people in a targeted audience are listening to our stations  as measured by an independent ratings service 
the size of the market influences rates as well  with larger markets typically receiving higher rates than smaller markets 
also  our advertising rates are influenced by the time of day the advertisement airs  with morning and evening drive time hours typically the highest 
we sell a certain number of radio advertising spots per hour to our advertisers 
radio advertising contracts are typically less than one year 
due to the geographic diversity and autonomy of our markets  we have a multitude of different advertising rates and audience demographics that are market specific 
therefore  our discussion of the results of operations of our radio broadcasting segment focuses on the macro level indicators that management monitors to assess our radio segment s financial condition and results of operations 
management looks at our radio operations overall revenues as one of its main performance metric 
management also looks at its local advertising  which is sold predominately in a station s local market  and national advertising  which is sold across multiple markets 
local advertising is sold by our local radio stations sales staff while national advertising is sold  for the most part  through a national representation firm 
local and national advertising revenues are tracked separately because these revenue streams have different sales forces  respond differently to changes in the economic environment and because local advertising is the primary driver of our radio revenues 
throughout  growth in our national advertising revenue outpaced the growth in our local advertising revenue 
national advertising revenue growth was driven by categories such as entertainment  finance  telecom utility  retail and auto 
management also looks at radio revenue by market size  as defined by arbitron 
typically  larger markets can reach bigger audiences with wider demographics than smaller markets 
more than half of our radio revenue and divisional operating expenses comes from our largest markets 
management also reviews our overall industry share of radio revenue 
we believe our share of industry revenue is a key metric to gauge how well our combined markets are succeeding at attracting advertisers 
our share of industry revenue was essentially the same in as it was in additionally  management reviews our share of listeners in target demographics listening to the radio in an average quarter hour 
this metric gauges how well our formats are doing attracting and keeping listeners 
our overall share of listeners years and older and age to was up slightly in over the prior year 
a significant portion of our radio segment s expenses vary in connection with changes in revenue 
these variable expenses primarily relate to costs in our sales department  such as salaries  commissions  and bad debt 
our costs that do not vary as much in relation to revenue are mostly in our programming and general and administrative departments  such as talent costs  rights fees  utilities and office salaries 
lastly  our costs that are highly discretionary are costs in our marketing and promotions department  which we primarily incur to maintain and or increase our audience and market share 

table of contents outdoor advertising our outdoor advertising revenues are generated from selling advertisements on our display faces  which consist of bulletins  posters and transit displays as well as street furniture panels 
our advertising rates are based on a particular display s impressions in relation to the demographics of a particular market and its location within a market 
our outdoor advertising contracts are typically based on the number of months the advertisement is displayed on our inventory 
to monitor the health of our outdoor business  management reviews average rates  average occupancy and inventory levels of each of our display faces by market 
in addition  because a significant portion of our outdoor advertising is conducted in foreign markets  principally europe  management looks at revenues from our foreign operations on a constant dollar basis 
a constant dollar basis allows for comparison of operations independent of foreign exchange movements 
our outdoor advertising revenue and divisional operating expenses increased in as compared to approximately million and million  respectively  as a result of increases in foreign exchange 
our significant outdoor expenses include production expenses  revenue sharing or minimum guarantees on our transit and street furniture contracts and site lease expenses  primarily for land surrounding our advertising displays 
our site lease terms vary from monthly to yearly  can be for terms of years or longer  and typically provide for renewal options 
our street furniture contracts are usually won in a competitive bid and generally last between and years 
live entertainment we derive live entertainment revenues primarily from promoting or producing music and theater events 
revenues from these events are mainly from ticket sales  rental income  corporate sponsorships  concessions and merchandise 
we typically receive  for each event we host  all the ticket sales  or just a fixed fee 
we also receive fees representing a percentage of total concession sales from vendors and total merchandise sales from the performer or tour producer 
we generally receive higher music profits when an event is at a venue we own rather than a rented venue 
the higher music profits are due to our ability to share in a percentage of the revenues received from concession and merchandise sales as well as the opportunity to sell sponsorships for venue naming rights and signage 
to judge the health of our music business  management monitors the number of shows  average paid attendance  talent cost as a percent of revenue  sponsorship dollars and ticket revenues 
in addition  because a significant portion of our live entertainment business is conducted in foreign markets  management looks at revenues from our foreign operations on a constant dollar basis 
a constant dollar basis allows for comparison of operations independent of foreign exchange movements 
our live entertainment revenue and divisional operating expenses increased approximately million and million in  respectively  as a result of foreign exchange 
the primary expense driver for live entertainment is talent cost 
talent cost is the amount we pay to a musical artist or theatrical production to perform at an event 
this is a negotiated amount primarily driven by what the artist or production requires to cover their direct costs and value of their time 
these fees are typically agreed to at a set minimum amount with a potential additional sharing if the event exceeds set revenue targets

discontinued sports broadcasting rights such as the la dodgers  cessation of business with independent promoters and a revenue decline in our nationally syndicated radio business due to the elimination of certain shows also contributed to the decline 
however  we were able to generate a revenue increase from our top markets  primarily behind the relative strength of national advertising compared to local advertising 
some of our strongest top markets during were new york  los angeles  cleveland  sacramento and austin 
leading national advertising categories in were entertainment  finance  telecom utility  retail and auto 
in total  radio s divisional operating expenses were flat year over year 
we saw declines in variable sales related expenses primarily from commissions and bonuses  declines in expenses related to sports broadcasting rights that we did not renew in  and a decline in bad debt expense

also included in the increase is ackerley  acquired in june  which contributed million in revenue during the first six months of we saw revenue increases across our entire inventory  but our bulletin inventory  which comprises about of our domestic outdoor revenue  fueled the growth 
our domestic bulletin inventory performed well year over year across the vast majority of our markets  with both rates and occupancy up 
we saw strong growth in both large markets such as new york  san francisco  miami and tampa and in smaller markets such as albuquerque and chattanooga 
top domestic advertising categories for us during were business and consumer services  entertainment and automotive 
international revenue growth was spurred by our transit and street furniture inventory 
this growth was driven by an increase in displays and average revenue per display primarily from our street furniture products 
strong markets for our street furniture inventory were australia  norway and the united kingdom 
this revenue increase was slightly offset by a decline in our international billboard revenues 
divisional operating expenses increased million in compared to included in this increase is roughly million in foreign exchange increases 
also  ackerley contributed approximately million in divisional operating expenses during the first six months of roughly million of the overall increase is from restructuring our international outdoor operations in france during the second quarter of the remainder of the increase is partially attributable to direct production costs  site lease expenses  and bonus and commission expenses associated with the increase in revenue

another contributing factor to the 
table of contents revenue growth was various acquisitions  the most significant of which was ackerley in june our ackerley acquisition accounted for roughly million of the revenue increase 
we also saw growth in television advertising  which was partially attributable to political advertisements that coincided with the state and federal elections 
further  the strengthening of our international functional currencies against the us dollar contributed approximately million to the revenue increase 
the revenue increase was partially offset by a million decline within our entertainment segment primarily from a decline in ticket sales

non cash compensation non cash compensation expense relates largely to unvested stock options assumed in mergers that are now convertible into clear channel stock 
to the extent that these employees options continue to vest  we recognize non cash compensation expense over the remaining vesting period 
vesting dates vary through april if no employees forfeit their unvested options by leaving the company  we expect to recognize non cash compensation expense of approximately million during the remaining vesting period 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense decreased billion for the year ended december  as compared to upon our adoption of statement of financial accounting standard no 
on january   we no longer amortize goodwill and fcc licenses

also  we recognized impairment charges in related to analog television equipment 
finally  during the second quarter of  a talent contract became fully amortized  which had contributed million in amortization expense in these decreases were partially offset by additional depreciation expense related to assets acquired in the ackerley acquisition in june corporate expenses corporate expense decreased million for the year ended december  as compared to primarily due to a decrease in corporate head count and facilities and other cost cutting measures 
we closed the amfm corporate offices in dallas on march  and a portion of the sfx offices in new york were closed on june  the decrease was partially offset by an increase in performance based bonus expense as well as higher corporate legal expenses 

table of contents interest expense interest expense was million and million for the year ended december  and  respectively  a decrease of million 
this decrease was due to a decrease in our total debt outstanding as well as an overall decrease in libor rates

 we reclassified million shares of amt from an available for sale classification to a trading classification 
as a result of the reclassification  a million pre tax unrealized holding gain was recorded

equity in earnings of nonconsolidated affiliates equity in earnings of nonconsolidated affiliates for the year ended december  was million as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase is primarily attributable to an increase in our share of net income

cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle the loss recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle during relates to our adoption of statement on january  statement required that we test goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles for impairment using a fair value approach 
as a result of the goodwill test  we recorded a non cash  net of tax  impairment charge of approximately billion 
also  as a result of the indefinite lived intangible test  we recorded a non cash  net of tax  impairment charge on our fcc licenses of approximately billion 
as required by statement  a subsequent impairment test was performed at october   which resulted in no additional impairment charge 
the non cash impairments of our goodwill and fcc licenses were generally caused by unfavorable economic conditions  which persisted in the industries we served throughout this weakness contributed to our customers reducing the number of advertising dollars spent on our media inventory and live entertainment events 
these conditions adversely impacted the cash flow projections used to determine the fair value of our licenses and each reporting unit at january  these factors resulted in the non cash impairment charge of a portion of our licenses and goodwill

reach is measured in individual markets by audience surveys 
while ratings across all of our markets are the ultimate determinate of the health of our radio business  we generate approximately half of our radio revenues from our top markets 
therefore  we took a snapshot of our ratings from these markets based on the percentage of people in the market over twelve years old who listened to our stations in an average quarter hour for the six months ending in the fall of based on this demographic  our ratings improved in twelve of the twenty markets  were down in six of the twenty markets and were flat in the other markets as compared to the summer of divisional operating expenses increased million in as compared to the increase is attributable to acquisitions as well as the addition of new programs and an increase in talent fees in our national syndication business

at december   our leverage and interest coverage ratios were x and x  respectively 
including our cash and cash equivalents recorded at december   our leverage on a net debt basis was x 
our bank credit facilities have cross default provisions among the bank facilities only

our international subsidiary s million international credit facility includes a put option to the company in the event that our long term debt ratings fall below bb ba we believe there are no other agreements that contain provisions that trigger an event of default upon a change in long term debt ratings that would have a material impact to our financial statements

table of contents commitments  contingencies and future obligations in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states  we do not record the following transactions or obligations on our balance sheet commitments and contingencies we were among the defendants in a lawsuit filed on june  in the united states district court for the southern district of florida by spanish broadcasting system 
the plaintiffs alleged that we were in violation of section one and section two of the sherman antitrust act as well as various other claims  such as unfair trade practices and defamation  among other counts 
this case was dismissed with prejudice on january  the plaintiffs filed an appeal with the th circuit court of appeals and oral argument was held in the case in february a decision has not yet been issued 
there are various other lawsuits and claims pending against us 
we believe that any ultimate liability resulting from those actions or claims will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial position or liquidity 
although we have recorded accruals based on our current assumptions of the future liability for these lawsuits  it is possible that future results of operations could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies related to these proceedings 
see also item legal proceedings and note g commitments and contingencies in the notes to consolidate financial statements in item included elsewhere in this report 
certain agreements relating to acquisitions provide for purchase price adjustments and other future contingent payments based on the financial performance of the acquired companies generally over a one to five year period 
we will continue to accrue additional amounts related to such contingent payments if and when it is determinable that the applicable financial performance targets will be met 
the aggregate of these contingent payments  if performance targets are met  would not significantly impact our financial position or results of operations 
future obligations in addition to our scheduled maturities on our debt  we have future cash obligations under various types of contracts 
we lease office space  certain broadcast facilities  equipment and the majority of the land occupied by our outdoor advertising structures under long term operating leases 
some of our lease agreements contain renewal options and annual rental escalation clauses generally tied to the consumer price index  as well as provisions for our payment of utilities and maintenance 
we have minimum franchise payments associated with non cancelable contracts that enable us to display advertising on such media as buses  taxis  trains  bus shelters and terminals 
the majority of these contracts contain rent provisions that are calculated as the greater of a percentage of the relevant advertising revenue or a specified guaranteed minimum annual payment 
also  we have non cancelable contracts in our entertainment operations related to minimum performance payments with artists as well as various other contracts in our radio broadcasting operations related to program rights and music license fees 
in the normal course of business  our broadcasting operations have minimum future payments associated with employee and talent contracts 
these contracts typically contain cancellation provisions that allows us to cancel the contract with good cause 

table of contents the scheduled maturities of our credit facilities  other long term debt outstanding  future minimum rental commitments under non cancelable lease agreements  minimum payments under other non cancelable contracts  payments under employment talent contracts  and capital expenditure commitments as of december  are as follows non other cancelable non employment credit long term operating cancelable talent capital in thousands facilities debt leases contracts contracts expenditures total thereafter total market risk interest rate risk at december   approximately of our long term debt  including fixed rate debt on which we have entered into interest rate swap agreements  bears interest at variable rates 
accordingly  our earnings are affected by changes in interest rates 
assuming the current level of borrowings at variable rates and assuming a two percentage point change in the year s average interest rate under these borrowings  it is estimated that our interest expense would have changed by million and that our net income would have changed by million 
in the event of an adverse change in interest rates  management may take actions to further mitigate its exposure 
however  due to the uncertainty of the actions that would be taken and their possible effects  this interest rate analysis assumes no such actions 
further  the analysis does not consider the effects of the change in the level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment 
at december   we had entered into interest rate swap agreements with a billion aggregate notional amount that effectively float interest at rates based upon libor 
these agreements expire from february to march the fair value of these agreements at december  was an asset of million 
equity price risk the carrying value of our available for sale and trading equity securities is affected by changes in their quoted market prices 
it is estimated that a change in the market prices of these securities would change their carrying value at december  by million and would change accumulated comprehensive income loss and net income loss by million and million  respectively 
at december   we also held million of investments that do not have a quoted market price  but are subject to fluctuations in their value 
subsequent to december   we sold million of our available for sale equity securities foreign currency we have operations in countries throughout the world 
foreign operations are measured in their local currencies except in hyper inflationary countries in which we operate 
as a result  our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets in which we have operations 
to mitigate a portion of the exposure to risk of international currency fluctuations  we maintain a natural hedge through borrowings in currencies other than the us dollar 
this hedge position is reviewed monthly 
we currently maintain no derivative instruments to mitigate the exposure to translation and or transaction risk 
however  this does not preclude the adoption of specific hedging strategies in the future 
our foreign operations reported a net income of 
million for the year ended december  it is estimated that a change in the value of the us dollar to foreign currencies would change net income for the year ended december  by 
million 

table of contents our earnings are also affected by fluctuations in the value of the us dollar as compared to foreign currencies as a result of our investments in various countries  all of which are accounted for under the equity method 
it is estimated that the result of a fluctuation in the value of the dollar relative to these foreign currencies at december  would change our equity in earnings of nonconsolidated affiliates by million and would change our net income for the year ended december  by approximately million 
this analysis does not consider the implications that such fluctuations could have on the overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment in the us or the foreign countries or on the results of operations of these foreign entities

critical accounting policies the preparation of the company s financial statements in conformity generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of a financial statements and the reported amount of expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates that are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the result of these evaluations forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amount of expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions 
the following accounting policies require significant management judgments and estimates 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations  we record a specific reserve to reduce the amounts recorded to what we believe will be collected 
for all other customers  we recognize reserves for bad debt based on historical experience of bad debts as a percent of revenues for each business unit  adjusted for relative improvements or deteriorations in the agings and changes in current economic conditions 
revenue recognition radio broadcasting revenue is recognized as advertisements or programs are broadcast and is generally billed monthly 
outdoor advertising provides services under the terms of contracts covering periods up to three years  which are generally billed monthly 
revenue for outdoor advertising space rental is recognized ratably over the term of the contract 
advertising revenue is reported net of agency commissions 
agency commissions are calculated based on a stated percentage applied to gross billing revenue for our broadcasting and outdoor operations 
clients remit the gross billing amount to the agency and the agency remits gross billings less their commission to the company 
payments received in advance of being earned are recorded as deferred income 
entertainment revenue from the presentation and production of an event is recognized on the date of the performance 
revenue collected in advance of the event is recorded as deferred income until the event occurs 
entertainment revenue collected from advertising and other revenue  which is not related to any single event  is classified as deferred revenue and generally amortized over the operating season or the term of the contract 
purchase accounting we account for our business acquisitions under the purchase method of accounting 
the total cost of acquisitions is allocated to the underlying identifiable net assets  based on their respective estimated fair values 
the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill 
determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management s judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions  including assumptions with respect to future cash inflows and outflows  discount rates  asset lives and market multiples  among other items 
in addition  reserves have been established on our balance sheet related to acquired liabilities and qualifying restructuring costs based on assumptions made at the time of acquisition 
we evaluate these reserves on a regular basis to determine the adequacies of the amounts 
long lived assets we record impairment losses when events and circumstances indicate that depreciable and amortizable long lived assets might be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying amount of those assets 
when specific assets are determined to be unrecoverable  the cost basis of the asset is reduced to reflect their current fair market value 
we use various assumptions in determining the current fair market value of these assets  including future expected cash flows and discount rates  as well as future salvage values 
in the first quarter of  we adopted statement  goodwill and other intangible assets 
in accordance with statement  we tested our fcc licenses for impairment as of january  by comparing their fair value to their carrying value at that date 
we recorded an impairment charge of our fcc licenses of approximately billion  net of deferred tax of billion 
we used an income approach to value the fcc licenses 
we also recorded an impairment charge of our goodwill of approximately billion  net of deferred taxes of million 
similar to our test for impairment of fcc licenses  we used the income approach to determine the fair value of our reporting units 
the fair value of our reporting units was used to apply value to the net assets of each reporting unit 
to the extent that the net assets exceeded the fair value  an impairment charge was recorded 
the income approach used for valuing goodwill and fcc licenses involved estimating future cash flows expected to be generated from the related assets  discounted to their present value using a risk adjusted discount rate 
terminal values were also estimated and discounted to their present value 
the fair values calculated were significantly impacted by the assumptions made  which impacted our impairment charge 
in accordance with statement  we performed our annual impairment tests as of october  and on fcc licenses and 
table of contents goodwill 
no impairment charges resulted from these tests 
we may incur additional impairment charges in future periods under statement to the extent we do not achieve our expected cash flow growth rates  and to the extent that market values and long term interest rates in general decrease and increase  respectively 
accounting for investments at december   we had million recorded as other investments 
other investments are composed primarily of equity securities 
these securities are classified as available for sale or trading and are carried at fair value based on quoted market prices 
securities are carried at historical value when quoted market prices are unavailable 
the net unrealized gains or losses on available for sale securities  net of tax  are reported as a separate component of shareholders equity 
the net unrealized gains or losses on trading securities are reported in the statement of operations 
in addition  we hold investments that do not have quoted market prices 
we review the value of these investments and record an impairment charge in the statement of operations for any decline in value that is determined to be other than temporary 
for the years ended december  and  we recorded impairment charges of million and million  respectively  related to other than temporary declines in value of various media companies 
in addition  at december   we had million recorded as investments accounted for under the equity method 
we review the value of these investments and record an impairment charge in the statement of operations for any decline in value that is determined to be other than temporary 
tax accruals the internal revenue service and other taxing authorities routinely examine our tax returns 
from time to time  the irs challenges certain of our tax positions 
we believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and we would vigorously defend these positions if challenged 
the final disposition of any positions challenged by the irs could require us to make additional tax payments 
we believe that we have adequately accrued for any foreseeable payments resulting from tax examinations and consequently do not anticipate any material impact upon their ultimate resolution 
to the extent there are changes in the expected outcome of tax examinations  our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period could be impacted 
litigation accruals we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings and  as required  have accrued our estimate of the probable costs for the resolution of these claims 
these estimates have been developed in consultation with counsel and are based upon an analysis of potential results  assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
it is possible  however  that future results of operations for any particular period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies related to these proceedings 
insurance accruals we currently are self insured beyond certain retention amounts for various insurance coverages  including general liability and property and casualty 
accruals are recorded based on estimates of actual claims filed  historical payouts  existing insurance coverage and projections of future development of costs related to existing claims 
inflation inflation has affected our performance in terms of higher costs for wages  salaries and equipment 
although the exact impact of inflation is indeterminable  we believe we have offset these higher costs by increasing the effective advertising rates of most of our broadcasting stations and outdoor display faces 
ratio of earnings to fixed charges the ratio of earnings to fixed charges is as follows year ended december  for the year ended december   fixed charges exceeded earnings before income taxes and fixed charges by billion 

table of contents the ratio of earnings to fixed charges was computed on a total enterprise basis 
earnings represent income from continuing operations before income taxes less equity in undistributed net income loss of unconsolidated affiliates plus fixed charges 
fixed charges represent interest  amortization of debt discount and expense  and the estimated interest portion of rental charges 
we had no preferred stock outstanding for any period presented
