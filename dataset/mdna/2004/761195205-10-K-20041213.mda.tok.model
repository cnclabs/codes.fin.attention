item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview general 
while our fiscal  and results reflect the continued dominant position of our energy operations  the initiatives we began in fiscal and continued in fiscal in our structured finance  equipment leasing and real estate businesses resulted in material revenue growth for those operations 
in  we also began the process of reorganizing our company into two independent companies with our company continuing its business of asset management in structured finance  equipment leasing and real estate and atlas america separately continuing the energy business 
as part of that process o atlas america completed a public offering of its common stock in may the offering of atlas america s common stock resulted in net proceeds of million which was distributed to us in a tax free distribution and substantially enhanced our liquidity  and o our interest in atlas america was reduced to  with the public interest in atlas america now being reflected as a minority interest in our financial statements 
we anticipate that we will complete the spin off of atlas america in fiscal since the spin off is subject to the completion of several conditions  principally receipt of a ruling from the internal revenue service as to the tax free nature of the proposed spin off  it may not occur 
if the spin off does occur  we will no longer consolidate atlas america s financial statements with ours and  as a result  our assets  revenues and stockholders equity will be substantially reduced 
our financial condition and results of operations during fiscal were affected by and  until we spin off atlas america  will continue to be affected by initiatives taken by atlas pipeline partners  lp in april  atlas pipeline completed a public offering of  of its common units  realizing million of offering proceeds  net of expenses 
the principal financial effect of the offering was an increase to the minority interest in our financial statements 
on july   atlas pipeline acquired spectrum field services  inc at a cost of million  including transaction costs and anticipated taxes 
the acquisition was funded partially by debt financing and partially by the proceeds of the april offering together with a further offering completed on july  the latter offering of  common units raised million 
the spectrum acquisition increased atlas pipeline s assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and  because we consolidate with atlas pipeline  increased ours as well 
our financial condition in fiscal was further strengthened by our repurchase of the remaining million of our senior notes 
as a result of the premium we offered to effect the repurchase  we recorded a loss on the transaction of million which is included in other income  net in our consolidated statements of operations 
also as a result of the repurchase  we reduced our interest expense by million in fiscal in addition to the senior notes  we repaid or paid down various real estate and corporate credit facilities by million  further reducing our interest expense 
during fiscal  we continued our program of building the businesses that we will retain following the planned spin off 
in structured finance  we increased the amount of assets we managed for issuers of cdos by billion through our sponsorship of three additional trapeza cdo issuers 
as a result  our structured finance revenues increased by million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and  in fiscal we have formed a wholly owned subsidiary  ischus capital management llc  to develop and sponsor cdo issuers holding asset backed securities 
we anticipate that this will positively impact the amount of assets we manage and our revenues in succeeding periods 
our equipment leasing revenues grew to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  in fiscal  we originated million in leases as compared to million in leases in fiscal  and our leases under management increased to million at september  from million at september  we further increased sales and marketing efforts which has lead to new program agreements with equipment vendors  such as scansource inc  asap software  x ray marketing associates  inc  and cardiometrics inc  and our million acquisition of a portfolio of leases from premier lease services lc we expect to continue to grow our equipment leasing business by securing additional equipment vendor programs  such as our recent funding agreement with gateway inc  and the acquisition of equipment leasing companies similar to premier 
our business growth is facilitated by our ability to sell lease originations to our own public equipment leasing funds as well as to a subsidiary of merrill lynch 
in real estate  we increased the amount of assets we managed on behalf of the investment limited partnerships we sponsored to million at september  from million at september  as part of our strategic plan  we are continuing to resolve our real estate loan portfolio through sales and loan resolutions 
in fiscal  we resolved loans with a book value of million  realizing million in net proceeds 
as a result  the loans and real estate assets in our loan portfolio decreased from million principally outstanding loan receivables at september  to million principally outstanding loan receivables at september  our consolidated financial statements for fiscal and reflect the effect of financial accounting standards board s  or fasb  interpretation  or fin   consolidation of variable interest entities  as amended which we refer to as fin as required by fin  we consolidated into our financial statements for fiscal and fiscal certain entities in our real estate loan business that hold loans acquired at a discount between and the adoption of fin resulted in a non cash cumulative effect adjustment of million  net of taxes  in the fourth quarter of fiscal at september   we reported assets and liabilities of million and million  respectively  related to these fin entities  while at september  we reported assets and liabilities of million and million  respectively 
in line with our strategic focus of resolving our real estate loan portfolio  we reported an additional million of our fin assets as being held for sale along with million of associated liabilities at september  at september   our fin assets being held for sale were million and the associated liabilities were million 
for a more detailed discussion of fin  you should read cumulative effects of changes in accounting principles  and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the following tables reflect changes to our revenues and assets for the periods indicated revenues as a percent of total revenues years ended september  energy real estate equipment leasing equity in earnings of structured finance entities assets as a percent of total assets at september  energy real estate equipment leasing structured finance all other other assets are related to operations which do not meet the definition of a business segment 
for financial information about our operating segments  see note  operating segment information and major customer information  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the following is a detailed analysis and discussion of the results of our energy  real estate  structured finance and equipment leasing operations and our other revenues  and our costs and expenses 
results of operations energy the following tables set forth information relating to revenues recognized and costs and expenses incurred  daily production volumes  average sales prices  production costs as a percentage of natural gas and oil sales  and production costs per mcfe for our energy operations during fiscal  and years ended september  in thousands revenues production    well drilling    well services    gathering  transmission and processing    other costs and expenses production    exploration    well drilling    well services    gathering  transmission and processing    terminated acquisition  non direct    years ended september  dollars in thousand revenues gas    oil    production volumes gas mcf day    oil bbls day average sales prices gas per mmcf oil per bbl production costs as a percent of sales per mcfe depletion per equivalent mcfe excludes sales of residual gas and sales to landowners 
our average sales price before the effects of financial hedging was  and for fiscal  and  respectively 
production costs include labor to operate the wells and related equipment  repairs and maintenance  materials and supplies  property taxes  severance taxes  insurance  gathering charges and production overhead 
our energy revenues were million in fiscal  as compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal the growth in energy revenues was driven by increases in revenues from atlas america s well drilling operations as it substantially increased the amount of funds it raised from its drilling investment partnerships to million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal accordingly  well drilling revenues increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and million in fiscal as a result of atlas america s increased drilling activity and increased prices for its natural gas and oil  our production revenues increased to million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal in addition  as a result of atlas pipeline s acquisition of spectrum in july  gathering  transmission and processing revenues increased by million 
our well drilling revenues and expenses represent the billings and costs associated with the completion of  and net wells for drilling investment partnerships sponsored by atlas america in fiscal  and  respectively 
the following table sets forth information relating to these revenues and costs and expenses during the years indicated years ended september dollars in thousands average drilling revenue per well average drilling cost per well average drilling gross profit per well gross profit margin    gross margin percent net wells drilled year ended september  compared to year ended september  our natural gas revenues were million in fiscal  an increase of million from million in fiscal the increase was due to a increase in the average sales price of natural gas and a increase in production volumes 
the million increase in natural gas revenues consisted of million attributable to price increases and million attributable to volume increases 
our oil revenues were million in fiscal  an increase of million from million in fiscal the increase resulted from a increase in the average sales price of oil and a increase in production volumes 
the million increase in oil revenues consisted of  attributable to price increases and  attributable to volume increases 
our well drilling gross margin was million in fiscal  an increase of million from million in fiscal during the year ended september   the increase in gross margin was attributable to an increase in the number of wells drilled million and an increase in the gross profit per well 
since our drilling contracts are on a cost plus basis typically cost plus  an increase in our average cost per well also results in an increase in our average revenue per well 
the increase in our average cost per well resulted from the increase in the cost of tangible equipment used on the wells 
in addition  it should be noted that the line item liabilities associated with drilling contracts in our consolidated financial statements includes million of funds raised in our drilling investment partnerships in fiscal that had not been applied to drill wells as of september  due to the timing of drilling operations  and thus had not been recognized as well drilling revenues 
we expect to recognize this amount as income in fiscal we have completed our fundraising efforts for calendar year with a total of million raised after our fiscal year end and  therefore  we anticipate drilling revenues and related costs to be substantially higher in fiscal than in fiscal our well services revenues were million in fiscal  an increase of  from million in fiscal the increase resulted from an increase in the number of wells operated due to additional wells drilled in fiscal our gathering  transmission and processing revenues were million  of which million is associated with the operations of spectrum which was acquired on july  these revenues reflect two and one half months of operations in the current year period and  as a result  we expect they will increase in fiscal our production costs were million in fiscal  an increase of  from million in fiscal this increase includes normal operating expenses and coincides with the increased production volumes we realized from the increased number of wells we operate 
production costs as a percent of sales decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal as a result of increases in our average sales prices which more than offset the slight increase in production costs per mcfe 
our exploration costs were million in fiscal  a decrease of  from fiscal we attribute the decrease in fiscal as compared to the prior year period principally to the following o the benefit we received for our contribution of well sites to our drilling investment partnerships increased  in fiscal as compared to fiscal as a result of more wells drilled  which was offset in part by o  in dry hole costs we incurred upon making the determination that a well drilled in an exploratory area of our operations was not capable of economic production 
our well services expenses were million in fiscal  an increase of  from million in fiscal the increase resulted from an increase in costs associated with a greater number of wells operated in fiscal as compared to fiscal our gathering  transmission and processing expenses were million  of which million were associated with the operations of spectrum 
these costs reflect two and one half months of operations in the current year period and  as a result  we expect they will increase in fiscal our terminated acquisition costs are related to atlas pipeline s acquisition of alaska pipeline company  which was purportedly terminated in july these costs consist primarily of legal and professional fees 
in september  atlas pipeline entered into an agreement with semco energy  inc to purchase all of the stock of alaska pipeline company 
in order to complete the acquisition  atlas pipeline needed the approval of the regulatory commission of alaska 
the regulatory commission initially approved the transaction  but on june  it vacated its order of approval based upon a motion for clarification or reconsideration filed by semco 
on july   semco sent atlas pipeline a notice purporting to terminate the transaction 
atlas pipeline believes semco caused the delay in closing the transaction and breached its obligations under the acquisition agreement 
atlas pipeline is currently pursuing its remedies under the acquisition agreement 
in connection with the acquisition  subsequent termination and current legal action  atlas pipeline incurred million of costs  which are shown as terminated acquisition costs in the results of operations energy table 
our non direct expenses were million in fiscal  a decrease of  from million in fiscal these expenses include  among other things  salaries and benefits not allocated to a specific energy activity  costs of running our energy corporate office  partnership syndication activities and outside services 
these expenses are partially offset by reimbursements we receive from our drilling investment partnerships 
the decrease in the year ended september  as compared to the prior year period is attributable principally to the following o non direct expense reimbursements from our investment partnerships increased by million as we continued to increase the number of wells we drill and manage  o salaries and wages increased million due to an increase in executive salaries and in the number of our employees in anticipation of atlas america s spin off from us  o net syndication costs increased  as we continue to increase our syndication activities and the drilling funds we raise in our public and private partnerships  o legal and professional fees increased  which includes the implementation of sarbanes oxley section compliance and the filing of two tax returns for for atlas pipeline 
two tax returns were required as a result of our ownership percentage in it falling below due to its offering of common units in may  o non direct expenses increased to  due to the acquisition of spectrum on july   and o directors fees increased  due to the atlas america initial public offering and its anticipated spin off from us 
depletion of oil and gas properties as a percentage of oil and gas revenues was in both fiscal and fiscal depletion was per mcfe in fiscal  an increase of 
per mcfe from per mcfe in fiscal higher volumes produced on our new wells in their first year of production caused depletion per mcfe to increase in fiscal as compared to fiscal the variances from period to period are directly attributable to changes in our oil and gas reserve quantities  product prices and changes in the depletable cost basis of our oil and gas properties 
year ended september  compared to year ended september  our natural gas revenues were million in fiscal  an increase of million from million in fiscal the increase was due to a increase in the average sales price of natural gas partially offset by a decrease in production volumes 
the million increase in natural gas revenues consisted of million attributable to price increases  partially offset by  attributable to volume decreases 
production volumes decreased because normal production declines in our existing wells were not offset by the new wells we had drilled in crawford county  pennsylvania  since those wells could not be brought on line until the extension of our crawford gathering system had been completed 
the crawford extension was completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal our oil revenues were million in fiscal  an increase of  from million in fiscal the increase resulted from a increase in the average sales price of oil partially offset by a decrease in production volumes 
the  increase in oil revenues consisted of million attributable to price increases partially offset by  attributable to volume decreases 
the decrease in oil volumes was a result of the natural production decline inherent in the life of a well 
we did not offset the decline through the addition of new wells  as substantially all of the wells we have drilled during the past several years have targeted natural gas reserves 
our well drilling gross margin was million in the year ended september   a decrease of  from million in the year ended september  during the period  our average cost per well decreased because we drilled many of them to a shallower formation and  in certain areas where we have become more active  many of our wells either have not required fracture stimulation or have needed less equipment than wells we have drilled in prior years 
since our drilling contracts are on a cost plus basis typically cost plus  a decrease in our average cost per well also results in a decrease in our average revenue per well 
on the other hand  the decrease in our average cost per well allowed us to drill more wells with the funds available 
in addition  it should be noted that the line item liabilities associated with drilling contracts in our consolidated financial statements includes million of funds raised in our drilling investment partnerships in fiscal that had not been applied to drill wells as of september  due to the timing of drilling operations  and thus had not been recognized as well drilling revenues 
our gathering  transmission and processing revenues increased  in fiscal to million from million in fiscal the increase was a result of a increase in natural gas volumes transported by atlas pipeline partners and an increase in the average prices received for the natural gas transported  upon which the fees chargeable under a portion of our transportation arrangements are based 
our exploration costs were million in fiscal  an increase of  from fiscal the increase in fiscal as compared to the prior year period was attributable to expenditures for lease costs of  which were charged to operations upon our decision to discontinue drilling on certain leases 
our gathering  transmission and processing expenses increased in the year ended september   as compared to the prior year period 
this increase resulted from an increase in compressor expenses due to the addition of more compressors and increased compressor lease rates 
compressors were added to increase the transportation capacity of our gathering systems 
our non direct expenses were million in fiscal  a decrease of  from million in fiscal these expenses include  among other things  salaries and benefits not allocated to a specific energy activity  costs of running our energy corporate office  partnership syndication activities and outside services 
these expenses were partially offset by reimbursements we received for costs we incurred in our partnership management and drilling activities  resulting from an increase in the number of wells we drilled and managed during the year as compared to the prior year 
reimbursements received by us related to our drilling activities increased  in year ended september  as compared to the year ended september  in addition  we more closely allocated direct costs associated with our other energy activities to those activities  thereby reducing non direct expenses 
depletion of oil and gas properties as a percentage of oil and gas revenues was in fiscal compared to in fiscal the variances from period to period are directly attributable to changes in our oil and gas reserve quantities  product prices and changes in the depletable cost basis of our oil and gas properties 
higher gas and oil prices caused depletion as a percentage of oil and gas revenues to decrease in fiscal as compared to fiscal results of operations real estate during fiscal  and  our real estate operations were affected by three principal trends or events o we continued our program of resolving the loans in our existing portfolio through repayments  sales  refinancings  restructurings and foreclosures  o we sought growth in our real estate business through the sponsorship of three real estate investment partnerships  and o in fiscal we adopted fin the principal effects of the first two factors have been to reduce the number of our real estate loans while increasing our interests in real property and  as a result of repayments  sales  refinancings and restructurings  increasing our cash flow from loan resolutions while reducing the amount of our portfolio of loans and property interests 
the principal effect of adopting fin has been to consolidate in our financial statements the assets and liabilities of a number of borrowers although not affecting our creditor debtor legal relationship with these borrowers and not causing these assets and obligations to become our legal assets or obligations 
the following table sets forth information relating to the revenues recognized and costs and expenses incurred in our real estate operations during the periods indicated years ended september  in thousands revenues interest on loans   accreted discount net of collection of interest on loans    gains on resolutions of loans and loan payments in excess of the carrying value of loans   fee income from sponsorship of partnerships   rental and other income from properties fin revenues  equity in earnings of equity investees  cost and expenses real estate general and administrative    fin expenses  year ended september  compared to year ended september  revenues from our real estate operations increased million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal we attribute the increase to the following o an increase of million in fin revenues in fiscal as compared to fiscal we adopted fin on july  which resulted in our having to consolidate fourteen entities as of september  as a result of sales of our interests and our restructuring of certain of our interests  we consolidated seven entities under the provisions of fin as of september  operations for fiscal and all of fiscal reflect fin revenues and expenses  as appropriate  o an increase of million in our share of the operating results of our unconsolidated real estate investments accounted for on the equity method in fiscal as compared to fiscal the majority of the increase relates to one investment and resulted from a change made in the first quarter of fiscal in the allocation of net income between the partners as a result of our preferential cash distributions  and o an increase of  in rental and other income in fiscal as compared to fiscal the increase was primarily the result of three additional months of rental income from one property 
the increases were partially offset by the following o a decrease in interest and accreted discount income of million resulting from the following the transfer of fourteen loans to fin accounting treatment as of july  of which seven loans still remained as of september   which decreased interest income by million in fiscal as compared to fiscal  the resolution of twelve loans which decreased interest income by million in fiscal as compared to fiscal  the completion of accretion of discount on one loan  which decreased interest income by  in fiscal as compared to fiscal  a decrease in our average rate of accretion  resulting in a decrease in interest income of  in fiscal as compared to fiscal  and the conversion of one fin consolidated entity to a loan which increased interest income by  in fiscal as compared to fiscal this resulted from the partial resolution of the loan  such that we are no longer the primary beneficiary of the borrower 
o a decrease of  in gains on resolutions of loans and ventures 
in fiscal  we resolved four loans having an aggregate book value of million for a net gain of  we recognized an additional gain in fiscal of  on one loan which was resolved in fiscal we also received million for the sale of our investment in one venture resulting in a gain of  in fiscal  we resolved three loans having a book value of million for million  recognizing a gain of million  and o a decrease of million in fee income in fiscal as compared to fiscal we earned fees for services provided to the real estate investment partnerships which we sponsored relating to the purchase and third party financing of two properties in fiscal and four properties in fiscal these transaction fees totaled  in fiscal and million in fiscal additionally  we earned management fees for the properties owned by real estate investment partnerships which we sponsored totaling  in fiscal as compared to  in fiscal we anticipate earning additional fees from our three partnerships and any future real estate investment partnerships which we may sponsor 
gains on resolutions of loans  ventures and fin assets if any and the amount of fees received if any vary by each transaction and  accordingly  there may be significant variations in our gains on resolutions and fee income from period to period 
costs and expenses of our real estate operations were million in fiscal  an increase of million from million in fiscal we attribute the increase to the following o an increase of million in fin expenses for fiscal as compared to fiscal we early adopted fin on july   which resulted in our consolidating fourteen entities as of september  and seven entities as of september  and recording their operations as fin revenues and expenses for a portion of fiscal and twelve months in fiscal  o an increase of  in real estate general and administrative expenses in fiscal  as compared to fiscal the increase resulted primarily from the following an increase in wages and benefits of  as a result of the addition of personnel in our real estate subsidiary to manage our existing portfolio of commercial loans and real estate and to expand our real estate operations through the sponsorship of real estate investment partnerships offset by a reduced corporate allocation of executive wages  an increase in property management expenses of  related to the real estate investment partnerships  an increase in travel costs of  due to the increased activity associated with the acquisition and management of our real estate investment programs  and a decrease in outside services of  reflecting additional work performed internally by new personnel 
year ended september  compared to year ended september  revenues from our real estate operations decreased million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal we attribute these changes to the following o a decrease in interest income and accreted discount of million in fiscal as compared to fiscal  primarily resulting from the following the sale or repayment of three loans in fiscal which decreased interest income by million in fiscal as compared to fiscal  the completion of accretion of discount on one loan  which decreased interest income by million in fiscal as compared to fiscal  a decrease in our average accretion rate  resulting in a decrease in interest income of  in fiscal as compared to fiscal  and the early adoption of fin on july  resulted in our consolidating entities and resulted in a decrease in interest income of million 
o a decrease of million in gains on resolutions of loans and loan payments in excess of carrying value in fiscal as compared to fiscal  resulting primarily from the following in fiscal  we received repayments of million on three loans having aggregate book values of million  resulting in gains of million  in fiscal  we sold one loan having a book value of million to rait for million  resulting in a gain of  in fiscal  we received repayments of million on two loans having an aggregate book value of million  resulting in gains of million  and o an increase of million in fee income in fiscal  as compared to fiscal this increase resulted primarily from fees we earned for services provided to the real estate investment partnership which we sponsored 
these fees relate to the purchase and third party financing of four partnership properties 
we anticipate earning additional fees from this partnership and any future real estate investment partnerships which we may sponsor 
gains on resolutions of loans and loan payments in excess of the carrying value of loans if any and the amount of fees received if any vary from transaction to transaction and there may be significant variations in our gains on resolutions and fee income from period to period 
costs and expenses of our real estate operations increased million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal primarily resulting from the following o an increase in wages and benefits of  due to the addition of personnel in connection with of our sponsorship and management of our real estate investment partnerships  o an increase in insurance and professional services fees of  due to an increase in insurance rates in general and additional activity associated with the management of our loan portfolio and investment partnership  and o fin expenses associated with real estate entities consolidated upon adoption on july  of fin see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements increased  as fiscal represents three months of operations

these expenses were partially offset by reimbursements of million from our investment partnerships in the fiscal year ended year ended september  compared to year ended september  equity in the earnings of our structured finance investees increased million from  in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase in fiscal reflects our equity earnings subsequent to the completion of offerings by three trapeza cdo issuers which we had co sponsored as of september  results of operations equipment leasing the following table sets forth certain information relating to the revenues and costs and expenses incurred in our equipment leasing operations during the periods indicated years ended september  in thousands revenues leasing revenues  acquisition fees   management fees   other costs and expenses   on june   we acquired a portfolio of small ticket leases with a value of million along with numerous vendor finance relationships as well as experienced origination personnel from premier lease service lc year ended september compared to year ended september  our lease originations were million in fiscal  an increase of million from fiscal our total lease assets under management at september  were million  an increase of million from fiscal our leasing origination growth was facilitated by our relationships with merrill lynch  our investment partnership  and the premier portfolio acquisition 
this resulted in total revenues from leasing operations increasing to million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal  an increase of 
leasing revenues increased to million in fiscal as compared to  in fiscal  a increase  due to the increase in lease originations 
acquisition fees increased to million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal  a increase 
the increase in lease originations allowed us to sell a greater volume of leases to our investment partnership and merrill lynch 
management fees were relatively flat in fiscal year as compared to fiscal despite the increase in the lease portfolios managed 
at the time we acquired leaf financial in  it acted as the general partner of a series of public equipment leasing partnerships 
we liquidated the last four of these partnerships in the quarter ended march   and  as a result  the increase of management fees from other sources was largely offset by the elimination of management fees from this source 
included in other income are gains on lease terminations which vary from transaction to transaction and can result in significant income variances from period to period depending upon the termination schedules 
our equipment leasing expenses were million in fiscal year  an increase of million from million in fiscal year due to the expansion of our equipment leasing operations  our wages and benefits increased by million and overhead operational expenses increased by  from fiscal in addition  we had previously deferred organization and offering costs in connection with the fund raising activities of our equipment leasing investment partnership 
the investment partnership reimburses us for these costs as it sells partnership interests in connection with its public offering 
the offering period for the current equipment leasing investment partnership closed on august  during the fiscal year ended september   based on unanticipated circumstances impacting the sale of investment units  we reduced the amount of offering costs to be reimbursed by a million charge to earnings 
year ended september compared to year ended september  our equipment leasing revenues were million in fiscal  an increase of million from million in fiscal  primarily due to the receipt in fiscal of management fees and equipment leasing income associated with our new leasing investment programs 
our leasing expenses were million in fiscal  an increase of million from  in fiscal  primarily due to expenses associated with the expansion of our operations in connection with our new leasing programs 
results of operations other costs and expenses and other income expense year ended september  compared to year ended september  our expenses related to the planned spin off of atlas america were million for the year ended september  as previously discussed  in may atlas america completed an initial public offering of  shares of its common stock  leaving us with an ownership of atlas america 
in connection with the offering  edward cohen became chairman  chief executive officer and president of atlas america and retired as our chief executive officer 
as a result of his retirement  we commenced payments required by the supplemental employment retirement plan established under his employment arrangements with us and recorded a charge of million to reflect an actuarial adjustment based upon the acceleration of his retirement date 
the balance of the reorganization expenses consisted of  of legal fees incurred in connection with the planned spin off of atlas america 
depreciation  depletion and amortization increased million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this increase primarily resulted from the increase in energy properties and equipment related to the purchase of wells and related equipment due to the expansion of our drilling efforts in fiscal and as a result of the acquisition of spectrum by atlas pipeline 
our provision for possible losses decreased million to  in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal this decrease resulted primarily from the decrease in our investments in our real estate loan portfolio and other real estate assets owned through the repayment of loans and property resolutions 
our fiscal provision for a legal settlement of million represents the estimated cost associated with the settlement of an action filed by the former chairman of trm corporation as described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
subsequent to the end of fiscal  our claim against our insurance company for reimbursement of our costs was settled for million and we anticipate recording our recovery in operations during the first quarter of fiscal our interest expense in fiscal decreased by million to million from million in fiscal  due principally to the repurchase million of our senior notes and repayment of real estate credit facilities as a result of disposals of real estate loans and assets in fiscal at september   we owned of atlas pipeline through both our general partner interest and our subordinated limited partner units 
as general partner  we control atlas pipeline  therefore  we include it in our consolidated financial statements and show the ownership by the public as a minority interest 
the minority interest in atlas pipeline earnings was million in the year ended as compared to million in the year ended  an increase of  
these increases were the result of an increase in atlas pipeline s net income principally caused by increases in transportation fees received  the acquisition of spectrum and an increase in the amount of atlas pipeline s earnings attributable to minority interests as a result of its may  april and july public offerings 
during fiscal and fiscal  we sold  and  shares  respectively  of rait investment trust and recorded gains of million and million  respectively 
dividend income from rait decreased million to  in fiscal as a result of these sales 
at september   we owned approximately  shares of rait 
the million loss on the early extinguishment of the debt reflects the write off of the unamortized discount and issue costs related to the repurchased senior notes 
the repurchase of the senior notes was completed in january our effective tax rate increased to in fiscal as compared to in fiscal as a result of a reduction in statutory depletion and tax exempt interest

year ended september  compared to year ended september  in accordance with sfas accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  our decision in fiscal to dispose of optiron corporation  our former energy technology subsidiary  resulted in the presentation of optiron as a discontinued operation for the three years ended september  we had held a interest in optiron  as a result of the disposition in september  we currently hold a interest in optiron 
the plan of disposal required optiron to pay to us of its revenues if such revenues exceeded million in the twelve month period following the closing of the transaction 
as a result  in fiscal optiron became obligated to pay us  the payment was made in march on august   we sold our small ticket equipment leasing subsidiary  fidelity leasing  inc  to european american bank and ael leasing co  inc  subsidiaries of abn amro bank  nv we received total consideration of million  including repayment of indebtedness of fidelity leasing to us 
of the million consideration  million was paid by a non interest bearing promissory note 
the promissory note was payable to the extent of payments received from on a pool of fidelity leasing lease receivables and refunds received with respect to certain tax receivables 
in addition  million was placed in escrow as security for our indemnification obligations to the purchasers 
the successor in interest to the purchaser made a series of claims with respect to our indemnification obligations and representations which were settled in december under the settlement  we and the successor were released from certain terms and obligations of the original purchase agreements and from claims arising from circumstances known at the settlement date

in addition  we foreclosed on one property in which we held a loan and have classified this property as held for sale 
cumulative effects of changes in accounting principles in january the fasb issued fin  consolidation of variable interest entities 
this interpretation changed the method of determining whether certain entities called variable interest entities or vie should be included in our consolidated financial statements 
the analysis of whether an entity is a vie and a result  must be consolidated is based on an analysis of risks and rewards  not control  and represents a significant and complex modification of previous accounting principles 
under fin  a vie is an entity that has equity that is insufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties  or equity investors that cannot make significant decisions about the entity s operations  or that do not absorb the expected losses or receive the expected residual returns of the entity 
a vie must be consolidated by its primary beneficiary  which is the party involved with the vie that has exposure to a majority of the expected losses or a majority of the expected residual returns or both 
all other entities are evaluated for consolidation in accordance with sfas no 
 consolidation of all majority owned subsidiaries 
fin is applicable to vies created after january   and to vies in which an enterprise obtains an interest after that date 
for vies in which an enterprise holds an interest that it acquired before february   fin is applicable for financial statements issued for the first period ending after december  for any vies that must be consolidated under fin  the assets  liabilities and non controlling interest of the vie are initially measured at their carrying amounts  as defined in fin  with any difference between the net amount added to the balance sheet and the value at which the primary beneficiary carried its interest in the vie prior to the adoption of fin being recognized as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
if determining the carrying amounts is not practicable  the fair value at the date of adoption may be used to measure the assets  liabilities and non controlling interests of the vie 
we have determined that it was not practicable to determine the carrying values of the vie s as of the date of the qualifying event and accordingly  have used the fair values at the date of adoption  july  as encouraged by the pronouncement  we early adopted fin on july  consequently  certain entities relating to our real estate business were consolidated in our financial statements in fiscal several factors that distinguish these entities from others included in our consolidated statements follow o the assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses of the consolidated vies are included in our financial statements 
the investments in real estate loans and accreted interest income thereon  which were our variable interests in the vies  have been removed from the financial statements  o we consolidated the vies because we determined that we were the primary beneficiary of these entities within the meaning of fin  and o the assets and liabilities of the vies that are now included in our consolidated financial statements are neither our assets nor our liabilities 
liabilities of the vie can only be satisfied from the vie s assets  not our assets  nor can we use the vie s assets to satisfy our obligations 
as of july   the date of adoption  the consolidation of fin entities resulted in the addition of million in assets and million in liabilities to our consolidated balance sheet and in a million after tax cumulative effect adjustment in our fourth fiscal quarter 
in addition  because we classified certain of our fin assets as being held for sale  the operations of those assets were recognized in our consolidated statements of operations as income loss from discontinued operations 
accordingly  we recognized losses of million and income of  net of income taxes in fiscal and  respectively 
fin has been the subject of significant continuing interpretation by the fasb  and changes to its complex requirements are possible 
in december  a revised interpretation was issued  known as fin r 
this revision did not have an effect on our financial position or results of operations 
it is not possible to conclude whether future changes would be likely to affect the amounts we have already recorded 
the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in fiscal related to optiron which adopted sfas on january  and  as a result of this adoption  realized an impairment and writedown on its books of goodwill associated with the on going viability of the product with which the goodwill was associated 
this impairment resulted in a cumulative effect adjustment of million on optiron s books  and as a result  we recorded our share of this adjustment 
liquidity and capital resources general 
our major sources of liquidity have been funds generated by operations  funds raised and fees earned from investor partnerships  resolutions of real estate loans  borrowings under our existing energy  real estate  leasing and corporate credit facilities and the sales of our rait investment trust shares 
in fiscal  a principal source of liquidity was atlas america s payment of dividends to us principally with proceeds from its initial public offering 
we have employed these funds principally in the expansion of our energy operations  the repurchase of our senior notes  the repayment of our energy and real estate credit facilities 
the following table sets forth our sources and uses of cash for the periods indicated years ended september  in thousands provided by continuing operations    used in investing activities    provided by used in financing activities    provided by used in discontinued operations    increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents    our liquidity is affected by national  regional and local economic trends and uncertainties as well as trends and uncertainties more particular to us  including natural gas prices  interest rates and our ability to raise funds through our sponsorship of investment partnerships and structured finance vehicles 
while the current favorable natural gas pricing and interest rate environment have been positive contributors to our liquidity  and lead us to believe that we will be able to refinance  or renew  our indebtedness as it matures  there are numerous risks and uncertainties involved 
we describe factors affecting our liquidity  as well as the risks and uncertainties relating to our ability to generate this liquidity  in item  business risk factors and in this item in results of operations  changes in prices and inflation  and contractual obligations and commercial commitments 
year ended september  compared to year ended september  we had million in cash and cash equivalents on hand at september  as compared to million at september  our ratio of earnings from continuing operations before income taxes  minority interest and interest expense to fixed charges was to in the fiscal year ended september  as compared to to in the fiscal year ended september our working capital at september  was million  an increase of million from million at september  this increase primarily resulted from the net proceeds from atlas america s and atlas pipeline s public offerings 
our long term debt including current maturities to total capital ratio at september  was as compared to at september  cash flows from operating activities 
cash provided by operations is an important source of short term liquidity for us 
net cash provided by operating activities increased  in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  primarily due to o changes in operating assets and liabilities decreased cash flows by million primarily as a result of an increase in purchases of lease equipment which will subsequently be sold to third party equipment leasing programs and trade payables and deferred revenues on drilling contracts at september  as compared to september   due to the timing of investor funds raised and the subsequent use of those funds in our drilling programs  o offsetting this decrease was an increase in deferred taxes of million  and o gas and oil production net revenues increased million primarily attributable to a increase in the average price we received for our natural gas production 
cash flows from investing activities 
net cash used in our investing activities increased million in fiscal as compared to fiscal  primarily due to the following o cash used in the acquisition of spectrum was million  and o an increase in capital expenditures of million associated with the expansion of our energy operations  o offsetting these items was an increase of million in principal payments on notes receivable and proceeds from sale of assets  and o an increase of million in net proceeds from the sale of rait investment trust shares to million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal cash flows from financing activities 
net cash used in our financing activities increased million in fiscal as compared to fiscal  primarily due to the following o we received proceeds of million from public offerings of atlas america s common stock and atlas pipeline s common units  an increase of million from million in fiscal  o offsetting this increase was an increase in net repayments of debt of million in fiscal as compared to fiscal  and o an increase in dividends paid to minority interest of million in fiscal as compared to fiscal as a result of higher earnings and more common units outstanding for atlas pipeline as a result of its april and july offerings of common units 
year ended september  compared to year ended september  we had million in cash and cash equivalents on hand at september  as compared to million at september  our ratio of earnings from continuing operations before income taxes  minority interest and interest expense to fixed charges was to in the fiscal year ended september  as compared to to in the fiscal year ended september our working capital at september  was million  an increase of million from million at september  this increase primarily resulted from the classification of million of our fin assets net of related liabilities as held for sale  partially offset by the classification of the outstanding million principal amount of our senior notes as current liabilities due to their august  maturity date 
our long term debt including current maturities to total capital ratio at september  was as compared to at september  cash flows from operating activities 
cash provided by operations is an important source of short term liquidity for us 
net cash provided by operating activities increased million in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  primarily due to the following o operating assets and liabilities increased million primarily as a result of an increase in deferred revenues on drilling contracts at september  as compared to september   due to the timing of investor funds raised and the subsequent use of those funds in our drilling programs  o gas and oil production revenues increased million primarily attributable to a increase in the average price we received for our natural gas production  and o offsetting these increases in operating cash flow was a decrease in collections of interest of million associated with our real estate segment due in part to our adoption of fin cash flows from investing activities 
net cash used in our investing activities decreased million in fiscal as compared to fiscal  primarily due to the following o a realization of net proceeds of million from sale of rait shares in fiscal as compared to a use of million to acquire rait shares in fiscal  o a decrease of million in investments in real estate loans and real property interests in fiscal as compared to  o a decrease of million in cash spent on other assets due principally to investments with the commencement of the trapeza entities and our equipment leasing operation in fiscal o offsetting these items was a decrease of million in principal payments on notes receivable and proceeds from sale of assets  and o an increase in capital expenditures of million associated with the expansion of our energy operations 
cash flows from financing activities 
net cash used in our financing activities increased million in fiscal as compared to fiscal  primarily due to the following o an increase in net repayments of debt of million in fiscal as compared to fiscal  o an increase in purchases of treasury stock of million in fiscal as compared to fiscal  o offsetting these increases were net proceeds of million from atlas pipeline s public offering in fiscal  and o an increase in proceeds from issuance of stock of million in fiscal as compared to fiscal capital requirements during fiscal  our capital expenditures related primarily to investments in our drilling investment partnerships and pipeline expansions  in which we invested million and million  respectively 
during fiscal  we funded capital expenditures through cash on hand  borrowings under our credit facilities and from operations 
we have established two credit facilities to provide additional funding sources for our capital expenditures 
the level of capital expenditures we must devote to our exploration and production operations depends upon the level of funds raised through our drilling investment partnerships 
we have budgeted to raise up to million in fiscal through drilling partnerships 
during fiscal  we raised million 
we believe cash flow from operations and amounts available under our credit facility will be adequate to fund our contributions to these partnerships 
however  the amount of funds we raise and the level of our capital expenditures will vary in the future depending on market conditions for natural gas and other factors 
we continuously evaluate acquisitions of natural gas and oil and pipeline assets 
in order to make any acquisition  we believe we will be required to access outside capital either through debt or equity placements or through joint venture operations with other energy companies 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in our efforts to obtain outside capital 
changes in prices and inflation our revenues  the value of our assets  our ability to obtain bank loans or additional capital on attractive terms and our ability to finance our drilling activities through drilling investment partnerships have been and will continue to be affected by changes in oil and gas prices 
natural gas and oil prices are subject to significant fluctuations that are beyond our ability to control or predict 
during fiscal  we received an average of per mcf of natural gas and per bbl of oil as compared to per mcf and per bbl in fiscal and per mcf and per bbl in fiscal although certain of our costs and expenses are affected by general inflation  inflation has not normally had a significant effect on us 
however  inflationary trends may occur if the price of natural gas were to increase since such an increase may increase the demand for acreage and for energy equipment and services  thereby increasing the costs of acquiring or obtaining such equipment and services 
environmental regulation to date  compliance with environmental laws and regulations has not had a material impact on our capital expenditures  earnings or competitive position 
we cannot assure you that compliance with environmental laws and regulations will not  in the future  materially adversely affect our operations through increased costs of doing business or restrictions on the manner in which we conduct our operations 
dividends in the years ended september   and  we paid dividends of million  million and million  respectively 
we have paid regular quarterly dividends since august the determination of the amount of future cash dividends  if any  is at the sole discretion of our board of directors and will depend on the various factors affecting our financial condition and other matters the board of directors deems relevant 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following tables set forth our obligations and commitments as of september  payments due by period in thousands contractual cash obligations less than after total year years years years long term debt      secured revolving credit facilities   capital lease obligations operating leases    total contractual cash obligations      amount of commitment expiration per period in thousands other commercial commitments less than after total year years years years standby letters of credit   guarantees standby replacement commitments    other commercial commitments      total commercial commitments      critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of our assets  liabilities  revenues  costs and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to bad debts  deferred tax assets and liabilities  goodwill and identifiable intangible assets  and certain accrued liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we have identified the following policies as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
accounts receivable  investments in lease assets and real estate and allowance for possible losses 
through our business segments  we engage in credit extension  monitoring  and collection 
in equipment leasing  in evaluating our allowance for possible losses  we consider our contractual delinquencies  economic conditions and trends  industry statistics  lease portfolio characteristics and management s prior experience with similar lease assets 
at september   our credit evaluation indicated that we have no need for an allowance for possible losses for our lease assets 
in energy  in evaluating our allowance for possible losses  we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current creditworthiness  as determined by our review of our customer s credit information 
we extend credit on an unsecured basis to many of our energy customers 
at september   our credit evaluation indicated that we have no need for an allowance for possible losses for our oil and gas receivables 
in real estate  in evaluating the carrying value of our investments and our allowance for possible losses  we consider general and local economic conditions  neighborhood values  competitive overbuilding  casualty losses and other factors which may affect the value of our loans 
the value of our investments may also be affected by factors such as the cost of compliance with regulations and liability under applicable environmental laws  changes in interest rates and the availability of financing 
income from a property will be reduced if a significant number of tenants are unable to pay rent or if available space cannot be rented on favorable terms 
we reduce our investment in real estate loans by an allowance for amounts that may become unrealizable in the future 
such allowance can be either specific to a particular loan or property or general to all loans or properties 
as of september  and  we had investments in real estate loans and real estate of million and million  net of an allowance for possible losses of  and million  respectively 
we believe our allowance for possible losses is adequate at september  however  an adverse change in the facts and circumstances with regard to one of our larger loans or properties could cause us to experience a loss in excess of our allowance 
we believe that our allowance for possible losses is reasonable based on our experience and our analysis of the net realizable value of our receivables at september  reserve estimates our estimates of our proved natural gas and oil reserves and future net revenues from them are based upon reserve analyses that rely upon various assumptions  including those required by the us securities and exchange commission  as to natural gas and oil prices  drilling and operating expenses  capital expenditures  taxes and availability of funds 
any significant variance in these assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantity of our reserves 
as a result  our estimates of our proved natural gas and oil reserves are inherently imprecise 
actual future production  natural gas and oil prices  revenues  taxes  development expenditures  operating expenses and quantities of recoverable natural gas and oil reserves may vary substantially from our estimates or estimates contained in the reserve reports and may affect our ability to pay amounts due under our credit facilities or cause a reduction in our energy credit facilities 
in addition  our proved reserves may be subject to downward or upward revision based upon production history  results of future exploration and development  prevailing natural gas and oil prices  mechanical difficulties  governmental regulation and other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
impairment of oil and gas properties we review our producing oil and gas properties for impairment on an annual basis and whenever events and circumstances indicate a decline in the recoverability of their carrying values 
we estimate the expected future cash flows from our oil and gas properties and compare such future cash flows to the carrying amount of the oil and gas properties to determine if the carrying amount is recoverable 
if the carrying amount exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows  we will adjust the carrying amount of the oil and gas properties to their fair value in the current period 
the factors used to determine fair value include  but are not limited to  estimates of reserves  future production estimates  anticipated capital expenditures  and a discount rate commensurate with the risk associated with realizing the expected cash flows projected 
because of the complexities associated with oil and gas reserve estimates and the history of price volatility in the oil and gas markets  events may arise that will require us to record an impairment of our oil and gas properties 
any such impairment may affect or cause a reduction in our energy credit facilities 
dismantlement  restoration  reclamation and abandonment costs on an annual basis  we estimate the costs of future dismantlement  restoration  reclamation and abandonment of our natural gas and oil producing properties 
we also estimate the salvage value of equipment recoverable upon abandonment 
on october  we adopted sfas  as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
as of september   and  our estimate of salvage values was greater than or equal to our estimate of the costs of future dismantlement  restoration  reclamation and abandonment 
a decrease in salvage values or an increase in dismantlement  restoration  reclamation and abandonment costs from those we have estimated  or changes in our estimates or costs  could reduce our gross profit from energy operations 
goodwill and other long lived assets goodwill and other intangibles with an indefinite useful life are no longer amortized  but instead are assessed for impairment annually 
we have recorded goodwill of million in connection with several acquisitions of assets 
in assessing impairment of goodwill  we use estimates and assumptions in estimating the fair value of reporting units 
if under these estimates and assumptions we determine that the fair value of a reporting unit has been reduced  the reduction can result in an impairment of goodwill 
however  future results could differ from the estimates and assumptions we use 
events or circumstances which might lead to an indication of impairment of goodwill would include  but might not be limited to  prolonged decreases in expectations of long term well servicing and or drilling activity or rates brought about by prolonged decreases in natural gas or oil prices  changes in government regulation of the natural gas and oil industry or other events which could affect the level of activity of exploration and production companies 
in assessing impairment of long lived assets other than goodwill  where there has been a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying amount of a long lived asset may not be recoverable  we have estimated future undiscounted net cash flows from the use of the asset based on actual historical results and expectations about future economic circumstances  including natural gas and oil prices and operating costs 
our estimate of future net cash flows from the use of an asset could change if actual prices and costs differ due to industry conditions or other factors affecting our performance 
revenue recognition energy 
we conduct certain energy activities through  and a portion of our revenues are attributable to  sponsored energy limited partnerships 
these energy partnerships raise capital from investors to drill gas and oil wells 
we serve as general partner of the energy partnerships and assume customary rights and obligations for them 
as the general partner  we are liable for partnership liabilities and can be liable to limited partners if it breaches its responsibilities with respect to the operations of the partnerships 
the income from our general partner interest is recorded when the gas and oil are sold by a partnership 
we contract with the energy partnerships to drill partnership wells 
the contracts require that the energy partnerships must pay us the full contract price upon execution 
the income from a drilling contract is recognized as the services are performed 
the contracts are typically completed in less than days 
on an uncompleted contract  we classify the difference between the contract payments we have received and contract costs previously incurred as a current liability 
we recognize gathering  transmission and processing revenues at the time the natural gas and liquids are delivered 
we recognize well services revenues at the time the services are performed 
we are entitled to receive management fees according to the respective partnership agreements 
we recognize such fees as income when earned and include them in energy revenues 
we record the income from the working interests and overriding royalties of wells in which we own an interest when the gas and oil are delivered 
real estate 
we sponsored and manage two real estate partnerships which were organized to invest in multi family residential properties 
we receive acquisition fees equal to previously of the net purchase price of properties acquired and an additional previously fee for debt placement related to the properties acquired 
we recognize these fees upon acquiring the properties and obtaining the related financing 
we sponsored a third real estate partnership in the third quarter of fiscal  which is still in the offering stage at september  we also receive a fee equal to of the gross operating revenues from the partnerships properties  payable monthly 
we recognize this fee as the partnerships revenues are earned 
additionally  we receive an annual investment management fee from the partnerships equal to of the gross offering proceeds of the partnership for our services 
this investment management fee is recognized ratably over each annual period 
we accrete the difference between our cost basis in a real estate loan and the sum of projected cash flows from that loan into interest income over the estimated life of the loan using the interest method which recognizes a level interest rate over the life of the loan 
we review projected cash flows  which include amounts realizable from the underlying properties  on a regular basis 
changes to projected cash flows  which can be based upon updated property appraisals  changes to the property and changes to the real estate market in general  reduce or increase the amounts accreted into interest income over the remaining life of the loan 
we also utilize the cost recovery method for loans when appropriate under the circumstances 
equipment leasing 
our lease transactions are generally classified as direct financing leases in accordance with sfas no 
and its amendments as distinguished from sales type or operating leases 
such leases transfer substantially all benefits and risks of equipment ownership to the customer 
unearned lease income  which is recognized as revenue over the term of the lease by the effective interest method  represents the excess of the total future minimum lease payments plus the estimated unguaranteed residual value expected to be realized at the end of the lease term over the cost of the related equipment 
we generally discontinue the recognition of revenue for leases for which payments are more than days past due 
initial direct costs incurred in consummating a lease are capitalized as part of the investment in lease receivables and amortized over the lease term as a reduction in the yield 
leases not meeting any of the criteria to be classified as direct financing leases are deemed to be operating leases 
rental income consists primarily of monthly periodic rentals due under the terms of the leases 
generally  during the lease terms of existing operating leases  we will not recover all of the undepreciated cost and related expenses of its rental equipment and  therefore  we are prepared to remarket the equipment in future years 
our policy is to review quarterly the expected economic life of its rental equipment in order to determine the recoverability of its undepreciated cost 
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  we write down our rental equipment to its estimated net realizable value when it is probable that its carrying amount exceeds such value and the excess can be reasonably estimated  gains are only recognized upon actual sale of our rental equipment 
we receive acquisition fees from certain parties equal to a percentage of the cost of leased equipment acquired on behalf of these parties as compensation for acquisition expenses incurred related to the lease acquisition 
these fees are earned at the time of the sale of the related leased equipment to those parties 
we receive management fees for managing and servicing the leased assets acquired on behalf of these parties and earn fees at the time the service is performed 
we receive servicing fees ranging from to of gross rental payments received from certain parties and for others  we receive servicing fees that average of the managed portfolio balance 
in addition  we also receive fees as a reimbursement of our operating and administrative expenses incurred to manage the partnerships 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of the following information is to provide forward looking quantitative and qualitative information about our potential exposure to market risks 
the term market risk refers to risks arising from changes in interest rates and oil and gas prices 
the disclosures are not meant to be precise indicators of the effects of expected changes in market conditions  but rather indicators of the effects of reasonably possible changes 
this forward looking information provides indicators of how we view and manage our ongoing market risk exposures 
all of our market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for purposes other than trading 
general we are exposed to various market risks  principally fluctuating interest rates and changes in commodity prices 
these risks can impact our results of operations  cash flows and financial position 
we manage these risks through regular operating and financing activities and periodically use derivative financial instruments such as forward contracts and interest rate cap and swap agreements 
the following analysis presents the effect on our earnings  cash flows and financial position as if hypothetical changes in market risk factors occurred on september  only the potential impacts of hypothetical assumptions are analyzed 
the analysis does not consider other possible effects that could impact our business 
energy interest rate risk 
at september   the amount outstanding under atlas america s credit facility had decreased to million from million at september  the weighted average interest rate for this facility increased from at september  to at september  due to a larger portion of our borrowings being at the bank s prime rate and an increase in short term market interest rates 
holding all other variables constant  a hypothetical change in the weighted average interest rate would change our net income by approximately  at september   atlas pipeline had a million four year revolving line of credit which can be increased by an additional million under certain circumstances and a million five year term loan  to fund the expansion of its existing gathering systems and the acquisition of other gas gathering systems 
atlas pipeline had million drawn on this facility at september  the weighted average interest rate for borrowings under this credit facility was at september  holding all other variables constant  a hypothetical change in the weighted average interest rate would change our net income by approximately  commodity price risk 
our major market risk exposure in commodities is fluctuations in the pricing of our gas and oil production 
realized pricing is primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide prices for crude oil and spot market prices applicable to united states natural gas production 
pricing for gas and oil production has been volatile and unpredictable for many years 
to limit our exposure to changing natural gas prices  we use hedges 
through our hedges  we seek to provide a measure of stability in the volatile environment of natural gas prices 
our risk management objective is to lock in a range of pricing for expected production volumes 
atlas america does not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes 
historically  it has entered into financial hedging activities for a portion of its projected natural gas production 
atlas america recognizes gains and losses from the settlement of these hedges in gas revenues when the associated production occurs 
the gains and losses realized as a result of hedging are substantially offset in the market when atlas america delivers the associated natural gas 
atlas america determines gains or losses on open and closed hedging transactions as the difference between the contract price and a reference price  generally closing prices on nymex 
we recognized losses of million and  on settled contracts during the years ended september  and  respectively 
atlas america had no open hedge transactions in place as of september  atlas america also enters into forward sales transactions which are not deemed hedges for accounting purposes because they require firm delivery of natural gas 
thus  atlas america limits these arrangements to much smaller quantities than those projected to be available at any delivery point 
the price paid by firstenergy solutions  colonial energy  inc  ugi energy services  and any other third party marketers for certain volumes of natural gas sold under these sales agreements may be significantly different from the underlying monthly spot market value 
the portion of natural gas that atlas america engages in forward sales and the manner in which it is sold eg  fixed pricing  floor and or floor price with a cap  which we refer to as a costless collar changes from time to time 
as of september   atlas america s overall forward sales position for the future months ending march for its natural gas production was approximately as follows o was sold with a fixed price  o was sold with a floor price and or costless collar price  and o was sold subject to market based pricing 
atlas america also enters into forward sales transactions  which we discuss in item  business energy forward sales 
in our mid continent operations  we are exposed to commodity price risks as a result of being paid for certain services in the form of commodities rather than cash 
for gathering services  we receive fees or commodities from the producers to bring the raw natural gas from the wellhead to the processing plant 
for processing services  we receive either fees or commodities as payment for these services  based on the type of contractual agreement 
based on our current contract mix  we have a long ngl position and a long natural gas position 
based upon our portfolio of supply contracts  without giving effect to hedging activities that would reduce the impact of commodity price decreases  a decrease of per gallon in the price of ngls and per million btus in the average price of natural gas would result in decreases in annual net income of approximately  and  respectively 
in addition  a decrease of per barrel in the average price of crude oil would result in a decrease to annual net income of approximately  our mid continent operations also entered into financial swap instruments  some of which settled during the three months ended september   that are designated as cash flow hedging instruments in accordance with sfas the maturities of the instruments outstanding at september  are less than three years 
the swap instruments are contractual agreements to exchange obligations of money between the buyer and seller of the instruments as natural gas  ngls and crude oil volumes during the pricing period are sold 
the swaps are tied to a set fixed price for the seller and floating prices for the buyer based on specified market index prices at the end of the relevant trading period 
we also enter into offsetting option transactions that fix the price for the seller within the range of prices established by puts purchased and calls sold and provide floating prices for the buyer based on specified market index prices at the end of the relevant trading period 
we entered into these instruments to hedge the residue natural gas  ngls and condensate sales that we had forecasted would occur against variability in expected future cash flows attributable to changes in market prices 
for the instruments that were settled during the year ended september   we recognized a loss of  spectrum entered into several swaps that were designed to hedge ngls prices during the three months ended september  that did not meet specific hedge accounting criteria 
spectrum recognized a loss of  related to these instruments during the year ended september  as of september   atlas pipeline had the following ngls  natural gas  and crude oil volumes hedged 
natural gas liquids fixed price swaps production average fair value period volumes fixed price liability calendar year gallons per gallon in thousands natural gas fixed price swaps production average fair value period volumes fixed price liability calendar year mmbtu per mmbtu in thousands natural gas options production average fair value period option type volumes strike price asset liability calendar year mmbtu per mmbtu in thousands puts purchased  calls sold  puts purchased  calls sold  crude fixed price swaps production average fair value period volumes fixed price liability calendar year barrels per barrel in thousands crude options production average fair value period option type volumes strike price liability calendar year barrels per barrel in thousands puts purchased  calls sold  puts purchased  calls sold  puts purchased  calls sold  total  mmbtu means million british thermal units 
as of september   the fair value of the swap agreements atlas pipeline had entered into in order to convert our market sensitive floating price contracts to fixed price positions resulted in a million liability 
real estate portfolio loans and related senior liens 
we believe that none of the six loans held in our portfolio as of september  including loans treated in our consolidated financial statements as fin assets and liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates since o the loans are subject to forbearance or other agreements that require all of the operating cash flow from the properties underlying the loans  after debt service on senior lien interests  to be paid to us and thus are not currently being paid based on the stated interest rates of the loans  o the senior lien interests are at fixed rates and are thus not subject to interest rate fluctuation that would affect payments to us  and o each loan has significant accrued and unpaid interest and other charges outstanding to which cash flow from the underlying property would be applied even if cash flow were to exceed the interest due  as originally underwritten 
equipment leasing at september   the amount outstanding on leaf financial s credit facility with national city bank was million at a weighted average interest rate of while the amount outstanding on its million credit facility with commerce bank was million at a weighted average interest rate of 
a hypothetical change in the weighted average interest rates on these facilities would change our net income by approximately
