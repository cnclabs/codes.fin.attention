item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
avigen s actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that might cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed herein and in risk factors under item overview we are focused on developing pharmaceutical products that provide improved treatments for serious and chronic hematological and neurological diseases 
since our inception  we have devoted substantially all of our resources to research and development activities  including the development of our proprietary gene delivery platform technology based on adeno associated virus vectors  known as aav vectors  and the development and clinical testing of dna based treatments for targeted hematological and neurological diseases 
our research and development activities to date are supported by a broad base of proprietary intellectual property that we have assembled covering methods of transferring genes into cells  high yield processes to manufacture contaminant free aav vectors  specific genes of interest  specific disease indications  and other proprietary technologies and processes 
in addition  we have built the manufacturing capacity necessary to produce clinical grade aav vectors and our other dna based treatments at volumes we believe will support the commercial needs of our current product candidates 
we currently have one development product in phase i clinical trials  coagulin b for the treatment of hemophilia b 
we have also submitted an ind to the fda to initiate a phase i dose escalation clinical trial for a second development product  av  for the treatment of parkinson s disease  and are currently responding to a request for more information from the fda 
the pace of clinical progress for both development products has been impacted by factors that were unpredictable  including a lengthy and complex regulatory review process by the fda and the timeliness of recruiting and screening volunteers and coordinating the treatment of a sufficient number of qualified patients in our trials 
these and other factors will continue to have a significant effect on the timing and financial cost of the development of our products 
we are a development stage company and have primarily supported the financial needs of our research and development activities since our inception through public offerings and private placements of our equity securities and will continue to seek additional future funding through similar financings  when market conditions allow 
we have not received any revenue from the sale of our products in development  and we do not anticipate generating revenue from the sale of products in the foreseeable future 
we expect our source of revenue  if any  for the next several years to consist of payments under collaborative arrangements with third parties  government grants  and license fees 
we have incurred losses since our inception and expect to incur substantial losses over the next several years due to lack of any substantial revenue and the continuation of our ongoing and planned research and development efforts  including preclinical studies and clinical trials 
there can be no assurance that we will successfully develop  commercialize  manufacture  or market our product candidates or ever achieve or sustain product revenues for profitability 
at december  we had an accumulated deficit of million and cash  cash equivalents  available for sale securities  and restricted investments of approximately million 
we believe that our capital resources at december  will be adequate to fund our current operating needs over the next three to four years 
in august  we changed our fiscal year end from june to december  beginning with the six months ended december  critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments related to revenue recognition  valuation of investments in financial instruments  impairment of property and equipment  and research and development expenses 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
while our significant accounting policies are more fully described under note in the notes to our financial statements  we believe the following accounting policies are critical to the process of making significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue associated with up front license  technology access and research and development funding payments under collaborative agreements ratably over the relevant periods specified in the agreements  generally the development phase 
this development phase can be defined as a specified period of time  however  in certain cases  the collaborative agreement specifies a development phase that culminates with milestone objectives but does not have a fixed date and requires us to estimate the time period over which to recognize this revenue 
our estimated time periods are based on management s estimate of the time required to achieve a particular development milestone considering level of effort and stage of development 
if our estimate of the development phase time period increases  the amount of revenue we recognize related to up front license and technology access fees for a given period will decrease 
we recognize non refundable product license fees  including fees associated with research license agreements  for which we have no further performance obligations  and no continuing involvement requirements  on the earlier of the dates on when the payments are received or when collection is assured 
valuation of investments in financial instruments we carry investments in financial instruments at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss in stockholders equity 
our investment portfolio does not include equity securities or derivative financial instruments that could subject us to material market risk  however  we do invest in corporate obligations that subject us to varying levels of credit risk 
we consider an impairment of a financial instrument to be other than temporary if the fair value of the financial instrument has declined below its carrying value for a period in excess of six consecutive months or if the decline is due to a significant adverse event  such that the carrying amount of the investment may not be fully recoverable 
we write down an other than temporary decline in fair value of a financial instrument with a charge in net loss 
the determination of whether a decline in fair value is other than temporary requires significant judgment  and could have a material impact on our balance sheet and results of operations 
our management reviews the securities within our portfolio for other than temporary declines in value with our investment advisor on a regular basis 
we have not had any write downs for other than temporary declines in the fair value of our financial instruments since our inception 
at december   the carrying value of our financial instruments was million in available for sale securities and million in restricted investments 
impairment of property and equipment we have invested significant amounts on construction for improvements to our research and development facilities  with the largest portion of our spending made to modify manufacturing facilities that are intended to comply with requirements of government mandated manufacturing rules for pharmaceutical production 
these assets could be subject to write down for impairment in the event that our facilities are deemed to fail to comply with these government mandated policies and procedures or if the products for which the manufacturing facilities have been constructed do not receive regulatory approval 
these assets could also be subject to write down to the extent that facilities could be idled due to the adoption of operating efficiencies for an other than temporary period  resulting in excess capacity 
the determination of whether an impairment in use is other than temporary requires significant judgment  and could have a material effect on our balance sheet and our results of operations 
we have not had any write downs for impairments in the fair value of our property and equipment since our inception 
at december   the carrying value of our property and equipment was million 
research and development expenses our research and development expenses include salaries and benefits costs  fees for contractors and consultants  fees to collaborators for preclinical research studies  patient treatment costs related to clinical trials and related clinical manufacturing costs  license fees for use of third party intellectual property rights  and an allocation of facilities and overhead costs 
research and development expenses consist of costs incurred for drug and product development  manufacturing  clinical activities  discovery research  screening and identification of drug candidates  and preclinical studies 
all such costs are charged to research and development expenses as incurred  with the costs of materials and other supplies charged to research and development expense upon receipt 
clinical development costs are a significant component of research and development expenses 
we accrue costs for clinical trial activities performed by third parties based upon estimates of the percentage of work completed over the life of the individual study in accordance with agreements established with the clinical trial sites 
we determine our estimates through discussion with internal clinical personnel and outside service providers as to the progress or stage of completion of trials or services and the agreed upon fee to be paid for such services 
these estimates may or may not match the actual services performed by the organizations as determined by patient enrollment levels and related activities 
we monitor clinical trial activities to the extent possible  however  if we underestimated activity levels associated with various studies at a given point in time  we could record significant research and development expenses in future periods 
results of operations as a result of the change from a june fiscal year to a calendar year effective december   which resulted in a six month transition period  it is difficult to compare our results of operations  or any of the components of our results of operations  between the full years ended december  and  and the six month transition period ended december  therefore  in order to best understand the trends in our results of operations  primarily expenses  over the most recent reporting periods  we have included analyses of variances between the twelve month periods ended december    and using an unaudited twelve month period ended december  revenue in thousands  except percentages revenue percentage increase over prior period in  revenue primarily consisted of the recognition of  of deferred revenue from the million payment received from bayer in march this payment from bayer is being recognized ratably over the estimated development period of our hemophilia b product candidate  which was estimated at five years from the date of the payment  resulting in revenue recognition of  per quarter beginning with the second quarter of research license fees totaled   and  respectively  in   and research license agreements allow the licensee to make or use products using our patented aav technologies for research purposes only  and do not allow for the use of our technologies in products for commercial sale 
these licenses usually include initiation fees and annual maintenance fees 
royalty revenue totaled   and  respectively  in  and  all of which were attributed to a single royalty license that was entered into in july  which allows for the development  manufacture  use and commercial sale of products using our patented aav technologies 
revenues in included grant revenue of  consisting of reimbursements under a grant from the national institutes of health nih  which expired on march  we do not expect to earn significant revenues from  or to be party to  any new nih grants for the foreseeable future 
in the event that we enter a phase ii iii clinical trial with our coagulin b product  we expect to earn additional revenues in connection with our collaboration agreement with bayer  including a milestone payment for initiating a phase ii iii clinical trial and reimbursements for the costs of manufacturing aav vector used in the clinical trials 
under the terms of the agreement  bayer will also pay for third party costs of the clinical trials 
however  we cannot be certain when or if we will enter a phase ii iii clinical trial 
we do not expect to earn any other significant revenues for the foreseeable future 
research and development expenses our research and development expenses can be divided into two primary functions  costs to support research and preclinical development and costs to support preparation for and implementation of human clinical trials 
research and preclinical development costs include activities associated with general research and exploration  animal studies  production of vector for use by external collaborators in general research and exploration  and development of processes to translate research achievements into commercial scale capabilities 
clinical development costs include activities associated with preparing for regulatory approvals  maintaining regulated and controlled processes  manufacturing vector for use in human clinical trials  and supporting patient enrollment and patient administration within clinical trials 
during the second half of  we took strategic steps to focus the work of our research and development organizations on the clinical development of our lead product programs 
this included a reduction in staff and the implementation of other operational efficiencies without limiting our production capabilities 
our research and development staff count grew from approximately at the beginning of to approximately at december   and continued to rise to a peak of approximately in september the impact of the workforce reduction in october reduced that staff level to at december  at december   our staff count dedicated to research and development activities totaled during  our research and preclinical development expenses included activities for our development programs for hemophilia  parkinson s disease  neuropathic pain  and other neurological targets  and our clinical development expenses included activities to support our development programs for coagulin b and av during  our research and preclinical development expenses were focused on our development programs for hemophilia and parkinson s disease  and other cardiac and neurological targets  and our clinical development expenses were focused on our development programs for coagulin b and av during  our research and preclinical development expenses were primarily focused on our development programs for hemophilia and parkinson s disease  and our clinical development expenses were focused on our development programs for coagulin b 
we estimate that the costs associated with these two categories approximate the following in thousands year ended december  year ended december  unaudited twelve months ended december  research and preclinical development clinical development total research and development expenses because a significant percentage of our research and development resources are dedicated to activities that focus on fundamental platform technologies that may be used in many different product applications  including production and administration techniques  the majority of our costs are not directly attributed to individual development programs 
decisions regarding our project management and resource allocation are primarily based on interpretations of scientific data  rather than cost allocations 
our estimates of costs between research and preclinical development and clinical development are primarily based on staffing roles within our research and development departments 
as such  costs allocated to specific projects may not necessarily reflect the actual costs of those efforts and  therefore  we do not generally evaluate actual costs incurred information on a project by project basis 
in addition  we are unable to estimate the future costs to completion for any specific projects 
comparison of the years ended december  and the decrease of  in our research and preclinical development expenses for  compared to  was primarily due to changes in costs for the following lower materials expenses of million  reflecting the impact of decreased consumption of materials to produce our aav vectors and support our on going research which resulted from our lower staff levels in when compared to the staff level for most of and the benefits of operating efficiencies we have implemented over the last two years  lower personnel related expenses of  primarily reflecting the impact of our lower staff levels in after the workforce reduction that occurred in october  and lower consulting expenses of  reflecting decreased involvement by third party service providers to support our in house research  partially offset by higher expenditures for services from third party collaborators associated with our preclinical animal studies of  primarily related to our work with parkinson s disease  higher depreciation expenses of  reflecting the full year impact of newly constructed facilities that were placed in service in the second half of for general and animal research  and higher other facilities related expenses of  related to the rise in costs under the new building lease that went into effect in and generally higher maintenance costs 
the decrease of million in our clinical development expenses for  compared to  was primarily due to changes in costs for the following lower personnel related expenses of million  primarily reflecting the impact of our lower staff levels in after the workforce reduction in october  lower materials expenses of  reflecting lower levels of material consumed for the production of clinical grade material due to the delayed needs of our coagulin b clinical trial  as well as general benefits from manufacturing efficiencies adopted over the last two years for the production of our aav vectors  lower expenditures of  to third party collaborators associated with treating and monitoring subjects in our clinical trial  reflecting the delay in treating coagulin b patients in  and lower consulting and validation services expenses of  primarily in connection with regulatory and quality assurance process improvements and validation of new cgmp facilities that were completed in  partially offset by  higher license origination fees of  higher depreciation expenses of  reflecting the full year impact of newly constructed facilities that were placed in service in the second half of for cgmp manufacturing  and higher other facilities related expenses of  related to the rise in costs under the new building lease that went into effect in and generally higher maintenance costs 
comparison of the year ended december  and unaudited twelve month period ended december  the increase of million in our research and preclinical development expenses for  compared to  was primarily due to changes in costs for the following higher expenditures for services from third party collaborators associated with our preclinical animal studies of  primarily related to our work with parkinson s disease  higher personnel related expenses of  reflecting rising staff levels throughout most of  and higher depreciation and amortization expenses of  reflecting the impact of new facilities placed in service during the year  partially offset by  lower other overall costs of  the increase of  in our clinical development expenses for  compared to  was primarily due to changes in costs for the following higher expenditures to third party collaborators associated with treating and monitoring subjects in our coagulin b clinical trial of  reflecting the increase in the number of patients treated in compared to  higher depreciation and other facilities related expenses of  due to new facilities placed in service in  higher validation services of  in connection with the validation of new cgmp facilities that were completed in  and higher personnel related expenses of  reflecting rising staff levels throughout most of  partially offset by  lower materials expenses of  reflecting the benefit of manufacturing efficiencies adopted in for the production of our aav vectors  lower recruiting and other related costs of  and lower license milestone payments of  total research and development expenses in were lower than management expected due to delays in treating new patients in our coagulin b clinical trial 
we recognize that regulatory approvals and patient scheduling and coordination will continue to be factors that could cause delays in the progress in our clinical trials  however  we do expect to expand our clinical trial activities in as we move forward with our hemophilia b clinical trial and  assuming we obtain final regulatory approval of our ind application for av from the fda  as we begin to enroll patients in a new parkinson s disease clinical trial 
as a result  we expect our total research and development spending to rise in above our levels as we conduct our clinical trial activities and to the extent we enhance our manufacturing capabilities and expand our research and development programs for additional hematological and neurological diseases 
general and administrative expenses in thousands  except percentages general and administrative expenses percentage increase over prior period the decrease in general and administrative expenses between and was primarily related to lower personnel related costs of approximately  reflecting lower staff levels as a result of the october workforce reduction  lower depreciation and facilities related expenses related to the reduction in allocation of space for our non research and development activities of approximately  and lower litigation related legal fees of approximately  as a result of the settlement of our lawsuit with rct 
these decreases were partially offset by higher patent related legal fees of approximately  and higher expenses for other professional services and information services of approximately  the increase in general and administrative expenses between and was primarily due to approximately  in higher personnel related costs due to the increase in headcount in prior to our october staff workforce reduction   in higher legal fees related to the rct litigation   in higher corporate expenses  including insurance and information services  and  in higher depreciation and overhead expenses 
these higher costs were partially offset by a  decline in other corporate expenses  primarily for professional services  due to the fact that in we had two audits and prepared and filed two annual reports as a result of the change of our fiscal year end from june to december in that year 
we expect our general and administrative expenses for to remain steady or increase slightly from levels 
interest income in thousands  except percentages interest income percentage increase over prior period almost all of our interest income is generated from our investments in high grade marketable securities of government and corporate debt 
the declines in interest income between and and between and  were primarily due to the general decline in market interest rates between those periods and the decrease in outstanding interest bearing cash and securities balances due to resources having been used to fund our on going operations and finance construction of additional research and development facilities 
adoption of recently issued accounting standards in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 or fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
fin requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
in december  the fasb issued fin r  a revision to fin fin r provides a broad deferral of the latest date by which all public entities must apply fin to certain variable interest entities to the first reporting period ending after march  we do not expect the adoption of fin to have a material impact on our financial position  cash flows or results of operations 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity  which establishes standards for how an issuer of financial instruments classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
it requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability or in some circumstances  as an asset if  at inception  the monetary value of the obligation is based solely or predominantly on a a fixed monetary amount known at inception  b variations in something other than the fair value of the issuer s equity shares or c variations inversely related to changes in the fair value of the issuer s equity shares 
sfas no 
is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  the adoption of sfas no 
did not have an impact on our financial statements 
deferred income tax assets in accordance with fas  accounting for income taxes  which is described in the notes to our financial statements  we have calculated a deferred tax asset based on the potential future tax benefit we may be able to realize in future periods as a result of the significant tax losses experienced since our inception 
however  the value of such deferred tax asset must be calculated using the tax rates expected to apply to the taxable income in the years in which such income occurs 
since we have no history of earnings  and cannot reliably predict when we might create taxable income  if at all  we have recorded a valuation allowance for the full amount of our calculated deferred tax asset 
liquidity and capital resources since our inception in  cash expenditures have significantly exceeded our revenue 
we have funded our operations primarily through public offerings and private placements of our equity securities 
subsequent to our initial public offering in may  through december we raised million from private placements and public offerings of our common stock and warrants to purchase our common stock 
pursuant to our collaboration agreement for coagulin b with bayer corporation  we received net proceeds of million from the sale of our common stock to bayer ag in february and we received million in research support from bayer corporation in march also  during the three years ended december   we raised an additional million as a result of exercises of previously issued warrants and options to purchase our common stock 
the timing of and amounts realized from the exercise of these warrants and options are determined by the decisions of the respective warrant and option holders  and are not controlled by us 
therefore  funds raised from exercises of stock options and warrants in past periods should not be considered an indication of additional funds to be raised in the future periods 
in addition to funding our operations through sales of our common stock  we have attempted to contain costs and reduce cash flow requirements by renting scientific equipment and facilities  contracting with third parties to conduct research and development and using consultants  where appropriate 
we expect to incur additional future expenses  resulting in significant additional losses  as we continue to expand our research and development activities and undertake additional preclinical studies and clinical trials of our gene therapy product candidates 
we also expect to incur substantial additional expenses relating to the filing  prosecution  maintenance  defense and enforcement of patent and other intellectual property claims 
at december   we had cash  cash equivalents  available for sale securities  and restricted investments  of approximately million  compared to approximately million at december  and million at december  at december   and  million  million  and million  respectively  was pledged to secure certain long term liabilities 
at december   these long term liabilities include million for our line of credit  million for equipment operating leases  and approximately  for letters of credit that we entered into in may which serve as security deposits on our building lease 
our restricted investments are reported as a long term asset and would not be considered a current source of additional liquidity 
the following are contractual commitments at december  associated with debt obligations  lease obligations  and contractual commitments to fund third party research in thousands payments due by period contractual commitment total less than year years years after years revolving line of credit operating leases research funding for third parties total in june  we amended the terms of our million revolving line of credit which had been put in place with wells fargo bank in june to provide support for construction related activities 
under the terms of the amendment  the expiration date of the borrowing was extended from june  to june   thereby deferring the timetable to repay the principal borrowed for two years 
the debt instrument bears interest at a floating rate based on the london inter bank offered rate  which is reset in three month increments after the date of each drawdown  until such expiration 
as of december  and  the average annual rate of interest charged on the borrowing was approximately and  respectively 
also under the terms of this agreement  we pledged a portion of our portfolio of available for sale securities as collateral and have identified the amount of the pledged securities as restricted investments on our balance sheets 
the amount of the pledged securities is equal to the amount of utilized borrowing capacity on the line of credit 
at december   we had borrowed million from the line of credit and had reserved the remaining million in borrowing capacity to secure a letter of credit in connection with the property lease entered into in november as a result  at december   we have no more borrowing capacity under this facility 
as collateral for the revolving line of credit  our restricted investments would not be considered a current source of additional liquidity 
the total amount of restricted investments at december   including the portion of our investment portfolio that is pledged as collateral for this line of credit and other securities that have been pledged to secure equipment operating leases and other letters of credit  was million 
our current office and facility includes approximately  square feet of space 
of this  approximately  square feet of space is leased through may and approximately  square feet of space is leased through november payments scheduled under these lease commitments are included in the table above under operating leases 
we enter into commitments to fund collaborative research and clinical work performed by third parties 
while these contracts are cancelable by either party  we expect the research studies and clinical work to be completed as defined in the terms of the agreements  and all amounts paid when due 
payments scheduled to be made under these contracts are included in the table above under research funding for third parties 
for the years ended december  and  net cash used in operating activities was million and million  respectively 
the change in cash used in operating activities between and was primarily due to the reduction in our net loss due to the decrease in research and development costs  as a result of our adoption of operating efficiencies and the impact of our october workforce reduction discussed above  and the receipt of a million payment from bayer corporation in march  which was recorded as deferred revenue 
for the years ended december  and june   net cash used in operating activities was million and million  respectively 
the change in cash used in operating activities between these two comparable periods was primarily due to the increase in our net loss as a result of the increase in our research and development costs due to increased staff and expanded product development programs  partially offset by a decrease in accrued interest and an increase in accounts payable and other liabilities 
during the six month period ended december  and unaudited six month period ended december   net cash used in operating activities was million and million  respectively 
the change in cash used in operating activities between the comparable six month periods was primarily due to the increase in our net loss as a result of the increase in our research and development costs due to increased staff and expanded product development programs  partially offset by a decrease in accrued interest and an increase in accounts payable and other liabilities 
for the year ended december   net cash provided by investing and financing activities was million and  respectively 
the cash provided by investing activities consisted of maturities  net of purchases  of available for sale securities of million  which we used to fund our operating activities  offset in part by purchases of property and equipment of  and increases in restricted investments of  the cash provided by financing activities consisted of proceeds from the exercise of stock options and warrants during the year 
for the year ended december   net cash provided by investing and financing activities was million and  respectively 
the cash provided by investing activities consisted of maturities  net of purchases  of available for sale securities of million  which we used to fund our operating activities  offset in part by purchases of property and equipment of million and increases in restricted investments of million 
the cash provided by financing activities consisted of proceeds from the exercise of stock options and warrants during the year 
during the six month transition period ended december   approximately million and million  were provided by investing and financing activities  respectively 
the cash provided by investing activities consisted of maturities  net of purchases  of available for sale securities  which we used to fund our operating activities  offset in part by purchases of property and equipment of million and increases in restricted investments of million 
the cash provided by financing activities primarily consisted of additional borrowings from our revolving line of credit to provide funding for construction related activities 
for the year ended june   approximately million was provided by financing activities and million was used by investing activities 
the cash provided by financing activities  which was used in investing activities and to fund our operating activities  primarily consisted of proceeds from the issuance of common stock during a public offering in november and in connection to our collaboration agreement with bayer in march the cash used by investing activities consisted of purchases  net of maturities  of available for sale securities of million  purchases of property and equipment of million and increases in restricted investments of million 
we believe we will continue to require substantial additional funding in order to complete the research and development activities currently contemplated and to commercialize our proposed products 
we believe that our capital resources at december  will be adequate to fund our current operating needs over the next three to four years 
however  this forward looking statement is based upon our current plans and assumptions regarding our future operating and capital requirements  which may change 
our future operating and capital requirements will depend on many factors  including continued scientific progress in research and development programs  the scope and results of preclinical studies and clinical trials  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  the costs involved in filing  prosecuting and enforcing patents claims and other intellectual property rights  competing technological developments  the cost of manufacturing scale up  the costs of commercialization activities  and other factors which may not be within our control 
we intend to continue to seek additional funding through public or private equity or debt financing  when market conditions allow  or through additional collaborative arrangements with corporate partners 
if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities  there may be further dilution to existing stockholders 
we cannot assure our investors that we will be able to enter into such financing arrangements on acceptable terms or at all 
without such additional funding  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of  or eliminate one or more of our research or development programs 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and our long term debt 
we do not hold derivative financial investments  derivative commodity investments or other financial investments or engage in foreign currency hedging or other transactions that exposes us to other market risks 
none of our investments are held for trading purposes 
our investment objectives are focused on preservation of principal and liquidity 
by policy  we manage our exposure to market risks by limiting investments to high quality issuers and highly liquid instruments with effective maturities of less than three years  and an average aggregate portfolio duration of approximately one year 
our entire portfolio is classified as available for sale and  as of december   consisted of approximately fixed rate securities and variable rate securities 
this compares to approximately fixed rate securities and variable rate securities at december  we have evaluated the risk associated with our portfolios of investments in marketable securities and have deemed this market risk to be immaterial 
if market interest rates were to increase by basis points  or  from their december  levels  we estimate that the fair value of our securities portfolio would decline by approximately million 
our estimated exposure at december  is lower than our estimated million exposure at december  due to the reduction in size of our overall portfolio 
the modeling technique used measures duration risk sensitivity to estimate the potential change in fair value arising from an immediate hypothetical shift in market rates and quantifies the ending fair market value including principal and accrued interest 
our long term debt includes a million revolving line of credit due june   of which we have drawn down million in cash that will need to be repaid 
interest charged on the borrowing is based on libor and is reset in three month increments based on the date of each original drawdown 
as of december   the average annual rate of interest charged on the borrowing was approximately
