table of contents as of august   we had contracts with health plans to provide disease management and care enhancement program services to their eligible members and also had contracts to provide our services at hospitals 
we have seen increasing demand for our care enhancement and disease management services from health plans administrative services only aso customers 
aso customers are typically self insured employers for which our health plan customers do not assume risk but provide primarily administrative claim and health network access services 
signed contracts between these self insured employers and our health plan customers are incorporated in our contracts with our health plan customers  and these program eligible members are included in the actual lives under management  when appropriate 
highlights of fiscal performance revenues increased over fiscal net income increased over fiscal actual lives under management increased from the end of fiscal to the end of fiscal  which included a increase in aso actual lives under management

we undertake no obligation to update or revise any such forward looking statements 

table of contents critical accounting policies we describe our accounting policies in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
we prepare the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which require management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosures at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results may differ from those estimates 
we believe the following accounting policies are the most critical in understanding the judgments that we use in preparing our financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
revenue recognition we generally determine our contract fees by multiplying a contractually negotiated rate per health plan member per month pmpm by the number of health plan members covered by the company s services during the month 
we set the pmpm rates during contract negotiations with customers based on the value we expect our programs to create and a sharing of that value between the customer and the company 
in some contracts  the pmpm rate may differ between the health plan s lines of business eg  preferred provider organizations ppo  health maintenance organizations hmo  medicare choice 
contracts generally range from three to seven years with provisions for subsequent renewal 
some contracts provide that a portion up to of our fees may be refundable to the customer performance based if our programs do not achieve  when compared to a baseline year  a targeted percentage reduction in the customer s health care costs and selected clinical and or other criteria that focus on improving the health of the members 
approximately of revenues recorded during the year ended august  were performance based and are subject to final reconciliation 
we anticipate that this percentage will fluctuate due to the timing of data reconciliation  which varies according to contract terms  revenue recognition associated with performance based fees  and the level of performance based fees in new contracts 
a limited number of contracts also provide opportunities for us to receive incentive bonuses in excess of the contractual pmpm rate if we exceed contractual performance targets 
we bill our customers each month for the entire amount of the fees contractually due for the prior month s enrollment  which typically includes the amount  if any  that is performance based and may be subject to refund should we not meet performance targets 
contractually  we cannot bill for any incentive bonuses until after contract settlement 
we recognize revenue as follows we recognize the fixed portion of the monthly fees as revenue during the period we perform our services  we recognize the performance based portion of the monthly fees based on our performance to date in the contract year  and we recognize additional incentive bonuses based on our performance to date in the contract year  to the extent we consider such amounts collectible 
we assess our level of performance based on medical claims and other data that the health plan customer is contractually required to supply each month 
a minimum of four to six months data is typically required for us to measure performance 
in assessing our performance  we may include estimates such as medical claims incurred but not reported and a health plan s medical cost trend 
table of contents compared to a baseline year 
in addition  we may also provide contractual reserves  when appropriate  for billing adjustments at contract reconciliation 
if data from the health plan is insufficient or incomplete to measure performance  or interim performance measures indicate that we are not meeting performance targets  we do not recognize performance based fees subject to refund as revenues but instead record them in a current liability account contract billings in excess of earned revenue 
if we do not meet performance levels by the end of the contract year  we are contractually obligated to refund some or all of the performance based fees 
we would only reverse revenues that we had already recognized if performance to date in the contract year  previously above targeted levels  dropped below targeted levels due to subsequent adverse performance and or adjustments in contractual reserves 
during the settlement process under a contract  which generally occurs six to eight months after the end of a contract year  we settle any performance based fees and reconcile health care claims and clinical data 
data reconciliation differences  for which we provide contractual allowances until we reach agreement with respect to identified issues  can arise between the customer and us due to health plan data deficiencies  omissions  and or data discrepancies 
impairment of intangible assets and goodwill in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 we review goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
if we determine that the carrying value of goodwill is impaired based upon an impairment review  we calculate any impairment using a fair value based goodwill impairment test as required by sfas no 
fair value is the amount at which the asset could be bought or sold in a current transaction between two willing parties 
we estimate fair value using a number of techniques  including quoted market prices or valuations by third parties  present value techniques based on estimates of cash flows  or multiples of earnings or revenues performance measures 
we amortize other identifiable intangible assets  such as acquired technologies and customer contracts  on the straight line method over their estimated useful lives  except for trade names  which have an indefinite life and are not subject to amortization 
we review intangible assets not subject to amortization on an annual basis or more frequently whenever events or circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired 
we assess the potential impairment of intangible assets subject to amortization whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values may not be recoverable 
if we determine that the carrying value of other identifiable intangible assets may not be recoverable  we calculate any impairment using an estimate of the asset s fair value based on the projected net cash flows expected to result from that asset  including eventual disposition 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill and or other intangible assets associated with our acquired businesses are impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
business strategy our primary strategy is to develop new and to expand existing relationships with health plans to provide disease management and care enhancement services  including assisting these health plans in 
table of contents creating value for their large self insured customers 
we plan to use our scaleable state of the art care enhancement centers and medical information content and technologies to gain a competitive advantage in delivering our disease management and care enhancement services 
in addition  we expect to continue adding services to our product mix that extend our programs beyond a chronic disease focus and provide care enhancement services to individuals who currently have  or face the risk of developing  one or more additional conditions 
we believe that we can achieve improvements in care  and therefore significant cost savings  by providing care enhancement programs to members with these additional selected diseases and conditions  which will enable us to address a larger percentage of a health plan s population and total health care costs 
we anticipate that we will incur significant costs during fiscal to enhance and expand our clinical programs and data reporting systems  enhance our information technology support  integrate statusone s information systems  and open additional care enhancement centers as needed 
we may add some of these new capabilities and technologies through strategic alliances with other entities  one or more of which we may make minority investments in or acquire for stock or cash 
business acquisitions on september   we acquired statusone health systems  inc statusone  a provider of health management services for high risk populations of health plans and integrated systems nationwide through the merger of our wholly owned subsidiary with and into statusone in accordance with the terms of an agreement and plan of merger the merger agreement 
the addition of statusone expands our product offerings and provides additional opportunities for initiating and expanding total population care management programs with health plans 
we paid an aggregate purchase price for statusone of approximately million  which we funded through a million term loan the term loan and cash of million 
at the closing  we delivered million of the purchase price into an escrow account under the terms and conditions of a separate escrow agreement to secure certain obligations of the former stockholders under the terms of the merger agreement 
subsequent to fiscal year end  all conditions and obligations of the escrow agreement were satisfied  and the million was distributed in accordance with the terms of the escrow agreement 
the former stockholders of statusone received million  and we received the remaining million 
pursuant to an earn out agreement executed in connection with the acquisition of statusone the earn out agreement  we were obligated to pay the former stockholders of statusone up to million in additional purchase price  payable either in cash or common stock at our discretion  if statusone achieved certain revenue targets during the one year period immediately following the acquisition the earn out period 
because statusone did not achieve the revenue targets established in the earn out agreement  we did not pay any additional purchase price related to the earn out agreement 
the purchase price was preliminarily allocated to the related assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair values and is subject to adjustments  primarily related to any additional purchase price attributable to statusone s results during the earn out period and settlement of the escrow 
the purchase price paid in excess of the fair value of identifiable net assets was million 

table of contents results of operations the following table shows the components of the statements of operations for the years ended august   and expressed as a percentage of revenues 
year ended august  revenues cost of services gross margin selling  general and administrative expenses depreciation and amortization interest expense income before income taxes income tax expense net income revenues revenues increased and  respectively  for fiscal and fiscal over the prior fiscal years primarily due to increases in new contracts  increases in new programs and increased membership in existing contracts  and the acquisition of statusone on september  excluding statusone revenues of million in fiscal  revenues would have increased in fiscal compared to fiscal excluding the acquisition of statusone  revenues increased from fiscal to primarily due to an increase in the aso actual lives under management from  at august  to  at august   resulting from increasing demand for our care enhancement services from self insured employers who contract with our health plan customers  existing health plan customers adding new programs  the signing of new health plan contracts during fiscal and  and increased membership in customers existing programs 
in addition  the increase in revenues for fiscal compared to fiscal was also partially attributable to the renegotiation of one contract at the beginning of fiscal for which we did not recognize any revenue in fiscal because we were unable to measure performance due to contracting terms and outcomes measurement provisions unique to this contract 
revenues increased from fiscal to primarily due to existing health plan customers adding new programs  the signing of new health plan contracts during fiscal and  and growth in our aso actual lives under management from approximately  at the end of fiscal to  at the end of fiscal  resulting from increasing demand for our care enhancement services from self insured employers who contract with our health plan customers 
we anticipate that fiscal revenues will increase over fiscal revenues primarily due to the expansion of existing contracts  increasing demand for our care enhancement services from self insured employers who contract with our health plan customers  and anticipated new health plan contracts 
we also anticipate that the level of contract performance incentive bonus revenues will 
table of contents decline from the million recorded in fiscal as we have restructured existing contracts in the last two fiscal years to eliminate incentive bonus opportunities in return for lower performance based fee risk  longer contract terms  and more programs 
cost of services cost of services as a percentage of revenues decreased to for fiscal compared to for fiscal excluding contract performance incentive bonus revenues  which decreased from million for fiscal to million for fiscal  cost of services as a percentage of revenues would have decreased to from for fiscal and  respectively  primarily as a result of increased capacity utilization  economies of scale  and productivity enhancements  as well as a lower employee bonus accrual in fiscal over fiscal because we did not achieve certain internal targets in fiscal on which the employee bonus was based 
cost of services as a percentage of revenues decreased to for fiscal  compared to for fiscal excluding contract performance incentive bonus revenues  which increased million for fiscal compared to fiscal  cost of services as a percentage of revenues would have decreased to from for fiscal and  respectively  primarily as a result of increased capacity utilization  economies of scale  and productivity enhancements 
we anticipate that fiscal cost of services will increase over fiscal primarily as a result of increased operating staff required for expected increases in demand for our services  increased indirect staff costs associated with the continuing development and implementation of our care enhancement services  and increases in information technology and other support staff and costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased to for fiscal compared to for fiscal excluding contract performance incentive bonus revenues  which decreased million for fiscal compared to fiscal  selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues would have decreased to for fiscal from for fiscal  primarily due to a decrease in costs related to marketing and branding campaigns  partially offset by a million increase in stock based compensation expense resulting from the grant  which was subject to stockholder approval  of stock options to two new directors of the company in june such approval was obtained at the annual meeting of stockholders in january  at which time the options were issued 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased to for fiscal compared to for fiscal excluding contract performance incentive bonus revenues  which increased million for fiscal compared to fiscal  selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues would have decreased to from for fiscal and  respectively  primarily because of our ability to more effectively leverage our selling  general and administrative expenses as a result of growth in our operations 
we anticipate that selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal will increase over fiscal primarily due to increased indirect support costs for our existing and anticipated new and expanded health plan contracts 

table of contents depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense for fiscal increased over fiscal primarily due to amortization expense related to statusone intangible assets and increased depreciation and amortization expense associated with equipment  software development  leasehold improvements  and computer related capital expenditures 
we made these capital expenditures to enhance our health plan information technology capabilities  open two new care enhancement centers  and expand our corporate office and one existing care enhancement center during fiscal depreciation and amortization expense for fiscal increased over fiscal primarily due to increased depreciation and amortization expense associated with equipment  software development  and computer related capital expenditures 
we made these capital expenditures to enhance our health plan information technology capabilities  open a new care enhancement center  and expand our corporate office and two existing care enhancement centers during fiscal we anticipate that depreciation and amortization expense for fiscal will increase over fiscal primarily as a result of additional capital expenditures associated with expected increases in demand for our services and growth and improvement in our information technology capabilities 
interest expense interest expense for fiscal increased million compared to fiscal primarily due to interest costs related to a million term loan incurred in connection with the acquisition of statusone described more fully in liquidity and capital resources below  offset slightly by decreased fees associated with a reduction in outstanding letters of credit to support certain contractual requirements to repay fees in the event we do not perform at target levels and do not repay the fees due in accordance with the contract terms 
interest expense for fiscal increased million compared to fiscal the increase was primarily due to fees associated with an increase in outstanding letters of credit 
we obtained these letters of credit to support certain contractual requirements to repay fees in the event we do not perform at established target levels and do not repay the fees due in accordance with the terms of certain contracts 
interest expense also increased because we wrote off certain deferred loan costs associated with our previous credit facility 
income tax expense the company s effective tax rate decreased to for fiscal compared to for fiscal and  primarily as a result of the company s geographic mix of earnings  which involves the impact of state income taxes  and other factors 
the differences between the statutory federal income tax rate of and the company s effective tax rate are due primarily to the impact of state income taxes and certain non deductible expenses for income tax purposes 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents increased million during fiscal to million at august  from million at august  the increase was primarily due to cash flow from operations and proceeds from borrowings under our credit facility related to the statusone acquisition  partially offset by capital expenditures  business acquisitions  and payments of long term debt 

table of contents operating activities for fiscal generated million in cash flow from operations compared to million for fiscal the increase in operating cash flow of million resulted primarily from an increase in net income as well as increased adjustments to net income attributable to stock option exercise tax benefits  increases in non cash expenses  and an increase in accounts payable associated with capital expenditures for upgrades to hardware in support of core business functions 
these increases to cash flow from operations were partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable primarily due to growth in revenues and a decrease in accrued salaries and benefits primarily related to the payment in fiscal of fiscal employee bonuses 
investing activities during fiscal used million in cash primarily due to the acquisition of statusone  the opening of two new care enhancement centers  the expansion of an existing care enhancement center  the expansion of the corporate office  and investments in our health plan information technology capabilities 
financing activities for fiscal provided million in cash primarily due to net proceeds from borrowings under our credit facility related to the acquisition of statusone and the exercise of stock options  offset by payments on long term debt and debt issuance costs 
on september   in conjunction with the acquisition of statusone  we entered into a revolving credit and term loan agreement the credit agreement with eight financial institutions 
the credit agreement provides us with up to million in borrowing capacity  including the term loan and a million revolving line of credit  under a credit facility that expires on august  the million revolving line of credit provides us with the ability to issue up to million of letters of credit  provided the aggregate amounts outstanding under the revolving line of credit do not exceed million 
as of august   our available line of credit totaled million 
on september   we entered into an interest rate swap agreement to manage our interest rate exposure 
by entering into the interest rate swap agreement we effectively converted million of floating rate debt to a fixed obligation with an interest rate of 
in september  in anticipation of amending and restating our credit agreement  as described below  we unwound the million interest rate swap agreement and recognized a gain of approximately  on october   we entered into a first amended and restated revolving credit loan agreement the amended credit agreement 
the amended credit agreement provides us with up to million in borrowing capacity  including a million sub facility for letters of credit  under a senior revolving credit facility that expires on october  we repaid the outstanding principal of million on the term loan with million in cash and a million draw on the revolving credit facility under the amended credit agreement 
the amended credit agreement requires us to repay the principal on any loans at the maturity date of october  borrowings under the amended credit agreement bear interest  at our option  at the prime rate plus a spread of to or libor plus a spread of to  or a combination thereof 
the amended credit agreement also provides for a fee ranging between and of unused commitments 
substantially all of our assets are pledged as collateral for any borrowings under the credit facility 
the credit agreement contained  and the amended credit agreement contains  similar financial covenants  which require us to maintain  as defined  minimum ratios or levels of i total funded debt to ebitda  ii interest coverage  iii fixed charge coverage  and iv net worth 
the agreements also prohibit the payment of dividends and limits the amount of repurchases of the company s common stock 
as of august   we were in compliance with all of the financial covenant requirements of the credit agreement 

table of contents as of august   there was one letter of credit outstanding under the credit agreement for million to support our requirement to repay fees under one health plan contract in the event we do not perform at established target levels and do not repay the fees due in accordance with the terms of the contract 
we have never had a draw under an outstanding letter of credit 
during fiscal  in conjunction with contractual requirements under one contract beginning on march   we funded an escrow account in the amount of approximately million 
we are required to deposit a percentage of all fees received from this customer during the first year of the contract into the escrow account to be used to repay fees under the contract in the event we do not perform at established target levels 
we believe that cash flow from operating activities  our available cash  and our available credit under the amended credit agreement will continue to enable us to meet our contractual obligations and to fund the current level of growth in our operations for the foreseeable future 
however  if expanding our operations requires significant additional financing resources  such as capital expenditures for technology improvements  additional care enhancement centers and or letters of credit or other forms of financial assurance to guarantee our performance under the terms of new contracts  or to the extent we are required to refund performance based fees pursuant to contract terms  we may need to raise additional capital by expanding our existing credit facility and or issuing debt or equity 
if we face a limited ability to arrange such financing  it may restrict our ability to expand our operations 
in addition  if contract development accelerates or acquisition opportunities arise that would expand our operations  we may need to issue additional debt or equity to provide the funding for these increased growth opportunities 
we may also issue equity in connection with future acquisitions or strategic alliances 
we cannot assure you that we would be able to issue additional debt or equity on terms that would be acceptable to us
