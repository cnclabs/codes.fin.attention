item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general realty income corporation  the monthly dividend company  is a maryland corporation organized to operate as an equity real estate investment trust  commonly referred to as a reit 
our primary business objective is to generate dependable monthly distributions from a consistent and predictable level of funds from operations  or ffo per share 
over the past years  realty income and its predecessors have been acquiring and owning freestanding retail properties that generate rental revenue under long term primarily to year lease agreements 
the monthly distributions are supported by the cash flow from  retail properties leased to regional and national retail chains 
we also seek to increase distributions to stockholders and ffo per share through both active portfolio management and the acquisition of additional properties 
at december   we owned a diversified portfolio of  retail properties  with an occupancy rate of  or  properties occupied of the  properties in the portfolio  leased to different retail chains doing business in separate retail industries  located in states  with over million square feet of leasable space  and with an average leasable retail space of  square feet 
of the  properties in the portfolio   or  are single tenant retail properties and the remaining five are multi tenant properties 
as of december    or  of the  single tenant properties were leased with a weighted average remaining lease term excluding extension options of approximately years 
in addition to our real estate portfolio  at december   our wholly owned subsidiary  crest net lease  inc had invested million in a portfolio of retail properties located in states 
these properties are held for sale 
liquidity and capital resources cash reserves 
realty income is organized to operate as an equity reit that acquires and leases properties and distributes to stockholders  in the form of monthly cash distributions  a substantial portion of its net cash flow generated from leases on its retail properties 
we intend to retain an appropriate amount of cash as working capital 
at december   we had cash and cash equivalents totaling million 
we believe that our cash and cash equivalents on hand  cash provided from operating activities and borrowing capacity is sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future 
we intend  however  to use additional sources of capital to fund property acquisitions and to repay our credit facility 
million bank credit facility 
we have a million revolving  unsecured credit facility that expires in october realty income s current investment grade credit ratings provide for financing under the million credit facility at the london interbank offered rate  commonly referred to as libor  plus basis points with a facility fee of basis points  for all in drawn pricing of basis points over libor 
at february   we had a borrowing capacity of million available on our credit facility and an outstanding balance of million at an effective interest rate of 
the credit facility is expected to be used to acquire additional retail properties and for other corporate purposes 
any additional borrowings will increase our exposure to interest rate risk 
we have no mortgage debt on any of our properties 
universal shelf registration of million 
in december  we filed a universal shelf registration statement with the sec registering the issuance of up to million in aggregate value of common stock  preferred stock and debt securities 
this registration statement was declared effective by the sec in january at february   million remained available for issuance under our universal shelf registration statement 
issuances of common stock in in october  we issued  shares of common stock at a price of per share 
the net proceeds of million were used to repay borrowings under our million acquisition credit facility 
conservative capital structure 
we believe that our stockholders are best served by a conservative capital structure 
therefore  we seek to maintain a conservative debt level on our balance sheet and solid interest and fixed charge coverage ratios 
at february   our total outstanding credit facility borrowings and outstanding notes were million or approximately of our total market capitalization of billion 
we define our total market capitalization at february  as the sum of shares of our common stock outstanding of  multiplied by the last reported sales price of our common stock on the nyse of per share  or billion  liquidation value of the class b preferred stock of million  liquidation value of the class c preferred stock of million  outstanding borrowings of million on our credit facility  and outstanding notes of million 
historically  we have met our long term capital needs through the issuance of common stock  preferred stock and long term unsecured notes 
over the long term  we believe that the majority of our future securities issuances should be in the form of common stock  however  we may issue additional preferred stock or debt securities from time to time 
we may issue common stock when we believe that our share price is at a level that allows for the proceeds of any offering to be accretively invested into additional properties 
in addition  we may issue common stock to permanently finance properties that were financed by our credit facility or debt securities 
however  we cannot assure you that we will have access to the capital markets at terms that are acceptable to us 
credit agency ratings 
we are currently assigned investment grade corporate credit ratings  on our senior unsecured notes  from fitch ratings  moody s investor service  inc and standard poor s rating group 
currently  fitch ratings has assigned a rating of bbb  moody s has assigned a rating of baa and standard poor s has assigned a rating of bbb to our senior notes 
all of these ratings have been assigned a stable outlook 
we also have received credit ratings from the same rating agencies on our preferred stock 
fitch ratings has assigned a rating of bbb  moody s investor service  inc has assigned a rating of baa and standard poor s rating group has assigned a rating of bbb 
all of these ratings have been assigned a stable outlook 
during  our credit ratings were upgraded by both moody s and standard poor s for our unsecured notes and our preferred stock 
the credit ratings assigned to us could change based upon  among other things  our results of operations and financial condition

no off balance sheet arrangements or unconsolidated investment 
realty income and its subsidiaries have no unconsolidated or off balance sheet investments in variable interest entities or off balance sheet financing  nor do we engage in trading activities involving energy or commodity contracts or other derivative instruments 
as we have no joint ventures  off balance sheet entities  or mandatorily redeemable preferred stock  our financial position or results of operations are currently not effected by financial accounting standard board interpretation no

acquisitions during realty income and crest net 
realty income and crest net invested million in aggregate in new properties and properties under development in these properties are located in states and are leased with an initial average lease length of years 
realty income 
realty income invested million in new properties and properties under development with an initial weighted average contractual lease rate of in these properties are located in states and are leased with an initial average lease length of years and will contain approximately million leasable square feet 
included in the investments of real estate by realty income in is million invested in properties acquired before that were under development 
estimated unfunded development costs on realty income and crest net properties under development at december  totaled million 
at december   eight new properties acquired during were leased and under development  pursuant to contracts under which the tenants agreed to develop the properties with development costs funded by realty income or crest net  with rent scheduled to begin at various times during the first nine months of the initial weighted average contractual lease rate on our investments is computed as estimated contractual net operating income in a net leased property this is equal to the base rent or  in the case of properties under development  the estimated base rent under the lease for the first year of each lease  divided by the estimated total costs 
since it is possible that a tenant could default on the payment of contractual rent  we cannot assure you that the actual return on the funds invested will remain at the percentages listed above 
the new properties acquired by realty income are net leased to different retail chains in ten industries automotive collision service  automotive service  automotive tire service  convenience store  equipment rental service  grocery store  home improvement  restaurant  sporting goods and travel plaza 
during  we added two new industries equipment rental service and travel plaza to our portfolio 
we also segregated the automotive tire service industry from the automotive parts industry 
this segregation was made to reflect the different economic characteristics of the two industries 
crest net 
crest net invested million during in new retail properties and properties under development 
investments in existing properties 
in  we capitalized costs of  on existing properties in our portfolio  consisting of  for re leasing costs and  for building improvements sales of investment properties 
during  we sold properties and exchanged excess land parcels from three properties for an aggregate of million  which resulted in a gain of million 
the properties sold consisted of child care facilities  nine restaurants  three home improvement stores  two auto services location  one consumer electronics store and one other property 
the land exchanges were on three convenience store locations 
these gains are included in discontinued operations 
the net proceeds from the sale of these properties were or will be used to repay outstanding indebtedness on our credit facility and to invest in new properties 
crest net property sales 
during  crest net our wholly owned subsidiary sold properties from its inventory for million  which resulted in a gain of million 
crest net s property inventory 
crest net s property inventory at december  and december  totaled million and million  respectively  and is included in real estate held for sale  net  on our consolidated balance sheets 
the financial statements of crest net are consolidated into realty income s financial statements 
all material intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation 
increase in monthly distributions to common stockholders 
we continue our year policy of paying distributions monthly 
monthly distributions per share were increased by in april to  in july to  in october to and in january to 
the increase in january was our th consecutive quarterly increase and th increase since our listing in on the new york stock exchange 
in december  january and february  we declared distributions of per share  which were paid on january   february  and payable on march   respectively 
the monthly distribution of per common share represents a current annualized distribution of per share and an annualized distribution yield of approximately  based on a closing price on february  of 
although we expect to continue our policy of paying monthly distributions  we cannot guarantee that we will maintain the current level of distributions  that we will continue our pattern of increasing distributions per share  or what the actual distribution yield will be for any future period 
credit ratings upgrades 
in november  our credit ratings were upgraded by standard poor s ratings group 
our senior unsecured debt rating was raised to bbb from bbb and our preferred stock rating was raised to bbb from bb  with a stable outlook 
in february  our credit ratings were upgraded by moody s investors service

stock and senior debt purchase program 
in january  our board of directors authorized the purchase of up to million of our outstanding common and preferred shares and senior debt securities 
from time to time since january  we concluded that our share price justified purchasing shares since this provided an attractive return on our investment capital 
we have purchased an aggregate of million of our securities in and we did not purchase any of our securities in or  but may do so from time to time in the future 
results of operations critical accounting policies 
our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
our consolidated financial statements are the basis for our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
completing our consolidated financial statements requires us to make a number of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported values and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements 
we believe that we have made these estimates and assumptions in an appropriate manner in a way that accurately reflects our financial condition 
we continually test and evaluate these estimates and assumptions using our historical knowledge of the business  as well as other factors to ensure that they are reasonable for reporting purposes 
however  actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions 
in order to prepare our consolidated financial statements according to the rules and guidelines set forth by generally accepted accounting principles  many subjective judgments must be made with regard to critical accounting polices 
one of these judgments is our estimate for useful lives in determining depreciation expense for our properties 
depreciation of buildings and improvements is computed using the straight line method over an estimated useful life of years 
if we use a shorter or longer estimated useful life it could have a material impact on our results of operations 
we believe that years is an appropriate estimate of useful life 
no depreciation has been recorded on crest net s properties because they are held for sale 
another significant judgment that must be made is the impairment losses taken on our properties when events or change in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
generally  a provision is made for impairment loss if estimated future operating cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges plus estimated disposition proceeds undiscounted are less than the current book value 
impairment losses are measured as the amount by which the current book value of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
if a property is held for sale  it is carried at the lower of carrying cost or estimated fair value  less cost to sell 
the carrying value of our real estate is the largest component of our consolidated balance sheet 
if events should occur that required us to reduce the carrying value of our real estate by recording provisions for impairment losses  it could have a material impact on our results of operations 
the following is a comparison of our results of operations for the years ended december   and rental revenue 
rental revenue was million for versus million for  an increase of million  or 
rental revenue was million in the increase in rental revenue in compared to is attributable to the retail properties acquired in by realty income  which generated revenue of million  the retail properties acquired in by realty income  which generated revenue of million in compared to million in  an increase of million  same store rents generated on  leased properties owned in all of both and increased by million  or  to million from million 
properties owned by crest net  which generated revenue of million in compared to million in  an increase of million  development properties acquired before that started paying rent in  properties that were vacant during part of or and lease termination settlements generated revenue of million in as compared to million in  a decrease of million  and a decrease in straight line rent of  in as compared to we anticipate that our rental revenue from the properties acquired in will increase significantly in since the majority of these properties were acquired in the fourth quarter 
of the  properties in the portfolio at december    or  are single tenant properties and the remaining properties are multi tenant properties 
of the  single tenant properties   or  were net leased with a weighted average remaining lease term excluding extension options of approximately years at december  of our  leased single tenant properties   or  were under leases that provide for increases in rents through base rent increases tied to a consumer price index with adjustment ceilings  overage rent based on a percentage of the tenants gross sales  fixed increases  or a combination of two or more of the above rent provisions 
percentage rent  which is included in rental revenue  was million in  million in and million in percentage rent in was less than of rental revenue and we anticipate percentage rent to be less than of rental revenue in our portfolio of retail real estate leased primarily under net leases to regional and national chains continues to perform well and provides dependable lease revenue supporting the payment of monthly dividends to our stockholders 
at december   our portfolio of  retail properties was leased with properties available for lease 
transactions to lease or sell of the properties available for lease or sale at december  were underway or completed as of february  we anticipate these transactions to be completed during the next six months  although we cannot guarantee that all of these properties can be sold or leased within this period 
it has been our experience that approximately to of our property portfolio will be unleased at any given time  however  we cannot assure you that the number of properties available for lease will not exceed these levels 
gain on sales of real estate acquired for resale by crest net 
in  crest net sold properties for million  which resulted in a gain of million 
in  crest net sold properties for million  which resulted in a gain of million 
in  crest net sold nine properties for million  which resulted in a gain of million 
all gains on sales of real estate acquired for resale are reported before income taxes 
at december   crest net had invested million in properties  which are held for sale 
our goal is for crest net to carry an average inventory of to million in real estate 
crest net s level of inventory increased substantially during the second half of crest net generates an earnings spread on the difference between the lease payments it receives on the properties held in inventory and the cost of capital used to acquire properties 
it is our belief that at this level of inventory  earnings will more than cover the ongoing expenses of crest net 
interest expense 
interest expense was million higher in than in primarily due to higher average outstanding balances 
the following is a summary of the five components of our interest expense dollars in thousands interest on credit facilities and notes amortization of settlements on treasury lock agreements credit facility commitment fees amortization of credit facility origination costs and deferred bond financing costs interest capitalized interest expense credit facilities and notes outstanding dollars in thousands average outstanding balances average interest rates interest on outstanding credit facilities and notes increased by million in as compared to primarily due to higher average outstanding balances

interest coverage ratio 
our interest coverage ratio for was times  for it was times and for it was times 
interest coverage ratio is calculated as the interest coverage amount as calculated below divided by interest expense 
we consider interest coverage ratio to be an appropriate supplemental measure of a company s ability to meet its interest expense 
our calculation of interest coverage ratio may be different from the calculation used by other companies and  therefore  comparability may be limited

our fixed charge coverage ratio for and was times and for was times 
fixed charge coverage ratio is calculated in exactly the same manner as interest coverage ratio  except that preferred stock dividends are also added to the denominator 
we consider fixed charge coverage ratio to be an appropriate supplemental measure of a company s ability to make its interest and preferred stock dividend payments 
our calculation of the fixed charge coverage ratio may be different from the calculation used by other companies and  therefore  comparability may be limited

in  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue increased to as compared to in and in included in general and administrative expenses are   and  of expenses attributable to crest net in  and  respectively 
general and administrative expenses  excluding expenses attributable to crest net  increased primarily due to increases in corporate insurance  payroll and staffing costs 
as our property portfolio has grown and continues to grow  we have and anticipate that we will continue to increase the level of our staffing 
we expect general and administrative expenses to continue to increase due to costs attributable to payroll  staffing costs and corporate governance 
we anticipate that our rental revenue will increase at a faster rate in than our general and administrative expenses 
we had employees at february  compared to at march   at march  and at march  property expenses 
property expenses are broken down into costs associated with non net leased multi tenant properties  unleased single tenant properties and general portfolio expenses 
expenses related to the multi tenant and unleased single tenant properties include  but are not limited to  property taxes  maintenance  insurance  utilities  property inspections  bad debt expense and legal fees 
general portfolio costs include  but are not limited to  insurance  legal  property inspections and title search fees 
at december   properties were available for lease  as compared to at december  and at december  property expenses were million in  million in and million in the  increase in property expenses in is primarily attributable to an increase in costs associated with vacant properties 
income taxes 
income taxes increased million to million in as compared to million in the increase in is due to an increase in crest net income taxes 
crest net taxes were higher in as compared to because crest net s taxable net income was higher

of this gain  million is included in discontinued operations 
in  we sold or exchanged properties for a total of million and recognized a gain of million 
we have an active portfolio management program that incorporates the sale of assets when we believe the reinvestment of the sale proceeds will generate higher returns  enhance the credit quality of our real estate portfolio or extend our average remaining lease term 
at december   we classified real estate with a carrying amount of million as held for sale  which includes million in properties owned by crest net 
additionally  we anticipate selling investment properties from our portfolio that have not yet been specifically identified 
we anticipate we will receive between million and million in proceeds from the sale of investment properties during the next months and we intend to invest these proceeds into new property acquisitions 
however  we cannot guarantee that we will sell properties during the next months 
discontinued operations 
the operations of seven properties listed as held for sale at december   plus properties sold in and have been classified as discontinued operations 
the following is a summary of our discontinued operations for  and dollars in thousands rental and other revenue gain on sales of investment properties depreciation and amortization property expenses provisions for impairment income from discontinued operations provisions for impairment

preferred stock dividends 
we paid preferred stock dividends of million in each of  and net income available to common stockholders 
net income available to common stockholders in increased by million  or  to million as compared to million in net income available to common stockholders in was million 
net income available to common stockholders includes gains and losses from the sale of investment properties 
the amount of gains and losses varies from period to period  based on the timing of property sales  and can significantly impact net income available to common stockholders 
the gain recognized from the sales of investment properties during was million as compared to million during and million in funds from operations ffo available to common stockholders ffo for increased by million  or  to million as compared to million in the following is a reconciliation of net income available to common stockholders which we believe is the most comparable generally accepted accounting principles gaap measure to ffo  information regarding distributions paid and the diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding for and dollars in thousands net income available to common stockholders depreciation and amortization continuing operations discontinued operations depreciation of furniture  fixtures and equipment gain on sales of investment properties continuing operations discontinued operations total funds from operations distributions paid to common stockholders ffo in excess of distributions to common stockholders diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding we define ffo  a non gaap measure  consistent with the national association of real estate investment trust s definition  as net income available to common stockholders  plus depreciation and amortization of assets uniquely significant to the real estate industry  reduced by gains and increased by losses on i sales of investment property and ii extraordinary items 
we consider ffo to be an appropriate supplemental measure of a reit s operating performance as it is based on a net income analysis of property portfolio performance that excludes non cash items such as depreciation 
the historical accounting convention used for real estate assets requires straight line depreciation of buildings and improvements  which implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
since real estate values historically rise and fall with market conditions  presentations of operating results for a reit  using historical accounting for depreciation  could be less informative 
the use of ffo is recommended by the reit industry as a supplemental performance measure 
in addition  ffo is used as a measure of our compliance with the financial covenants of our credit facility 
presentation of this information is intended to assist the reader in comparing the operating performance of different reits  although it should be noted that not all reits calculate ffo the same way  so comparisons with other reits may not be meaningful 
furthermore  ffo is not necessarily indicative of cash flow available to fund cash needs and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indication of realty income s performance 
in addition  ffo should not be considered as an alternative to reviewing our cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities as a measure of liquidity  of our ability to make cash distributions or of our ability to pay interest payments 
other non cash items and capitalized expenditures 
the following information includes non cash items and capitalized expenditures on existing properties in our portfolio 
these items are not utilized in the adjustments to net income available to common stockholders to arrive at funds from operations 
analysts and investors often request this supplemental information

no costs associated with our credit facility agreements or annual fees paid to credit rating agencies have been included 
negative amounts represent that our straight line rent was more than our actual cash rent collected by the amounts indicated 
positive amounts represent that our straight line rent was less than our actual cash rent collected by the amounts indicated 
ffo generated by crest net crest net generated million in ffo for realty income in  million in and million in as a result of the increase in crest net s inventory  we anticipate that crest net s contributions to our ffo in the early quarters of may be more significant compared to the same quarters in the future contribution  if any  to our ffo by crest net will depend on the timing and the number of property acquisitions and sales it achieves  if any  in a given period 
the following is a calculation of crest net s ffo contribution to realty income for and dollars in thousands gains from the sales of real estate acquired for resale rent and other revenue interest expense general and administrative expenses property expenses income taxes funds from operations contributed by crest net impact of inflation tenant leases generally provide for limited increases in rent as a result of increases in the tenants sales volumes  increases in the consumer price index  and or fixed increases 
we expect that inflation will cause these lease provisions to result in rent increases over time 
during times when inflation is greater than increases in rent  as provided for in the leases  rent increases may not keep up with the rate of inflation 
approximately  or  of the  properties in the portfolio are leased to tenants under net leases where the tenant is responsible for property costs and expenses 
net leases tend to reduce our exposure to rising property expenses due to inflation 
inflation and increased costs may have an adverse impact on our tenants if increases in their operating expenses exceed increases in revenue 
impact of accounting pronouncements in january  the fasb issued fin no 
revised december  consolidation of certain variable interest entities 
fin no 
r requires consolidation of a variable interest entity by an enterprise that holds a controlling financial interest 
the impact of adopting fin no 
r is not expected to have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to interest rate changes primarily as a result of our credit facility and long term notes used to maintain liquidity and expand our real estate investment portfolio and operations 
our interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flow and to lower our overall borrowing costs 
to achieve these objectives we issue long term notes  primarily at fixed rates  and may selectively enter into derivative financial instruments  such as interest rate lock agreements  interest rate swaps and caps in order to mitigate our interest rate risk on a related financial instrument 
we were not a party to any derivative financial instruments at december  we do not enter into any transactions for speculative or trading purposes 
our interest rate risk is monitored using a variety of techniques 
the following table presents the principal amounts  weighted average interest rates  fair values and other terms required by year of expected maturity to evaluate the expected cash flows and sensitivity to interest rate changes dollars in table in millions expected maturity data thereafter total fair value fixed rate debt average interest rate variable rate debt average interest rate the credit facility expires in october the credit facility balance as of february  was million 
million matures in may million matures in october million matures in january  million matures in march and million matures in november we base the fair value of the fixed rate debt at december  on the closing market price or indicative price per each note 
the fair value of the variable rate debt approximates its carrying value because its terms are similar to those available in the market place 
the table incorporates only those exposures that exist as of december   it does not consider those exposures or positions that could arise after that date 
as a result  our ultimate realized gain or loss  with respect to interest rate fluctuations  would depend on the exposures that arise during the period  our hedging strategies at the time  and interest rates
