item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a leading worldwide developer of high performance  hand carried ultrasound imaging systems for use in a variety of clinical applications and settings 
our proprietary technologies have enabled us to design hand carried diagnostic ultrasound systems that combine all digital  high resolution imaging with advanced features and capabilities traditionally found on cart based ultrasound systems 
we believe that the mobility  high clinical utility  durability  ease of use and cost effectiveness of our products are expanding existing markets and will create new markets for ultrasound imaging by bringing ultrasound out of the imaging center to other clinical settings and to the point of care such as the patient s bedside or the physician s examining table 
the size and complexity of traditional cart based ultrasound systems typically require a physician or highly trained clinician to perform the examination in a centralized imaging department  such as a hospital s radiology department 
by providing ultrasound at the primary point of care  our easy to use systems can eliminate delays associated with the referral process and enable physicians to use ultrasound more frequently and in a wider variety of clinical settings 
this increased accessibility creates the potential for enhanced patient care through earlier diagnosis of diseases and conditions 
our products are used for imaging in a variety of medical specialties  such as radiology  obstetrics and gynecology  emergency medicine  surgery  cardiology  internal medicine and vascular medicine 
our current products include the sonosite titan system  for general imaging and cardiology applications  the sonosite plus system  for general ultrasound imaging  and the sonoheart elite  specifically configured for cardiovascular applications 
the ilook imaging tool is designed to provide visual guidance for physicians and nurses while performing vascular access procedures and the ilook imaging tool is designed to provide visual imaging of the chest and abdomen for physicians and nurses while performing other procedures and examinations 
our titan  sonosite plus and sonoheart elite products are used together with any of our transducers that are designed for specific clinical applications 
our ilook products each have a single transducer for specific clinical applications 
we first shipped our newest product  the sonosite titan  in june we were formerly a division of atl ultrasound  inc  or atl 
on april   we were spun off as an independent  publicly owned washington corporation to further the development and commercialization of high performance  hand carried ultrasound imaging systems 
atl retained no ownership in us following the spin off 
we entered into a technology transfer and license agreement with atl pursuant to which we took ownership of certain ultrasound technology developed as part of a government grant and also patent rights  which had been established or were being pursued for that technology 
as part of this agreement  we also entered into a cross license whereby we had the exclusive right to use certain atl technology existing on april  or developed by atl during the three year period following april  in ultrasound systems weighing pounds or less  and atl had the exclusive right to use our technology existing on april  or developed by us during the same three year period in ultrasound systems weighing more than pounds 
on april   this cross license became nonexclusive and  except for the patented technology of each party  now extends to all ultrasound systems regardless of weight 
we sold our first products in september critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to product returns  bad debts  inventories  investments  warranty obligations  service contracts  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
the results form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our critical accounting policies include accounts receivable  revenue recognition  valuation of inventories and treatment of warranty expense 
accounts receivable 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we determine the adequacy of this allowance by regularly reviewing the aging of our accounts receivable and evaluating individual customer receivables  considering customers financial condition  historical experience  credit history and current economic condition 
losses can be difficult to anticipate 
for example  in  we wrote off approximately  of our argentine receivables due to adverse economic conditions in argentina 
an increase in losses beyond those expected by management would reduce earnings when they become known 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue on products and accessories when goods are shipped under an agreement with a customer  risk of loss and title have passed to the customer and collection of any resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
for service contracts  revenue is recognized over the term of the contract 
revenue is recorded net of estimated returns 
sales discounts are recorded as a reduction in revenue 
in connection with sales to certain specific international customers  we sometimes conclude that full collection of the related accounts receivable is not reasonably assured due to extended payment terms or the financial condition of our customer and  consequently  we do not recognize revenue or cost of revenue at the time of title transfer 
in instances where collection is not reasonably assured  revenue and cost of revenue are recorded when cash is received 
our sales arrangements may contain multiple elements  which include hardware and software products 
revenue from the sale of software in these arrangements is recognized in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position  software revenue recognition  as amended 
in general  we have vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe  of fair value for our products 
accordingly  for transactions that have undelivered elements for which we have vsoe of the elements  revenue equal to the total fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and is not recognized until the element is delivered to the customer 
valuation of inventories 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market on a first in  first out method 
included in our inventories balance are demonstration products used by our sales representatives and marketing department and items that have been shipped to customers for which revenue recognition requirements have not been met 
cost adjustments are recorded for obsolete material  earlier generation products and used product held either as saleable inventory or as demonstration product 
the adjustments reduce their carrying values to amounts not lower than that which is expected to result in approximately normal profit margins upon sale 
inventory items for which title has passed to customers are evaluated for recoverability based on the same process we use to evaluate collection of accounts receivable 
we make judgments regarding the carrying value of our inventory based on current market conditions 
market conditions may change depending upon competitive product introductions  consumer demand and reimbursement criteria in the medical community 
if market conditions change or if the introduction of new products by us impacts the market for our previously released products  we may be required to write down the cost of our inventory 
warranty expense 
we accrue estimated warranty expenses at the time of sale for costs expected to be incurred under our product warranties 
this provision for warranty expenses is made based upon our historical experience and management s judgment 
we have limited history with some of our products 
any unexpected increase in defects would result in an increase in warranty expense and a reduction in earnings 
results of operations revenue overview revenue increased to million in  compared to million in and million in the increase in revenue in compared to was primarily due to an increase in sales in the united states and europe  which was somewhat offset by a decline in sales to our distributor in japan 
the increase in revenue was primarily due to sales of our latest product introduction  the titan system 
the first shipments of the titan system occurred in june and accounted for approximately of our worldwide revenue for the year ended december  approximately of the increase in revenue in compared to was in the united states 
the increase resulted from having a fully staffed direct sales force for the entire year  new product introductions and our increased average selling price 
sales representatives increased productivity as they became more experienced and were assisted by a team of clinical application specialists 
these specialists performed product demonstrations and customer support  enabling sales representatives to focus on sales calls 
additionally  the average selling price per system increased due to an increase in sales of higher priced features 
approximately of the increase was in europe  where we opened two new sales offices in germany and spain in and had a full year of operation in the united kingdom and france compared to the prior year 
united states us revenue increased to million in  compared to million in  due to sales of the titan system  increased government and military sales and higher sales force productivity 
sales of the titan system accounted for approximately of us revenue in us revenue increased to million in  compared to million in  due to an increase in us direct sales representatives  new product introductions and increased average selling prices 
rest of the world revenue from europe  africa and the middle east increased to million in from million in primarily due to an increase in revenue from direct sales in the united kingdom  france and germany 
sales of the titan system accounted for approximately of such revenue in changes in exchange rates accounted for approximately million of the increase in revenue 
in germany  recent health care reform introduced a diagnosis related group system that changes health care reimbursements from a per day reimbursement to a per case reimbursement 
this change caused hospital administrators to delay capital equipment purchases as they evaluate the impact of the new system 
although revenue from germany increased on a comparable basis  this delay negatively impacted our actual results against our sales expectations in germany in the increase to million in from million in was primarily due to an increase in direct sales in the united kingdom and france along with sales from our direct sales operations in germany and spain  which opened in revenue from canada  australia  south america  latin america and asia excluding japan increased to million in from million in primarily due to a large sale to the government of argentina 
the increase to million in from million in was primarily due to an increase in orders from our distributors in china and mexico 
revenue from japan decreased to million in from million in primarily due to a decrease in orders from our distributor  olympus 
the olympus organization underwent significant organizational changes  which affected its ability to provide sufficient sales and marketing focus on our products 
as a result  we are working to establish additional distribution relationships in japan 
we expect these relationships to become operational in the first half of the decrease of revenue in japan to million in from million in was due to the timing of orders received from olympus and the delay in approval of our new products 
we anticipate that revenue will increase in compared to prior years due to continued expansion of our direct selling efforts in the united states and europe  the establishment of direct sales operations in japan  canada and australia  introduction of new product features  and the overall expansion of market awareness and acceptance of our products 
however  increased competition may impact the extent of the increase in our anticipated growth in revenue 
we currently face competition from larger companies that manufacture cart based and portable ultrasound systems and have greater financial and other resources 
some of these competitors are introducing hand carried ultrasound products 
in  we anticipate improvement in our revenue from japan due to the establishment of direct sales operation there and the expected establishment of additional distributor relationships 
however  regulatory approval of our new products in japan could be delayed  which could impact our anticipated revenue 
gross margin gross margin increased to in  compared to in and in the increase in gross margin in was primarily due to improved manufacturing efficiencies and increased average selling prices 
the increased average selling prices resulted primarily from initial sales of the titan system  an increase in the percentage of direct sales compared with distributor sales and an increase in sales with advanced feature configurations 
direct sales accounted for approximately of total sales in compared to in the increase in gross margin in from was primarily due to an increase in the percentage of direct sales compared with distributor sales  increased average selling prices due to the sale of higher priced features and improved manufacturing efficiencies 
direct sales accounted for approximately of total sales in compared to in we expect our gross margin percentage in to increase slightly from our gross margin in nevertheless  increased competition from existing and new competitors in the highly portable ultrasound system market could result in lower average realized prices and could lower our gross margin 
our gross margin can be expected to fluctuate in future periods based on the mix of business between direct and distributor sales and our product and accessories sales mixes 
changes in our cost of inventory also may impact our gross margin 
included in our inventories are demonstration products  refurbished products and products held by our customers  which are valued by us at amounts not lower than that which is expected to result in approximately normal margins upon sale 
if market conditions change or the introduction of new products by us impacts the market for our previously released products  we may be required to write down the cost of our inventory  resulting in a negative impact on gross margins 
additionally  we rely on our sales forecasts by product to determine production volume 
to the extent our sales forecasts or product mix estimates are inaccurate  we may produce excess inventory or experience inventory shortages  which may result in an increase in our costs of revenue and a decrease in our gross margin 
operating expenses research and development expenses were million in  compared to million in and million in research and development expenses decreased in compared to primarily due to expenses incurred in associated with the development of the titan system and the ilook products combined with a reduction in product development costs in due to the completion of the titan system  which first shipped to customers in june the decrease in research and development expenses compared to was primarily due to a reduction in product development costs after the completion and introduction of the sonoheart elite and ilook products during the first nine months of we anticipate that research and development expenses will increase in due to increased development of new products using newly designed integrated circuit chips 
however  should our competitors develop products with features that equal or exceed the features that exist in our products  we may incur higher than anticipated research and development costs in order to accelerate existing programs and compete more effectively 
sales and marketing expenses increased to million in  compared to million in and million in the million increase in expenses in compared to was primarily due to increased expenses in europe 
expenses in europe increased due to the increase  year over year  in the number of sales representatives there and expenses associated with the titan product launch 
in addition  expenses increased due to the increase  year over year  in the number of clinical application specialists in the united states  and expenses associated with the reconfiguration of our united states sales territories in early changes in exchange rates accounted for approximately million of the increase in expenses 
the increase in sales and marketing expenses in compared to was primarily due to our direct sales activities in the united states  where for the first time we had a fully operational sales force for an entire year 
approximately of the increase was related to the addition of clinical application specialists in the united states  who assisted sales representatives with product demonstrations and customer support 
approximately of the increase was related to our direct sales activities in europe where we opened two new sales office and increased headcount in our two existing offices 
we anticipate that sales and marketing expenses in will increase primarily due to sales force expansion in the us and the establishment of direct sales operations in japan  canada and australia 
general and administrative expenses were million in  compared to million in and million in the increase in general and administrative expenses in was related primarily to supporting our business growth and to legal and consulting expenses associated with medical reimbursement activities 
the increase in was primarily due to supporting our business growth and to legal expenses incurred to defend our intellectual property rights 
we anticipate that general and administrative expenses will increase in in order to support our increased business activity 
we may incur additional substantial legal expenses as we continue to defend our patent rights in the existing neutrino patent infringement litigation 
in addition  we may incur unanticipated legal expenses if we become involved in any new litigation 
other income loss for other income and loss  we reported income of million in compared to  in the increase in compared to was primarily due to foreign currency transaction gains of approximately  and net realized gains on investments of approximately  in we reported income of  in  compared to  in the increase in compared to was primarily due to a decrease in equity investment losses from our joint venture in china 
in  we began the process of terminating our joint venture in china and have since entered into a new joint venture in china with a new partner 
liquidity and capital resources our cash and cash equivalents balance was million as of december   compared to million as of december  cash and cash equivalents were primarily invested in money market accounts 
operating activities used cash of million in  compared to million in and million in the decrease in cash used in compared with was primarily due to a million reduction in our net loss 
this was offset by increases in accounts receivable and inventories to support our business growth 
the decrease in cash used in operations as compared with was primarily due to a reduction of million in our net loss 
the decrease in cash used was also due to changes in accounts receivable and accounts payable  both of which were substantially offset by the change in inventories 
the effect on cash from the change in accounts receivable improved in compared to primarily due to improved collection efforts 
accounts payable increased primarily due to the timing of payments  increased inventory purchases and our overall growth 
inventories increased to support increased business activity 
investing activities used cash of million in  compared to cash used of million in and cash provided of million in the decrease in cash used in compared with reflects the fact that we used million of cash in for net purchases of investment securities compared to when we had net purchases of investment securities of million 
in  we received million on the net sales of investment securities 
we anticipate using cash to invest in high quality investment instruments in  the extent of which will depend on the interest rate environment during the period and the timing of cash flows from our operations during the period 
financing activities provided cash of million in  compared to million in and million in the main source of cash provided by financing activities in was the exercise of stock options totaling million  compared to million in in may  we received net proceeds of million through the sale of  shares of our common stock at per share 
in august  we received net proceeds of million through the sale of  shares of our common stock at per share 
we anticipate that cash used in operations will decrease in compared to primarily due to anticipated decreases in our net loss 
this decrease will depend on our ability to successfully sell our products  collect our receivables  control our inventories and manage our expenses 
we believe that our existing cash and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to fund our operations and planned capital expenditures in nevertheless  we may experience an increased need for additional cash due to any significant decline in our revenues or gross margins  any delay or inability to collect accounts receivable  any acquisition or strategic investment in another business  any significant increase in expenditures as a result of expansion of our sales and marketing infrastructure  our manufacturing capability or our product development activities  any significant increase in our sales and marketing expenditures as a result of our introduction of new products  and any significant increase in expenditures related to the neutrino patent infringement litigation 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we had no off balance sheet debt 
furthermore  except for certain foreign exchange rate hedging transactions  discussed more fully under foreign currency risk in item a below  we are not a party to any derivative transaction 
we apply the disclosure provisions of fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others to our agreements that contain guarantee or indemnification clauses 
we provide i indemnifications of varying scope and size to our customers and distributors against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products  ii indemnifications of varying scope and size to our customers against third party claims arising as a result of defects in our products  iii indemnifications of varying scope and size to consultants against third party claims arising from the services they provide to us  and iv guarantees to support obligations of some of our subsidiaries such as lease payments 
these indemnifications and guarantees give rise only to the disclosure provisions of fin to date  we have not incurred material costs as a result of these obligations and do not expect to incur material costs in the future 
accordingly  we have not accrued any liabilities in our financial statements related to these indemnifications or guarantees 
contractual obligations we have the following contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period total less than year years years more than years in thousands capital lease obligations operating leases unconditional purchase obligations other commitments as part of our agreements with our suppliers  suppliers may procure resources and material expected to be used for the manufacture of our product in accordance with our production schedule provided to them 
we may be responsible for compensating our suppliers for these procurements in the event these items are not used in the quantities submitted as part of the production schedule or material becomes obsolete as a result of production timing  material changes or design changes 
as part of obtaining our lease for our current facility  we were required to deposit approximately  representing restricted cash with our bank 
also  we were required to maintain a deposit of approximately  with our bank in the united kingdom as security for payment of customs and duties charges 
both amounts are included in other long term assets 
in march  one of our component suppliers  philips semiconductor  or philips  informed us that  commencing in september  it would discontinue production of our integrated circuit chips using micron technology 
we have designed and implemented a new chip using micron technology that will continue to be produced by philips to replace all but one of the discontinued chips 
we expect to design and implement an additional new chip to replace the remaining micron chip by early in the second quarter of  we entered into a purchase commitment totaling approximately million for supplies of micron chips from philips for our anticipated manufacturing needs until new chips have been incorporated in all of our products 
we pay for these chips at the time deliveries are made to us 
as of december   our remaining purchase commitment was approximately million 
on december   we are required to take possession of  and pay for  the balance of the undelivered chips 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued sfas  no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  which provides the accounting requirements for retirement obligations associated with tangible long lived assets 
sfas no 
requires entities to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred 
sfas no 
is effective for our fiscal year and we adopted sfas no 
on january  the adoption of sfas no 
did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 or fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
fin clarifies the requirements of statement no 
 accounting for contingencies  relating to a guarantor s accounting for  and disclosure of  the issuance of certain types of guarantees 
for certain guarantees issued after december   fin requires a guarantor to recognize  upon issuance of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligations it assumes under the guarantee 
guarantees issued prior to january   are not subject to liability recognition  but are subject to expanded disclosure requirements 
the adoption of this interpretation did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in november  the emerging issues task force  or eitf  reached a consensus on eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  with respect to determining when and how to allocate revenue from sales with multiple deliverables 
the eitf consensus provides a framework for determining when and how to allocate revenue from sales with multiple deliverables based on a determination of whether the multiple deliverables qualify to be accounted for as separate units of accounting 
the consensus is effective prospectively for arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june  and we adopted this consensus on july  the adoption of this consensus did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 or fin  consolidation of variable interest entities 
variable interest entities often are created for a single specified purpose  for example  to facilitate securitization  leasing  hedging  research and development  or other transactions or arrangements 
this interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements  defines what these variable interest entities are and provides guidelines on how to identity them and also on how an enterprise should assess its interests in a variable interest entity to decide whether to consolidate that entity 
generally  fin applies to variable interest entities created after january   and to variable interest entities in which an enterprise obtains an interest after that date 
on october   the fasb deferred the implementation date for the consolidation requirements of fin as it relates to variable interest entities that existed before february  fin also requires companies that expect to consolidate a variable interest entity they acquired before february  to disclose the entity s nature  size  activities  and the company s maximum exposure to loss in financial statements issued after january  in december  the fasb issued fin r with respect to variable interest entities created before january   which  among other things  revised the implementation date to the fiscal year or interim period ending after march  except for special purpose entities 
the adoption of this interpretation did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements nor do we expect that it will have a material impact on our future consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas no 
changes the accounting for certain financial instruments that  under previous guidance  could be classified as equity or mezzanine equity  by now requiring those instruments to be classified as liabilities or assets in some circumstances in the balance sheet 
sfas no 
is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  the adoption of sfas no 
did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we are exposed to market risk relating to changes in interest rates  which could adversely affect the value of our investments in marketable securities 
as of december   our portfolio consisted of million of interest bearing debt securities with maturities of less than one year and million of interest bearing debt securities with maturities of more than one year 
our intent is to hold these securities until maturity  but we have classified them as available for sale in the event of unanticipated cash needs 
the interest bearing securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
we believe that the impact on the fair market value of our securities and related earnings for from a hypothetical increase in market interest rates would not have a material impact on the investment portfolio 
foreign currency risk except for sales transacted by our wholly owned foreign subsidiaries  we transact all our sales in united states dollars  or usds  therefore  the obligations of many of our international customers are in usds 
our exposure to risk from fluctuations in foreign currencies relates primarily to the strengthening of the usd against the local currency of our international customers  which may impact our ability to collect amounts owed by our international customers 
as of december   of our outstanding accounts receivable balance was from international customers  of which  or approximately million  was denominated in a currency other than usds 
total sales for the year ended december  denominated in a currency other than usds were approximately million  or of total consolidated revenues 
the british pound and the euro represented the majority of financial transactions executed in a currency not denominated in usds 
historically  the impact on us of changes in exchange rates compared to the usd has been insignificant 
we regularly review our receivable positions in foreign countries for any indication that collection may be at risk 
in addition  we utilize letters of credit where they are warranted in order to mitigate our collection risk 
we periodically enter into foreign currency forward contracts to reduce the impact of adverse fluctuations on earnings associated with foreign currency exchange rate changes 
the currencies hedged during were the british pound and the euro 
on december   we entered into foreign currency forward contracts totaling million 
all of these contracts expire on march  and serve as hedges of a substantial portion of our british pound and euro denominated intercompany balances 
a sensitivity analysis of a change in the fair value of the contracts entered into on december  indicates that  if the usd weakened by against the british pound and the euro  the fair value of these contracts would decrease by approximately  conversely  if the usd strengthened by against the british pound and the euro  the fair value of these contracts would increase by approximately  any gains and losses on the fair value of these contracts would be largely offset by losses and gains on the underlying transactions 
these offsetting gains and losses are not reflected in the sensitivity analysis above 
the fair value of these contracts as of december  was not material to our results of operations or our financial position
