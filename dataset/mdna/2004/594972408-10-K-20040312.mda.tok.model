table of contents part i item business overview we are a leading worldwide provider of business intelligence software that enables companies to analyze the raw data stored across their enterprise to reveal the trends and insights needed to develop solutions to manage their business effectively 
our software delivers this critical information to workgroups  the enterprise and extranet communities via e mail  web  fax  wireless and voice communication channels 
businesses can use our software platform to develop user friendly solutions  proactively refine revenue generating strategies  enhance cost efficiency and productivity and improve customer relationships 
our software platform  microstrategy i  enables users to query and analyze the most detailed  transaction level databases  turning data into business intelligence and delivering boardroom quality reports and alerts about the users business processes 
our web based architecture provides reporting  security  performance and standards that are critical for web deployment 
with intranet deployments  our products provide employees with information to enable them to make better  more cost effective business decisions 
with extranet deployments  enterprises can use microstrategy i to build stronger relationships by linking customers and suppliers via the internet 
we also offer a comprehensive set of consulting  education  technical support and technical advisory services for our customers and strategic partners 
industry background business intelligence software offers decision makers the opportunity to ask and answer questions about their business using data that has been captured but not yet exploited to its fullest extent 
four key trends have driven demand for business intelligence tools need for increased user access in the past  dissemination of information has been limited to a few power users or analysts 
now a wide range of information customers from customer service representatives to the ceo and from customers to suppliers demand the insight that business intelligence can provide 
the wide acceptance of the internet as an information source has also fueled demand for enterprise data to be accessible over the web 
increased data scalability increasing information intensity  and in particular  the need to capture electronically and store every business transaction  has made terabyte size data warehouses commonplace 
terabyte size data warehouses store one trillion bytes of data or more and are among the largest databases in the world 
since transaction level information is now routinely captured  organizations struggle to make productive use of such massive data stores 
organizations need to view data within the operational context of the data making even the most detailed information meaningful and comprehensive to business users 
as a result  users are easily able to discover trends hidden in these very large databases  and verify these trends by reviewing the underlying transaction detail 
improved supply efficiency supplier transactions become more efficient with direct access to inventory and other related data 
for true vendor managed inventory and collaborative commerce systems  vendors need to have access to key information about how their products are performing against business metrics 
for example  vendors should be able to see how their products are selling in each geographic region so as not to over ship products that are slow moving or under ship products that are selling quickly 
by opening vendor performance information to the vendors themselves  buyers and sellers of goods and services become partners in the quest to optimize sales  margin and inventory 
improved distribution efficiency business partners collaborate more effectively with access to shared data 
by granting access to information such as the manufacturing pipeline and build schedule  partners can be more effective at satisfying demands of end customers and setting expectations 
opening invoice and purchase order information to partners can enable them to reduce the overhead associated with 
table of contents channel management  resulting in cost savings and time efficiencies 
for example  notifying channel sales partners of changes in the manufacturing schedule allows them to reset end customer expectations or to increase selling activity 
the emergence and widespread acceptance of the internet as a medium of communication and commerce have changed the way businesses interact with each other and their customers by allowing businesses to establish new revenue streams  create new distribution channels and reduce costs 
simultaneously  the amount of corporate information stored in databases continues to grow exponentially  and companies are giving an increasing number of employees  customers and partners access to their information 
business intelligence tools are one of the gateways to this information 
for example  companies are using internet based systems to facilitate business operations  including sales automation  supply chain management  marketing  customer service and human resource management 
consumers are also becoming increasingly sophisticated in their use of the internet  relying on the internet not only to make online purchases  but to perform price comparisons  analyze recommendations from like minded individuals  educate themselves about relevant products and offerings and enter into transactions that were once conducted face to face or via the telephone 
the integration of the internet into business processes and increased consumer sophistication create opportunities for companies to use business intelligence applications as part of a more dynamic business model 
factors driving demand for these applications include increased electronic capture of transaction  operational and customer information 
the rapid growth in the electronic capture of business information and the increased availability of related profile data on the parties or products involved in each transaction are providing businesses with a rich data foundation for performing various analyses and making decisions 
powerful data analysis and mining tools are required to sift through massive amounts of data to uncover information regarding customer interactions  trends  patterns and exceptions  in turn enabling organizations to provide superior service and products to customers 
need to create a personalized  one to one customer and or supplier experience while maintaining privacy 
many companies are initiating strategies that establish personalized relationships with each customer and or supplier based on individual needs and preferences  and earn their loyalty by providing superior service  security and convenience 
in order to successfully acquire  retain and upgrade customers  organizations need to understand their profiles  their transaction history  their past responses to marketing campaigns  and their interactions with customer service 
retrieving information from widely dispersed and complex data sources and providing a holistic view of the customer can be challenging 
at the same time  while businesses have the opportunity to collect a variety of information that could improve targeting  customers are increasingly concerned about the potential for loss or abuse of their privacy 
need to integrate online and traditional operations 
while there are substantial benefits to conducting business electronically  companies need to ensure that their online operations work in combination with their traditional operations 
companies are seeking to ensure that an order placed online can be reliably fulfilled according to the expectations of the customer and to develop and maintain consistent interactions with customers across different channels 
maintaining the integrity of  and enhancing  the customer experience are crucial to fostering customer loyalty and supply chain relationships 
increased openness of business intelligence applications to customers  suppliers and partners 
business intelligence systems are no longer confined to the corporation 
today  companies are extending their business intelligence insight to suppliers  channel partners and customers via extranets 
business partners can have up to the minute access to sales histories  inventory status and billing information through their web browsers 
emergence of wireless internet and voice technologies 
information can be more valuable if there is untethered  ubiquitous access to the information 
the development of wireless standards and improvements in text to speech and voice recognition technologies have created a technology platform for delivering internet based information and services to mobile devices 
an integrated platform reduces the need for relying on multiple vendors for these products and services 
this development is expected to generate new business 
table of contents opportunities for companies by providing an additional channel for existing services and creating opportunities to provide new services that can be delivered any place and at any time to anyone that has access to a wireless device

competition the markets for business intelligence software  analytical applications and information delivery are intensely competitive and subject to rapidly changing technology 
in addition  many companies in these markets are offering  or may soon offer  products and services that may compete with microstrategy products 
microstrategy s most direct competitors include providers of business intelligence software  olap tools  ad hoc query tools  web based reporting tools  and report delivery and proactive alerting 
each of these markets is discussed more fully below 
business intelligence software 
makers of business intelligence software provide business intelligence capabilities designed for integration  customization and application development 
companies such as microsoft  oracle  hyperion solutions  sap ag  computer associates and sas provide business intelligence software 
olap tools 
companies that build software to perform online analytical processing olap provide offerings competitive with the core microstrategy i platform 
whether web based or client server  these tools give end users the ability to analyze underlying data sources without having to hand code structured query language queries 
most olap tools allow users to build their own calculations and specify report layouts and other options 
additionally  olap tools provide users the ability to navigate throughout the underlying data in an easy  graphical style  often referred to as drilling 
additional olap capabilities include pivoting and filtering 
providers of olap tools include cognos  hyperion solutions  ibm  sap and microsoft 

table of contents ad hoc query tools 
ad hoc query tools allow large numbers of end users to gain access to pre defined reports and queries for simple analysis 
often each end user is able to specify some personalized run time criteria that customize the result set for that particular person 
some limited drilling is also provided 
some ad hoc query tools allow users to access databases and create their own database queries using structured query language 
users are then able to export the resulting data into other formats such as microsoft excel for their own use 
companies that produce query and reporting tools include business objects  cognos  oracle  hyperion solutions and information builders 
web based reporting tools 
companies that offer software to deliver pre built reports for end user viewing and consumption can also compete with microstrategy 
extensive formatting capabilities ensure that users can easily consume the information contained in the reports 
there is limited user interactivity with these reports generated by reporting tools 
reporting applications built with these tools often lack the sophistication  robustness and scalability of the microstrategy platform  but can be attractive for small departments 
vendors in this category include actuate  business objects  microsoft and sas 
report delivery and proactive alerting 
companies that focus on the proactive delivery of information  via e mail  website  or other medium can compete with microstrategy s offerings 
typically  these tools serve to push out compiled reports on a scheduled basis to sets of users based on job type 
microstrategy software has integrated this technology into the microstrategy i platform 
vendors of such technology include actuate and business objects 
many of our competitors have longer operating histories  significantly greater financial  technical  marketing or other resources  and greater name recognition than we do 
in addition  many of our competitors have strong relationships with current and potential customers and extensive knowledge of the business intelligence industry 
as a result  they may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of their products than we can 
increased competition may lead to price cuts  reduced gross margins and loss of market share 
we may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors  and the failure to meet the competitive pressures we face may have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
current and future competitors may also make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with others 
by doing so  they may increase their ability to meet the needs of our potential customers 
our current or prospective indirect channel partners may establish cooperative relationships with our current or future competitors 
these relationships may limit our ability to sell our products through specific distribution channels 
accordingly  new competitors or alliances among current and future competitors may emerge and rapidly gain significant market share 
these developments could limit our ability to obtain revenues from new customers and to maintain technical support revenues from our installed customer base 
employees as of december   we had a total of employees  of whom were based in the united states and were based internationally 
of the total  were engaged in sales and marketing  in product development  in professional services and in finance  administration and corporate operations 
none of our employees are represented by a labor union 
we have not experienced any work stoppages and consider our relations with our employees to be good 
we believe that effective recruiting  education and nurturing of human resources are critical to our success and have traditionally made investments in these areas in order to differentiate ourselves from our competition  increase employee loyalty and create a culture conducive to creativity  cooperation and continuous improvement

critical accounting policies microstrategy s consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
for a comprehensive discussion of our accounting policies  see note in the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
microstrategy does not have any ownership interest in any special purpose entities that are not wholly owned and consolidated subsidiaries of microstrategy 
additionally  microstrategy does not have any material related party transactions as defined under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 related party disclosures 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and equity and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
these estimates and judgments  particularly relating to revenue recognition  restructuring and impairment charges and litigation and contingencies  have a material impact on our financial statements  and are discussed in detail throughout our analysis of the results of operations as discussed below 
in addition to evaluating estimates relating to the items discussed above  we also consider other estimates  including  but not limited to  those related to allowance for doubtful accounts  software development costs  intangible assets  income taxes and financing operations 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets  liabilities and equity that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results and outcomes could differ from these estimates and assumptions 
additional information regarding risk factors that may impact our estimates is included below under risk factors 
we apply the following critical accounting policies in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition 
microstrategy s software revenue recognition policies are in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountant s statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended 
in the case of software arrangements that require significant production  modification  or customization of software  we follow the guidance in sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
we also follow the guidance provided by sec staff 
table of contents accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  and sab no 
 revenue recognition which provide guidance on the recognition  presentation and disclosure of revenue in the financial statements filed with the sec 
we recognize revenue from sales of software licenses to end users or resellers upon persuasive evidence of an arrangement  as provided by agreements or contracts executed by both parties  delivery of the software and determination that collection of a fixed or determinable fee is reasonably assured 
when the fees for software upgrades and enhancements  technical support  consulting and education are bundled with the license fee  they are unbundled using our objective evidence of the fair value of the elements represented by our customary pricing for each element in separate transactions 
if such evidence of fair value exists for all undelivered elements and there is no such evidence of fair value established for delivered elements  revenue is first allocated to the elements where evidence of fair value has been established and the residual amount is allocated to the delivered elements 
if evidence of fair value for any undelivered element of an arrangement does not exist  all revenue from the arrangement is deferred until such time that evidence of fair value exists for undelivered elements or until all elements of the arrangement are delivered  subject to certain limited exceptions set forth in sop when a software license arrangement requires us to provide significant production  customization or modification of the software  or when the customer considers these services essential to the functionality of the software product  both the product license revenue and consulting services revenue are recognized using the percentage of completion method 
under percentage of completion accounting  both product license and consulting services revenue are recognized as work progresses based upon labor hours incurred 
any expected losses on contracts in progress are expensed in the period in which the losses become probable and reasonably estimable 
contracts accounted for under the percentage of completion method were immaterial for the years ended december  and for the year ended december   contracts accounted for under the percentage of completion method represented approximately of total revenues 
if an arrangement includes acceptance criteria  revenue is not recognized until we can objectively demonstrate that the software or service can meet the acceptance criteria  or the acceptance period lapses  whichever occurs earlier 
if a software license arrangement obligates us to deliver specified future products or upgrades  the revenue is recognized when the specified future product or upgrades are delivered  or when the obligation to deliver specified future products expires  whichever occurs earlier 
if a software license arrangement obligates us to deliver unspecified future products  then revenue is recognized on the subscription basis  ratably over the term of the contract 
license revenue derived from sales to resellers or oem s who purchase our products for future resale is recognized upon sufficient evidence that the products have been sold to the ultimate end users provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
technical support revenue  included in product support and other services revenue  is derived from providing technical support and software updates and upgrades to customers 
technical support revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the contract  which in most cases is one year 
revenue from consulting and education services is recognized as the services are performed 
amounts collected prior to satisfying the above revenue recognition criteria are included in deferred revenue and advance payments in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
the application of sop  as amended  requires judgment  including a determination that collectibility is reasonably assured  the fee is fixed and determinable and whether a software arrangement includes multiple elements  and if so  whether vendor specific objective evidence of fair value exists for those elements 
judgment is also required to assess whether future releases of certain software represent new products or upgrades and enhancements to existing products 
microstrategy s ability to enter into revenue generating transactions and recognize revenue in the future is subject to a number of business and economic risks discussed below under risk factors 

table of contents restructuring and impairment charges 
restructuring and impairment charges have been recorded in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring and sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
in determining the costs associated with real estate lease losses from exiting facilities  management was required to make judgments and estimates which significantly impacted the recorded amount of restructuring and impairment charges 
the real estate lease losses included estimates of sublease commission costs  sub tenant concession costs  sublease rental income and the expected length of time to sublease idle space 
final results could substantially differ from current estimates if we are unable to sublet the remaining vacant office space on the estimated terms 
litigation and contingencies 
we are subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business 
we consider the likelihood of loss or impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability  as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss in determining loss contingencies 
an estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
we regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted 
we are involved in lawsuits with business objects  sa and business objects americas  inc relating to claims involving patent infringement and other intellectual property claims 
the outcome of this litigation is not presently determinable  and as such  we are currently unable to estimate the potential range of gain or loss  if any  relating to these actions 
accordingly  no provision for these matters has been made in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
additional information regarding these matters is included below under risk factors 
we are also involved in a lawsuit with eplus group  inc relating to a claim by eplus involving breach of contract 
although the ultimate outcome of this litigation is uncertain  we believe that the litigation will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based on our assessment of the collectibility of specific customer accounts and the aging of our accounts receivable 
if there were a deterioration in the financial condition of our customers  or actual defaults were higher than our historical experience  our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to us could be overstated  which could have an adverse impact of our revenues and operations 
software development costs 
we account for software development costs in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed 
sfas no 
specifies that software development costs incurred internally should be expensed as incurred until technological feasibility has been established 
once technological feasibility has been established  all software development costs should be capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers 
judgment is required in determining when the technological feasibility of a product is established 
we consider technological feasibility to be achieved when a product design and working model of the software product have been completed 
deferred taxes 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  if we were to subsequently determine that we would be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount  an adjustment to deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination was made 
similarly  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to deferred tax assets would reduce income in the period such determination was made 
in determining net deferred tax assets and valuation allowances  management is required to make judgments and estimates related to projections of domestic and foreign profitability  the timing and extent of the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards  applicable tax rates  transfer pricing methodologies and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 

table of contents impairment of long lived assets 
we review long lived assets  including intangible assets  for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable or that the useful lives of these assets are no longer appropriate 
each impairment test is based on a comparison of the undiscounted cash flows to the recorded value of the asset 
subsequent impairment assessments could result in future impairment charges 
any impairment charge would result in reductions in the carrying value of long lived assets and would reduce our operating results in the period in which the charge arose

the following table sets forth revenues in thousands and percentage changes in revenues for the periods indicated december  change in change in revenues product licenses product support and other services total revenues product licenses revenues 
product licenses revenues decreased during  as compared to  as a result of our decision to limit our sales focus to licensing our core business intelligence software and generating profitable transactions 
this change in focus  a result of our restructuring plans  included a significant reduction in our sales force during  which at the same time substantially reduced our sales and marketing related costs 
during and  we introduced several new products that complement our business intelligence platform  which we believe have been well accepted by our customers and industry analysts 
the overall increase in  as compared to  was primarily attributable to an increase in the size of our sales force to further our presence in the business intelligence market  the impact of favorable foreign currency fluctuations and an increase in the average size of our product license transactions 
in  we had twenty six product license transactions in excess of  including one transaction during the second quarter of that generated product licenses revenues of million 
in  we had nine transactions in excess of  and twelve such transactions in product licenses revenues as a percentage of total revenues were  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the average size of our product license transactions and the number of high dollar transactions may fluctuate on a period to period basis 
additionally  product licenses revenues as a percentage of total revenues may fluctuate on a period to period basis and may vary significantly from the percentage of total revenues achieved in prior years 
product support and other services revenues 
the overall decrease in product support and other services revenues during  as compared to  was primarily attributable to a decrease in consulting services revenue  a decrease in education services revenue  and the termination of our software development and oem agreement with exchange applications discussed in more detail below  which generated million of product support and other services revenues during the decrease was offset in part by a increase in revenues from technical support services 
the increase in product support and other services revenues in  as compared to  was primarily the result of a increase in revenues from technical support services  while revenues from education and consulting services remained relatively unchanged 
revenues from technical support services have increased year over year as a result of an ongoing increase in our installed base of software licenses under technical support contracts  an increase in the average rate charged for technical support  our high renewal rates for such contracts  and the impact of favorable foreign currency fluctuations 
product support and other services revenues as a percentage of total revenues were  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
as a result of possible fluctuations in product licenses revenues discussed above  product support and other services revenues as a percentage of total revenues may fluctuate on a period to period basis and vary significantly from the percentage of total revenues achieved in prior years

international revenues are included in the amounts discussed above for product licenses and product support and other services revenues and also are discussed separately within this paragraph 
the decrease in international revenues in  as compared to  was primarily attributable to a global economic slowdown  which led to decreased corporate spending on information technology 
we believe the global economic slowdown had a greater impact on our international product licenses revenues in than our domestic product licenses revenues 
in  after adjusting for foreign currency fluctuations  international product licenses revenues decreased by 
the decrease was offset in part by a positive impact from foreign currency fluctuations 
the average size of our international product licenses revenue transactions decreased from  in to  in the increase in international product support and other services revenues in  as compared to  was the result of a positive foreign currency impact and a increase in revenues 
in  international product support and other services revenues included a increase in revenues from technical support services  which included a increase in revenues and a positive impact from foreign currency fluctuations 
this increase was offset in part by a decrease in revenues from education and consulting services 
as a percentage of total revenues  international revenues were in  in and in foreign currency impacts generally fluctuate over time  and accordingly  the same volume of license transactions and support services in a future period may result in lower reported earnings if future foreign currency impacts are less favorable than those experienced in we anticipate that international revenues will continue to account for a significant portion of total revenues  and management expects to continue to commit significant time and financial resources to the maintenance and ongoing development of direct and indirect international sales and support channels 
costs and expenses the following table sets forth total cost of revenues in thousands and percentage changes in cost of revenues for the periods indicated december  change in change in cost of revenues product licenses product support and other services total cost of revenues cost of product licenses revenues

as a percentage of product licenses revenues  cost of product licenses revenues were in  in and in the decrease in cost of product licenses revenues as a percentage of product licenses revenues in  as compared to  was primarily due to decreased software royalty arrangements with third party software vendors 
in the event that we enter into additional software royalty 
table of contents arrangements with third party software vendors in the future  cost of product licenses revenues as a percentage of total product licenses revenues may increase 
the decrease in was partially offset by an increase in the amortization of capitalized software development costs associated with the release of microstrategy i and narrowcast server in april and web universal in november cost of product licenses revenues increased in  as compared to  due to a full year of capitalized software amortization related to products released in and a partial year of capitalized software amortization related to the release of our new enterprise reporting product  microstrategy report services  in november cost of product licenses revenues  however  decreased as a percentage of product licenses revenues because of the significant increase in product licenses revenues in based on our existing product offerings  we expect cost of product licenses revenues to increase by approximately  in as a result of the amortization of software development costs that were capitalized in and our cost of product licenses revenues could increase further with the development and addition of new products to our product line

as a percentage of product support and other services revenues  cost of product support and other services revenues was in  in and in the decrease in total cost of product support and other services revenues as a percentage of product support and other services revenues services cost ratio was primarily due to sequential decreases in our consulting  technical support and education staffing levels 
in connection with the implementation of our restructuring plans  our staffing levels decreased by approximately in as compared to our staffing levels decreased by an additional in as we continued to align our expenses with our expected revenue streams 
additionally  the significant sequential decreases in services cost ratio was also attributable to improved utilization of consulting personnel as a consequence of the overall restructuring plans  a decrease in the use of third parties to perform consulting services and an increase in technical support revenues as a percentage of total product support and other services revenues  which result in higher profit margins than our consulting and education services

as a percentage of total revenues  research and development expenses were in  in and in the decrease in our research and development expenses in  as compared to  resulted from our focus on enhancing our core business intelligence product line and limiting our initiatives on new product development peripheral to the business intelligence market 
also contributing to the decline in research and development expenses in were our restructuring plans  which involved a reduction in staffing levels and a decrease in the use of third party consultants

software development costs for a product are capitalized from the time that technological feasibility is reached until the general release of that product 
we consider technological feasibility to be achieved when a product design and working model of the software product have been completed 
these capitalized software costs are amortized over their respective useful lives of approximately three years

general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses include personnel and other costs of our finance  human resources  information systems  administrative and executive departments as well as third party consulting  legal and other professional fees 
the decrease in general and administrative expenses in  as compared to  was primarily due to a reduction in staffing levels and office occupancy costs as a result of the restructuring plans and a reduction in recruiting efforts 
staffing levels of our general and administrative personnel decreased by in as compared to the decrease in was offset in part by an increase in the use of external legal and professional services related to the business objects litigation as well as certain other matters

during  we adopted restructuring plans which included a strategic decision to focus operations on the business intelligence market  the elimination or reduction of speculative technology initiatives  a reduction of our workforce and a consolidation of our multiple northern virginia facilities into a single location in mclean  virginia 
as a result of these restructuring plans  we recorded restructuring and impairment charges of million during for severance costs and other benefits for terminated employees  costs associated with exiting facilities and fees incurred for professional services directly related to the restructuring 
costs associated with exiting facilities included estimated sublease losses  representing the excess of lease costs over sublease income  estimated sublease commissions and concessions and other facility closing costs including rent expense while the office space is vacant 
on a quarterly basis  we assess the adequacy of our restructuring reserve based upon changes in current market conditions 
due to a decline in estimated sublease rates and an increase in the expected length of time to sublease vacant space  we updated our accrued restructuring costs by recording additional sublease losses of million during during  we further updated our estimated sublease losses and recorded an increase in our restructuring reserve of million due to a sustained high level of vacancy rates in the commercial real estate market and difficulties experienced in subleasing idle space 
in connection with a periodic assessment of the carrying value of long lived assets  we concluded that the products derived from our teracube intangible asset  which had been acquired in connection with the purchase of intellectual property and other tangible and intangible assets relating to ncr corporation s teracube project  would not generate sufficient cash flow to support its carrying value 
accordingly  we recorded an impairment charge of million in to write down that intangible asset to its fair value 
during  we updated our periodic assessment of the carrying value of our teracube intangible asset and determined it would not generate sufficient cash flow to support any carrying value 
accordingly  during  we recorded an additional impairment charge of million to write off the remaining teracube intangible asset 
amounts related to the estimated sublease losses associated with exiting facilities and terminations of computer and equipment leases will be paid over the respective lease terms through february as a result of the restructuring  we have approximately  square feet of vacant office space with the following expiration dates  square feet expire in august  and  square feet expire in february of the  square feet of vacant office space   square feet has been subleased as of december  the remaining vacant office space continues to be marketed for sublease

at december   we had million in gross lease obligations and million of estimated commissions  concessions and 
table of contents other costs  partially offset by million in estimated gross sublease income recoveries during the remaining lease terms 
we estimated our sublease losses based upon current information available relating to sublease commission costs  sub tenant concession costs  sublease rental income and the length of time expected to sublease excess space 
final amounts could differ from current estimates if we are unable to sublet the remaining vacant office space on the estimated terms 
for example  if our estimates relating to sublease income and costs to sublease differ from current estimates by  our final restructuring costs could be approximately  higher 
we may also continue to seek to terminate certain leases early  however  our landlords may not be willing to terminate such lease arrangements under terms and conditions that are acceptable to us

amortization of goodwill and intangible assets 
the decrease in amortization expense from to was primarily due to the impairment charge of million recorded in to write down the carrying value of our teracube intangible asset to its fair value 
additionally  as of january   we ceased amortizing goodwill as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
during  our amortization of goodwill was immaterial

during  we completed our distribution of consideration under these lawsuits 
based on the terms of the settlement agreements  we established an initial estimate for the cost of the litigation settlement during subsequently  during each successive financial reporting period prior to distribution of the consideration  we updated the estimated value assigned to each individual component of the settlement based upon valuation assumptions stemming from the settlement 
as a result of changes in the estimated market borrowing rate and discount on the series a notes  declines in the value of our class a common stock and reductions in the estimated fair value of warrants issued in connection with the litigation settlement  we recorded aggregate reductions in the provision for the litigation settlement of million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively

benefit provision for income taxes 
during the year ended december   we recognized a net benefit for income taxes of million 
this benefit included a million reduction of valuation allowances on net operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets in certain foreign subsidiaries that continued to demonstrate profitability 
this benefit was partially offset by income tax expense incurred in our foreign operations 
also during  we recognized a deferred tax asset of million primarily related to domestic tax losses and certain other items 
however  because the realization of this deferred tax asset does not meet the more likely than not criteria under sfas no 
 we recorded a full valuation allowance on this benefit

deferred revenue and advance payments deferred revenue and advance payments primarily represent product support and other services fees that are collected in advance and recognized over the contract service period and product license and product support and other services fees relating to multiple element software arrangements that include future deliverables 
aggregate deferred revenue and advance payments were million as of december  compared to million as of december  the increase in deferred revenue and advance payments was primarily attributable to an ongoing increase in our installed base of software licenses under technical support contracts  an increase in the average rate charged for technical support during and our high renewal rates of such contracts during the increase was partially offset by a reduction of deferred revenue and advance payment balances due to the recognition of revenues on existing license and technical support contracts 
we expect to recognize approximately million of this deferred revenue and advance payments over the next months  however  the timing and ultimate recognition of our deferred revenue and advance payments depend on our performance of various service obligations  and the amount of deferred revenue and advance payments at any date should not be considered indicative of revenues for any succeeding period

also contributing to the change in were increased revenues and an improvement in operating results 
the change from to was primarily attributable to an improvement in operating results from continuing operations and a decrease in cash used for payment of accounts payable and accrued expenses

based upon our cash position  we do not currently expect to borrow money to finance our operations 
our liquidity and capital resources and ability to generate revenues are subject to various business and economic risks discussed below under risk factors 
recent accounting standards in november  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
fin requires a company to recognize the fair value for certain guarantee obligations on the date of issuance of the guarantee 
the initial recognition and measurement provisions of fin are applicable on a prospective basis for guarantee arrangements issued or modified by us after december  fin also requires a company to make certain additional disclosures even when the likelihood of payment under the guarantee is remote 
the adoption of fin had no impact on our results of operations 
pursuant to fin and subsequent fasb staff positions  intellectual property infringement indemnifications are subject to the disclosure requirements of fin  but are exempt from its initial recognition and measurement provisions 
we typically include our standard intellectual property indemnification clauses in our software license agreements 
pursuant to these clauses  we agree to defend and hold harmless the indemnified party  typically our customers  business partners and their directors  officers  employees and agents  in connection with certain intellectual property infringement claims by third parties relating to our products 
the term of the indemnification clauses varies  typically ranging from five years to perpetuity  and generally applies at any time after the execution of the software license agreement 
in addition  we generally warrant that our software products will perform in all material respects in accordance with our standard published software specifications in effect at the time of delivery of the licensed products to the customer for a specified period of time following delivery  typically to days 
we have not experienced any material intellectual property indemnification or warranty claims historically and have no amounts accrued as of december  relating to such obligations 

table of contents we are also a party to a variety of other agreements with current and former customers  vendors  landlords  employees  directors and others pursuant to which we may be obligated to make payments to guaranteed parties 
for example  such indemnification arrangements may obligate us to make payments to a property owner in the event of an adverse judgment in a lawsuit or the imposition of additional taxes in connection with real estate leased by us 
these obligations may require the other party to make an adverse claim pursuant to procedures specified in the specific agreement  and our obligations may be limited in terms of time  and or amount  or otherwise be qualified 
it is not possible to predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under such agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement 
to date  we have not incurred material indemnification expense under these agreements and have not accrued any amounts relating to such provisions in our financial statements 
in november  the eitf reached a consensus on eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
eitf issue no 
provides guidance on how to account for arrangements that involve the delivery or performance of multiple products  services and or rights to use assets 
eitf issue no 
is applicable to revenue arrangements entered into or modified after june  the provisions of this consensus did not have any effect on our financial position and results of operations 
in january  the fasb issued fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
in december  the fasb revised fin no 
to reflect decisions it made regarding a number of implementation issues 
fin no 
 as revised  requires that the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity consolidate the entity even if the primary beneficiary does not have a majority voting interest 
this interpretation applies to certain entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support 
this interpretation also identifies those situations where a controlling financial interest may be achieved through arrangements that do not involve voting interests 
the interpretation also establishes additional disclosures which are required regarding an enterprise s involvement with a variable interest entity when it is not the primary beneficiary 
the requirements of this interpretation are required to be applied for all new variable interest entities created or acquired after january  for variable interest entities created or acquired prior to february   the provisions must be applied for the first interim or annual period ending after december  we do not have any controlling interest  contractual relationships or other business relationships with unconsolidated variable interest entities and therefore the adoption of this standard did not have any effect on our financial position and results of operations 
in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
amends and clarifies accounting for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities under sfas no 
the statement requires that contracts with comparable characteristics be accounted for similarly and clarifies when a derivative contains a financing component that warrants special reporting in the statement of cash flows 
sfas no 
is effective for contracts entered into or modified after june   except in certain circumstances  and for hedging relationships designated after june  the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations

risk factors you should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing microstrategy 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations 

table of contents if any of the following risks actually occur  our business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
in such case  the trading price of our class a common stock could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment 
we may not be able to achieve profitability in the future we incurred a net loss of million for the year ended december   including a million charge attributable to the conversion of our series a notes into shares of class a common stock on july  as of december   our accumulated deficit was million 
although we expect to be profitable in  we may not be able to achieve profitability in this or any other future period 
our quarterly operating results  revenues and expenses may fluctuate significantly  which could have an adverse effect on the market price of our stock for a number of reasons  including those described below  our operating results  revenues and expenses may vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
these fluctuations could have an adverse effect on the market price of our class a common stock 
fluctuations in quarterly operating results 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate as a result of the size  timing  volume and execution of significant orders and shipments  the mix of products and services of customer orders  which can affect whether we recognize revenue upon the signing and delivery of our software products or whether revenue must be recognized as work progresses or over the entire contract period  the timing of new product announcements  changes in our pricing policies or those of our competitors  market acceptance of business intelligence software generally and of new and enhanced versions of our products in particular  the length of our sales cycles  changes in our operating expenses  personnel changes  our success in adding to our indirect distribution channels  utilization of our consulting personnel  which can be affected by delays or deferrals of customer implementation of our software products and consulting  education and support services  changes in foreign currency exchange rates  which had a positive impact on our results for the year ended december   and seasonal factors  such as our traditionally lower pace of new sales in the summer 
limited ability to adjust expenses 
we base our operating expense budgets on expected revenue trends 
many of our expenses  such as office and equipment leases and certain personnel costs  are relatively fixed 
we may be unable to adjust spending quickly enough to offset any unexpected revenue shortfall 
accordingly  any shortfall in revenue may cause significant variation in operating results in any quarter 
based on the above factors  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results are not a good indication of our future performance 
it is possible that in one or more future quarters  our operating results may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
in that event  the trading price of our class a common stock may fall 

table of contents we rely on our strategic channel partners and if we are unable to develop or maintain successful relationships with them  our business  operating results and financial condition will suffer in addition to our direct sales force  we rely on strategic channel partners such as value added resellers  system integrators and original equipment manufacturers to license and support our products in the united states and internationally 
in particular  for the years ended december   and  channel partners accounted for  directly or indirectly  approximately  and of our total product licenses revenues  respectively 
our channel partners generally offer customers the products of several different companies  including some products that compete with ours 
although we believe that direct sales will continue to account for a majority of product license revenues  we are seeking to increase the level of indirect sales activities through our strategic channel partners  however  we may not be successful in our efforts to expand indirect sales in this manner 
we may not be able to attract strategic partners who will market our products effectively and who will be qualified to provide timely and cost effective customer support and service 
our ability to achieve revenue growth in the future will depend in part on our success in developing and maintaining successful relationships with those strategic partners 
if we are unable to develop or maintain our relationships with these strategic partners  our business  operating results and financial condition will suffer 
our recognition of deferred revenue and advance payments is subject to future performance obligations and may not be representative of revenues for succeeding periods our deferred revenue and advance payments were million as of december  the timing and ultimate recognition of our deferred revenue and advance payments depend on our performance of various service obligations 
because of the possibility of customer changes in development schedules  delays in implementation and development efforts and the need to satisfactorily perform product support services  deferred revenue and advance payments at any particular date may not be representative of actual revenue for any succeeding period 
managing our international operations is complex and our failure to do so successfully or in a cost effective manner would have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition international sales accounted for  and of our total revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
our international operations require significant management attention and financial resources 
there are certain risks inherent in our international business activities including changes in foreign currency exchange rates  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs and other trade barriers  costs of localizing products for foreign countries  lack of acceptance of localized products in foreign countries  longer accounts receivable payment cycles  difficulties in managing international operations  tax issues  including restrictions on repatriating earnings  weaker intellectual property protection in other countries  economic weakness or currency related crises that may arise in different countries or geographic regions  and the burden of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws 

table of contents these factors may have a material adverse effect on our future international sales and  consequently  on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we may lose sales  or sales may be delayed  due to the long sales and implementation cycles for our products  which would reduce our revenues to date  our customers have typically invested substantial time  money and other resources and involved many people in the decision to license our software products and purchase our consulting and other services 
as a result  we may wait nine months or more after the first contact with a customer for that customer to place an order while they seek internal approval for the purchase of our products and or services 
during this long sales cycle  events may occur that affect the size or timing of the order or even cause it to be canceled 
for example  our competitors may introduce new products  or the customer s own budget and purchasing priorities may change 
even after an order is placed  the time it takes to deploy our products and complete consulting engagements varies widely from one customer to the next 
implementing our product can sometimes last several months  depending on the customer s needs and may begin only with a pilot program 
it may be difficult to deploy our products if the customer has complicated deployment requirements  which typically involve integrating databases  hardware and software from different vendors 
if a customer hires a third party to deploy our products  we cannot be sure that our products will be deployed successfully 
we face intense competition  which may lead to lower prices for our products  reduced gross margins  loss of market share and reduced revenue the markets for business intelligence software  analytical applications and information delivery are intensely competitive and subject to rapidly changing technology 
in addition  many companies in these markets are offering  or may soon offer  products and services that may compete with microstrategy products 
microstrategy s most direct competitors include providers of business intelligence software  olap tools  ad hoc query tools  web based reporting tools  and report delivery and proactive alerting 
each of these markets is discussed more fully below 
business intelligence software 
makers of business intelligence software provide business intelligence capabilities designed for integration  customization and application development 
companies such as microsoft  oracle  hyperion solutions  sap ag  computer associates and sas provide business intelligence software 
olap tools 
companies that build software to perform online analytical processing olap provide offerings competitive with the core microstrategy i platform 
whether web based or client server  these tools give end users the ability to analyze underlying data sources without having to hand code structured query language queries 
most olap tools allow users to build their own calculations and specify report layouts and other options 
additionally  olap tools provide users the ability to navigate throughout the underlying data in an easy  graphical style  often referred to as drilling 
additional olap capabilities include pivoting and filtering 
providers of olap tools include cognos  hyperion solutions  ibm  sap and microsoft 

table of contents ad hoc query tools 
ad hoc query tools allow large numbers of end users to gain access to pre defined reports and queries for simple analysis 
often each end user is able to specify some personalized run time criteria that customize the result set for that particular person 
some limited drilling is also provided 
some ad hoc query tools allow users to access databases and create their own database queries using structured query language 
users are then able to export the resulting data into other formats such as microsoft excel for their own use 
companies that produce query and reporting tools include business objects  cognos  oracle  hyperion solutions and information builders 
web based reporting tools 
companies that offer software to deliver pre built reports for end user viewing and consumption can also compete with microstrategy 
extensive formatting capabilities ensure that users can easily consume the information contained in the reports 
there is limited user interactivity with these reports generated by reporting tools 
reporting applications built with these tools often lack the sophistication  robustness and scalability of the microstrategy platform  but can be attractive for small departments 
vendors in this category include actuate  business objects  microsoft and sas 
report delivery and proactive alerting 
companies that focus on the proactive delivery of information  via e mail  website  or other medium can compete with microstrategy s offerings 
typically  these tools serve to push out compiled reports on a scheduled basis to sets of users based on job type 
microstrategy software has integrated this technology into the microstrategy i platform 
vendors of such technology include actuate and business objects 
many of our competitors have longer operating histories  significantly greater financial  technical  marketing or other resources  and greater name recognition than we do 
in addition  many of our competitors have strong relationships with current and potential customers and extensive knowledge of the business intelligence industry 
as a result  they may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of their products than we can 
increased competition may lead to price cuts  reduced gross margins and loss of market share 
we may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors and the failure to meet the competitive pressures we face may have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
current and future competitors may also make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with others 
by doing so  they may increase their ability to meet the needs of our potential customers 
our current or prospective indirect channel partners may establish cooperative relationships with our current or future competitors 
these relationships may limit our ability to sell our products through specific distribution channels 
accordingly  new competitors or alliances among current and future competitors may emerge and rapidly gain significant market share 
these developments could limit our ability to obtain revenues from new customers and to maintain technical support revenues from our installed customer base 
our inability to develop and release product enhancements and new products to respond to rapid technological change in a timely and cost effective manner would have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition the market for our products is characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product introductions and enhancements  changing customer demands and evolving industry standards 
the introduction of products embodying new technologies can quickly make existing products obsolete and unmarketable 
we believe that our future success depends largely on three factors our ability to continue to support a number of popular operating systems and databases  our ability to maintain and improve our current product line  and our ability to rapidly develop new products that achieve market acceptance  maintain technological competitiveness and meet an expanding range of customer requirements 

table of contents business intelligence applications are inherently complex  and it can take a long time to develop and test major new products and product enhancements 
in addition  customers may delay their purchasing decisions because they anticipate that new or enhanced versions of our products will soon become available 
we cannot be sure that we will succeed in developing and marketing  on a timely and cost effective basis  product enhancements or new products that respond to technological change or new customer requirements  nor can we be sure that any new products and product enhancements will achieve market acceptance 
the emergence of new industry standards may adversely affect our ability to market our existing products the emergence of new industry standards in related fields may adversely affect the demand for our existing products 
this could happen  for example  if new web standards and technologies emerged that were incompatible with customer deployments of our products 
although the core database component of our business intelligence solutions is compatible with nearly all major enterprise server hardware and operating system combinations  such as os  as  unix  linux and windows  certain of our application server components run only on the windows nt  server and server operating systems 
therefore  our ability to increase sales currently depends in part on the continued acceptance of the windows nt and windows server operating systems and in part on our ability to port certain components of our software to non windows based operating systems 
the nature of our products makes them particularly vulnerable to undetected errors  or bugs  which could cause problems with how the products perform and which could in turn reduce demand for our products  reduce our revenue and lead to product liability claims against us software products as complex as ours may contain errors or defects 
although we test our products extensively  we have in the past discovered software errors in new products after their introduction 
despite testing by us and by our current and potential customers  errors may be found in new products or releases after commercial shipments begin 
this could result in lost revenue or delays in market acceptance  which could have a material adverse effect upon our business  operating results and financial condition 
our license agreements with customers typically contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to product liability claims 
it is possible  however  that these provisions may not be effective under the laws of certain domestic or international jurisdictions 
although there have been no product liability claims against us to date  our license and support of products may involve the risk of these claims 
a successful product liability claim against us could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
if we are unable to recruit or retain skilled personnel  or if we lose the services of any of our key management personnel  our business  operating results and financial condition would be materially adversely affected our future success depends on our continuing ability to attract  train  assimilate and retain highly skilled personnel 
competition for these employees is intense 
we may not be able to retain our current key employees or attract  train  assimilate or retain other highly skilled personnel in the future 
our future success also depends in large part on the continued service of key management personnel  particularly michael j 
saylor  our chairman and chief executive officer  and sanju k 
bansal  our vice chairman  executive vice president and chief operating officer 
if we lose the services of one or both of these individuals or other key personnel  or if we are unable to attract  train  assimilate and retain the highly skilled personnel we need  our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
because of the rights of our two classes of common stock  and because we are controlled by our existing holders of class b common stock  these stockholders could transfer control of microstrategy to a third party without anyone else s approval or prevent a third party from acquiring microstrategy we have two classes of common stock class a common stock and class b common stock 
holders of our class a common stock generally have the same rights as holders of our class b common stock  except that 
table of contents holders of class a common stock have one vote per share while holders of class b common stock have ten votes per share 
as of march   holders of our class b common stock owned or controlled  shares of class b common stock  or of the total voting power 
michael j 
saylor  our chairman and chief executive officer  controlled shares of class a common stock and  shares of class b common stock  or of the total voting power  as of march  accordingly  mr 
saylor is able to control microstrategy through his ability to determine the outcome of elections of our directors  amend our certificate of incorporation and by laws and take other actions requiring the vote or consent of stockholders  including mergers  going private transactions and other extraordinary transactions and their terms 
our certificate of incorporation allows holders of class b common stock  almost all of whom are current employees or former employees of our company or related parties  to transfer shares of class b common stock  subject to the approval of stockholders possessing a majority of the outstanding class b common stock 
mr 
saylor or a group of stockholders possessing a majority of the outstanding class b common stock could  without seeking anyone else s approval  transfer voting control of microstrategy to a third party 
such a transfer of control could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
mr 
saylor will also be able to prevent a change of control of microstrategy  regardless of whether holders of class a common stock might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over the then current market price 
we have only limited protection for our proprietary rights in our software  which makes it difficult to prevent third parties from infringing upon our rights we rely primarily on a combination of copyright  patent  trademark and trade secret laws  customer licensing agreements  employee and third party nondisclosure agreements and other methods to protect our proprietary rights 
however  these laws and contractual provisions provide only limited protection 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology 
policing such unauthorized use is difficult  and we cannot be certain that we can prevent it  particularly in countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 
our products may be susceptible to claims by other companies that our products infringe upon their proprietary rights  which could adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition as the number of software products in our target markets increases and the functionality of these products further overlaps  we may become increasingly subject to claims by a third party that our technology infringes such party s proprietary rights 
regardless of their merit  any such claims could be time consuming and expensive to defend  may divert management s attention and resources  could cause product shipment delays and could require us to enter into costly royalty or licensing agreements 
if successful  a claim of infringement against us and our inability to license the infringed or similar technology could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
on october   business objects filed suit against us in the united states district court for the northern district of california  claiming that our software infringes a patent issued to business objects relating to relational database access the patent 
the suit sought injunctive relief and monetary damages 
on august   the court granted our motion for summary judgment and dismissed the lawsuit  ruling as a matter of law that our products do not infringe the patent 
business objects has filed an appeal 
on october   we filed suit against business objects  sa and its subsidiary  business objects americas  inc  in the united states district court for the eastern district of virginia  claiming that business objects software infringes two patents held by us relating to asynchronous control of report generation using a web browser the patent and a system and method of adapting automatic output of olap reports to disparate user output devices the patent 
the complaint against business objects was amended to add claims for violations of the federal computer fraud and abuse act  misappropriation of trade secrets  tortious interference with contractual relations  and violations of the virginia conspiracy act 
as a result of pre trial 
table of contents rulings  certain of these claims were dismissed 
our claims for tortious interference and misappropriation of trade secrets proceeded to trial on october  on october   the court dismissed the tortious interference claim 
the court has yet to issue a ruling on the merits of the misappropriation of trade secrets claim  for which we are seeking various equitable remedies against business objects 
in july  the united states patent trademark office confirmed the validity of all the claims in the and patents and terminated reexamination proceedings that business objects had requested as to those patents 
we agreed to dismissal of the patent claims without prejudice 
our patent claims are currently scheduled to proceed to trial on june  we are seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief 
on december   we filed a complaint for patent infringement against crystal decisions  inc in the united states district court for the district of delaware 
the lawsuit alleges that crystal decisions willfully infringes three patents issued to us relating to i asynchronous control of report generation using a web browser the patent  ii management of an automatic olap report broadcast system the patent  and iii providing business intelligence web content with reduced client side processing the patent 
we are seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief 
following the filing of the complaint  crystal decisions was acquired by business objects americas  inc business objects americas  inc 
has answered the complaint  denying infringement and seeking a declaration that the patents in suit are invalid and not infringed by business objects americas  inc the case is in its earliest stages 
trial is scheduled for november if the market for business intelligence software fails to grow as we expect  or if businesses fail to adopt our products  our business  operating results and financial condition would be materially adversely affected nearly all of our revenues to date have come from sales of business intelligence software and related technical support  consulting and education services 
we expect these sales to account for a large portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future 
although demand for business intelligence software has grown in recent years  the market for business intelligence software applications is still emerging 
resistance from consumer and privacy groups to increased commercial collection and use of data on spending patterns and other personal behavior and recent european union restrictions on the collection and use of personal data may impair the further growth of this market  as may other developments 
we cannot be sure that this market will continue to grow or  even if it does grow  that businesses will adopt our solutions 
we have spent  and intend to keep spending  considerable resources to educate potential customers about business intelligence software in general and our solutions in particular 
however  we cannot be sure that these expenditures will help our products achieve any additional market acceptance 
if the market fails to grow or grows more slowly than we currently expect  our business  operating results and financial condition would be materially adversely affected 
we have substantial real estate lease commitments for unoccupied space and if we are unable to sublet this space on acceptable terms our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected we are party to real estate leases for approximately  square feet of vacant office space 
of the  square feet of vacant office space   square feet has been subleased as of december  we have established a restructuring reserve of million related to the costs of disposition of this space as of december  in establishing this reserve  we have assumed that we will be able to sublet the available space and receive approximately million of sublease income relating to this space over the term of the respective leases 
we may not be able to sublet this space on the assumed terms 
if we are unable to do so  we would incur additional restructuring costs relating to these leases and would expend more cash than currently expected  which could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
the price of our stock may be extremely volatile the market price for our class a common stock has historically been volatile and could fluctuate significantly for any of the following reasons quarter to quarter variations in our operating results  developments or disputes concerning proprietary rights  
table of contents technological innovations or new products  governmental regulatory action  general conditions in the software industry  increased price competition  changes in revenue or earnings estimates by analysts  or other events or factors 
many of the above factors are beyond our control 
the stock market has recently experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations 
these fluctuations have particularly affected the market price of many software companies  often without regard to their operating performance 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about our market risk disclosures involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations 
interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our cash equivalents and short term investments 
we invest our excess cash in short term  fixed income financial instruments 
these fixed rate investments are subject to interest rate risk and may fall in value if market interest rates increase 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from the levels at december   the fair market value of the portfolio would decline by an immaterial amount 
we have the ability to hold our fixed income investments until maturity and  therefore  we do not expect our operating results or cash flows to be materially affected by a sudden change in market interest rates on our investment portfolio 
foreign currency risk we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
our international revenues and expenses are denominated in foreign currencies  principally the euro and the british pound sterling 
the functional currency of each of our foreign subsidiaries is the local currency 
our international business is subject to risks typical of an international business  including  but not limited to differing tax structures  other regulations and restrictions  and foreign exchange rate volatility 
based on our overall currency rate exposure at december   a change in foreign exchange rates would have had an immaterial effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
international revenues were   and of total revenues in   and  respectively 
we anticipate that international revenues will continue to account for a significant amount of total revenues 
to date  we have not hedged the risks associated with foreign exchange exposure 
although we may do so in the future  we cannot be sure that any hedging techniques we may implement will be successful or that our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows will not be materially adversely affected by exchange rate fluctuations
