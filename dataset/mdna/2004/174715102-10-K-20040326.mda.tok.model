the resort and its related services employ approximately  people from the corporation s service area

capital standards 
the frb  fdic and other federal banking agencies have established risk based capital adequacy guidelines intended to provide a measure of capital adequacy that reflects the degree of risk associated with a bank s operations 
a banking organization s risk based capital ratios are obtained by dividing its qualifying capital by its total risk adjusted assets and off balance sheet items 
since december   the federal banking agencies have required a minimum ratio of qualifying total capital to risk adjusted assets and off balance sheet items of  and a minimum ratio of tier capital to risk adjusted assets and off balance sheet items of 
in addition to the risk based guidelines  federal banking regulators require banking organizations to maintain a minimum amount of tier capital to total assets  referred to as the leverage ratio 
for a banking organization rated in the highest of the five categories used by regulators to rate banking organizations  the minimum leverage ratio of tier capital to total assets is 
prompt corrective action and other enforcement mechanisms 
the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of fdicia requires each federal banking agency to take prompt corrective action to resolve the problems of insured depository institutions  including but not limited to those that fall below one or more of the prescribed minimum capital ratios 
the law requires each federal banking agency to promulgate regulations defining the following five categories in which an insured depository institution will be placed  based on the level of its capital ratios well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized  and critically undercapitalized 
the corporation and bank are classified as well capitalized under these guidelines 
safety and soundness standards 
fdicia also implemented certain specific restrictions on transactions and required the regulators to adopt overall safety and soundness standards for depository institutions related to internal control  loan underwriting and documentation  and asset growth 
among other things  fdicia limits the interest rates paid on deposits by undercapitalized institutions  the use of brokered deposits and the aggregate extension of credit by a depository institution to an executive officer  director  principal shareholder or related interest  and reduces deposit insurance coverage for deposits offered by undercapitalized institutions for deposits by certain employee benefits accounts 
restrictions on dividends and other distributions 
the power of the board of directors of an insured depository institution to declare a cash dividend or other distribution with respect to capital is subject to statutory and regulatory restrictions which limit the amount available for such distribution depending upon the earnings  financial condition and cash needs of the institution  as well as general business conditions 
the corporation s ability to pay dividends depends in large part on the ability of the bank to pay dividends to the corporation 
the approval of the mississippi department of banking and consumer finance is required prior to the bank paying dividends  dividends are limited to earned surplus in excess of three times the bank s capital stock 
frb regulations limit the amount the bank may loan to the corporation unless those loans are collateralized by specific obligations 
at december   the maximum amount available for transfer from the bank in the form of cash dividends and loans was of the bank s consolidated net assets 
fdic insurance assessments 
the fdic has established several mechanisms to increase funds to protect deposits insured by the bank insurance fund bif and the savings association insurance fund saif  both of which are administered by the fdic 
the bank s deposits are insured through bif except for those deposits the bank acquired from the resolution trust corporation in april  this acquisition consisted of one branch of the former security federal savings and loan in kosciusko  mississippi  and these deposits remain insured through saif 
deposit insurance premiums for banks and savings associations were increased as a result of the financial institutions reform  recovery and enforcement act of  and losses incurred by the fdic in connection with the default or assistance of troubled federally insured financial institutions are required to be reimbursed by other federally insured financial institutions 
other bhc act provisions the bhc act requires a bank holding company to obtain prior approval of the frb before acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than of the voting shares of any bank that is not already majority owned by such bank holding company 
the bhc act provides that the frb shall not approve any acquisition  merger or consolidation which would result in a monopoly or which would be in furtherance of any combination or conspiracy to monopolize or attempt to monopolize the business of banking 
neither will the frb approve any other transactions in which the effect might substantially lessen competition  or in any manner be a restraint on trade  unless the anti competitive effects of the proposed transaction are clearly outweighed in the public interest by the probable effect of the transaction in meeting the convenience and needs of the community to be served 
the bhc act also prohibits a bank holding company  with certain exceptions  from itself engaging in or acquiring direct or indirect control of more than of the voting shares of any company engaged in non banking activities 
the principal exception is for engaging in or acquiring shares of a company whose activities are found by the frb to be so closely related to banking or managing banks as to be a proper incident thereto 
in making such determinations  the frb is required to consider whether the performance of such activities by a bank holding company or its subsidiaries can reasonably be expected to produce benefits to the public such as greater convenience  increased competition  or gains in efficiency of resources versus the risks of possible adverse effects such as decreased or unfair competition  conflicts of interest  or unsound banking practices 
the bhc act prohibits the acquisition by a bank holding company of more than of the outstanding voting shares of a bank located outside the state in which the operations of its banking subsidiaries are principally conducted  unless such an acquisition is specifically authorized by statute of the state in which the bank to be acquired is located 
we and our bank are subject to certain restrictions imposed by the federal reserve act and the federal deposit insurance act on any extensions of credit to the company or the bank  or investments in the stock or other securities of the company or the bank  and on taking such stock or other securities as collateral for loans of any borrower 
the bhc act was recently amended to permit financial holding companies to engage in a broader range of nonbanking financial activities  such as underwriting and selling insurance  providing financial or investment advice  and dealing and making markets in securities and merchant banking 
the gramm leach bliley act was enacted on november   and became effective on march  in order to qualify as a financial holding company  we must declare to the federal reserve our intention to become a financial holding company and certify that our depository subsidiary meets the capitalization management requirements and that it has at least a satisfactory rating under the community reinvestment act of as of december   we had not elected to become a financial holding company

if a state opted out prior to june   then banks located in that state may not participate in interstate branching 
effective may   mississippi opted in to the interstate branching provision of the interstate act 
community reinvestment act 
the community reinvestment act of  as amended cra  requires the assessment by the appropriate regulatory authority of a financial institution s record in meeting the credit needs of the local community  including low and moderate income neighborhoods 
the regulations promulgated under cra emphasize an assessment of actual performance rather than of the procedures followed by a bank  to evaluate compliance with the cra 
cra compliance is also a factor in evaluations of proposed mergers  acquisitions and applications to open new branches or facilities 
overall cra compliance continues to be rated across a four point scale from outstanding to substantial noncompliance  and continues to be a factor in review of applications to merge  to establish new branches or for the formation of bank holding companies 
different evaluation methods are used depending on the asset size of the bank 
the fdic examined the bank on june  and again most recently on august   for its performance under the cra 
the bank was rated satisfactory during both of these examinations 
no discriminatory practices or illegal discouragement of applications were found

the sarbanes act also accelerates section insider reporting obligations  restricts certain executive officer and director transactions  imposes new obligations on corporate audit committees and provides for enhanced review by the sec 
impact of monetary policies 
banking is a business that depends on interest rate differentials 
in general  the difference between the interest paid by a bank on its deposits and other borrowings  and the interest rate earned by banks on loans  securities and other interest earning assets comprises the major source of banks earnings 
thus  the earnings and growth of banks are subject to the influence of economic conditions generally  both domestic and foreign  and also to the monetary and fiscal policies of the united states and its agencies 
the nature and timing of any future changes in such policies and their impact on the corporation cannot be predicted 
competition the banking business is a highly competitive business 
the corporation s market area consists principally of neshoba  newton  leake  scott  attala  lauderdale  winston and kemper counties in mississippi  although the corporation also competes with other financial institutions in those counties and in surrounding counties in mississippi in obtaining deposits and providing many types of financial services 
the corporation competes with larger regional banks for the business of companies located in the corporation s market area 
a healthy economy  such as the corporation s market area is experiencing  invites certain challenges  especially that of competition 
all financial institutions today are faced with the challenge of competing for customers deposits  and the corporation is no exception 
the corporation competes with savings and loan associations  credit unions  production credit associations  federal land banks  finance companies  personal loan companies  money market funds and other non depository financial intermediaries 
many of these financial institutions have resources many times greater than those of the corporation 
in addition  new financial intermediaries such as money market mutual funds and large retailers are not subject to the same regulations and laws that govern the operation of traditional depository institutions 
the corporation believes it benefits from a good reputation in the community and from the significant length of time it has provided needed banking services to its customers 
also  as a locally owned financial institution  the corporation believes it is able to respond to the needs of the community with services tailored to the particular demands of its customers 
also  as a local institution  the corporation believes it can provide these services faster than a larger institution 
recent changes in federal and state law have resulted in  and are expected to continue to result in  increased competition 
the reductions in legal barriers to the acquisition of banks by out of state bank holding companies resulting from implementation of the interstate act and other recent and proposed changes are expected to continue to further stimulate competition in the markets in which the corporation operates  although it is not possible to predict the extent or timing of such increased competition 
currently  there are approximately fourteen different financial institutions in the corporation s market area competing for the same customer base 
despite these challenges  the corporation has not only been able to maintain its market share  but has actually increased its share in recent years 
the corporation competes in its market for loan and deposit products along with many of the other services required by today s banking customer 
the corporation believes it is able to compete favorably in its markets  in terms of both the rates we offer and the level of service that we provide to our customers 
item properties the corporation  through the bank  currently operates from its main office in downtown philadelphia  and from additional branches in neshoba  newton  leake  scott  attala  lauderdale  winston and kemper counties  all located in mississippi
