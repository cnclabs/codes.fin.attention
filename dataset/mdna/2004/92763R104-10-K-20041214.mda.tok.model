item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this filing 
overview business environment virage logic corporation provides semiconductor intellectual property semiconductor ip platforms based on memory  logic and i os input output interface components that are silicon proven and production ready 
these various forms of ip are utilized by our customers to design and manufacture system on a chip soc integrated circuits that power today s consumer  communications and networking  handheld and portable  computer and graphics  and automotive applications 
our customers include fabless semiconductor companies  integrated device manufacturers and foundries 
as semiconductor companies face increasing pressures to bring products to market faster and semiconductors have shorter product cycles  we focus on providing our customers a broad product offering as a means to satisfy a larger portion of our customers semiconductor ip needs  while positioning ourselves to offer advanced products as the semiconductor industry migrates to lower geometries 
the timing of customer purchases of our products is typically related to new design starts by fabless companies and migration to new manufacturing processes by idms and foundries 
because of the high costs involved in new design starts and migration to new manufacturing processes  our customers decision regarding these matters is heavily dependent on their long term business outlook 
as a result  our business  and specifically our license revenues  is likely to grow at times of positive outlook for the semiconductor industry 
while in the first part of fiscal we have seen signs of a moderate recovery in the semiconductor industry  we believe that our customers remain cautious in their long term business outlook 
we did see an increase in design starts in micron and nanometer process nodes during fiscal furthermore  the capabilities offered by our star memory system to improve yield and time to market and help reduce our customers overall costs became more important in these lower geometries  which contributed to an increase in our license revenues 
in fiscal  we derived of license revenue from the more advanced processes  micron and nm technologies  and from the older process nodes  predominantly  and micron technologies 
the company expects the micron and nm technologies to drive revenue growth in the foreseeable future while license revenues from the older process nodes decline 
the company s royalty revenue to date has been from production on the older process nodes and we expect future growth in royalty revenues to be driven by the advanced processes  micron and nm technologies  in addition to continued production on the micron technology 
we sell our product early in the design process  and there are time delays of to months between the sale of our products and the time we expect to receive royalty revenues 
these time delays are due to the length of time required for our customers to implement our semiconductor ip into their design  and then to manufacture  market and sell a product incorporating our products 
as a result  we expect our royalty revenues to increase in periods in which manufacturing volumes of semiconductors are growing as was the case during fiscal future growth of our royalty revenue is dependent on our ability to increase the number of designs incorporating our products and on such designs achieving substantial manufacturing volumes 
sources of revenues our revenues are derived principally from licenses of our semiconductor ip products  which include embedded memory  logic and i o elements  standard and custom memory compilers  
table of contents memory test processor and fuse box components for embedded test and repair of defective memory cells 
we also derive revenues from royalties  custom design services  maintenance services and library development and consulting services related to license of logic components 
our revenues are reported in two separate categories license revenues and royalty revenues 
license revenues are derived from license fees  maintenance fees  fees for custom design services  library design services and consulting services 
royalty revenues are derived from fees paid by a customer or a third party foundry based on production volumes of wafers containing chips utilizing our semiconductor ip technologies 
the license of our semiconductor ip typically covers a range of embedded memory  logic and i o products 
licenses of our semiconductor ip products can be either perpetual or term based 
in addition  maintenance can be purchased for both types of licenses 
we derive our royalty revenues from third party foundries that manufacture chips incorporating our area  speed and power asap memory products for our fabless customers  and from integrated device manufacturers and fabless customers that utilize our star memory system tm  netcam tm and novea tm technologies 
royalty payments are in addition to the license fees we collect from our customers  and are calculated based on production volumes of wafers containing chips utilizing our semiconductor ip technologies based on a rate per chip or rate per wafer depending on the terms of the respective license agreement 
royalty revenues are generally determined and recognized one quarter in arrears  when a production volume report is received from the customer or foundry 
currently  license fees represent a significant portion of our revenues  although over the last few years royalties have represented an increased percentage of our revenues 
royalty revenues for the years ended september   and were million  million and million  respectively 
we have been dependent on a limited number of customers for a substantial portion of our annual revenues  although that dependency continues to decrease 
customers comprising our top customer group have changed from time to time 
in each of fiscal   and  no single customer generated more than of our revenues 
sales to customers located outside north america accounted for   and of our revenues in fiscal   and  respectively 
substantially all of our direct sales representatives and field application engineers are located in north america and europe and serve those regions 
in japan and the rest of asia  we use both indirect sales through distributors and direct sales through sales representatives 
all revenues to date have been denominated in us dollars 
significant events in fiscal we achieved revenue of million during fiscal year  up percent from million for fiscal year gaap net income for fiscal year was million  or per share  compared with a gaap net loss for fiscal year of million  or per share 
we also achieved record quarterly revenues of million during the fourth quarter of fiscal  up percent from million for the fourth quarter of fiscal  and up percent from million for the third quarter of fiscal our royalty revenues continued to improve  increasing from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year mainly as a result of a significant increase in manufacturing volumes by foundries in asia  particularly of micron technology 
we continue to create and build relationships with emerging foundries and have entered into agreements with dongbuanam  silterra and smic 
this expands the number of technologies for which we sell our products and has the potential to increase our future royalties from customers that use these foundries 
we introduced the iprima mobile tm ultra low power memories as the first offering in our iprima family of application optimized semiconductor ip platforms designed to address the requirements for 
table of contents such markets as consumer  communications and networking  computer and graphics  and portable and handheld and as part of our strategy of offering our customers advanced products that address the costs  yield and technical challenges of smaller geometries 
we continued to penetrate our market  and during fiscal we signed a total of agreements for our nanometer product offerings  direct royalty bearing agreements for the star memory system  direct royalty bearing agreements for the novea memory product and received orders from new customers 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires that we make estimates and judgments  which affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we continually evaluate our estimates  including those related to bad debts  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  and contingencies such as litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we have identified the following as critical accounting policies to our company revenue recognition valuation of accounts receivable valuation of long lived assets and investments valuation of purchased intangibles  including goodwill accounting for stock options income taxes 
revenue recognition our revenue recognition policy is based on the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position  software revenue recognition as amended by statement of position and statement of position additionally  revenue is recognized on some of our products  according to statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
revenues from perpetual licenses for our semiconductor ip products are generally recognized when persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  delivery of the product has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
if any of these criteria are not met  we defer recognizing the revenue until such time as all criteria are met 
revenues from term based licenses  which are generally twelve months in duration  are recognized ratably over the term of the license  provided the criteria mentioned above are met 
license of custom memory compilers and logic libraries may involve customization to the functionality of the software  therefore revenues from such licenses are recognized in accordance with the provisions of statement of position  over the period that we perform services 
revenues derived from library development services are recognized using a percentage of completion method  and revenues from technical consulting services are recognized as the services are performed 
for all license and service agreements accounted for using the percentage of completion method  we determine progress to completion based on labor hours incurred 
we believe we are able to reasonably and reliably estimate the costs to complete projects accounted for using the percentage of completion method 
alternatively  for customers transactions for which we can not reasonably and reliably estimate the costs to complete a project  the completed contract method of accounting is used  such that costs are deferred until the project is completed at which time revenues are recognized 
a provision for estimated losses on engagements is made in the period in which the loss becomes 
table of contents probable and can be reasonably estimated 
costs incurred in advance of billings are recorded as costs in excess of related billings on uncompleted contracts 
if customer acceptance is required for completion of specified milestones  the related revenue is deferred until the acceptance criteria is met 
for agreements which include multiple elements  we recognize revenues attributable to delivered or completed elements covered by such agreements when such elements are completed or delivered 
the amount of such revenues is determined by deducting the aggregate fair value of the undelivered or uncompleted elements  which we determine by each such element s vendor specific objective evidence of fair value  from the total revenues recognizable under such agreement 
vendor specific objective evidence of fair value of each element of an arrangement is based upon the normal pricing for such licensed product and service when sold separately  and for maintenance  it is determined based on the stated renewal rate in each contract 
revenues are recognized once we deliver the element identified as having vendor specific objective evidence or once we complete the provision of the services 
maintenance revenues are recognized ratably over the contractual term of the maintenance period  which is generally twelve months 
the company assesses whether the fee associated with each transaction is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured and evaluates the payment terms 
if a portion of the fee is due beyond normal payment terms  the company recognizes the revenue on the payment due date  assuming collection is reasonably assured 
the company assesses collectibility based on a number of factors  including past transaction history and the overall credit worthiness of the customer 
if collection is not reasonably assured  revenue is deferred and recognized at the time collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of cash 
amounts invoiced to our customers in excess of recognized revenues are recorded as deferred revenues 
the timing and amounts invoiced to customers can vary significantly depending on specific contract terms and can therefore have a significant impact on deferred revenues in any given period 
royalty revenues are generally determined and recognized one quarter in arrears  when a production volume report is received from the customer or foundry  and are calculated based on production volumes of wafers containing chips utilizing our semiconductor ip technologies based on a rate per chip or rate per wafer depending on the terms of the respective license agreement 
while we believe our estimates used in calculating percentage of completion for certain agreements involving customization are reasonable  however different assumptions could materially affect the timing of our revenue recognition 
valuation of accounts receivable we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust customers credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness  as determined by our review of their then current credit information 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain an allowance for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection risks that we have identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the allowance we have established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
since our accounts receivable are concentrated in a relatively small number of customers  a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of any one of these customers could have a material adverse impact on the quality of our accounts receivables and our future operating results 
valuation of long lived assets and investments we periodically review the carrying value of our long lived assets and investments for continued realizability 
this review is based upon our projections of anticipated future cash flows from such assets and investments 
while we believe that our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable  different assumptions regarding such cash flows could materially affect our evaluations  which could result in an impairment charge 

table of contents valuation of purchased intangibles  including goodwill we periodically evaluate purchased intangibles  including goodwill  for impairment 
an assessment of goodwill is subjective by nature  and significant management judgment is required to forecast future operating results  projected cash flows and current period market capitalization levels 
if our estimates or related assumptions change in the future  these changes in conditions could require material write downs of net intangible assets  including impairment charges for goodwill 
in connection with the acquisition of in chip systems inc  the valuation of intangible assets was based on management s estimates 
such estimates included cash flow projections  discount rates and estimated life of technology  which management believes are reasonable under the circumstances 
use of other estimates or assumptions may have resulted in a different valuation for such intangible assets acquired leading to changes in recorded asset values 
intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized over the estimated life of each asset 
as of september   management believes no impairment of intangible assets has occurred 
accounting for stock options we account for outstanding stock options under accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb and financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
fin  and comply with the disclosure provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas 
in accordance with apb  we do not recognize compensation expense for options granted to employees as all employee options are granted with an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the underlying stock 
the company accounts for stock options or warrants granted to non employees  excluding non employee directors  under sfas and eitf issue no 
 accounting for equity instruments with variable terms that are issued for consideration other than employee services under sfas we record the expense of such services based upon the estimated fair value of the equity instrument using the black scholes pricing model 
assumptions used to value the equity instruments are consistent with equity instruments issued to employees 
we charge the value of the equity instrument to earnings over the term of the service agreement 
at the time all non employee options and warrants were valued  the instruments were immediately exercisable and there were no ongoing obligations from the holders 
there were no stock options grants to non employees and no expense recorded in the year ended september  expenses recorded for stock options granted to non employees for the years ended september   and were  and  respectively 
we make estimates and assumptions for the inputs used in the fair value calculation 
material differences in amounts of expense may result if different estimates and assumptions are used 
the financial accounting standards board fasb has recently proposed an accounting standard that will require the fair value of all equity based awards granted to employees be recognized in the income statement as compensation expense 
fasb is expected to issue final rules on stock option expensing in december with an effective date of june we will continue to monitor fasb s progress on the issuance of this standard 
income taxes we record the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
these differences resulted in deferred tax assets of million at september  the carrying value of the company s net deferred tax assets assumes that we will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions  based on estimates and assumptions 
management evaluates the recoverability of the deferred tax assets and assesses the need  if any  for additional valuation allowances 
taxes payable was million and  at september  and  respectively 

table of contents results of operations years ended september   and the following table lists the percentage of revenues for certain items in our consolidated statements of operations for the periods indicated year ended september  revenue license royalties cost and expenses cost of revenues research and development sales and marketing general and administrative stock based compensation in process research and development total cost and expenses operating income loss interest income interest and other expenses income tax provision benefit net income loss revenues 
total revenues in fiscal  and were as follows fiscal year total revenues million million million revenues increased million in from and decreased million from to the increase in revenue was the result of increases in both license revenue and royalty revenue 
the decline in revenues was due to a decline in license revenues  partially offset by an increase in royalties 
the following table lists the percentage of license revenues by geometry for the years ended september    and year ended september  by geometry micron technology micron technology nanometer technology other license revenues increased million in from and declined million from to from a product perspective  the increase in license revenue in was primarily due to increased sales on the nanometer technology from to of total license revenues from to these sales were derived from all categories of our customers idm integrated device manufacturers  fabless and foundry 
table of contents semiconductor customers 
during  the percent of our license revenues derived from micron technology decreased from for fiscal to for fiscal  while the overall license revenue earned from micron technology in fiscal increased by million 
the decrease in license revenues was primarily due to fewer project design starts by fabless semiconductor customers on the micron technology as evidenced by the decrease in sales of the micron technology from to of total license revenues from to  the lower than projected industry adoption of the nanometer technology as evidenced by the decrease in sales of the nanometer technology from to of total license revenues from to  and entering into agreements with select idm customers  who have purchased a full suite of products  which include higher future royalties in exchange for lower upfront license fees 
royalties increased million from to and million from to the increase resulted primarily from significant increase in manufacturing volumes by foundries in asia  particularly of micron technology 
the increase was due to increased royalties from foundries as a result of higher manufacturing volumes  entry of higher numbers of products into production incorporating our ip and the receipt of our first wafer based royalties directly from customers using our star memory system product family that was expanded in fiscal for the years ended september   and  total revenues by geography are as follows year ended september  by geography united states canada japan taiwan europe  middle east and africa emea other total from a geographic perspective  the increase in license revenue in from primarily resulted from a significant increase in sales outside of north america  which was driven by significant sales growth in global idm accounts  by growth in japan  and by a successful strategy of penetrating emerging foundries in the pacific rim 
this increase was evidenced by idm revenue increasing to from of revenue  and foundry revenue increasing to from of revenue 
japan revenue also increased to from of revenue on an expanding base 
the decrease in license revenues was due to the global downturn in the semiconductor industry 
the company experienced decreases in revenue ranging from to in all geographic locations with the exception of asia excluding japan where revenues increased in as compared to we have experienced increased revenues from asia year over year as we continue to build customer relationships and expand sales with emerging foundries 
in europe  we also experienced increased revenues due to higher volumes of product purchased by idm s and increasing royalty revenue 
sales to canada and the us were modestly higher from to due to an expanding customer base  partially offset by continued weakness in the us semiconductor industry 
sales to canada and emea were lower in fiscal as compared to fiscal due to the timing of certain customer orders and the limited number of customers in those regions 
sales to the united states were lower in fiscal as compared to fiscal due to the extended poor economic environment in the us semiconductor industry 

table of contents cost of revenues 
cost of revenues in fiscal  and were as follows fiscal year cost of revenues million million million cost of revenues consists primarily of personnel expenses  the allocation of facilities  software maintenance licensing fees and equipment expenses 
cost of revenues increased from to and from to the increase between and was due primarily to a million increase in labor cost associated with bonus compensation consistent with our profitable operations as well as increased headcount  and million increase in maintenance license fees for third party software utilized in our product development 
the increase between and was primarily due to the increase in personnel expenses which could not be deployed in a timely manner to research and development projects and the overhead expense due to higher rent expense 
cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues was  and for fiscal year  and  respectively 
the decrease in cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues from to was attributable to improved labor utilization during a period of higher revenues on a year over year basis 
cost of revenues excludes   and  of amortization of stock based compensation for the years ended september   and  respectively 
research and development expense 
research and development expenses in fiscal  and were as follows research and fiscal year development expenses million million million research and development expense decreased from to and increased from to the decrease in research and development expense from to was due to lower personnel and consulting expenses of million  which was the result of shifting personnel to activities associated with the development and delivery of our products  and a decrease in depreciation expense of million  offset by an increase of million in software license and maintenance fees and an increase in travel expenses of million 
headcount earmarked for research and development responsibilities was higher on a year over year basis 
the increase in research and development expense between and was primarily due to personnel and related expense of million  much of which was associated with the growth of the logic engineering organization  as well as an increase of million in software license and maintenance fees 
research and development expense excludes   and million of amortization of stock based compensation for the years ended september   and  respectively sales and marketing expense 
sales and marketing expenses in fiscal  and were as follows sales and fiscal year marketing expenses million million million sales and marketing expense increased from to and from to the increase in sales and marketing expense in was primarily due to costs of hiring more senior personnel and related higher compensation expense of million  commensurate with revenue growth and growth in operations  an increase in advertising expense of million  an increase in travel cost of million  an increase in overhead expenses of million  partially offset by a decrease in consulting expenses of million related to market research 
in  the increase was primarily due to the cost of hiring additional personnel of 
table of contents million and increased consulting expenses of million 
the number of employees decreased from to from to and increased from to from to in sales and marketing 
sales and marketing as a percentage of revenues was in fiscal  down from in fiscal sales and marketing expense excludes   and million of amortization of stock based compensation for the years ended september   and  respectively 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expenses in fiscal  and were as follows general and fiscal year administrative expenses million million million general and administrative expense increased from to and decreased from to the increase in general and administrative expense between and was primarily due to the increase in personnel related expense of million  increased bad debt provision of million  an increase in consulting expense of million  increased rent costs of million  offset by the decrease in legal and accounting fees of million 
the decrease in general and administrative expense between and was primarily the result of reduced bad debt expense of million 
general and administrative expense excludes   and  of amortization of stock based compensation for the years ended september   and  respectively 
stock based compensation 
with respect to the grant of stock options and restricted stock to employees  our balance sheet reflects an aggregate deferred stock based compensation of approximately and  for the years ended september  and this stock based compensation balance for september  resulted from the grant of stock options to employees prior to our initial public offering that were determined to have been granted at an exercise price that was lower than the fair market value of our common stock for accounting purposes and to a lesser extent related to equity instruments acquired in connection with the acquisition of in chip systems  inc in may the amount of deferred stock based compensation is presented as a reduction of stockholders equity and is amortized under the multiple option approach  which results in recognizing expense on an accelerated basis over the vesting period of the applicable options  generally four years 
amortization  net of cancellations  was  million and million for the years ended september   and  respectively 
interest income 
interest income was   and million for the years ended september   and  respectively 
interest income has continued to decrease due to the declining interest rate environment 
interest and other expenses 
interest and other expenses resulted in a net other income of  in the year ended september   and net other expense of  and  for the years ended september   and  respectively 
the net other income in is primarily due to foreign exchange gain on foreign currencies in the amount of  the net other expense in and primarily includes interest expense paid on capital leases of  and  respectively 
income tax provision 
for fiscal  we recorded a provision of  on a pre tax income of million  yielding an effective tax rate of 
for fiscal  we recorded an income tax benefit of million on a pre tax loss of million  yielding an effective tax rate of 
for fiscal we recorded a provision for income taxes of million on pre tax income of million  yielding an effective tax rate of 
the rates differ from the us statutory rates primarily due to the impact of stock based compensation related charges that are non deductible for tax purposes  as well as in process research and development charges for fiscal the change in the effective tax rate from fiscal to fiscal is primarily the result of the company s pre tax income position after its pre tax loss of million due to lower than expected revenues in fiscal 
table of contents additionally  the company s india branch office has received a tax assessment from the government of india  income tax department  for the tax year claiming the company owes an additional approximately million in income taxes 
the company asserts that the claim is baseless but  in october  has made a deposit of approximately  with the indian tax authorities as required and is appealing the tax assessment with the indian government s commissioner of income tax appeals 
in the unlikely event that an unfavorable outcome of the tax appeal process occurs  the company believes it will not have a material impact on our financial position  cash flows or results of operations 
liquidity and capital resources at september   cash  cash equivalents and investments were million compared to million as of september  of that  million was held in cash and cash equivalents  a decrease of million from cash and cash equivalents held at september  primarily as a result of the purchase of short term and long term government and marketable fixed income securities 
we held million in investments at september   as compared to million at september  in fiscal  and  operations were funded primarily from revenues received 
net cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
net cash provided by operating activities in resulted from net income of million in fiscal  adjusted for aggregate non cash charges associated with depreciation and amortization of million and the amortization of stock based compensation of  increased business volume and the associated increased revenues and billings in from led to significant increases in accounts receivable of million and deferred revenue in the amount of million 
the increase in both categories is primarily due to several large arrangements requiring upfront payments for licensing agreements from which the company will be generating revenues in subsequent periods 
the increases were also the result of annual maintenance renewals with foundries and integrated device manufacturers in the final month of fiscal days sales outstanding for the fiscal fourth quarter of  based on revenues of million and net accounts receivable of million  was  up from days in the fourth quarter of fiscal significant increases in taxes receivable of million from prior year tax refunds and deferred tax assets of million from tax credits and differences in timing of payments was offset by an increase in income tax payable of million resulting from the company s net income position in additional offsets to the increase in cash provided by operating activities were increases in accrued expenses of million consisting of accrued payroll and related expenses of  due to increased headcount and deferred rent of  related to the company s increased facility lease obligations in net cash provided by operating activities in resulted from a net loss of million in fiscal  adjusted for aggregate non cash charges associated with depreciation and amortization of million and the amortization of stock based compensation of million 
reduced revenue levels and timing of customer payments from to led to significant decreases in accounts receivable of million partially offset by increases in prepaid expenses of million resulting from purchases of software maintenance  a decrease in income taxes payable of million due to the company s loss position  an decrease in deferred revenue of million and a decrease in accrued expenses of million due to timing of payments 
days sales outstanding for the fiscal fourth quarter of  based on revenues of million and accounts receivable of million  was  down from days in the fourth quarter of fiscal the decrease was primarily due to the timing of customer payments 
in fiscal  net cash provided by operating activities resulted from net income of  adjusted for aggregate non cash charges associated with depreciation and amortization of million and the amortization of stock based compensation of million 
the increase in cash provided by operating activities from to is due to decreases in income tax receivable of million for the receipt of tax refunds received during the year resulting from tax credits and differences in timing of payments  increases in accrued payroll and related expenses of million due to increased headcount from to employees  an increase in deferred revenues of million from greater deferred maintenance revenue and an increase in income tax payable of million from continued earnings growth and a reduction of the amount of amortization of stock based compensation 
the increase in cash provided from operating activities from 
table of contents to was partially offset by increases in accounts receivable of million related to higher revenues  prepaid expenses of  related to purchases of software maintenance and deferred tax assets of million 
days sales outstanding for the fiscal fourth quarter of  based on revenues of million and accounts receivable of million  was  up from days in the fourth quarter of fiscal the increase was primarily due to some large milestone shipments in agreements with integrated device manufacturers late in the year 
net cash used in investing activities was million   and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
the increase in cash used for investing activities from to is due primarily to increased treasury investing activities 
the decrease in cash used for investing activities from to is due primarily to reduced treasury investment activity and no significant technology investment or merger and acquisition activity 
as a result of lower interest rates  management elected to maintain cash as cash equivalents or shorter term instruments rather than commit funds to longer term instruments at the then current low interest rates 
the cash used for investing activities in is due primarily to the disposition of the investment in atmos corporation and the net maturities of our investments in government securities  offset by the acquisition of in chip systems  inc and acquisitions of property and equipment  primarily computer software and hardware 
net cash provided by financing activities was million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal and primarily reflects proceeds from the issuance of common stock of million and million  respectively associated with our employee stock options and employee stock purchase plans 
in  the proceeds from issuance of common stock totaling million and the repayment of notes payable by stockholders of million further contributed to the net cash provided but was offset by the repayment to stockholder of million 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the rate of sales growth  market acceptance of our existing and new technologies  the amount and timing of research and development expenditures  the timing of the introduction of new technologies  expansion of sales and marketing efforts  potential acquisitions  and levels of working capital  primarily accounts receivable 
there can be no assurance that additional equity or debt financing  if required  will be available on satisfactory terms 
we believe that our current capital resources and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our needs for at least the next twelve months  although we may seek to raise additional capital during that period and there can be no assurance that we will not require additional financing beyond this time frame 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations less than after contractual obligations total year years years years operating lease obligations merger related obligations purchase obligations total contractual obligations includes  million and  respectively  payable under the lease agreement for our corporate office lease in fremont  california  which was extended through fiscal year reflects amounts payable under an agreement with a third party for the right to market certain semiconductor i o technology developed by such third party and create  modify and market derivatives of this technology  and contracts for product development software licenses and maintenance 

table of contents quarterly results of operations the following tables contain unaudited consolidated statement of operations data for our eight most recent quarters

table of contents risk factors risk related to our business inability or delayed execution on our strategy to be a leading provider of semiconductor ip platforms could adversely affect our revenues and profitability 
from inception to may  primarily all of our revenues resulted from licenses to our embedded memory products 
after our acquisition of in chip systems  inc in may  we were able to expand our product offering to also include logic products 
in  we added i os to our product offering to enable us to offer what we define as a semiconductor ip platform 
if our strategy to be a provider of semiconductor ip platforms is not broadly accepted by potential customers or acceptance is delayed for whatever reason  our revenues and profitability could be adversely affected 
in addition  our profitability could also be adversely affected due to investment of resources towards the development and or acquisition of logic and i o products and lower than anticipated revenues from the sale of such products 
factors that could prevent us from gaining market acceptance of our semiconductor ip platform include difficulty convincing customers of our memory products to purchase other products from us  competition resulting in minority market share  inability to migrate technologies to new foundries due to less design experience  limited experience in sales and marketing of the platform strategy and knowledge of the market  and difficulties and delays in expanding our logic and i o product offerings 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly and any failure to meet financial expectations for any fiscal quarter may cause our stock price to decline 
our quarterly operating results are likely to fluctuate in the future from quarter to quarter and on an annual basis due to a variety of factors  many of which are outside of virage logic s control 
factors that could cause our revenues and operating results to vary from quarter to quarter include large orders unevenly spaced over time  establishment or loss of strategic relationships with third party semiconductor foundries  pace of adoption of new technologies by customers  timing of new technologies and technology enhancements by us and our competitors  fluctuations in the demand for products that incorporate our ip  constrained or deferred spending decisions by customers  inability to collect trade receivables  the timing and completion of milestones under customer agreements  the impact of competition on license revenues or royalty rates  the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry and the general economic environment  difficulties in forecasting royalty revenues because of factors out of our control  such as the timing of manufacturing of semiconductors subject to royalty obligations  the number of such semiconductors actually manufactured and the timing and results of audits of royalty reports received from our customers  changes in development schedules  research and development expenditure levels and product support by us and our customers  
table of contents recording a significant portion of our quarterly revenues in the last month of a quarter 
this is the result of closing more product orders  and therefore  a higher percentage of product shipments  in the last month of a quarter than in the first months of a quarter 
some customers believe they can enhance their bargaining power by waiting until the end of the quarter to finalize negotiations  and costs associated with merger and acquisition plans that are not pursued 
as a result  we believe that period to period comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and you should not rely on these comparisons as indications of future performance 
these factors  together with the fact that our expenses are primarily fixed and independent of revenues in any particular period  make it difficult for us to accurately predict our revenues and operating results and may cause them to be below market analysts expectations in some future quarters  which could cause the market price of our stock to decline significantly  as happened in connection with our operating results for the first and second quarters of fiscal if we are unable to continue establishing relationships on favorable contractual terms with semiconductor companies to license our ip  our business will be harmed 
we currently rely on license fees from the sale of perpetual and term licenses to generate a large portion of our revenues 
these licenses produce large amounts of revenue in the periods in which the license fees are recognized  but are not necessarily indicative of a commensurate level of revenue from the same customers in future periods 
in addition  our agreements with our customers do not obligate them to license new or future generations of our ip 
as a result  the growth of our business depends significantly on our ability to expand our business with existing customers and attract new customers 
we face numerous challenges in entering into license agreements with semiconductor companies on terms beneficial to our business  including the lengthy and expensive process of building a relationship with a potential licensee  competition with the customers internal design teams and other providers of semiconductor ip as our customers may evaluate these alternatives for each design  and the need to persuade semiconductor companies to rely on us for critical technology 
these factors may make it difficult for us to maintain our current relationships or establish new relationships with additional licensees 
further  there are a finite number of fabless semiconductor companies and integrated device manufacturers to which we can license our ip 
if we are unable to establish and maintain these relationships  we will be unable to generate license fees  and our revenues will decrease 
if we are unable to maintain existing relationships and or develop new relationships with third party semiconductor manufacturers  or foundries  we will be unable to verify our technologies on their processes and license our ip to them or their customers 
our ability to verify our technologies for new manufacturing processes depends on entering into development agreements with third party foundries to provide us with access to these processes 
in addition  we rely on third party foundries to manufacture our silicon test chips  to provide referrals to their customer base and to define the focus of our research and development activities 
we currently have agreements with taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company tsmc  united microelectronics corporation umc  chartered semiconductor manufacturing chartered  tower semiconductor tower  silterra malaysia silterra  semiconductor manufacturing international corporation smic and dongbuanam semiconductor 
if we are unable to maintain our existing relationships with these foundries or enter into new agreements with other foundries  we will be unable to verify our technologies for their manufacturing processes and our ability to develop products for emerging technologies will be hampered 
we would then be unable to license our ip to fabless semiconductor companies that use these foundries to manufacture their silicon chips  which is a significant source of our revenues 

table of contents if we are unsuccessful in increasing our royalty revenues  our revenues and profitability may not be as large as we anticipate 
we have historically generated revenues almost entirely from license fees 
we have agreements with certain third party semiconductor foundries to pay us royalties on their sales of silicon chips they manufacture for our fabless customers 
beginning with our star memory system  cam technologies and more recently with the introduction of our novea technology  in addition to collecting royalties from third party semiconductor foundries  we intend to increase our royalty base by collecting royalties directly from our integrated device manufacturer and fabless customers 
however  we may not be successful in convincing all customers to agree to pay us royalties 
for the quarters ended september  and  we recorded royalty revenues of approximately million and million  respectively 
for the fiscal years ended september  and  we recorded royalty revenues of approximately million and million  respectively 
the continued growth of our revenues depends in part on increasing our royalty revenues  but we may not be successful in increasing our royalty revenues as expected and we face difficulties in forecasting our royalty revenues because of many factors beyond our control  such as fluctuating sales volumes of products that incorporate our ip  short or unpredictable product life cycles for some customer products containing our ip  potential slow down for manufacturing of certain newer process technology  foundry rate adjustments  the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry that affects the number of designs  commercial acceptance of these products  accuracy of revenue reports and difficulties in the royalty collection process 
in addition  occasionally we have completed agreements whereby significant upfront license fees are reduced or limited in exchange for higher royalty rates  which should result in future royalty revenues  but these royalty arrangements may not provide us with the anticipated benefits as sales of products incorporating our ip may not offset lower license fees 
it is difficult for us to verify royalty amounts owed to us under our licensing arrangements  and this may cause us to lose revenues or inaccurately report revenues 
the standard terms of our license agreements require our licensees to document the manufacture and sale of products that incorporate our technology and report this data to us on a quarterly basis 
while standard license terms give us the right to audit the books and records of our licensees to verify this information  audits can be expensive  time consuming and potentially detrimental to our ongoing business relationship with our licensees 
our failure to audit our licensees books and records may result in us receiving more or less royalty revenue than we are entitled to under the terms of our license agreements 
the results of such audits could also result in an increase  as a result of a licensees underpayment  or decrease  as a result of a licensees overpayment  to royalty revenues 
such adjustments are recorded in the period they are determined 
any adverse material adjustments resulting from royalty audits may cause our revenues and operating results to be below market expectations  which could cause our stock price to decline 
the royalty audit may also trigger disagreements over contract terms with our licensees and such disagreements could hamper customer relations  divert the efforts and attention of our management from normal operations and impact our business operations 
products that do not meet customer specifications or contain defects that harm our customers could damage our reputation and cause us to lose customers and revenue 
the complexity and ongoing development of our products could lead to design or manufacturing problems 
our semiconductor ip products may fail to meet our customers technical requirements  or may contain defects  which may cause our customers to fail to complete the design and manufacturing of their products in a timely manner 
any of these problems may harm our customers businesses 
if any of our products fail to meet specifications or have reliability or quality problems  our reputation could be damaged significantly and customers might be reluctant to buy our products  which could result in a decline in net revenue  an increase in product returns and the loss of existing customers or failure to attract new customers 
these problems may adversely affect customer relationships  as well as our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents our international operations may be adversely affected by instability in the countries in which we operate 
we currently have subsidiaries or branches in armenia  india  the united kingdom  israel  germany and japan 
in addition  a significant portion of our ip is being developed in development centers located in the republic of armenia and india 
israel continues to face an increased level of violence and terror  india is experiencing rising costs and armenia  only independent since  has suffered significant political and economic instability 
accordingly  continued and heightened unrest in areas of the world in which we operate may adversely affect our business in a number of ways  including the following changes in the political or economic conditions in armenia and india and the surrounding region  such as fluctuations in exchange rates  changes in laws protecting ip  the imposition of currency transfer restrictions or limitations  or the adoption of burdensome trade or tax policies  procedures  rules  regulations or tariffs  could adversely affect our ability to develop new products  to take advantage of the cost savings associated with operations in armenia and india  and to otherwise conduct business effectively in armenia and india  our ability to continue conducting business in israel and other countries in the normal course may be adversely affected by increased risk of social and political instability and our employees working and visiting in israel may be affected by terrorist attacks  our israeli customers demand for our products may be adversely affected because of negative economic consequences associated with reduced levels of safety and security in israel 
problems associated with international business operations could affect our ability to license our ip 
sales to customers located outside north america accounted for  and of our revenues for fiscal years   and  respectively 
for the three months ended september  and  sales to customers located outside north america accounted for and of our revenues  respectively 
we anticipate that sales to customers located outside north america will increase and will continue to represent a significant portion of our total revenues in future periods 
in addition  most of our customers that do not own their own fabrication plants rely on third party foundries located outside of north america 
accordingly  our operations and revenues are subject to a number of risks associated with doing business in international markets  including the following managing foreign distributors and sales partners and sharing revenues with such third parties  staffing and managing foreign branch offices and subsidiaries  political and economic instability  international conflicts or other crises  such as the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome  or sars  greater difficulty in collecting account receivables resulting in longer collection periods  foreign currency exchange fluctuations  changes in tax laws and tariffs  compliance with  and unexpected changes in  a wide variety of foreign laws and regulatory environments with which we are not familiar  timing and availability of export licenses  inadequate protection of ip rights in some countries  and obtaining governmental approvals for certain technologies 
if these risks actually materialize  our international operations may be adversely affected and sales to international customers  as well as those domestic customers that use foreign fabrication plants  may decrease 

table of contents we have a long and unpredictable sales cycle  which can result in uncertainty and delays in generating additional revenues 
historically  because of the complexity of our products  it can take a significant amount of time and effort to explain the benefits of our products and to negotiate a sale 
for example  it generally takes at least three to nine months after our first contact with a prospective customer before we start licensing our ip to that customer 
in addition  purchase of our products is usually made in connection with new design starts  the timing of which are out of our control 
accordingly  we may be unable to predict accurately the timing of any significant future sales of our products 
we may also spend substantial time and management attention on potential license agreements that are not consummated  thereby foregoing other opportunities 
we rely on a small number of customers for a substantial portion of our revenues and our accounts receivables are concentrated among a small number of customers 
we have been dependent on a limited number of customers for a substantial portion of our annual revenues in each fiscal year  although the customers comprising this group have changed from time to time 
no single customer generated more than of our revenues for the years ended september  and since fiscal year  our five largest customers have represented between of our revenues 
the license agreements we enter into with our customers do not obligate them to license future generations of our ip and  as a result  we cannot predict if and when they will purchase additional products from us 
as a result of this customer concentration  we could experience a dramatic reduction in our revenues if we lose one or more of our significant customers and are unable to replace them 
in addition  since our accounts receivable are concentrated in a relatively small number of customers  a significant change in the liquidity  financial position  or issues regarding timing of payments of any one of these customers could have a material adverse impact on the collectability of our accounts receivable  historical revenues recorded and our future operating results 
we may have difficulty sustaining profitability and may experience additional losses in the future 
although we recorded net income of million for fiscal and million for the last three quarters of fiscal  respectively  this followed five quarters of consecutive net losses 
the losses recorded in fiscal and the first quarter of were due principally to fewer project design starts by fabless semiconductor customers on the micron technology and the slow down in industry adoption of the nanometer process technology 
in order to maintain and improve our profitability  we will need to continue to generate new sales while controlling our costs 
as we plan on continuing the growth of our business while implementing cost control measures  we may not be able to successfully generate enough revenues to remain profitable with this growth 
any failure to increase our revenues and control costs as we pursue our planned growth would harm our profitability and would likely negatively affect the market price of our stock 
in addition  if we incurred losses for a sustained period we may be prevented from being able to fully utilize our deferred tax asset which will result in the need for a valuation allowance to be recorded 
we may be unable to deliver our customized memory  logic and i o products in the time frame demanded by our customers  which could damage our reputation and future sales 
a portion of our contracts require us to provide customized products to our customers within a specified delivery timetable 
while we have experienced delays in delivering products to our customers  the duration of these delays was sufficiently short in length so as to not materially damage our relationship with our customers 
furthermore  these delays did not result in a material impact on our operations 
however  any failure to meet significant customer milestones could damage our reputation in our industry and harm our ability to attract new customers 
we may be unable to attract and retain key personnel who are critical to the success of our business 
we believe that one of our significant competitive advantages is the size and quality of our engineering team 
our future success also depends on our ability to attract and retain engineers and other highly skilled personnel and senior managers 
in addition  in order to meet our planned growth we must increase our sales 
table of contents force  both domestic and international  with qualified employees 
hiring qualified technical  sales and management personnel is difficult due to a limited number of qualified professionals and competition in our industry for these types of employees 
we have in the past experienced delays and difficulties in recruiting and retaining qualified technical and sales personnel and believe that at times our employees are recruited aggressively by our competitors and start up companies 
our employees are at will and may leave our employment at any time  and under certain circumstances  start up companies can offer more attractive stock option packages than we offer 
as a result  we may experience significant employee turnover 
failure to attract and retain personnel  particularly sales and technical personnel would make it difficult for us to develop and market our technologies 
in addition  our business and operations are substantially dependent on the performance of our key personnel  including adam a 
kablanian  our president and chief executive officer  and alexander shubat  our vice president of research and development and chief technical officer 
we do not have formal employment agreements with mr 
kablanian or dr 
shubat and do not maintain key person life insurance policies on their lives 
if mr 
kablanian or dr 
shubat were to leave or become unable to perform services for our company  our business could be severely harmed 
we may need additional capital that may not be available to us and  if raised  may dilute our stockholders ownership interest in us 
we may need to raise additional funds to develop or enhance our technologies  to fund expansion  to respond to competitive pressures or to acquire complementary products  businesses or technologies 
additional financing may not be available on terms that are acceptable to us 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities  the percentage ownership of our stockholders would be reduced and these securities might have rights  preferences and privileges senior to those of our current stockholders 
if adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms  our ability to fund our expansion  take advantage of unanticipated opportunities  develop or enhance our products or services  or otherwise respond to competitive pressures would be significantly limited 
if we are unable to effectively manage our growth  our business may be harmed 
our future success depends on our ability to successfully manage our growth 
our ability to manage our business successfully in a rapidly evolving market requires an effective planning and management process 
our customers rely heavily on our technological expertise in designing and testing our products 
relationships with new customers may require significant engineering resources 
as a result  any increase in the demand for our products will increase the strain on our personnel  particularly our engineers 
our historical growth  international expansion  and our strategy of being a provider of semiconductor ip platforms  have placed  and are expected to continue to place  a significant strain on our managerial and financial resources as well as our financial and management controls  reporting systems and procedures 
although some new controls  systems and procedures have been implemented  our future growth  if any  will depend on our ability to continue to implement and improve operational  financial and management information and control systems on a timely basis  together with maintaining effective cost controls 
our inability to manage any future growth effectively would be harmful to our revenues and profitability 
any acquisitions we make may not provide us the expected benefits and could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition 
we acquired in chip systems  inc in may  and we may continue to acquire businesses or technologies that we believe are a strategic fit with our business 
the in chip acquisition as well as other future acquisitions may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures and may absorb significant management attention that would otherwise be available for ongoing development of our business 
in addition  the integration of acquisition targets may prove to be more difficult than expected  and we may be unsuccessful in maintaining and developing relations with the employees  customers and business partners of in chip and other acquisition targets 
since we will not be able to accurately predict these difficulties and 
table of contents expenditures  it is possible that these costs may outweigh the value we realize from a future acquisition 
future acquisitions could result in issuances of equity securities that would reduce our stockholders ownership interest  the incurrence of debt  contingent liabilities  deferred stock based compensation or expenses related to the valuation of goodwill or other intangible assets and the incurrence of large  immediate write offs 
risk related to our industry if demand for products incorporating complex semiconductors and semiconductor ip platforms does not increase  our business may be harmed 
our business and the adoption and continued use of our ip by semiconductor companies depends on the demand for products requiring complex semiconductors  embedded memories and logic elements  such as cellular and digital phones  pagers  pdas  digital cameras  dvd players  switches and modems 
the demand for such products is uncertain and difficult to predict  and it depends on factors beyond our control such as the competition faced by each customer  market acceptance of products that incorporate our ip and the financial and other resources of each customer 
a reduction in the demand for products incorporating complex semiconductors and semiconductor ip or in the general economic environment which results in the cutback of research and development budgets or capital expenditures would likely result in a reduction in demand for our products and could harm our business 
in addition  with increasing complexity in each successive generation of semiconductors  we face the risk that the rate of adoption of smaller technology processes may slow 
in addition  the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and has fluctuated between significant economic downturns characterized by diminished demand  erosion of average selling prices and production overcapacity  as well as periods of increased demand and production capacity constraints 
until recently  the semiconductor industry has been experiencing a downturn during a significant economic slowdown resulting in lower levels of technology expenditures by businesses and individuals 
as a result of such fluctuations in the semiconductor industry and the general economic slowdown  we may face a reduced number of design starts  tightening of customers operating budgets  extensions of the approval process for new orders and projects and consolidation among our customers  all of which may harm the demand for our products and may cause us to experience substantial period to period fluctuations in our operating results 
further  the markets for third party semiconductor ip have emerged only in recent years 
because of the recent emergence of these markets  it is difficult to forecast whether these markets will continue to develop or grow at a rate sufficient to support our business 
the market for semiconductor ip platforms is highly competitive  and we may lose market share to larger competitors with greater resources and to companies that develop their semiconductor ip platforms using internal design teams 
we face competition from both existing suppliers of third party semiconductor ip as well as new suppliers that may enter the market 
we also compete with the internal design teams of large  integrated device manufacturers 
many of these internal design teams have substantial programming and design resources and are part of larger organizations with substantial financial and marketing resources 
these internal teams may develop technologies that compete directly with our technologies or may actively seek to license their own technologies to third parties  which could negatively affect our revenue and operating results 
many of our existing competitors have longer operating histories  greater brand recognition and larger customer bases  as well as greater financial and marketing resources  than we do 
this may allow them to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements 
it may also allow them to devote greater resources than we can to the development and promotion of their products 
in addition  the intense competition in the market for semiconductor ip could result in pricing pressures  reduced license revenues  reduced margins or lost market share  any of which could harm our operating results and cause our stock price to decline 

table of contents the technology used in the semiconductor industry is rapidly changing and if we are unable to develop new technologies and adapt our existing ip to new processes  we will be unable to attract or retain customers 
the semiconductor industry has been characterized by an increasingly rapid rate of development of new technologies and manufacturing processes  rapid changes in customer requirements  frequent product introductions and ongoing demands for greater speed and functionality 
our future success depends on our ability to develop new technologies and introduce new products to the marketplace in a timely manner  and to adapt our existing ip to satisfy the requirements of new processes and our customers 
if our development efforts are not successful or are significantly delayed  or if the enhancements or new generations of our products do not achieve market acceptance  we may be unable to attract or retain customers and our operating results could be harmed 
our ability to continue developing technical innovations involves several risks  including our ability to anticipate and respond in a timely manner to changes in the requirements of semiconductor companies  the emergence of new semiconductor manufacturing processes and our ability to enter into strategic relationships with third party semiconductor foundries to develop and test technologies for these new processes and provide customer referrals  the significant research and development investment that we may be required to make before market acceptance  if any  of a particular technology  the possibility that the industry may not accept a new technology or may delay use of a new technology after we have invested a significant amount of resources to develop it  and new technologies introduced by our competitors 
if we are unable to adequately address these risks  our ip will become obsolete and we will be unable to sell our products 
further  as new technologies or manufacturing processes are announced  customers may defer licensing our ip until those new technologies become available or our ip has been adopted for that manufacturing process 
in addition  research and development requires a significant expense and resource commitment 
since we have a limited operating history  we are unable to predict our future resource requirements 
as a result  we may not have the financial and other resources necessary to develop the technologies demanded in the future and may be unable to attract or retain customers 
general economic conditions and future terrorist attacks may reduce our revenues and harm our business 
as our business has grown  we have become increasingly subject to the risks arising from adverse changes in domestic and global economic conditions 
as a result of the recent economic slowdown in the united states and in other parts of the world  many industries are still delaying or reducing technology purchases and investments and similarly  our customers may delay payment for virage logic products causing our accounts receivable to increase 
in addition  continued unrest in israel and the middle east may negatively impact the investments that our worldwide customers make in these geographic regions 
the impact of this slowdown on us is difficult to predict  but if businesses or consumers defer or cancel purchases of new products that contain complex semiconductors  purchases by fabless semiconductor companies and integrated device manufacturers and production levels by semiconductor manufacturers could decline causing our revenues to be adversely affected  which would have an adverse effect on our results of operations and could have an adverse effect on our financial condition 

table of contents risk related to our intellectual property rights if we are not able to protect our ip adequately  we will have less proprietary technology to license  which will reduce our revenues and profits 
our patents  copyrights  trademarks  trade secrets and other ip are critical to our success 
we rely on a combination of patent  trademark  copyright  mask work and trade secret laws to protect our proprietary rights 
we cannot be sure that the us patent and trademark office will issue patents or trademark registrations for any of our pending applications 
further  any patents or trademark rights that we hold or may hold in the future may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented or may not be of sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful protection or any commercial advantage to us 
we have not attempted to secure patent protection in foreign countries  and the laws of some foreign countries may not adequately protect our ip as well as the laws of the united states 
also  the portion of our ip developed outside of the united states may not receive the same copyright protection that it would receive if it was developed in the united states 
as we increase our international presence  we expect that it will become more difficult to monitor the development of competing technologies that may infringe on our rights as well as unauthorized use of our technologies 
we use licensing agreements  confidentiality agreements and employee nondisclosure and assignment agreements to limit access to and distribution of our proprietary information and to obtain ownership of technology prepared on a work for hire basis 
even though we have taken all customary industry precautions  we cannot be sure that we have taken adequate steps to protect our ip rights and deter misappropriation of these rights or that we will be able to detect unauthorized uses and take immediate or effective steps to enforce our rights 
since we also rely on unpatented trade secrets to protect some of our proprietary technology  we cannot be certain that others will not independently develop or otherwise acquire the same or substantially equivalent technologies or otherwise gain access to our proprietary technology or disclose that technology 
we also cannot be sure that we can ultimately protect our rights to our unpatented proprietary technology 
in addition  third parties might obtain patent rights to such unpatented trade secrets  which they could use to assert infringement claims against us 
third parties may claim we are infringing or assisting others to infringe their ip rights  and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from licensing our technology 
while we do not believe that our technology or the conduct of our business infringes the valid ip rights of third parties  we may be unaware of ip rights of others that may cover some of our technology 
as a result  third parties may claim we or our customers are infringing their ip rights 
our license agreements typically require us to indemnify our customers for infringement actions related to our technology 
any litigation regarding patents or other ip could be costly and time consuming  and divert our management and key personnel from our business operations 
the complexity of the technology involved makes any outcome uncertain 
if we do not prevail in any infringement action  we may be required to pay significant damages and may be prevented from developing some of our technology or from licensing some of our ip for certain manufacturing processes unless we enter into a royalty or license agreement 
in addition  if challenging a claim is not feasible  we might be required to enter into royalty or license agreements in order to settle a claim and continue to license or develop our ip  which may result in significant expenditures 
we may not be able to obtain such agreements on terms acceptable to us or at all  and thus  may be prevented from licensing or developing our technology 

table of contents risk related to our stock our stock price may be volatile and could decline substantially 
the market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly in the past  will likely continue to fluctuate in the future and may decline 
fluctuations or a decline in our stock price may occur regardless of our performance 
among the factors that could affect our stock price  in addition to our performance  are variations between our operating results and the published expectations of securities analysts  changes in financial estimates or investment recommendations by securities analysts following our business  announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts  new products or services  acquisitions  or other significant transactions  sale of our common stock or other securities in the future  the inclusion or exclusion of our stock in various indices or investment categories  especially as compared to the investment profiles of our stockholders at a given time  changes in economic and capital market conditions  changes in business regulatory conditions  and the trading volume of our common stock 
compliance with internal control attestation effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and effectively prevent fraud 
pursuant to section of the sarbanes oxley act of  we will be required  beginning with our fiscal year ending september  to include in our annual report our assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and our audited financial statements as of the end of fiscal furthermore  our independent registered public accounting firm will be required to attest to whether our assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting is fairly stated in all material respects and separately report on whether it believes we maintained  in all material respects  effective internal control over financial reporting as of september  we have not yet completed our assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls 
if we fail to timely complete this assessment  or if our independent registered public accounting firm cannot attest to our assessment  we could be subject to regulatory sanctions and a loss of public confidence in our internal controls 
in addition  any failure to implement required new or improved controls  or difficulties encountered in their implementation  could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to timely meet our regulatory reporting obligations 
any of these failures could have a negative effect on the trading price of our stock 
if we are required to record compensation expense in connection with stock option grants  our profitability may be reduced significantly 
the financial accounting standards board fasb has recently proposed an accounting standard that will require the fair value of all equity based awards granted to employees be recognized in the income statement as compensation expense 
the various methods for determining the fair value of stock options are based on  among other things  the volatility of the underlying stock 
our stock price has historically been volatile 
therefore  the adoption of an accounting standard requiring companies to expense stock options could negatively affect our profitability and may adversely affect our stock price 
such adoption could also limit our ability to continue to use stock options as an incentive and retention tool  which could  in turn  hurt our ability to recruit employees and retain existing employees 
fasb is expected to issue final rules on stock option expensing in december with an effective date of june we will continue to monitor fasb s progress on the issuance of this standard 

table of contents changes to accounting standards and rules could either delay our recognition of revenues or reduce the amount of revenues that we may recognize at a specific time  and thus defer or reduce our profitability 
these effects on our reported results could cause our stock price to be lower than it otherwise might have been 
we adopted the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position  or sop   software revenue recognition  as of october  in december  the american institute of certified public accountants issued sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions 
we implemented these provisions as of october  in december  the securities and exchange commission issued sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements which summarizes certain of the sec s views in applying generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition in financial statements 
additional accounting guidance or pronouncements in the future could affect the timing of our revenue recognition in the future  which could cause our operating results to fail to meet the expectations of investors and securities analysts 
in addition  changes to accounting policies that affect other aspects of our business may adversely affect our reported financial results 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws as well as delaware law contain provisions that could discourage transactions resulting in a change in control  which may negatively affect the market price of our common stock 
our certificate of incorporation  our bylaws and delaware law contain provisions that might enable our management to discourage  delay or prevent change in control 
in addition  these provisions could limit the price that investors would be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 
these provisions include our board of directors is authorized  without prior stockholder approval  to create and issue preferred stock  commonly referred to as blank check preferred stock  with rights senior to those of common stock  our board of directors is staggered into classes  only one of which is elected at each annual meeting  stockholder action by written consent is prohibited  nominations for election to our board of directors and the submission of matters to be acted upon by stockholders at a meeting are subject to advance notice requirements  certain provisions in our bylaws and certificate may only be amended with the approval of stockholders holding of our outstanding voting stock  the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders is prohibited  and our board of directors is expressly authorized to make  alter or repeal our bylaws 
we are also subject to section of the delaware general corporation law  which provides  subject to enumerated exceptions  that if a person acquires or more of our outstanding voting stock  the person is an interested stockholder and may not engage in any business combination with us for a period of three years from the time the person acquired or more of our outstanding voting stock 
compliance with changing regulation of corporate governance and public disclosure may result in additional expenses 
changing laws  regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure  including the sarbanes oxley act of  new sec regulations and nasdaq national market rules  are creating uncertainty for companies such as ours 
these new or changed laws  regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations in many cases due to their lack of specificity  and as a result  their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies  which could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing 
table of contents revisions to disclosure and governance practices 
we are committed to maintaining high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure 
as a result  we intend to invest resources to comply with evolving laws  regulations and standards  and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue generating activities to compliance activities 
if our efforts to comply with new or changed laws  regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to practice  our reputation may be harmed 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our core business  the sale of semiconductor ip for the design and manufacture of system on a chip integrated circuits  has exposure to financial market risks  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
a significant portion of our customers are located in asia  canada and europe 
however  to date  our exposure to foreign currency exchange fluctuations has been minimal because all of our license agreements provide for payment in us dollars 
our international business is subject to risks typical of an international business  including  but not limited to differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax environments  other regulations and restrictions and foreign exchange rate volatility 
our foreign subsidiaries incur most of their expenses in the local currency 
to date these expenses were not significant  therefore  we do not anticipate our future results to be materially adversely impacted by changes in factors affecting international operations 
we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and changes in the market values of our marketable securities 
we maintain an investment portfolio of various issuers  types and maturities 
we are averse to principal loss and seek to preserve our invested funds by limiting default risk  market risk and reinvestment risk 
our investments primarily consist of short term money market mutual funds  united states government obligations and mortgage backed securities and commercial paper 
cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities in both fixed and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to rising interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future interest income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sells securities that have declined in market value due to change in interest rates
