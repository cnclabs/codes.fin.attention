item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion provides additional information regarding our operations for the twelve months ended december  and  the six months ended december  and  and the fiscal years ended june  and  and financial condition at december   december   and june  in august  the company s board of directors elected to change the company s fiscal year end from june to december due to this change  the company filed last year for the transition period from july  to december  throughout this document  reference to fiscal  the transition period  fiscal and are for the year ended december   the six months ended december   and the years ended june  and  respectively 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with selected consolidated financial data and our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto included or incorporated by reference elsewhere in this document 
overview the company was formed in february for the purpose of organizing quad city bank trust and has grown to million in consolidated assets as of december  management expects continued opportunities for growth  even though the rate of growth may be slower than that experienced to date 
the company reported earnings of million or basic earnings per share for fiscal as compared to million or basic earnings per share for the twelve months ended december   million or basic earnings per share for the six month transition period ended december   million or basic earnings per share for fiscal  and million or basic earnings per share for fiscal in october  the company sold its iso related merchant credit card portfolio to ipayment  inc  however bancard continued to process the portfolio s transactions through september the company s earnings for fiscal were positively impacted by the continued processing of these iso volumes 
this continued iso processing resulted in additional net income in fiscal of thousand or per share 
the sale in october resulted in a gain of million  after income tax and related expenses  or in diluted earnings per share  and was a significant contributor to the increase in earnings for the six months ended december  when compared to the same period in the increase in fiscal earnings from fiscal was attributable primarily to significant increases in both net interest income and noninterest income  partially offset by an increase in noninterest expense 
excluding both the one time gain from the sale of the iso portfolio in october  as well as the non recurring revenue from the continued processing through september  net income for the twelve months ended december  would have been million  or diluted earnings per share of  and net income for the twelve months ended december  would have been million  or diluted earnings per share of 
this represents a improvement in adjusted diluted earnings per share year to year 
although excluding the impact of these events is a non gaap measure  management believes that it is important to provide such information due to the non recurring nature of this income and to more accurately compare the results of the periods presented 
when compared to the same period in  the fiscal year ended december  reflected significant growth in both net interest income and gains on sales of loans  net  for the company 
for fiscal  net interest income and gains on sales of loans  net  improved by and  respectively  for a combined increase of million when compared to the twelve months ended december  both quad city bank trust and cedar rapids bank trust generated marked improvement in net interest margin  as well as increases in the gains on sales of residential real estate loans for fiscal bancard s continued processing through the first nine months of of the iso related merchant credit card portfolio that was sold  contributed million of noninterest income 
partially offsetting these revenue contributions for the company was an increase in noninterest expense of thousand 
the primary contributor to the increase in noninterest expense was salaries and employee benefits  which increased million from the same period in stock appreciation rights sar expense was thousand for the year  as the company s stock price grew from to during for the fiscal year ended december   net income for cedar rapids bank trust was thousand as compared to a net loss of thousand for the same period in management is pleased with the outstanding progress that cedar rapids bank trust has made in only its second full year of operation 
the company s results of operations are dependent primarily on net interest income  which is the difference between interest income  principally from loans and investment securities  and interest expense  principally on customer deposits and borrowings 
changes in net interest income result from changes in volume  net interest spread and net interest margin 
volume refers to the average dollar level of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
net interest spread refers to the difference between the average yield on interest earning assets and the average cost of interest bearing liabilities 
net interest margin refers to the net interest income divided by average interest earning assets and is influenced by the level and relative mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
the company s average tax equivalent yield on interest earning assets decreased for the twelve months ended december  as compared to the same period in with the same comparison  the average cost of interest bearing liabilities decreased  which resulted in a decrease in the net interest spread of at december  compared to at december  resulting from the prolonged low rate environment  the relative stability in the net interest spread from year to year did not carry over to the net interest margin 
for the fiscal year ended december   net interest margin was compared to for the like period in management continues to closely monitor and manage net interest margin 
from a profitability standpoint  an important challenge for the subsidiary banks is to maintain their net interest margins 
management continues to address this issue with alternative funding sources and pricing strategies 
the company s operating results are also affected by sources of noninterest income  including merchant credit card fees  trust fees  deposit service charge fees  gains from the sales of residential real estate loans and other income 
operating expenses of the company include employee compensation and benefits  occupancy and equipment expense and other administrative expenses 
the company s operating results are also affected by economic and competitive conditions  particularly changes in interest rates  government policies and actions of regulatory authorities 
the majority of the subsidiary banks loan portfolios are invested in commercial loans 
deposits from commercial customers represent a significant funding source as well 
the company has added facilities and employees to accommodate both its historical growth and anticipated future growth 
as such  overhead expenses have had a significant impact on earnings 
this trend is likely to continue as both banks continue to add the facilities and resources necessary to attract and serve additional customers during  quad city bank trust began to develop internally a merchant credit card processing operation and in transferred this function to bancard  a separate subsidiary of the company 
bancard initially had an arrangement to provide processing services exclusively to merchants of a single independent sales organization or iso 
this iso was sold in  and the purchaser requested a reduction in the term of the contract 
bancard agreed to amend the contract to reduce the term and accept a fixed monthly processing fee of thousand for merchants existing at the time the agreement was signed  and a lower transaction fee for new merchants  in exchange for a payment of million  the ability to transact business with other isos and the assumption of the credit risk by the iso 
approximately two thirds of the income from this settlement  or million  was reported in fiscal  with the remainder of thousand being recognized during fiscal bancard terminated its processing for this iso in may  eliminating approximately of its average monthly processing volume 
prior to this iso s termination  bancard s average monthly processing volume for fiscal was million 
during both fiscal and  bancard worked to establish additional iso relationships and further develop the relationships with existing isos successfully rebuilding and expanding processing volumes 
bancard s average monthly dollar volume of transactions processed during fiscal was million 
during fiscal  the average monthly dollar volume of transactions processed by bancard increased to million 
monthly processing volumes at bancard during fiscal climbed to a level above that existing prior to the termination of all processing with the initial iso 
on october   the company announced bancard s sale of its iso related merchant credit card operations to ipayment  inc for million 
after contractual compensation and severance payments  transaction expenses  and income taxes  the transaction resulted in a net gain of million  or per share  which was realized during the quarter ended december  also included in the sale were all of the merchant credit card processing relationships owned by bancard s subsidiary  allied 
bancard will continue to provide credit card processing for its local merchants and cardholders of the subsidiary banks and agent banks 
the company anticipated that the termination of the iso related merchant credit card processing would reduce bancard s future earnings 
bancard continued to process transactions for ipayment  inc through september as anticipated  the reduced processing volumes that bancard experienced during the fourth quarter of resulted in a decline in quarterly merchant credit card fees  net of processing costs for the company 
the fourth quarter of generated thousand of merchant credit card fees  net of processing costs  as compared to thousand for the third quarter of regardless of this decline in processing volumes and fees and the resulting reduction in operating results from prior quarters  the company believes that on a smaller scale bancard will remain profitable with its narrowed business focus of providing credit card processing for its local merchants and agent banks and for cardholders of the company s subsidiary banks 
during fiscal  quad city bank trust expanded its presence in the mortgage banking market by hiring several experienced loan originators and an experienced underwriter  and now has eight loan originators on staff 
quad city bank trust and cedar rapids bank trust originate mortgage loans on personal residences and sell the majority of these loans into the secondary market to avoid the interest rate risk associated with long term fixed rate financing 
the subsidiary banks realize revenue from this mortgage banking activity from a combination of loan origination fees and gains on the sale of the loans in the secondary market 
during the twelve months ended december   the subsidiary banks originated million of real estate loans and sold million  or  of these loans resulting in gains of million 
during the six months ended december   the subsidiary banks originated million of real estate loans and sold million  or  of these loans resulting in gains of million 
during fiscal  the subsidiary banks originated million of real estate loans and sold million  or  of these loans  which resulted in gains of million 
the depressed interest rates during these periods have caused a significant increase in the subsidiary banks mortgage origination volume 
in fiscal  quad city bank trust originated million of real estate loans and sold million  or  of these loans resulting in gains of million 
trust department income continues to be a significant contributor to noninterest income 
trust department fees contributed million in revenues during fiscal in the six months ended december   trust department fees contributed million in revenues 
trust department fees grew from million in fiscal to million in fiscal income is generated primarily from fees charged based on assets under administration for corporate and personal trusts and for custodial services 
assets under administration at december  increased to million  resulting primarily from the development of existing relationships and the addition of new trust relationships 
at december   assets under administration were million 
the decrease of million in trust assets from june to december  was a reflection of the reduced market values of securities held in trust accounts 
primarily as a result of new trust relationships  assets under administration had grown from at june  to million at june the company s initial public offering during the fourth calendar quarter of raised approximately million 
in order to provide additional capital to support the growth of quad city bank trust  the company formed a statutory business trust  which issued million of capital securities to the public for cash in june in conjunction with the formation of cedar rapids bank trust  the company sold approximately million of its common stock through a private placement offering in september  primarily to investors in the cedar rapids area 
in february  the company formed two additional trusts  which  in a private transaction  issued million of floating rate capital securities and million of fixed rate capital securities 
the company intends to use the net proceeds for general corporate purposes  including the possible redemption  in june  of the million of capital securities issued in critical accounting policy the company s financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the financial information contained within these statements is  to a significant extent  financial information that is based on approximate measures of the financial effects of transactions and events that have already occurred 
based on its consideration of accounting policies that involve the most complex and subjective decisions and assessments  management has identified its most critical accounting policy to be that related to the allowance for loan losses 
the company s allowance for loan loss methodology incorporates a variety of risk considerations  both quantitative and qualitative in establishing an allowance for loan loss that management believes is appropriate at each reporting date 
quantitative factors include the company s historical loss experience  delinquency and charge off trends  collateral values  changes in nonperforming loans  and other factors 
quantitative factors also incorporate known information about individual loans  including borrowers sensitivity to interest rate movements 
qualitative factors include the general economic environment in the company s markets  including economic conditions throughout the midwest and in particular  the state of certain industries 
size and complexity of individual credits in relation to loan structure  existing loan policies and pace of portfolio growth are other qualitative factors that are considered in the methodology 
as the company adds new products and increases the complexity of its loan portfolio  it will enhance its methodology accordingly 
management may report a materially different amount for the provision for loan losses in the statement of operations to change the allowance for loan losses if its assessment of the above factors were different 
this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the company s financial statements and the accompanying notes presented elsewhere herein  as well as the portion of this management s discussion and analysis section entitled financial condition allowance for loan losses 
although management believes the levels of the allowance as of both december  and and both june  and were adequate to absorb losses inherent in the loan portfolio  a decline in local economic conditions  or other factors  could result in increasing losses that cannot be reasonably predicted at this time 
results of operations fiscal compared with the twelve months ended december  overview 
net income for the twelve months ended december  was million as compared to net income of million for the twelve month period ended december  for an increase of thousand or 
basic earnings per share for fiscal were as compared to for the comparable period in the increase in net income was comprised of an increase in net interest income after provision for loan losses of million  partially offset by a decrease in noninterest income of million  and increases in noninterest expenses of thousand and federal and state income taxes of thousand 
several specific factors contributed to the improvement in net income from to for the twelve month periods 
primary factors included a improvement in net interest income prompted by increased volume  and a increase in gains on sales of real estate loans 
interest income 
interest income grew from million for the twelve months ended december  to million for fiscal the increase in interest income was attributable to greater average outstanding balances in interest earning assets  principally loans receivable  partially offset by a decrease in interest rates 
the average yield on interest earning assets for the twelve months ended december  was as compared to for the twelve month period ended december  interest expense 
interest expense decreased by thousand  from million for the twelve months ended december  to million for fiscal the decrease in interest expense was primarily attributable to a reduction in interest rates  which was almost entirely offset by greater average outstanding balances in interest bearing liabilities 
the average cost on interest bearing liabilities was for the twelve months ended december  as compared to for the like period in provision for loan losses 
the provision for loan losses is established based on a number of factors  including the local and national economy and the risk associated with the loans in the portfolio 
the company had an allowance for estimated losses on loans of approximately of total gross loans at december   as compared to approximately at december   at june  and at june  the provision for loan losses remained stable at million for fiscal  as it had been for the twelve months ended december  during both periods  management made monthly provisions for loan losses based upon a number of factors  principally the increase in loans and a detailed analysis of the loan portfolio 
during fiscal  the million provision to the allowance for loan losses was attributed  or million  to net growth in the loan portfolio  and  or million  to downgrades and write offs within the portfolio 
for the twelve months ended december   commercial loans had total charge offs of million  which resulted primarily from a single customer relationship at quad city bank trust  and there were thousand of commercial recoveries  due primarily to this same relationship 
the net write off of this relationship accounted for of the provision for loans losses during fiscal and was in addition to a million charge off  which occurred during the quarter ended december  the additional losses were a result of environmental issues associated with the collateral for the loan  which were identified during the first quarter of the company believed that these environmental issues negatively impacted the value and salability of the business and determined that it was appropriate to take a conservative approach and write down the loan balance to reflect no value in the real estate and equipment collateral 
during the second quarter of  all of the collateral  including the real estate and equipment  was sold resulting in a thousand recovery 
in the third and fourth quarters  there were recoveries of thousand  as quad city bank trust realized gain from the sale of other real estate  which had been deferred in accordance with current accounting rules 
consumer loan charge offs and recoveries totaled thousand and thousand  respectively  for the twelve months ended december  real estate loans had no charge off or recovery activity during fiscal the ability to grow profitably is  in part  dependent upon the ability to maintain asset quality 
the company is focusing efforts at its subsidiary banks in an attempt to improve the overall quality of the company s loan portfolio 
noninterest income 
noninterest income decreased by million from million for the twelve months ended december  to million for fiscal in the twelve months ended december   the largest component of noninterest income was the gain on sale of the iso related portion of the merchant credit card portfolio of million  which accounted for of the total 
noninterest income for both periods consisted of income from the merchant credit card operation  fees from the trust department  depository service fees  gains on the sale of residential real estate mortgage loans  and other miscellaneous fees 
making significant improvements from year to year in the noninterest income category were increases in gains on sales of loans and other miscellaneous fees 
during the twelve month period ended december   merchant credit card fees net of processing costs  decreased by thousand to million  from million for the comparable period in  reflecting little effect of the sale of the independent sales organization iso related merchant credit card activity to ipayment  inc in october  the company sold bancard s iso related merchant credit card operations to ipayment  inc for million 
after contractual compensation and severance payments  transaction expenses  and income taxes  the transaction resulted in a gain of million  or per share  which was realized during the quarter  ended december  also included in the sale were all of the merchant credit card processing relationships owned by allied 
bancard continues to provide credit card processing for its local merchants and cardholders of the subsidiary banks and agent banks 
through september   bancard also temporarily continued to process iso related transactions for ipayment  inc for a fixed monthly fee rather than a percentage of transaction volumes 
built into the sales contract with ipayment was an agreement that the fixed monthly fee would increase as the temporary processing period was extended 
extensions to the processing period and the resulting growth in the fixed monthly fee mitigated the drop in bancard s earnings that was expected to occur 
the transfer of this iso processing to another provider occurred in september  just prior to the close of the third quarter 
as the company anticipated  bancard s monthly earnings were reduced significantly in the final quarter of for the three quarters through september   bancard s net income was thousand  and for the fourth quarter of fiscal  bancard s net income was thousand 
while future operating results are anticipated to be reduced  the company believes that bancard will  on a smaller scale  remain profitable with its narrowed business focus of continuing to provide credit card processing for its local merchants and agent banks and for cardholders of the company s subsidiary banks 
for the twelve month periods ended both december  and  trust department fees were million 
the thousand  or  increase from year to year was primarily a reflection of the further development of existing trust relationships throughout and the addition of a significant volume of new trust relationships occurring late in the fourth quarter  which were almost entirely offset by the reduction of approximately million during the first quarter of a single trust account and its resulting impact on the calculation of trust fees for the remainder of the year 
deposit service fees increased thousand  or  to million from million for the twelve month periods ended december  and december   respectively 
this increase was primarily a result of the growth in noninterest bearing demand deposit accounts of million  or  since december  service charges and nsf non sufficient funds charges related to demand deposit accounts were the main components of deposit service fees 
gains on sales of loans were million for fiscal  which reflected an increase of  or million  from million for the same period in the increase resulted from the lower mortgage rates that originated in calendar and continued throughout this situation created significantly more home refinances during the period and the subsequent sale of the majority of these loans into the secondary market 
because the gains on sales of loans typically have an inverse relationship with mortgage interest rates  it is unlikely that the subsidiary banks will continue to maintain this level of activity in the long term 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  refinancing volumes slowed dramatically from the pace that had existed in the three previous quarters 
for the twelve months ended december   other noninterest income increased thousand  or  to million from thousand for the same period in the increase was primarily due to a combination of improved earnings on the cash surrender value of life insurance  gain realized on the sale of foreclosed property  increased earnings realized by nobel electronic transfer  llc  one of the three associated companies in which the company holds an interest  dividends earned on federal reserve bank and federal home loan bank stock  and increased fees generated from investment services offered at the subsidiary banks

compensation and other expenses related to the sale of the iso related merchant credit card portfolio of million accounted for of the million total in noninterest expenses for the twelve months ended december  contractual bonus and severance payments were based on the gain realized from the sale of bancard s iso related merchant credit card operations to ipayment  inc in october occupancy and equipment expense increased thousand  or  for the period 
the increase was due primarily to increased levels of rent  property taxes  utilities  depreciation  maintenance  and other occupancy expenses  in conjunction with thousand in losses on disposals of assets 
professional and data processing fees increased thousand  or  when comparing fiscal to the comparable period in the increase was primarily attributable to a combination of additional data processing fees incurred by the subsidiary banks and other professional fees incurred by the parent company

the commitments and contingent liabilities include various guarantees  commitments to extend credit  and standby letters of credit 
commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
the subsidiary banks evaluate each customer s creditworthiness on a case by case basis 
the amount of collateral obtained  if deemed necessary by the banks upon extension of credit  is based upon management s credit evaluation of the counter party 
collateral held varies but may include accounts receivable  marketable securities  inventory  property  plant and equipment  and income producing commercial properties 
standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the subsidiary banks to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party 
those guarantees are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements and  generally  have terms of one year  or less 
the credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers 
the banks hold collateral  as described above  supporting those commitments if deemed necessary 
in the event the customer does not perform in accordance with the terms of the agreement with the third party  the banks would be required to fund the commitments 
the maximum potential amount of future payments the banks could be required to make is represented by the contractual amount 
if the commitment is funded  the banks would be entitled to seek recovery from the customer

the company also has a guarantee to mastercard international incorporated  which is backed by a performance bond in the amount of million 
as of december  there were no significant pending liabilities 
a significant portion of residential mortgage loans sold to investors in the secondary market is sold with recourse 
specifically  certain loan sales agreements provide that if the borrower becomes delinquent a number of payments or a number of days  within six months to one year of the sale  the subsidiary banks must repurchase the loan from the subject investor 
the banks did not repurchase any loans from secondary market investors under the terms of these loan sales agreements during the year ended december   six months ended december   or the years ended june  or in the opinion of management  the risk of recourse to the banks was not significant and  accordingly  no liability has been established related to such 
the company has various financial obligations  including contractual obligations and commitments  which may require future cash payments 
the following table presents  as of december   significant fixed and determinable contractual obligations to third parties by payment date 
further discussion of the nature of each obligation is included in the referenced note to the consolidated financial statements 
payments due by period in thousands description and one year after note reference total or less years years years deposits without a   stated maturity certificates of deposits     short term borrowings 
  federal home loan bank advances      other borrowings   junior subordinated debentures   rental commitments  purchase obligations 
  operating leases    total contractual cash obligations      purchase obligations represent obligations under agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on the company and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
the purchase obligation amounts presented primarily relate to certain contractual payments for capital expenditures of data processing technology and facilities expansion 
the company s operating lease obligations represent short and long term lease payments for data processing equipment and services  software  and other equipment and professional services 
impact of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollar amounts without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of the company s operations 
unlike industrial companies  nearly all of the assets and liabilities of the company are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a greater impact on the company s performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the price of goods and services

in july  the board of governors of the federal reserve system issued a supervisory letter instructing bank holding companies to continue to include trust preferred securities in their tier i capital for regulatory capital purposes until notice is given to the contrary 
the federal reserve intends to review the regulatory implications of this accounting change and  if necessary or warranted  provide further appropriate guidance 
no further guidance has been issued to date and  as such  the million in trust preferred securities issued by qcr capital trust i were included in tier i capital for regulatory capital purposes at december  there can be no assurance that the federal reserve will continue to permit institutions to include trust preferred securities in tier i capital in the future

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company  like other financial institutions  is subject to direct and indirect market risk 
direct market risk exists from changes in interest rates 
the company s net income is dependent on its net interest income 
net interest income is susceptible to interest rate risk to the degree that interest bearing liabilities mature or reprice on a different basis than interest earning assets 
when interest bearing liabilities mature or reprice more quickly than interest earning assets in a given period  a significant increase in market rates of interest could adversely affect net interest income 
similarly  when interest earning assets mature or reprice more quickly than interest bearing liabilities  falling interest rates could result in a decrease in net income 
in an attempt to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates  management monitors the company s interest rate risk 
each subsidiary bank has an asset liability management committee of the board of directors that meets quarterly to review the bank s interest rate risk position and profitability  and to make or recommend adjustments for consideration by the full board of each bank 
management also reviews quad city bank trust and cedar rapids bank trust s securities portfolios  formulates investment strategies  and oversees the timing and implementation of transactions to assure attainment of the board s objectives in the most effective manner 
notwithstanding the company s interest rate risk management activities  the potential for changing interest rates is an uncertainty that can have an adverse effect on net income 
in adjusting the company s asset liability position  the board and management attempt to manage the company s interest rate risk while maintaining or enhancing net interest margins 
at times  depending on the level of general interest rates  the relationship between long term and short term interest rates  market conditions and competitive factors  the board and management may decide to increase the company s interest rate risk position somewhat in order to increase its net interest margin 
the company s results of operations and net portfolio values remain vulnerable to increases in interest rates and to fluctuations in the difference between long term and short term interest rates 
one approach used to quantify interest rate risk is the net portfolio value analysis 
in essence  this analysis calculates the difference between the present value of liabilities and the present value of expected cash flows from assets and off balance sheet contracts 
the following table sets forth  at december  and  an analysis of the company s interest rate risk as measured by the estimated changes in the net portfolio value resulting from instantaneous and sustained parallel shifts in the yield curve or basis points

 dollars in thousands the company does not currently engage in trading activities or use derivative instruments to control interest rate risk 
even though such activities may be permitted with the approval of the board of directors  the company does not intend to engage in such activities in the immediate future 
interest rate risk is the most significant market risk affecting the company 
other types of market risk  such as foreign currency exchange rate risk and commodity price risk  do not arise in the normal course of the company s business activities
