overview we are a delaware limited partnership formed by martin resource management to receive the transfer of substantially all of the assets  liabilities and operations of martin resource management related to the four lines of business in which we operate 
we provide marine transportation  terminalling  distribution and midstream logistical services for producers and suppliers of hydrocarbon products and by products  specialty chemicals and other liquids 
we also manufacture and market sulfur based fertilizers and related products 
hydrocarbon products and by products are produced primarily by major and independent oil and gas companies who often turn to independent third parties  such as us  for the transportation and disposition of these products 
in addition to these major and independent oil and gas companies  our primary customers include independent refiners  large chemical companies  fertilizer manufacturers and other wholesale purchasers of hydrocarbon products and by products 
we operate primarily in the gulf coast region of the united states 
in connection with the november  closing of our initial public offering of common units representing limited partner interests  martin resource management and certain of its subsidiaries conveyed to us certain of their assets  liabilities and operations  in exchange for the following i a general partnership interest held by martin midstream gp llc  an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of martin resource management  ii incentive distribution rights granted by us  and iii  subordinated units in us 
the historical combined financial statements of martin midstream partners predecessor included in this annual report reflect the financial condition and results of operations of the assets and operations contributed to us in november the operations that were contributed to us relate to four primary lines of business marine transportation of hydrocarbon products and by products  terminalling of hydrocarbon products and by products  lpg distribution  and fertilizer manufacturing 

table of contents we analyze and report our results of operations on a segment basis 
our four operating segments are as follows marine transportation services for hydrocarbon products and by products  terminalling of hydrocarbon products and by products  distribution of lpgs  and manufacturing and marketing fertilizer products  which are primarily sulfur based  and other sulfur related products 
in november  martin resource management and cf industries  inc formed cf martin sulphur  lp cf martin sulphur  lp collects and aggregates  transports  stores and markets molten sulfur 
prior to november  martin resource management operated this molten sulfur business as part of its lpg distribution business which was recently contributed to us in connection with our formation 
we have an unconsolidated non controlling limited partner interest in cf martin sulphur  lp we account for this interest in cf martin sulphur  lp using the equity method since we do not control this entity 
as a result  we have not included any portion of the revenue  operating costs or operating income attributable to cf martin sulphur  lp in our results of operations or in the results of operations of any of our operating segments 
rather  we have included only our share of its net income in our statement of operations 
under the equity method of accounting  we do not include any individual assets or liabilities of cf martin sulphur  lp on our balance sheet 
instead  we carry our book investment as a single amount within the other assets caption on our balance sheet 
we have not guaranteed the repayment of any debt of cf martin sulphur  lp and we should not otherwise be required to repay any obligations of cf martin sulphur  lp if it defaults on any such obligations 
our operations were part of a taxable consolidated group prior to november  therefore  for all periods prior to november   our consolidated and combined financial statements include the effects of applicable income taxes in order to comply with generally accepted accounting principles 
subsequent to november   we have not been subject to federal or state income taxes as a result of our partnership structure 
therefore  our results of operations subsequent to november  do not include the effects of any income taxes 
the results of operations for the years ended december  have been derived from the combined financial statements of martin midstream partners predecessor 
the combined results of operations for the year ended december  have been derived from the combined financial statements of martin midstream partners predecessor for the period from january  through november  and the consolidated financial statements of martin midstream partners  lp for the period from november  through december  the results of operations for the year ended december  have been derived from the consolidated and combined financial statements of martin midstream partners lp recent developments and subsequent events in december  we completed the acquisition of certain assets associated with tesoro marine s shore based marine activities for million plus approximately million for tesoro marine s lubricant inventories 
the assets we acquired included marine terminals and one inland terminal located along the gulf coast from venice  louisiana to corpus christi  texas  nine inland tank barges and four inland pushboats  and tesoro marine s lubricant distribution and marketing business 
we financed this acquisition through borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
tesoro marine services  llc is a subsidiary of tesoro petroleum corporation  a refiner and marketer of petroleum products 
in december  in a parallel transaction  midstream fuel service llc  a wholly owned subsidiary of martin resource management  the owner of our general partner  completed its acquisition of tesoro marine s fuel oil distribution business for million plus approximately million for tesoro marine s diesel fuel inventories 
midstream fuel  rather than us  acquired these assets from tesoro marine because fuel oil distribution 
table of contents generates non qualifying income under internal revenue service regulations applicable to publicly traded limited partnerships 
however  following the closing of the marine asset acquisition and the fuel oil distribution acquisition  we entered into certain agreements with martin resource management pursuant to which we provide marine transportation and terminalling services to midstream fuel and midstream fuel provides terminal services to us to handle lubricants  greases and drilling fluids 
in october  we acquired a marine terminal located on the ouachita river in southern arkansas from cross oil refining marketing  inc for million 
at the same time  we entered into a five year terminalling agreement with cross  with two five year renewal terms  whereby cross has the right to use the acquired terminal for the storage of crude oil and or finished oil products 
we also entered into a five year marine transportation agreement with cross  with two five year renewal terms  whereby we agreed to provide two inland tank barges on a full time basis for the marine transportation of crude oil and finished oil products owned by cross or owned by others that are in transit to cross s refinery located in southern arkansas 
in october  in another separate transaction  we purchased an inland pushboat and two inland tank barges from a third party for million 
we use these vessels to transport crude oil pursuant to the marine transportation agreement with cross 
in may   we experienced a casualty loss caused by a lightening strike at our odessa  texas sulfur and fertilizer facility 
this event did not negatively affect our operating results during the second or third quarters of during the fourth quarter of  we recorded a gain of million related to this involuntary conversion of assets 
in december  we amended our credit agreement and increased our existing credit facility from a total of million to million 
our term loan remained at million and our revolving credit facility increased from million to million 
our expanded revolving credit facility provides for a million acquisition line and a million working capital facility 
we financed the tesoro marine asset acquisition through borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
we used the net proceeds of this offering to repay a portion of the borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility 
on january   we declared a cash distribution of per unit  payable on february  to common and subordinated unitholders of record as of the close of business on january  this distribution reflects an increase of per unit over the quarterly distributions we previously paid and is based on our current operating performance and the current general economic  industry and market conditions impacting us 
public offering 
in february  we issued  common units in a public offering  resulting in proceeds of million  net of underwriters discounts  commissions and offering expenses 
our general partner contributed million in cash to us in conjunction with the issuance in order to maintain its general partner interest in us 
the net proceeds were used to pay down revolving debt under our credit facility 
following such pay down of debt  as of march   we had million of outstanding indebtedness  consistency of outstanding borrowings of million under our term loan and million under our revolving credit facility 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on the historical consolidated and combined financial statements included elsewhere herein 
we prepared these financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements required us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
we based our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
our results may differ from these estimates 
currently  we believe that our accounting policies do not require us to make estimates using assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain 
however  we have described below the critical accounting policies that we believe could impact our consolidated and combined financial statements most significantly 

table of contents you should also read note  significant accounting policies in notes to consolidated and combined condensed financial statements contained in this annual report on form k 
some of the more significant estimates in these financial statements include the amount of the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable and the determination of the fair value of our reporting units under the financial accounting standards board fasb statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
product exchanges 
we enter into product exchange agreements with third parties whereby we agree to exchange lpgs with third parties 
we record the balance of lpgs due to other companies under these agreements at quoted market product prices and the balance of lpgs due from other companies at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined using the first in  first out fifo method 
revenue recognition 
for our marine transportation segment  we recognize revenue for contracted trips upon completion of the trips 
for time charters  we recognize revenue based on the daily rate 
for our terminalling segment  we recognize revenue monthly for storage contracts based on the contracted monthly tank fixed fee 
for throughput contracts  we recognize revenue based on the volume moved through our terminals at the contracted rate 
for our lpg distribution segment  we recognize revenue for product delivered by truck upon the delivery of lpgs to our customers  which occurs when the customer physically receives the product 
when product is sold in storage  or by pipeline  we recognize revenue when the customer receives the product from either the storage facility or pipeline 
for our fertilizer segment  we recognize revenue when the customer takes title to the product  either at our plant or the customer s facility 
equity method investment 
we use the equity method of accounting for our interest in cf martin sulphur  lp because we only own an unconsolidated non controlling limited partner interest in this entity 
in accordance with fasb s emerging issues task force eitf issue  exchange of assets or interest in a subsidiary for a non controlling equity interest in a new entity  we did not recognize a gain when we contributed our molten sulfur business to cf martin sulphur  lp because we concluded we had an implied commitment to support the operations of this entity as a result of our role as a supplier of product to cf martin sulphur  lp and our relationship to martin resource management  which guarantees the debt of this entity 
as a result of the non recognition of this gain  the amount we initially recorded as an investment in cf martin sulphur  lp on our balance sheet is less than the amount of our underlying equity in this entity as recorded on the books of cf martin sulphur  lp we are amortizing such excess amount over years  the expected life of the net assets contributed to this entity  as additional equity in earnings of cf martin sulphur  lp in our statements of operations 
goodwill 
we adopted sfas no 
effective january  sfas no 
discontinues goodwill amortization over its estimated useful life  rather goodwill is subject to a fair value based impairment test in the year of adoption and on an annual basis 
in connection with sfas no 
s transitional goodwill impairment evaluation  the statement required the partnership to perform an assessment of whether there was an indication that goodwill is impaired as of the date of adoption 
to accomplish this  the partnership was required to identify its reporting units and determine the carrying value of each reporting unit by assigning the assets and liabilities  including the existing goodwill and intangible assets  to those reporting units as of january  the partnership was required to determine the fair value of each reporting unit and compare it to the carrying amount of the reporting unit within six months of january  the partnership was also required to perform additional annual tests during and to the extent the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeded the fair value of the reporting unit  the partnership would be required to perform the second step of the impairment test  as this is an indication that the reporting unit goodwill may be impaired 
the partnership performed the initial test in the second quarter of and the annual tests in the third quarter of and with no indication of impairment 
the amount of our unamortized goodwill as of december  was million 
we performed the initial and annual impairment tests required by sfas no 
as of january   september  and september   respectively 
in performing such tests  we determined we had three reporting units which contained goodwill 
these reporting units were three of our reporting segments marine transportation  lpg distribution and fertilizer 

table of contents for each period  we performed the first step under sfas no 
 which is to compare the fair value of each reporting unit to the related carrying amount including amounts for goodwill in the consolidated and combined financial statements 
we determined fair value in each reporting unit based on a multiple of current annual cash flows 
we determined such multiple from our recent experience with actual acquisitions and dispositions and valuing potential acquisitions and dispositions 
for all three reporting units and all test dates  the fair value exceeded the carrying amount of the reporting units  indicating no impairment of goodwill 
prior to january   we amortized goodwill on a straight line basis over the expected future periods to be benefited  generally years 
we assessed goodwill for recoverability by determining whether the amortization of the goodwill balance over its remaining life could be recovered through undiscounted future operating cash flows of the acquired operation 
environmental liabilities 
historically  we have not experienced circumstances requiring us to account for environmental remediation obligations 
if such circumstances arise  we would estimate remediation obligations utilizing a remediation feasibility study and any other related environmental studies that we may elect to perform 
we would record changes to our estimated environmental liability as circumstances change or events occur  such as the issuance of revised orders by governmental bodies or court or other judicial orders and our evaluation of the likelihood and amount of the related eventual liability 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
in evaluating the collectibility of our accounts receivable  we assess a number of factors  including a specific customer s ability to meet its financial obligations to us  the length of time the receivable has been past due and historical collection experience 
based on these assessments  we record both specific and general reserves for bad debts to reduce the related receivable to the amount we ultimately expect to collect from customers

the decrease in demand for our services  as well as the decrease in our rates  was primarily due to an industry wide decrease in the transportation of fuel oil 
in  higher natural gas prices created additional demand for fuel oil as a substitute for natural gas 
when natural gas prices declined by the end of the second quarter of  the demand for and price of fuel oil returned to normal levels 
additionally  we placed one of our offshore barge units in a shipyard for days during the first quarter of this unit historically carried fuel oil and was placed in the shipyard in order to modify it to carry molten sulfur

please read risks related to our business below for a discussion of such risks

as of march   we had no outstanding acquisition debt 
we have no commercial commitments such as lines of credit or guarantees that might result from a contingent event that would require our performance pursuant to a funding commitment 
no off balance sheet arrangements 
we do not have any off balance sheet financing arrangements 
description of our credit facility in connection with the tesoro marine asset acquisition  we entered into an amendment to our syndicated credit agreement led by royal bank of canada  as administrative agent  lead arranger and book runner  and our existing credit facility was increased from a total of million to million 
our credit facility now consists of a million revolving credit facility and a million term loan 
the million revolving credit facility is comprised of i a million working capital sub facility that will be used for ongoing working capital needs and general partnership purposes and ii a million sub facility that may be used to finance permitted acquisitions and capital expenditures 
as of december   we had million available for expansion and acquisition activities under our revolving credit facility 
in february  we used the proceeds from our public offering of  common units to pay down revolving debt under our credit facility 
following such pay down of debt  as of march   we had million of outstanding indebtedness  consisting of outstanding borrowings of million under our term loan and million under our revolving credit facility  and as of such date have million available for expansion and acquisition activities 
our obligations under the credit facility are secured by substantially all of our assets  including  without limitation  inventory  accounts receivable  vessels  equipment and fixed assets 
we may prepay all amounts outstanding under this facility at any time without penalty 
indebtedness under the credit facility bears interest at either libor plus an applicable margin or the base prime rate plus an applicable margin 
the applicable margin for libor loans will range from to and the applicable margin for base prime rate loans will range from to 
we incur a commitment fee on the unused portions of the revolving credit facility 
in addition  the credit agreement contains various covenants  which  among other things  limit our ability to i incur indebtedness  ii grant certain liens  iii merge or consolidate unless we are the survivor  iv sell all or 
table of contents substantially all of our assets  v make acquisitions  vi make certain investments  vii make capital expenditures  viii make distributions other than from available cash  ix create obligations for some lease payments  x engage in transactions with affiliates  or xi engage in other types of business 
the credit agreement also contains covenants  which  among other things  require us to maintain specified ratios of i minimum net worth as defined in the credit agreement of million  ii ebitda as defined in the credit agreement to interest expense of not less than to  iii total debt to ebitda  pro forma for any asset acquisition  of not more than to  iv current assets to current liabilities of not less than to  and v an orderly liquidation value of pledged fixed assets to the aggregate outstanding principal amount of our term indebtedness and our revolving acquisition sub facility of not less than to until the date that is one year after the closing of the tesoro marine asset acquisition and not less than to thereafter 
we were in compliance with our debt covenants for the period november  through december   as of december   for the year ended december  and as of december  the amount we are able to borrow under the working capital sub facility is based on a formula 
under this formula  our borrowing base under the sub facility is calculated based on of eligible accounts receivable plus of eligible inventory 
such borrowing base will be reduced by  per quarter during the entire three year term of our revolving credit facility 
this quarterly reduction may decrease the amount we may borrow under the working capital sub facility and could result in quarterly mandatory prepayments to the extent that borrowings under this sub facility exceed the revised borrowing base 
other than mandatory prepayments that would be triggered by certain asset dispositions  the issuance of subordinated indebtedness or as required under the above noted borrowing base reductions  the credit agreement requires interest only payments on a quarterly basis until maturity 
all outstanding principal and unpaid interest must be paid by november  the credit agreement contains customary events of default  including  without limitation  payment defaults  cross defaults to other material indebtedness  bankruptcy related defaults  change of control defaults and litigation related defaults 
seasonality a substantial portion of our revenues are dependent on sales prices of products  particularly lpgs and fertilizers  which fluctuate in part based on winter and spring weather conditions 
the demand for lpgs is strongest during the winter heating season 
the demand for fertilizers is strongest during the early spring planting season 
however  our marine transportation and terminalling businesses and the molten sulfur business of cf martin sulphur  lp are typically not impacted by seasonal fluctuations 
we expect to derive a majority of our net income from our marine transportation and terminalling businesses and our unconsolidated non controlling interest in cf martin sulphur  lp therefore  we do not expect that our overall net income will be impacted by seasonality factors 
impact of inflation inflation in the united states has been relatively low in recent years and did not have a material impact on our results of operations in  and however  inflation remains a factor in the united states economy and could increase our cost to acquire or replace property  plant and equipment as well as our labor and supply costs 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to pass along increased costs to our customers 
environmental matters our operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations adopted by various governmental authorities in the jurisdictions in which these operations are conducted 
we incurred no significant environmental costs  liabilities or expenditures to mitigate or eliminate environmental contamination during    or under the omnibus agreement  martin resource management will indemnify us for five years after the closing of our initial public offering  which closed on november   against certain potential environmental liabilities associated with the assets it contributed to us relating to events or conditions that occurred or existed before the closing of our initial public offering  and 
table of contents any payments we are required to make  as a successor in interest to affiliates of martin resource management  under environmental indemnity provisions contained in the contribution agreement associated with the contribution of assets by martin resource management to cf martin sulphur  lp in november recent accounting pronouncements in june  fasb issued sfas no

sfas no 
also includes disclosure requirements that provide a description of asset retirement obligations and reconciliation of changes in the components of those obligations 
we adopted sfas no

risks related to our business important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations include  but are not limited to  the risks set forth below 
the risks described below should not be considered to be comprehensive and all inclusive 
additional risks that we do not yet know of or that we currently think are immaterial may also impair our business operations  financial condition and results of operations 
if any events occur that give rise to the following risks  our business  financial condition  or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected  and as a result  the trading price of our common units could be materially and adversely impacted 
these risk factors should be read in conjunction with other information set forth in this annual report on form k  including our consolidated and combined financial statements and the related notes 
many of such factors are beyond our ability to control or predict 
investors are cautioned not to put undue reliance on forward looking statements 
we may not have sufficient cash after the establishment of cash reserves and payment of our general partner s expenses to enable us to pay the minimum quarterly distribution each quarter 
on a pro forma basis for  determined by reference to the historical combined results of operations for martin midstream partners predecessor and applying pro forma adjustments to the historical results of operations of martin midstream partners predecessor to give effect to the transactions that occurred in connection with our initial public offering in november  our available cash from operating surplus would have been insufficient in to pay the minimum quarterly distribution on all our units 
we may not have sufficient available cash each quarter in the future to pay the minimum quarterly distribution on all our units 
under the terms of our partnership agreement  we must pay our general partner s expenses and set aside any cash reserve amounts before making a distribution to our unitholders 
the amount of cash we can distribute on our common units principally depends upon the amount of net cash generated from our operations  which will fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on  among other things the costs of acquisitions  if any  the prices of hydrocarbon products and by products  fluctuations in our working capital  the level of capital expenditures we make  restrictions contained in our debt instruments and our debt service requirements  our ability to make working capital borrowings under our revolving credit facility  and the amount  if any  of cash reserves established by our general partner in its discretion 

table of contents you should also be aware that the amount of cash we have available for distribution depends primarily on our cash flow  including cash flow from working capital borrowings  and not solely on profitability  which will be affected by non cash items 
in addition  our general partner determines the amount and timing of asset purchases and sales  capital expenditures  borrowings  issuances of additional partnership securities and the establishment of reserves  each of which can affect the amount of cash available for distribution to our unitholders 
as a result  we may make cash distributions during periods when we record losses and may not make cash distributions during periods when we record net income 
adverse weather conditions could reduce our results of operations and ability to make distributions to our unitholders 
our distribution network and operations are primarily concentrated in the gulf coast region and along the mississippi river inland waterway 
weather in these regions is sometimes severe and can be a major factor in our day to day operations 
our marine transportation operations can be significantly delayed  impaired or postponed by adverse weather conditions  such as fog in the winter and spring months  and certain river conditions 
additionally  our marine transportation operations and our assets in the gulf of mexico  including our barges  pushboats  tugboats and terminals  can be adversely impacted or damaged by hurricanes  tropical storms  tidal waves or other related events 
demand for our lubricants and the diesel fuel we throughput in our terminalling segment can be affected if offshore drilling operations are disrupted by weather in the gulf of mexico 
national weather conditions have a substantial impact on the demand for our products 
unusually warm weather during the winter months can cause a significant decrease in the demand for lpg products  fuel oil and gasoline 
likewise  extreme weather conditions either wet or dry can decrease the demand for fertilizer 
for example  an unusually wet spring can delay planting of seeds  which can leave insufficient time to apply fertilizer at the planting stage 
conversely  drought conditions can kill or severely stunt the growth of crops  thus eliminating the need to nurture plants with fertilizer 
any of these or similar conditions could result in a decline in our net income and cash flow  which would reduce our ability to make distributions to our unitholders 
we receive a material portion of our net income and cash available for distribution from our unconsolidated non controlling limited partner interest in cf martin sulphur  lp we receive a material portion of our net income and cash available for distribution from our unconsolidated non controlling limited partner interest in cf martin sulphur  lp cf industries owns the remaining limited partner interest 
we have virtually no rights or control over the operations or management of cash generated by this entity 
cf martin sulphur  lp is managed by its general partner  which is owned equally by cf industries and martin resource management 
deadlocks between cf industries and martin resource management over issues relating to the operation of cf martin sulphur  lp could have an adverse impact on its results of operations and  consequently  the amount and timing of cash generated by its operations that is available for distribution to its partners  including us as a limited partner 
additionally  the partnership agreement for cf martin sulphur  lp requires this entity to make cash distributions to its limited partners subject to the discretion of its general partner  other than in limited circumstances 
as a result  we are substantially dependent upon the discretion of the general partner with respect to the amount and timing of cash distributions from this entity 
if the general partner of cf martin sulphur  lp does not distribute the cash generated by its operations to its limited partners  as a result of a deadlock between cf industries and martin resource management or for any other reason  including operating difficulties or if cf martin sulphur  lp is unable to meet its debt service obligations  our cash flow and quarterly distributions would be reduced significantly 
we may have to sell our interest  or buy the other partnership interests in cf martin sulphur  lp at a time when it may not be in our best interest to do so 
the cf martin sulphur  lp partnership agreement contains a buy sell mechanism that could be implemented by a partner under certain circumstances 
as a result of this buy sell mechanism  we could be forced to either sell our limited partner interest or buy the limited and general partner interests of cf industries in cf martin sulphur  lp at a time when it may not be in our best interest to do so 
in addition  we may not have 
table of contents sufficient cash or available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility to allow us to elect to purchase the limited and general partner interest of cf industries  in which case we may be forced to sell our limited partner interest as a result of this buy sell mechanism when we would otherwise prefer to keep this interest 
further  if cf industries implements this buy sell mechanism and we decide to use cash from operations or obtain financing to purchase cf industries interest in this partnership  we may not be able to make distributions to our unitholders 
conversely  if we are required to sell our interest in this partnership  we would lose our share of distributable income from its operations  our ability to make subsequent distributions to our unitholders could be adversely affected 
if cf martin sulphur  lp issues additional partnership interests  our ownership interest in this partnership could be diluted 
consequently  our share of cf martin sulphur  lp s distributable cash could be reduced  which could adversely affect our ability to make distributions to our unitholders 
cf martin sulphur  lp has the ability under its partnership agreement to issue additional general and limited partner interests 
if cf martin sulphur  lp issues additional interests  our ownership percentage in cf martin sulphur  lp  and our share of cf martin sulphur  lp s distributable cash  may decrease 
this decrease in our ownership interest could reduce the amount of cash distributions we receive from cf martin sulphur  lp and could adversely affect our ability to make distributions to our unitholders 
if we incur material liabilities that are not fully covered by insurance  such as liabilities resulting from accidents on rivers or at sea  spills  fires or explosions  our results of operations and ability to make distributions to our unitholders could be adversely affected 
our operations are subject to the operating hazards and risks incidental to marine transportation  terminalling and the distribution of hydrocarbon products and by products and other industrial products 
these hazards and risks  many of which are beyond our control  include accidents on rivers or at sea and other hazards that could result in releases  spills and other environmental damages  personal injuries  loss of life and suspension of operations  leakage of lpgs and other hydrocarbon products and by products  fires and explosions  damage to transportation  terminalling and storage facilities  and surrounding properties caused by natural disasters  and terrorist attacks or sabotage 
our insurance coverage may not be adequate to protect us from all material expenses related to potential future claims for personal injury and property damage  including various legal proceedings and litigation resulting from these hazards and risks 
if we incur material liabilities that are not covered by insurance  our operating results  cash flow and ability to make distributions to our unitholders could be adversely affected 
changes in the insurance markets attributable to the september  terrorist attacks  and their aftermath  may make some types of insurance more difficult or expensive for us to obtain 
as a result of the september attacks and the risk of future terrorist attacks  we may be unable to secure the levels and types of insurance we would otherwise have secured prior to september moreover  the insurance that may be available to us may be significantly more expensive than our existing insurance coverage 
the price volatility of hydrocarbon products and by products can reduce our results of operations and ability to make distributions to our unitholders 
we and our affiliates purchase hydrocarbon products and by products such as molten sulfur  sulfur derivatives  fuel oil  lpgs  asphalt and other bulk liquids and sell these products to wholesale and bulk customers and to other end users 
since the closing of the tesoro marine asset acquisition  we and our affiliates also distribute and market lubricants 
we also generate revenues through the terminalling of certain products for third parties 
the 
table of contents price and market value of hydrocarbon products and by products can be volatile 
our revenues have been adversely affected by this volatility during periods of decreasing prices because of the reduction in the value and resale price of our inventory 
future price volatility could have an adverse impact on our results of operations  cash flow and ability to make distributions to our unitholders 
restrictions in our credit agreement may prevent us from making distributions to our unitholders 
as of march   we currently have approximately million of indebtedness outstanding  composed of million of debt under our revolving credit facility and million of term debt 
our payment of principal and interest on our debt reduces the cash available for distribution to our unitholders 
in addition  we are prohibited by our revolving credit facility from making cash distributions during an event of default or if the payment of a distribution would cause an event of default under any of our debt agreements 
our leverage and various limitations in our revolving credit facility may reduce our ability to incur additional debt  engage in some transactions and capitalize on acquisition or other business opportunities that could increase cash flows and distributions to our unitholders 
if we do not have sufficient capital resources for acquisitions or opportunities for expansion  our growth will be limited 
we intend to explore acquisition opportunities in order to expand our operations and increase our profitability 
we may finance acquisitions through public and private financing  or we may use our limited partner interests for all or a portion of the consideration to be paid in acquisitions 
distributions of cash with respect to these equity securities or limited partner interests may reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to the common units 
in addition  in the event our limited partner interests do not maintain a sufficient valuation  or potential acquisition candidates are unwilling to accept our limited partner interests as all or part of the consideration  we may be required to use our cash resources  if available  or rely on other financing arrangements to pursue acquisitions 
if we use funds from operations  other cash resources or increased borrowings for an acquisition  the acquisition could adversely impact our ability to make our minimum quarterly distributions to our unitholders 
additionally  if we do not have sufficient capital resources or are not able to obtain financing on terms acceptable to us for acquisitions  our ability to implement our growth strategies may be adversely impacted 
our recent and any future acquisitions may not be successful  may substantially increase our indebtedness and contingent liabilities  and may create integration difficulties 
as part of our business strategy  we intend to acquire businesses or assets we believe complement our existing operations 
we may not be able to successfully integrate recent or any future acquisitions into our existing operations or achieve the desired profitability from such acquisitions 
these acquisitions may require substantial capital expenditures and the incurrence of additional indebtedness 
if we make acquisitions  our capitalization and results of operations may change significantly 
further  any acquisition could result in post closing discovery of material undisclosed liabilities of the acquired business or assets  the unexpected loss of key employees or customers from the acquired businesses  difficulties resulting from our integration of the operations  systems and management of the acquired business  and an unexpected diversion of our management s attention from other operations 
if recent or any future acquisitions are unsuccessful or result in unanticipated events or if we are unable to successfully integrate acquisitions into our existing operations  such acquisitions could adversely affect our results of operations  cash flow and ability to make distributions to our unitholders 

table of contents demand for our terminalling services is substantially dependent on the level of offshore oil and gas exploration  development and production activity 
the level of offshore oil and gas exploration  development and production activity has historically been volatile and is likely to continue to be so in the future 
the level of activity is subject to large fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in a variety of factors that are beyond our control  including prevailing oil and natural gas prices and expectations about future prices and price volatility  the cost of offshore exploration for  and production and transportation of  oil and natural gas  worldwide demand for oil and natural gas  consolidation of oil and gas and oil service companies operating offshore  availability and rate of discovery of new oil and natural gas reserves in offshore areas  local and international political and economic conditions and policies  technological advances affecting energy production and consumption  weather conditions  environmental regulation  and the ability of oil and gas companies to generate or otherwise obtain funds for exploration and production 
we expect levels of offshore oil and gas exploration  development and production activity to continue to be volatile and affect demand for our terminalling services 
our lpg and fertilizer businesses are seasonal and could cause our revenues to vary 
the demand for lpg is highest in the winter 
therefore  revenue from our lpg distribution business is higher in the winter than in other seasons 
our fertilizer business experiences an increase in demand during the spring  which increases the revenue generated by this business line in this period compared to other periods 
the seasonality of the revenue from these business lines may cause our results of operations to vary on a quarter to quarter basis and thus could cause our cash available for quarterly distributions to fluctuate from period to period 
the highly competitive nature of our industry could adversely affect our results of operations and ability to make distributions to our unitholders 
we operate in a highly competitive marketplace in each of our primary business segments 
most of our competitors in each segment are larger companies with greater financial and other resources than we possess 
we may lose customers and future business opportunities to our competitors and any such losses could adversely affect our results of operations and ability to make distributions to our unitholders 
our business is subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental  safety and other regulatory matters 
the violation of or the cost of compliance with these laws and regulations could adversely affect our results of operations and ability to make distributions to our unitholders 
our business is subject to a wide range of environmental  safety and other regulatory laws and regulations 
for example  our operations are subject to permit requirements and increasingly stringent regulations under numerous environmental laws  such as the clean air act  the clean water act  the resource conservation and recovery act  and similar state and local laws 
our costs could increase due to more strict pollution control requirements or liabilities resulting from compliance with future required operating or other regulatory permits 

table of contents new environmental regulations might adversely impact our results of operations and ability to pay distributions to our unitholders 
federal and state agencies also could impose additional safety requirements  any of which could adversely affect our results of operations and ability to make distributions to our unitholders 
the loss or insufficient attention of key personnel could negatively impact our results of operations and ability to make distributions to our unitholders 
additionally  if neither ruben martin nor scott martin is the chief executive officer of our general partner  amounts we owe under our credit facility may become immediately due and payable 
our success is largely dependent upon the continued services of members of the senior management team of martin resource management 
those senior executive officers have significant experience in our businesses and have developed strong relationships with a broad range of industry participants 
the loss of any of these executives could have a material adverse effect on our relationships with these industry participants  our results of operations and our ability to make distributions to our unitholders 
additionally  if neither ruben martin nor scott martin is the chief executive officer of our general partner  the lender under our credit facility could declare amounts outstanding thereunder immediately due and payable 
if such event occurs  our results of operations and our ability to make distribution to our unitholders could be negatively impacted 
we do not have employees 
we rely solely on officers and employees of martin resource management to operate and manage our business 
martin resource management operates businesses and conducts activities of its own in which we have no economic interest 
there could be competition for the time and effort of the officers and employees who provide services to our general partner 
if these officers and employees do not or cannot devote sufficient attention to the management and operation of our business  our results of operation and ability to make distributions to our unitholders may be reduced 
our loss of significant commercial relationships with martin resource management could adversely impact our results of operations and ability to make distributions to our unitholders

our business would be adversely affected if operations at our transportation  terminalling and distribution facilities experienced significant interruptions 
our business would also be adversely affected if the operations of our customers and suppliers experienced significant interruptions 
our operations are dependent upon our terminalling and storage facilities and various means of transportation 
we are also dependent upon the uninterrupted operations of certain facilities owned or operated by our suppliers and customers 
any significant interruption at these facilities or inability to transport products to or from these facilities or to or from our customers for any reason would adversely affect our results of operations  cash flow and ability to make distributions to our unitholders

our marine transportation business would be adversely affected if we do not satisfy the requirements of the jones act  or if the jones act were modified or eliminated 
the jones act is a federal law that restricts domestic marine transportation in the united states to vessels built and registered in the united states 
furthermore  the jones act requires that the vessels be manned and owned by united states citizens 
if we fail to comply with these requirements  our vessels lose their eligibility to engage in coastwise trade within united states domestic waters 
the requirements that our vessels be united states built and manned by united states citizens  the crewing requirements and material requirements of the coast guard and the application of united states labor and tax laws significantly increase the costs of united states flag vessels when compared with foreign flag vessels 
during the past several years  certain interest groups have lobbied congress to repeal the jones act to facilitate foreign flag competition for trades and cargoes reserved for united states flag vessels under the jones act and cargo preference laws 
if the jones act were to be modified to permit foreign competition that would not be subject to the same united states government imposed costs  we may need to lower the prices we charge for our services in order to compete with foreign competitors  which would adversely affect our cash flow and ability to make distributions to our unitholders 
our marine transportation business would be adversely affected if the united states government purchases or requisitions any of our vessels under the merchant marine act 
we are subject to the merchant marine act of  which provides that  upon proclamation by the president of the united states of a national emergency or a threat to the national security  the united states secretary of transportation may requisition or purchase any vessel or other watercraft owned by united states citizens including us  provided that we are considered a united states citizen for this purpose 
if one of our pushboats  tugboats or tank barges were purchased or requisitioned by the united states government under this law  we would be entitled to be paid the fair market value of the vessel in the case of a purchase or  in the case of a requisition  the fair market value of charter hire 
however  if one of our pushboats or tugboats is requisitioned or purchased and its associated tank barge is left idle  we would not be entitled to receive any compensation for the lost revenues resulting from the idled barge 
we also would not be entitled to be compensated for any consequential damages we suffer as a result of the requisition or purchase of any of our pushboats  tugboats or tank barges 
if any of our vessels are purchased or requisitioned for an extended period of time by the united states government  such transactions could have a material adverse affect on our results of operations  cash flow and ability to make distributions to our unitholders 
regulations affecting the domestic tank vessel industry may limit our ability to do business  increase our costs and adversely impact our results of operations and ability to make distributions to our unitholders 
the us oil pollution act of  or opa  provides for the phase out of single hull vessels and the phase in of the exclusive operation of double hull tank vessels in us waters 
under opa  substantially all tank vessels that do not have double hulls will be phased out by and will not be permitted to come to us ports or trade in us waters 
the phase out dates vary based on the age of the vessel and other factors 
all of our offshore tank barges are double hull vessels and have no phase out date 
we have inland single hull barges that will be phased out in the year the phase out of these single hull vessels in accordance with opa may require us to make substantial capital expenditures  which could adversely affect our operations and market position and reduce our cash available for distribution

under our omnibus agreement with martin resource management  martin resource management provides us with corporate staff and support services on behalf of our general partner that are substantially identical in nature and quality to the services it conducted for our business prior to our formation 
the omnibus agreement requires us to reimburse martin resource management for the costs and expenses it incurs in rendering these services  including an overhead allocation to us of martin resource management s indirect general and administrative expenses from its corporate allocation pool 
these payments may be substantial 
payments to martin resource management will reduce the amount of available cash for distribution to our unitholders 
martin resource management has conflicts of interest and limited fiduciary responsibilities  which may permit it to favor its own interests to the detriment of our unitholders 
martin resource management currently owns approximately of our outstanding limited partnership interests and owns and controls our general partner  which owns a general partner interest and incentive distribution rights in us 
conflicts of interest may arise between martin resource management and our general partner  on the one hand  and our unitholders  on the other hand 
as a result of these conflicts  our general partner may favor its own interests and the interests of martin resource management over the interests of our unitholders 
potential conflicts of interest between us  martin resource management and our general partner could occur in many of our day to day operations including  among others  the following situations officers of martin resource management who provide services to us also devote significant time to the businesses of martin resource management and are compensated by martin resource management for that time 
we own an unconsolidated non controlling limited partnership interest in cf martin sulphur  lp  which operates a business involving the acquisition  handling and sale of molten sulfur 
as a limited partner  we have virtually no rights or control over the operation and management of this entity 
the day to day operation and control of this partnership is managed by its general partner  cf martin sulphur  llc  which is owned equally by cf industries and martin resource management 
because we have very limited control over the operations and management of cf martin sulphur  lp  we are subject to the risks that this business may be operated in a manner that would not be in our interest 
for example  the amount of cash distributed to us from cf martin sulphur  lp could decrease if it uses a significant amount of cash from operations or additional debt to make significant capital expenditures or acquisitions 
neither our partnership agreement nor any other agreement requires martin resource management to pursue a business strategy that favors us or utilizes our assets or services 
martin resource management s directors and officers have a fiduciary duty to make these decisions in the best interests of the shareholders of martin resource management without regard to the best interests of the unitholders 
martin resource management may engage in limited competition with us 
our general partner is allowed to take into account the interests of parties other than us  such as martin resource management  in resolving conflicts of interest  which has the effect of reducing its fiduciary duty to our unitholders 
under our partnership agreement  our general partner may limit its liability and reduce its fiduciary duties  while also restricting the remedies available to our unitholders for actions that  without the limitations and reductions  might constitute breaches of fiduciary duty 
as a result of purchasing units  you will be treated as having consented to some actions and conflicts of interest 
table of contents that  without such consent  might otherwise constitute a breach of fiduciary or other duties under applicable state law 
our general partner determines which costs incurred by martin resource management are reimbursable by us 
our partnership agreement does not restrict our general partner from causing us to pay it or its affiliates for any services rendered on terms that are fair and reasonable to us or from entering into additional contractual arrangements with any of these entities on our behalf 
our general partner controls the enforcement of obligations owed to us by martin resource management 
our general partner decides whether to retain separate counsel  accountants or others to perform services for us 
in some instances  our general partner may cause us to borrow funds to permit us to pay cash distributions  even if the purpose or effect of the borrowing is to make a distribution on the subordinated units  to make incentive distributions or to accelerate the expiration of the subordination period 
our general partner has broad discretion to establish financial reserves for the proper conduct of our business 
these reserves also will affect the amount of cash available for distribution 
our general partner may establish reserves for distribution on the subordinated units  but only if those reserves will not prevent us from distributing the full minimum quarterly distribution  plus any arrearages  on the common units for the following four quarters 
please read item certain relationships and related transactions below 
unitholders have less power to elect or remove management of our general partner than holders of common stock in a corporation 
unitholders do not have sufficient voting power to elect or remove our general partner without the consent of martin resource management 
unlike the holders of common stock in a corporation  unitholders have only limited voting rights on matters affecting our business and therefore limited ability to influence management s decisions regarding our business 
unitholders did not elect our general partner or its directors and will have no right to elect our general partner or its directors on an annual or other continuing basis 
martin resource management elects the directors of our general partner 
although our general partner has a fiduciary duty to manage our partnership in a manner beneficial to us and our unitholders  the directors of our general partner also have a fiduciary duty to manage our general partner in a manner beneficial to martin resource management and its shareholders 
if unitholders are dissatisfied with the performance of our general partner  they will have a limited ability to remove our general partner 
our general partner generally may not be removed except upon the vote of the holders of at least of the outstanding units voting together as a single class 
because our general partner and its affiliates  including martin resource management  control approximately of all limited partner units  our general partner initially cannot be removed without the consent of it and its affiliates 
if our general partner is removed without cause during the subordination period and units held by our general partner and its affiliates are not voted in favor of removal  all remaining subordinated units will automatically be converted into common units and any existing arrearages on the common units will be extinguished 
a removal under these circumstances would adversely affect the common units by prematurely eliminating their contractual right to distributions and liquidation preference over the subordinated units  which preferences would otherwise have continued until we had met certain distribution and performance tests 
cause is narrowly defined to mean that a court of competent jurisdiction has entered a final  non appealable judgment finding our general partner liable for actual fraud  gross negligence or willful or wanton misconduct in its capacity as our general partner 
cause does not include most cases of charges of poor management of our business  so the removal 
table of contents of our general partner because of the unitholders dissatisfaction with our general partner s performance in managing our partnership will most likely result in the termination of the subordination period 
unitholders voting rights are further restricted by our partnership agreement provision prohibiting any units held by a person owning or more of any class of units then outstanding  other than our general partner  its affiliates  their transferees and persons who acquired such units with the prior approval of our general partner s directors  from voting on any matter 
in addition  our partnership agreement contains provisions limiting the ability of unitholders to call meetings or to acquire information about our operations  as well as other provisions limiting the unitholders ability to influence the manner or direction of management 
as a result of these provisions  it will be more difficult for a third party to acquire our partnership without first negotiating the acquisition with our general partner 
consequently  it is unlikely the trading price of our common units will ever reflect a takeover premium 
our general partner s discretion in determining the level of our cash reserves may adversely affect our ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders 
our partnership agreement requires our general partner to deduct from operating surplus cash reserves it determines in its reasonable discretion to be necessary to fund our future operating expenditures 
in addition  our partnership agreement permits our general partner to reduce available cash by establishing cash reserves for the proper conduct of our business  to comply with applicable law or agreements to which we are a party or to provide funds for future distributions to partners 
these cash reserves will affect the amount of cash available for distribution to our unitholders 
unitholders may not have limited liability if a court finds that we have not complied with applicable statutes or that unitholder action constitutes control of our business 
the limitations on the liability of holders of limited partner interests for the obligations of a limited partnership have not been clearly established in some states 
the holder of one of our common units could be held liable in some circumstances for our obligations to the same extent as a general partner if a court determined that we had been conducting business in any state without compliance with the applicable limited partnership statute  or the right or the exercise of the right by our unitholders as a group to remove or replace our general partner  to approve some amendments to our partnership agreement  or to take other action under our partnership agreement constituted participation in the control of our business 
our general partner generally has unlimited liability for our obligations  such as our debts and environmental liabilities  except for our contractual obligations that are expressly made without recourse to our general partner 
in addition  under some circumstances  a unitholder may be liable to us for the amount of a distribution for a period of three years from the date of the distribution

our partnership agreement contains provisions that reduce the remedies available to unitholders for actions that might otherwise constitute a breach of fiduciary duty by our general partner 
our partnership agreement limits the liability and reduces the fiduciary duties of our general partner to the unitholders 
our partnership agreement also restricts the remedies available to unitholders for actions that would otherwise constitute breaches of our general partner s fiduciary duties 
for example  our partnership agreement permits our general partner to make a number of decisions in its sole discretion 
this entitles our general partner to consider only the interests and factors that it desires  and it has no duty or obligation to give any consideration to any interest of  or factors affecting  us  our affiliates or any limited partner  
table of contents provides that our general partner is entitled to make other decisions in its reasonable discretion which may reduce the obligations to which our general partner would otherwise be held  generally provides that affiliated transactions and resolutions of conflicts of interest not involving a required vote of unitholders must be fair and reasonable to us and that  in determining whether a transaction or resolution is fair and reasonable  our general partner may consider the interests of all parties involved  including its own  and provides that our general partner and its officers and directors will not be liable for monetary damages to us  our limited partners or assignees for errors of judgment or for any acts or omissions if our general partner and those other persons acted in good faith 
owners of common units will be treated as having consented to the various actions contemplated in our partnership agreement and conflicts of interest that might otherwise be considered a breach of fiduciary duties under applicable state law 
we may issue additional common units without unitholder approval  which would dilute unitholder ownership interests 
during the subordination period  our general partner  without the approval of our unitholders  may cause us to issue up to  additional common units 
our general partner may also cause us to issue an unlimited number of additional common units or other equity securities of equal rank with the common units  without unitholder approval  in a number of circumstances such as the issuance of common units in connection with acquisitions that increase cash flow from operations on a pro forma  per unit basis  the conversion of subordinated units into common units  the conversion of units of equal rank with the common units into common units under some circumstances  or the conversion of our general partner s general partner interest in us and its incentive distribution rights into common units as a result of the withdrawal of our general partner 
after the subordination period  we may issue an unlimited number of limited partner interests of any type without the approval of our unitholders 
our partnership agreement does not give our unitholders the right to approve our issuance of equity securities ranking junior to the common units at any time 
the issuance of additional common units or other equity securities of equal or senior rank will have the following effects our unitholders proportionate ownership interest in us will decrease  the amount of cash available for distribution on a per unit basis may decrease  because a lower percentage of total outstanding units will be subordinated units  the risk that a shortfall in the payment of the minimum quarterly distribution will be borne by our common unitholders will increase  the relative voting strength of each previously outstanding unit will diminish  and the market price of the common units may decline 
the control of our general partner may be transferred to a third party  and that party could replace our current management team  without unitholder consent

our general partner has a limited call right that may require unitholders to sell their common units at an undesirable time or price 
if at any time our general partner and its affiliates own more than of the common units  our general partner will have the right  but not the obligation  which it may assign to any of its affiliates or to us  to acquire all  but not less than all  of the remaining common units held by unaffiliated persons at a price not less than the then current market price 
as a result  you may be required to sell your common units at an undesirable time or price and may not receive any return on your investment 
you may also incur a tax liability upon a sale of your units 
no provision in our partnership agreement  or in any other agreement we have with our general partner or martin resource management  prohibits our general partner or its affiliates from acquiring more than of our common units

our common units have a limited trading history and a limited trading volume compared to other publicly traded securities 
our common units are quoted on the nasdaq national market under the symbol mmlp 
however  our common units have a limited trading history and daily trading volumes for our common units are  and may continue to be  relatively small compared to many other securities quoted on the nasdaq national market 
we cannot assure you that this offering will increase the trading volume for our common units  and the price of our common units may  therefore  be volatile 
tax risks the irs could treat us as a corporation for tax purposes  which would substantially reduce the cash available for distribution to unitholders 
the anticipated after tax economic benefit of an investment in us depends largely on our classification as a partnership for federal income tax purposes 
we have not requested  and do not plan to request  a ruling from the irs on this or any other matter affecting us 
if we were treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes  we would pay tax on our income at corporate rates  which is currently a maximum of 
distributions to unitholders would generally be taxed again to them as corporate distributions  and no income  gains  losses  or deductions would flow through to them 
because a tax would be imposed upon us as a corporation  the cash available for distribution to unitholders would be 
table of contents substantially reduced 
treatment of us as a corporation would result in a material reduction in the anticipated cash flow and after tax return to unitholders and therefore would likely result in a substantial reduction in the value of the common units 
current law may change so as to cause us to be taxable as a corporation for federal income tax purposes or otherwise subject us to entity level taxation 
our partnership agreement provides that  if a law is enacted or existing law is modified or interpreted in a manner that subjects us to taxation as a corporation or otherwise subjects us to entity level taxation for federal  state or local income tax purposes  then the minimum quarterly distribution amount and the target distribution amount will be adjusted to reflect the impact of that law on us 
a successful irs contest of the federal income tax positions we take may adversely affect the market for our common units and the costs of any contest will be borne by our unitholders and our general partner 
we have not requested a ruling from the irs with respect to our treatment as a partnership for federal income tax purposes or any other matter affecting us 
the irs may adopt positions that differ from our counsel s conclusions expressed in this prospectus 
it may be necessary to resort to administrative or court proceedings to sustain some or all of our counsel s conclusions or the positions we take 
a court may not agree with some or all our counsel s conclusions or the positions we take 
our counsel has not rendered an opinion on certain matters affecting us 
any contest with the irs may materially and adversely impact the market for our common units and the prices at which they trade 
in addition  the costs of any contest with the irs will be borne directly or indirectly by all of our unitholders and our general partner 
unitholders may be required to pay taxes on income from us even if they do not receive any cash distributions from us 
unitholders may be required to pay federal income taxes and  in some cases  state  local and foreign income taxes on their share of our taxable income even if they receive no cash distributions from us 
unitholders may not receive cash distributions from us equal to their share of our taxable income or even the tax liability that results from the taxation of their share of our taxable income 
tax gain or loss on the disposition of our common units could be different than expected 
if unitholders sell their common units  they will recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized and your tax basis in those common units 
prior distributions in excess of the total net taxable income unitholders were allocated for a common unit  which decreased their tax basis in that common unit  will  in effect  become taxable income to them if the common unit is sold at a price greater than their tax basis in that common unit  even if the price they receive is less than their original cost 
a substantial portion of the amount realized  whether or not representing gain  may be ordinary income to them 
should the irs successfully contest some positions we take  unitholders could recognize more gain on the sale of units than would be the case under those positions  without the benefit of decreased income in prior years 
in addition  if unitholders sell their units  they may incur a tax liability in excess of the amount of cash they receive from the sale 
changes in federal income tax law could affect the value of our common units 
on may   the jobs and growth tax relief reconciliation act of was signed into law  which generally reduces the maximum tax rate applicable to corporate dividends to 
this reduction could materially affect the value of our common units in relation to alternative investments in corporate stock  as investments in corporate stock may be relatively more attractive to individual investors thereby exerting downward pressure on the market price of our common units 
tax exempt entities  regulated investment companies and foreign persons face unique tax issues from owning common units that may result in adverse tax consequences to them 
investment in common units by tax exempt entities such as individual retirement accounts known as iras  regulated investment companies known as mutual funds and non us persons raises issues unique to them 
for example  virtually all of our income allocated to organizations exempt from federal income tax  including 
table of contents individual retirement accounts and other retirement plans  will be unrelated business income and will be taxable to them 
very little of our income will be qualifying income to a regulated investment company 
distributions to non us persons will be reduced by withholding taxes at the highest effective tax rate applicable to individuals  and non us persons will be required to file federal income tax returns and pay tax on their share of our taxable income 
we are registered as a tax shelter 
this may increase the risk of an irs audit of us or a unitholder 
we are registered with the irs as a tax shelter 
our tax shelter registration number is the federal income tax laws require that some types of entities  including some partnerships  register as tax shelters in response to the perception that they claim tax benefits that may be unwarranted 
as a result  we may be audited by the irs and tax adjustments could be made 
any unitholder owning less than a profits interest in us has very limited rights to participate in the income tax audit process 
further  any adjustments in our tax returns will lead to adjustments in our unitholders tax returns and may lead to audits of unitholders tax returns and adjustments of items unrelated to us 
unitholders will bear the cost of any expense incurred in connection with an examination of their tax returns 
we treat a purchaser of our common units as having the same tax benefits without regard to the seller s identity 
the irs may challenge this treatment  which could adversely affect the value of the common units 
because we cannot match transferors and transferees of common units and because of other reasons  we will adopt depreciation positions that may not conform to all aspects of the treasury regulations 
a successful irs challenge to those positions could adversely affect the amount of tax benefits available to unitholders 
it also could affect the timing of these tax benefits or the amount of gain from the sale of common units and could have a negative impact on the value of our common units or result in audit adjustments to their tax returns 
unitholders may be subject to state  local and foreign taxes and return filing requirements as a result of investing in our common units 
in addition to federal income taxes  unitholders may be subject to other taxes  such as state  local and foreign income taxes  unincorporated business taxes and estate  inheritance  or intangible taxes that are imposed by the various jurisdictions in which we do business or own property 
unitholders may be required to state  local and foreign income tax returns and pay state and local income taxes in some or all of the various jurisdictions in which we do business or own property and may be subject to penalties for failure to comply with those requirements 
we own property and conduct business in alabama  arizona  arkansas  georgia  florida  illinois  louisiana  mississippi  texas and utah

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices 
the principal market risk to which we are exposed is commodity price risk for lpgs 
we also incur  to a lesser extent  risks related to interest rate fluctuations 
we do not engage in commodity contract trading or hedging activities 
commodity price risk 
our lpg storage and distribution business is a margin based business in which our gross profits depend on the excess of our sales prices over our supply costs 
as a result  our profitability is sensitive to changes in the market price of lpgs 
lpgs are a commodity and the price we pay for them can fluctuate significantly in response to supply and other market conditions over which we have no control 
when there are sudden and sharp decreases in the market price of lpgs  we may not be able to maintain our margins 
consequently  sudden and sharp decreases in the wholesale cost of lpgs could reduce our gross profits 
we attempt to minimize our exposure to market risk by maintaining a balanced inventory position by matching our physical inventories and purchase obligations with sales commitments 
we do not acquire and hold inventory or derivative financial instruments for the purpose of speculating on price changes that might expose us to indeterminable losses 

table of contents interest rate risk 
we are exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of our term loan and revolving credit facility  each of which have a floating interest rate as of december  we had a total of million of indebtedness outstanding under our credit facility at december  the impact of a increase in interest rates on this amount of debt would result in an increase in interest expense  and a corresponding decrease in net income of approximately million annually 
as of march   we had a total of million of indebtedness outstanding under our credit facility 
the impact of a increase in interest rates on this amount of debt would result in an increase in interest expense  and a corresponding decrease in net income of approximately million annually
