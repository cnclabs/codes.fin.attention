item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are the th largest radio broadcasting company in the united states according to bia financial network  inc we own and operate radio stations in markets including atlanta  ga  boston  ma  philadelphia  pa  miami ft 
lauderdale  fl  las vegas  nv  west palm beach boca raton  fl  ft 
myers naples  fl  fayetteville  nc  greenville new bern jacksonville  nc  and augusta  ga 
we refer to each group of radio stations that we own in each radio market as a market cluster 
our operations are divided into three reportable segments  radio group one  radio group two  and radio group three 
radio group one includes market clusters located in miami ft 
lauderdale  west palm beach boca raton  ft 
myers naples  and greenville new bern jacksonville 
radio group two includes market clusters located in atlanta  boston  philadelphia  fayetteville  and augusta 
radio group three includes our market cluster located in las vegas 
operating results and total assets for our reportable segments are contained in note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
effective january   we reorganized our internal reporting process including the information provided to the company s chief operating decision maker to better facilitate his evaluation of the performance of our radio stations 
our chief operating decision maker now receives operating results and other information directly from our radio stations and no longer evaluates performance or allocates resources based on the operating 
table of contents segments previously reported 
as a result of this reorganization  we now operate only one segment which includes all of our radio stations 
accordingly  we will no longer be reporting segment information beginning in the first quarter of net revenue 
our net revenue  from which we generate the majority of our cash  is primarily derived from the sale of advertising airtime to local and national advertisers 
net revenue is gross revenue less agency commissions 
local revenue generally consists of advertising airtime sales to advertisers in a radio station s local market either directly with the advertiser or through the advertiser s agency 
national revenue generally consists of advertising airtime sales to agencies purchasing advertising for multiple markets 
national sales are generally facilitated by our national representation firm  which serves as our agent in these transactions 
we generated of our net revenue from sales of local advertising airtime and of our net revenue from sales of national advertising airtime in we generated the balance of our net revenue from promotional events  brokered programming and sales to broadcasting networks that purchase advertising airtime 
the advertising rates that we are able to charge and the number of advertisements that we can be broadcast without jeopardizing listener levels generally determine our net revenue 
advertising rates are primarily based on three factors a radio station s audience share in the demographic groups targeted by advertisers  as measured principally by quarterly reports issued by the arbitron ratings company  the number of radio stations  as well as other forms of media  in the market competing for the same demographic groups  the supply of  and demand for  radio advertising time  and the size of the market 
our net revenue is affected by general economic conditions  competition and our ability to improve operations at our market clusters 
seasonal revenue fluctuations are also common in the radio broadcasting industry and are primarily due to variations in advertising expenditures by local and national advertisers 
typically  revenues are lowest in the first calendar quarter of the year and highest in the fourth calendar quarter 
we use trade agreements to reduce cash paid for expenses by exchanging advertising airtime for goods or services  however  we minimize our use of trade agreements to maximize cash revenue from our inventory of airtime 
the following summary table presents a comparison of our trade revenue and expenses for the years ended december   and year ended december  trade revenue trade expenses operating expenses 
our operating expenses consist primarily of programming  engineering  and promotional expenses  reported as cost of services  and selling  general and administrative expenses incurred at our radio stations  general and administrative expenses  including compensation  insurance and other expenses  incurred at our corporate offices  and depreciation and amortization 
we strive to control our operating expenses by centralizing certain functions at our corporate offices and consolidating certain functions in each of our market clusters 
income taxes 
our effective tax rate is approximately  which differs from the federal statutory rate of due to the effect of state income taxes and certain of our expenses that are not deductible for tax purposes 
for the year ended december   our effective tax rate was increased by a non deductible million loss arising from a split dollar life insurance arrangement 
certain events that affected our results of operations 
on february   we completed the sale of wbyu am to abc  inc for million 
the proceeds from the sale were used to reduce the outstanding balance of the revolving credit loan under our credit facility 
upon completion of this sale we no longer have operations in new orleans  therefore the results of operations for wbyu am have been reported as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations for all periods presented 

table of contents effective january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized  but instead tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the adoption of sfas in accordance with the provisions of sfas  as of january   we tested our fcc broadcasting licenses  which were identified as intangible assets having indefinite useful lives  and goodwill for impairment 
to determine the fair value of our fcc broadcasting licenses and goodwill  we obtained appraisals from an independent appraisal company 
as a result of the testing  we recognized an impairment of million related to fcc broadcasting licenses and goodwill in the radio group three segment and recorded the loss as a cumulative effect of accounting change in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  the cumulative effect of the accounting change  net of income tax effect  decreased net income million and earnings per share  of which million or per share is reported in discontinued operations 
we tested our fcc broadcasting licenses and goodwill as of december  and and no further impairment losses were recorded 
the following information presents the impact on the net income loss and net income loss per share had sfas been effective on january  and as a result fcc broadcasting licenses and goodwill had not been amortized during net income loss fcc broadcasting licenses amortization net of income tax benefit of goodwill amortization net of income tax benefit of  adjusted net income loss basic net income loss per share net income loss fcc broadcasting licenses amortization goodwill amortization adjusted net income loss diluted net income loss per share net income loss fcc broadcasting licenses amortization goodwill amortization adjusted net income loss basic common shares outstanding diluted common shares outstanding critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements  and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we base our estimates on historical experience and assumptions we consider reasonable at the time of making those estimates 
we evaluate our estimates on an on going basis 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different circumstances or using different assumptions 
accounts receivable 
we have recorded an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from customers inability to make payments to us 
we review specific accounts by radio station  the current 
table of contents financial condition of our customers and historical write off experience when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  then additional allowances may be required 
fcc broadcasting licenses 
our fcc broadcasting licenses represent significant amounts recorded in our financial statements 
to estimate the fair value of our fcc broadcasting licenses for our impairment test as of december   we obtained appraisals from an independent appraisal company 
subsequent estimates of fair value  whether by appraisal or management estimates of future discounted cash flows  may result in an impairment of our fcc broadcasting licenses in the future 
in addition  the use of different underlying assumptions by an appraisal company or management  such as determining future cash flows and discount rates  could result in materially different estimates of fair value and therefore could result in a material impairment of our fcc broadcasting licenses

liquidity and capital resources overview 
our primary sources of liquidity are internally generated cash flow and our credit facility 
our liquidity needs have been  and for the next twelve months and thereafter are expected to continue to be  for working capital  debt service  radio station acquisitions and other general corporate purposes  including capital expenditures 
we expect to provide for future liquidity needs through one or a combination of the following internally generated cash flow  our credit facility  additional borrowings  other than under our existing credit facility  to the extent permitted  and additional equity offerings 
we believe that we will have sufficient liquidity and capital resources to permit us to meet our financial obligations for at least the next twelve months 
however  poor financial results  unanticipated acquisition opportunities or unanticipated expenses could give rise to additional debt servicing requirements or other additional financing requirements sooner than we expect and  we may not secure financing when needed or on acceptable terms 
as of december   we held million in cash and cash equivalents and had million in remaining commitments available under our credit facility  however  as of december  our maximum total leverage covenant would have limited additional borrowings to million 
our ability to reduce our total leverage ratio by increasing operating cash flow and or decreasing long term debt will determine how much  if any  of the remaining commitments under our credit facility will be available to us in the future 
poor financial results or unanticipated expenses could result in our failure to maintain or lower our total leverage ratio and we may not be permitted to make any additional borrowings under our credit facility

table of contents risk factors our radio stations may not be able to compete effectively in their respective markets for advertising revenues  which could adversely affect our revenue and cash flow 
we operate in a highly competitive business 
a decline in our audience share or advertising rates in a particular market may cause a decline in the revenue and cash flow of our stations located in that market 
our radio stations compete for audiences and advertising revenues within their respective markets directly with other radio stations  as well as with other media 
these media include newspapers  magazines  network and cable television  outdoor advertising and direct mail and emerging media such as satellite radio 
our stations could suffer a reduction in ratings or advertising revenue and could incur increased promotional and other expenses if another radio station in a market was to convert its programming to a format similar to  and thereby compete directly with  one of our stations  or a new station was to adopt a comparable format or if an existing competitor were to improve its audience share 
other radio broadcasting companies may enter into markets in which we operate or may operate in the future 
these companies may be larger and have more financial resources than we have 
our radio stations may not be able to maintain or increase their current audience ratings and advertising revenues 
a downturn in the performance of our miami ft 
lauderdale could adversely affect our net revenue 
a ratings decline or other operating difficulty in the performance of our radio stations in miami ft 
lauderdale could have a disproportionately adverse affect on our consolidated net revenue 
for the year ended december   approximately of our consolidated net revenue came from our radio stations in the miami ft 
lauderdale market 
because of the large portion of our consolidated net revenue from miami ft 
lauderdale we have greater exposure to adverse events or conditions affecting the economy in that market than would be the case if we were more geographically diverse 
we have substantial debt that could have important consequences to you 
we have debt that is substantial in relation to our stockholders equity 
as of december   we had long term debt of million and stockholders equity of million 
our long term debt is substantial in amount and could have an impact on you 
for example  it could require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to debt service  thereby reducing the availability of cash flow for other purposes  including ongoing capital expenditures and future acquisitions  impair our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes  limit our ability to compete  expand and make capital improvements  increase our vulnerability to economic downturns  limit our ability to withstand competitive pressures and reduce our flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions  and limit or prohibit our ability to pay dividends and make other distributions 
as of december   we had million in remaining commitments available under our old credit facility  however  as of december  our maximum total leverage covenant would have limited additional borrowings to million 
our new credit facility also contains a similarly restrictive covenant 
our ability to 
table of contents reduce our total leverage ratio by increasing operating cash flow and or decreasing long term debt will determine how much  if any  of the remaining commitments under our credit facility will be available to us in the future 
poor financial results or unanticipated expenses could result in our failure to maintain or lower our total leverage ratio and we may not be permitted to make any additional borrowings under our credit facility 
moreover  we may need to modify or enter into a new credit facility to close on future acquisitions 
we also may seek to obtain other funding or additional financing in connection with the acquisition of radio stations  the full or partial repayment of our outstanding debt and or the payment of a dividend on our common stock 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain other funding  additional financing or the approvals  if necessary  for any of these transactions 
any additional borrowings would further increase the amount of our debt and the associated risks 
we are subject to restrictive debt covenants  which may restrict our operational flexibility 
our credit facility contains various financial and operating covenants  including  among other things  restrictions on our ability to incur additional indebtedness  subject our assets to additional liens  enter into certain investments  consolidate  merge or effect asset sales  enter into sale and lese back transactions  sell or discount accounts receivable  enter into transactions with our affiliates or stockholders  change the nature of our business  pay dividends on and redeem or repurchase capital stock  or make other restricted payments 
these restrictions could limit our ability to take actions that require funds in excess of those available to us 
our credit facility also requires us to maintain specified financial ratios and to satisfy financial condition tests 
our ability to meet those financial ratios and tests may be affected by events beyond our control and we cannot assure you that we will meet those ratios and tests 
our breach of any of these covenants  ratios  tests or restrictions could result in an event of default under our credit facility 
if an event of default exists under our credit facility  the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder to be immediately due and payable 
if the lenders accelerate the payment of the indebtedness  we cannot assure you that our assets would be sufficient to repay in full that indebtedness 
we may also incur future debt obligations in addition to  or in lieu of  our credit facility 
such future debt obligations might subject us to additional and different restrictive covenants that could further limit our operational flexibility or subject us to other events of default 
the radio broadcasting industry faces many unpredictable business risks that could have a material adverse affect on our advertising revenues 
our future operations are subject to many business risks  including those risks that specifically influence the radio broadcasting industry  which could have a material adverse affect on our business 
these risks include  but are not limited to shifts in population  demographics or audience preferences  increased competition for advertising revenues with other radio stations  television stations and other entertainment and communications media  and changes in government regulations and policies and actions of federal regulatory bodies  including the federal communications commission  or fcc  internal revenue service  united states department of justice  and the federal trade commission 
in addition  we believe that for most businesses advertising is a discretionary business expense  meaning that spending on advertising tends to decline disproportionately during economic recession or downturn as compared to other types of business spending 
consequently  a recession or downturn in the united states economy or the economy of an individual geographic market in which we own or operate radio stations would likely adversely affect our advertising revenues and our results of operations 

table of contents we may not be successful in identifying  financing  consummating and integrating future acquisitions  an element of our business strategy  which could significantly impair our future growth 
we believe that in order to continue to compete effectively in our industry  we need to identify radio stations that meet certain criteria and consummate acquisitions of such stations on terms that are both economically and commercially acceptable to us 
during the years ended december  and  however  we were unable to identify radio stations that satisfied these requirements 
as a result  during that time  we did not acquire any stations 
while we intend to continue to pursue our acquisition strategy  we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify radio stations that meet our acquisition requirements and consummate future acquisitions 
additionally  even if we are successful in identifying acceptable targets  our ability to consummate acquisitions is subject to a number of risks  including the risks that our competitors may be able to outbid us for acquisitions because they have greater financial resources  required regulatory approvals may result in unanticipated delays in  or prohibitions of  completing acquisitions  and we may be unable to raise any additional financing necessary to consummate such acquisitions and additional financing may not be available to us on terms that are acceptable to us or permitted under our credit facility 
even if we are able to consummate acquisitions  we cannot assure you that we will be successful in integrating the operations of the acquired station or stations into our existing operations or that we will realize the benefits that we expect to realize in connection with such acquisitions 
moreover  consummating these acquisitions could also result in the incurrence of additional debt and related interest expense as well as unforeseen contingent liabilities  all of which could have a material adverse effect of our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our chairman of the board and chief executive officer controls beasley broadcast group  and members of his immediate family also own a substantial equity interest in beasley broadcast group 
their interests may conflict with yours 
george g 
beasley  our chairman of the board and chief executive officer  generally is able to control the vote on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders 
without the approval of mr 
beasley  we will be unable to consummate transactions involving an actual or potential change in control  including transactions in which you might otherwise receive a premium for your shares over then current market prices 
shares of class b common stock  that mr 
beasley beneficially owns  represent approximately of the total voting power of all classes of our common stock 
mr 
beasley also has currently exercisable employee stock options to purchase  shares of class a common stock 
members of his immediate family also own significant amounts of class b common stock and  through stock options  class a common stock 
mr 
beasley will be able to direct our management and policies  except with respect to those matters requiring a class vote under the provisions of our amended certificate of incorporation  third amended and restated bylaws or applicable law 
historically  we have entered into significant transactions with george g 
beasley  members of his immediate family and affiliated entities that may conflict with the interests of our stockholders now or in the future 
see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
our business depends on the efforts of key personnel and the loss of any one of them could have a material adverse affect on our business 
our business depends upon the continued efforts  abilities and expertise of our executive officers and other key employees  including george g 
beasley  our chairman of the board and chief executive officer 
mr 
beasley is years old 
we believe the unique combination of skills and experience possessed by 
table of contents mr 
beasley would be difficult to replace and that the loss of mr 
beasley s or other key executives expertise could impair our ability to execute our operating and acquisition strategies 
we may not remain competitive if we do not respond to the rapid change in technology  standards and services that characterize our industry 
the radio broadcasting industry is subject to rapid technological change  evolving industry standards and the emergence of new media technologies and services 
we may not have the resources to acquire and deploy new technologies or to introduce new services that could compete with these new technologies 
competition arising from new technologies or regulatory change may have an adverse effect on the radio broadcasting industry or on our company 
if we are not able to obtain regulatory approval for our acquisitions  our future growth may be impaired 
an important part of our growth strategy is the acquisition of additional radio stations 
we may not be able to complete all the acquisitions that we may agree to make 
radio station acquisitions are subject to the approval of the fcc and  potentially  other regulatory authorities 
fcc regulations limit the number of radio stations that a licensee can own in a market  which could restrict our ability to consummate future transactions and in certain circumstances could require us to divest some radio stations 
the fcc recently adopted rules which could further limit the number of radio stations a licensee can own in a market  and may further restrict our ability to acquire and sell radio stations 
although those new rules are currently stayed by a federal court  they could become effective if upheld by the courts 
also  the fcc in the past has adopted  and may re institute  procedures to review radio advertising concentration levels in proposed radio broadcasting transactions even if the proposed acquisition otherwise complies with the fcc s ownership limitations 
additionally  since the passage of the telecommunications act of  the justice department has become more involved in reviewing proposed acquisitions of radio stations and radio station networks 
the justice department is particularly concerned when the proposed buyer already owns one or more radio stations in the market of the station it is seeking to buy 
historically  the justice department has challenged a number of radio broadcasting transactions 
some of those challenges ultimately resulted in consent decrees requiring  among other things  divestitures of certain stations 
in general  the justice department has more closely scrutinized radio broadcasting acquisitions that result in local market shares in excess of of radio advertising revenue 
we are dependent on federally issued licenses to operate our radio stations and are subject to extensive federal regulation 
the radio broadcasting industry is subject to extensive regulation by the fcc under the communications act 
we are required to obtain licenses from the fcc to operate our radio stations 
licenses are normally granted for a term of eight years and are renewable 
although the vast majority of fcc radio station licenses are routinely renewed  we cannot assure you that the fcc will approve our future renewal applications or that the renewals will be for full eight year terms or will not include conditions or qualifications 
the non renewal  or renewal with substantial conditions or modifications  of one or more of our licenses could have a material adverse effect on us 
we must comply with extensive fcc regulations and policies in the ownership and operation of our radio stations 
fcc regulations limit the number of radio stations that a licensee can own in a market  which could restrict our ability to consummate future transactions and in certain circumstances could require us to divest some radio stations 
the fcc also requires radio stations to comply with certain technical requirements to limit interference between two or more radio stations 
if the fcc relaxes these technical requirements  it could impair the signals transmitted by our radio stations and could have a material adverse effect on us 
moreover  these fcc regulations and others may change over time and we cannot assure you that those changes would not have a material adverse effect on us 

table of contents fcc regulations prohibit the broadcast of obscene material at any time and indecent material between the hours of am and am the fcc has recently indicated that it is enhancing its enforcement efforts relating to the regulation of indecency and has threatened on more than one occasion to initiate license revocation proceedings against a broadcast licensee who commits a serious indecency violation 
in addition  legislation has been introduced in congress that would dramatically increase the penalties for broadcasting indecent programming and potentially subject broadcasters to license revocation  renewal or qualification proceedings in the event that they broadcast indecent material 
in addition  the fcc s heightened focus on the indecency regulatory scheme against the broadcast industry generally  may encourage third parties to oppose the company s license renewal applications or applications for consent to acquire broadcast stations 
one of our stations is currently subject to two indecency related inquiries at the fcc s enforcement bureau and we may in the future become subject to additional inquiries or proceedings related to our stations broadcast of indecent or obscene material 
to the extent that these inquiries or other proceedings result in the imposition of fines  revocation of any of our station licenses or denials of license renewal applications  our results of operation and business could be materially adversely affected 
future sales by george g 
beasley or members of his family of our class a common stock could adversely affect its market price 
the market for our class a common stock could fall substantially if our stockholders who hold restricted shares of common stock  including george g 
beasley and members of his family  sell large amounts of shares of class a common stock in the public market 
these sales  or the possibility that these sales may occur  could make it more difficult for us to raise capital by selling equity or equity related securities in the future 
the difficulties associated with any attempt to gain control of our company may adversely affect the price of our class a common stock 
george g 
beasley controls the decision whether a change of control of beasley broadcast group will occur 
moreover  some provisions of our certificate of incorporation  by laws and delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us  even if a change of control could be beneficial to you 
in addition  the communications act and fcc rules and policies limit the number of stations that one individual or entity can own  directly or by attribution  in a market 
fcc approval for transfers of control of fcc licensees and assignments of fcc licenses are also required 
because of the limitations and restrictions imposed on us by these provisions and regulations  the trading price of our class a common stock may be adversely affected 
there may not be an active market for our class a common stock  making it difficult for you to sell your stock 
our stock may not be actively traded 
an illiquid market for our stock may result in price volatility and poor execution of buy and sell orders for investors 
our stock price and trading volume have fluctuated widely for a number of reasons  including some reasons that may be unrelated to their businesses or results of operations 
this market volatility could depress the price of our class a common stock without regard to our operating performance 
in addition  our operating results may be below expectations of public market analysts and investors 
if this were to occur  the market price of our class a common stock could decrease  perhaps significantly 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices such as interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 
our primary exposure to market risk is interest rate risk associated with our credit facility 
amounts borrowed under the credit facility incur interest at the london interbank offered rate  or libor  plus additional basis points depending on the outstanding principal balance under the credit facility 
as of december   million was outstanding under our credit facility 
we evaluate our exposure to interest rate risk by monitoring changes in interest rates in the market place 

table of contents to manage interest rate risk associated with our credit facility  we have entered into several interest rate cap  collar and swap agreements 
under the cap agreement  our base libor cannot exceed the cap interest rate 
under the collar agreements  our base libor cannot exceed the cap interest rate and our base libor cannot fall below our floor interest rate 
under the swap agreement  we pay a fixed interest rate and the other party pays us a variable amount based on libor 
notional amounts are used to calculate the contractual payments to be exchanged under the contracts 
as of december  and  the aggregate notional amount upon maturity of these cap  collar and swap agreements was million and million  respectively 
as of december   our swap agreements designated as cash flow hedges are summarized in the following table agreement notional amount floor cap swap expiration estimated fair value interest rate swap  may  interest rate swap  may  interest rate swap  may  as of december   our cap  collar and swap agreements that were not designated as hedges are summarized in the following table agreement notional amount floor cap swap expiration estimated fair value interest rate cap  may interest rate collar  november  interest rate collar  november  interest rate swap  november
