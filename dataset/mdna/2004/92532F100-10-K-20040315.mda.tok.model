item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a biotechnology company in the business of discovering  developing  and marketing small molecule drugs for serious diseases including hiv infection  chronic hepatitis c virus infection  inflammatory and autoimmune disorders and cancer  independently and with collaborators 
to date  we have discovered and advanced two products that have reached the market  agenerase amprenavir and lexiva fosamprenavir calcium 
agenerase was approved and launched in the united states in early  and lexiva was approved and launched in the united states in late we earn a royalty on the sales of agenerase and lexiva and co promote these products in collaboration with glaxosmithkline 
our drug candidate pipeline is principally focused on the development and commercialization of new treatments for viral and inflammatory diseases 
we have built a drug discovery capability that integrates advanced biology  chemistry  biophysics  automation and information technologies  with a goal of making the drug discovery process more efficient and productive 
drug discovery and development discovery and development of a single new pharmaceutical product is a lengthy and resource intensive process which may take to years or more 
during this process  potential drug candidates are subjected to rigorous evaluation  driven in part by stringent regulatory considerations  designed to generate information concerning toxicity profiles  efficacy  proper dosage levels and a variety of other characteristics which are important in determining whether a proposed drug candidate should be approved for marketing 
most chemical compounds which are investigated as potential drug candidates never progress into formal development  and most drug candidates which do advance into formal development never become commercial products 
we have a variety of drug candidates in clinical development and a broad based drug discovery effort 
given the uncertainties of the research and development process  it is not possible to predict with confidence which  if any  of these efforts will result in a marketable pharmaceutical product 
we constantly monitor the results of our discovery research and our nonclinical and clinical trials and regularly evaluate and re evaluate our portfolio investments with the objective of balancing risk and potential return in view of new data and scientific  business and commercial insights 
this process can result in relatively abrupt changes in focus and priority as new information comes to light and we gain new insights into ongoing programs 
business strategy we have elected to diversify our research and development activities across a relatively broad array of investment opportunities  due in part to the high risks associated with the biotechnology and pharmaceutical business 
we focus our efforts both on programs which we expect to control throughout the development and commercialization process  and programs which we expect will be conducted in the development and commercial phase principally by a collaborative partner 
since we have incurred losses from our inception and expect to incur losses for the forseeable future  our business strategy is dependent in large part on our continued ability to raise significant funding to finance our operations and meet our long term contractual commitments and obligations 
in the past  we have secured funds principally through capital market transactions  strategic collaborative agreements  proceeds from the disposition of assets  investment income and the issuance of stock under our employee benefit programs 
at december  we had million of cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities and million of convertible subordinated notes due the notes 
during and early we took a number of steps to address our cash position and investment requirements in support of our existing business strategy 
debt exchange 
on february   we exchanged approximately million in aggregate principal amount of our notes for approximately million in aggregate principal amount of newly issued convertible senior subordinated notes due the notes 
this transaction had an effect of significantly deferring the repayment date for almost half of our outstanding debt 
sale of business 
in two independent transactions closed in march and december  we sold the assets of our discovery tools and services business for an aggregate of million of cash and the assumption of certain liabilities  to invitrogen corporation invitrogen and to a company organized by telegraph hill partners  respectively 
as a result of the disposition of the discovery tools and services business  we now operate in a single operating segment pharmaceuticals 
novartis restructuring 
in january  we amended our existing collaboration agreement with novartis 
we will continue to receive research funding through april  consistent with the original agreement  and up to million in pre commercial payments for each preclinical drug candidate which we propose and novartis accepts for preclinical development 
we will no longer be responsible for the early development of drug candidates through proof of concept  as required under the original agreement  except that we may elect to develop vx under the terms of the original agreement 
we believe the restructured agreement remains financially attractive for us  and we are now free to devote our internal development resources to vertex controlled compounds in our areas of principal therapeutic interest 
rebalancing of research and development during  we elected to focus our internal development and commercialization activity on two principal areas for the intermediate term viral and inflammatory diseases 
our most advanced drug candidates in these areas are merimepodib hcv  vx hcv and vx inflammatory diseases 
in preparation for advancing these and other vertex controlled drug candidates  we restructured our operations during the second half of the year to rebalance our relative investment in research  development and commercialization 
this restructuring included a workforce reduction and a decision not to occupy our kendall square facility in cambridge  massachusetts 
of the terminated employees  were from research  were from sales  general and administrative functions primarily supporting research  and were from development 
our investment in company sponsored research declined during approximately from levels  while our investment in company sponsored development during increased over levels by approximately 
collaborator sponsored research increased approximately while our collaborator sponsored development declined in by 
overall we expect our total research and development investment in to be comparable to  with any increases  if any  resulting principally from activities funded in whole or in part by new collaborators 
collaborative revenue collaborations have been and will continue to be an important component of our business strategy going forward 
we currently have significant collaborations with novartis  aventis  glaxosmithkline  and serono 
in these collaborations  we have retained a share of downstream product revenue and may be entitled to significant pre commercial milestone payments as drug candidates progress in development 
we currently receive research funding from novartis and serono  and we currently have drug candidates in clinical development and commercialization under the collaborations with glaxosmithkline and aventis and under a collaboration with kissei 
in we realized million in royalties and collaborative revenue  all of which was earned under our pharmaceutical partnerships 
this represented a significant decline from the level of million and reflected the conclusion of funding from our collaborations with lilly  taisho and schering ag and our lack of any new source of collaboration revenue since our collaborations with novartis and glaxosmithkline accounted for and  respectively  of our total revenue in a significant portion of our total research effort is being conducted under our collaboration with novartis  which is scheduled to conclude  along with our research funding from novartis  in april under the terms of our agreement with novartis  we will retain all rights to the intellectual property which we generate during that collaboration  except for rights licensed to novartis in connection with the development and commercialization of specific preclinical drug candidates that novartis accepts for development 
our access to these retained rights may help us initiate other collaborative opportunities in the kinase inhibitor field if our collaboration with novartis is not extended beyond we will need to seek those opportunities or other financing alternatives in order to maintain our discovery effort at its existing level 
it is not possible to predict at present whether any of those collaborations or other financing alternatives will be available in and beyond 
based on the value that we believe we have built through research and development investments in certain of our drug discovery and development programs and our perception of the level of interest in certain of our programs among some potential collaborators  we believe that we could enter into additional collaborative agreements in which could be material to our business 
our business development priorities include new collaborations to support development and commercialization  in europe and japan  of our hcv clinical candidates and our oral cytokine inhibitor  vx our product development pipeline also includes drug candidates that are outside our core therapeutic areas of viral and inflammatory diseases  such as vx acute coronary syndromes  vx oncology and vx oncology 
in and future periods we expect to identify collaborative development and commercialization opportunities for these drug candidates in order to continue their clinical advancement  as we maintain focus on our company sponsored opportunities 
we are also seeking collaborators for our ion channels and other discovery programs 
lease restructuring for the twelve months ended december   we recorded restructuring and other related expenses of million  of which million relates to the potential restructuring of our kendall square lease 
the restructuring accrual remaining at december  was million 
the liability at december  represents our best judgment of the assumptions and estimates most appropriate in measuring the outcome of the potential lease restructuring 
although it is possible that this liability will be paid in full over the next months  the actual amount and timing of any payments will depend on the actual terms of any lease restructuring transaction s 
if we are successful in restructuring the lease  we could potentially be relieved of a future lease obligation of approximately to million per year and a contractual construction obligation which could be in excess of million through financial guidance the key financial measures for which we have provided guidance in are as follows our full year loss is expected to be between and million  before any gains or charges  including additional charges relating to the potential lease restructuring and the convertible note debt exchange 
total revenue is expected to be in the range of to million in this is expected to be comprised of to million in committed funding and milestones from existing collaborative partners  and to million from hiv product royalties 
in addition  we are currently in discussions with pharmaceutical companies regarding strategic research and product development agreements  and the successful conclusion of such discussions may result in additional revenue and cash flow in as we prioritize our investment toward proprietary drug candidates and realize the benefits from the operational restructuring in drug discovery during  we anticipate that research and development expenses will be in the range of to million for the full year of we expect sales  general and administrative expenses to be between and million in we expect cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities to be in excess of million at the end of the financial measures set forth above are forward looking and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to vary materially  as referenced in the section below entitled forward looking statements 
contractual commitments and obligations the first part of the following table sets forth commitments and obligations that have been recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as of december  certain other obligations and commitments  while not required under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap to be included in the consolidated balance sheets  may have a material impact on liquidity 
we have presented these items  all of which have been entered into in the ordinary course of business  in the table below in order to present a more complete picture of our financial position and liquidity

loans under the facility were intended to fund early clinical studies of kinase inhibitor compounds that we selected for early development 
in february  we amended the terms of the novartis collaboration agreement 
we will continue to be responsible for drug discovery and novartis will continue to provide research funding through the balance of the research term ending in april  as provided in the original agreement 
however  novartis will now be responsible for all nonclinical and clinical development of drug candidates which it accepts for development  and consequently the loan facility providing funding for development activities by vertex has been terminated 
we may either continue development of vx under the terms of the original agreement using loan proceeds we have received under the novartis loan facility  or elect to develop and commercialize vx independent of novartis 
if we elect to develop and commercialize vx independent of novartis  loan amounts with respect to that drug candidate which are unspent and uncommitted at the time of our election will be repayable immediately 
outstanding loans which funded amounts either spent or committed to be spent on development activities relating to a particular compound will be forgiven if that compound is selected by novartis for development 
if not  the related loan will be repayable without interest in may at december   approximately million in development loans previously advanced to us were unspent and uncommitted 
please refer to note p to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
at december  we had  in notes 
on february   we concluded an exchange of approximately million in aggregate principal amount of notes for approximately million in aggregate principal amount of newly issued notes 
as a result of this transaction  the company has outstanding million in aggregate principal amount of notes and million in aggregate principal amount of notes 
our annual interest payment obligation increased by million to million  reflecting the slightly higher coupon rate on the notes 
off balance sheet commitments and obligations at december  at december   our future minimum commitments and contractual obligations included facilities operating leases  a purchase obligation and contractual commitments related to our research and development programs 
these items are not required to be recorded on our consolidated balance sheets under gaap 
they are disclosed in the table presented above and described more fully in the following paragraphs in order to provide a more complete picture of our financial position and liquidity at december  our kendall square lease term began january  and lease payments commenced in may we have an obligation  staged over a number of years  to build out the space into finished laboratory and office space 
the lease will expire in with options to extend the lease for two consecutive terms of ten years each  ultimately expiring in in june  we decided not to occupy the space under this lease and to attempt to restructure the lease

the company s future minimum commitments under this lease including lease payments and a construction obligation are million for less than year  million for to years  million for to years and million for years or more and are included in the table above 
commitments under research and development programs represent contractual commitments entered into for materials and services in the normal course of business 
the purchase obligations referred to above include an agreement to purchase a minimum of million of certain specified products from invitrogen annually for three years after the completion of the sale of certain assets of the discovery tools and services business on march  liquidity and capital resources we have incurred operating losses since our inception and have historically financed our operations principally through public stock offerings  private placements of our equity and debt securities  strategic collaborative agreements  which include research and development funding  milestones and royalties on the sales of products  proceeds from disposition of assets of our discovery tools and services business  investment income and proceeds from the issuance of stock under our employee benefit programs

the restructuring accrual remaining at december  of million  relating to the potential kendall square lease restructuring  could possibly be paid in full over the next months 
however  the actual amount and timing of such payments will be dependent upon the ultimate terms of any lease restructuring 
we review our estimates underlying the restructuring accrual on at least a quarterly basis  and the accrual could change with any future change in our estimates 
we expect to continue to invest significantly in our pipeline  particularly in clinical trials of merimepodib  vx and vx  and in our ion channel and kinase discovery efforts 
consequently  we expect to incur losses on a quarterly and annual basis for the foreseeable future as we continue to develop and commercialize existing and future drug candidates 
we also expect to incur substantial administrative expenditures in the future and expenses related to filing  prosecution  defense and enforcement of patent and other intellectual property rights 
we expect our capital expenditures to remain at levels consistent with  and we expect to complete with cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities in excess of million 
beyond  the adequacy of our available funds to meet our future operating and capital requirements  including repayment of the notes and the notes  will depend on many factors  including the number  breadth and prospects of our discovery and development programs and the costs and timing of obtaining regulatory approvals for any of our product candidates 
collaborations have been and will continue to be an important component of our business strategy 
we will continue to rely on cash receipts from our existing research and development collaborations  including research funding  development reimbursements and potential milestone payments  and from new collaborations we may enter  in order to help fund our research and development efforts 
from time to time during  we may repurchase our existing notes in privately negotiated transactions  or market purchases or otherwise  depending on market conditions 
any such repurchases may be material 
to the extent that our current cash and marketable securities  in addition to the above mentioned sources  are not sufficient to fund our activities  it will be necessary to raise additional funds through public offerings or private placements of securities or other methods of financing 
we will continue to manage our capital structure and consider financing opportunities to strengthen our long term liquidity profile 
there can be no assurance that such financing will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reported periods 
these items are constantly monitored and analyzed by management for changes in facts and circumstances  and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future 
changes in estimates are recorded in the period in which they become known 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from our estimates if past experience or other assumptions do not turn out to be substantially accurate 
we believe that the application of the accounting policies for restructuring and other expenses  research and development expenses  and revenue recognition  all of which are important to our financial position and results of operations  require significant judgments and estimates on the part of management 
our accounting polices  including the ones discussed below  are more fully described in note b to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
restructuring and other expense we record liabilities associated with restructuring activities based on estimates of fair value in the period the liabilities are incurred  in accordance with sfas accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas 
these estimates are reviewed and may be adjusted in subsequent periods 
adjustments are based  among other things  on management s assessment of changes in factors underlying the estimates  the impact of which is measured using the credit adjusted risk free rate applied in the initial period 
on june   we announced a plan to restructure our operations in preparation for increased investment in the clinical development and commercialization of our drug candidates 
we designed the restructuring to rebalance our relative investment in research  development and commercialization  to better support our long term objective of becoming an integrated drug company 
the restructuring included a workforce reduction  write offs of certain assets and a decision not to occupy the kendall square facility 
we are actively trying to restructure the lease obligation 
as a result of the company s restructuring plan and in accordance with sfas  we recorded an initial estimate of the fair value of the estimated liability in the second quarter of we have reviewed our assumptions and estimates quarterly and updated the liability as changes in circumstances have required 
for the twelve months ended december   we recorded restructuring and other related expenses of million 
the million includes million of potential lease restructuring expense of which million  million and million was recorded in the second  third and fourth quarters of  respectively 
in addition to the million  other costs included in the million charge include million of lease operating expense incurred prior to the decision not to occupy the kendall square facility  million for severance and related employee transition benefits and million for a write off of leasehold improvements and other assets 
the charge for the potential lease restructuring is the most significant component of the total restructuring charge and requires us to make significant judgments and assumptions 
we use probability weighted discounted cash flows in order to calculate the amount of the liability associated with the potential lease restructuring 
in accordance with sfas  we used a credit adjusted risk free rate of approximately in discounting our estimated cash flows 
the probability weighted cash flows are based on management s assumptions and estimates regarding the possible outcomes of the potential lease restructuring 
in estimating the liability we considered several possible outcomes of the potential lease restructuring  including a sublease of the entire space  a buy out of our obligation  partial subleases by multiple parties  and other variations of these same outcomes 
we also included in these potential outcomes the contractually required commitment for build out of the leased space 
we validate our estimates and assumptions through consultations with independent third parties having relevant expertise 
we increased our estimated lease restructuring expense from the second quarter to the third quarter by million  based on our judgment that a significant decline in the real estate market in cambridge  massachusetts had occurred 
we believe an increase in available laboratory and office space in cambridge  massachusetts and certain other factors led to a corresponding overall decline in real estate market fundamentals from the previous quarter 
accordingly  we revised our expectations of attainable sublease terms  assuming lower sublease rental rates and a delay in occupancy by potential subtenants 
it is possible that our estimates and assumptions will change in the future resulting in additional adjustments to the amount of the liability  and the effect of such adjustments could be material 
for example  if sublease rental rates differ from our assumption by approximately in either direction  our recorded liability will be negatively or positively adjusted by approximately million 
if the time to finalize the restructuring is delayed by six months from our estimated completion date  the impact could be as high as approximately million in additional liability  or more if there is further delay 
we will review our assumptions and judgments related to the potential lease restructuring on at least a quarterly basis  until the outcome is finalized  and make whatever modifications we believe are necessary  based on our best judgment  to reflect any changed circumstances 
revenue recognition our revenue recognition policies are in accordance with the sec s staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition in financial statements  as amended by sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  and for revenue arrangements entered into after june   emerging issues task force issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf 
our collaborative and other research and development revenue is generated primarily through collaborative research and development agreements with strategic partners 
the terms of these agreements typically include non refundable up front license fees  funding of research and development efforts  payments based upon achievement of certain milestones and royalties on product sales 
we recognize revenue from non refundable  up front license fees and milestones  not specifically tied to a separate earnings process  ratably over the contracted or estimated period of performance 
changes in estimates could impact revenue in the period the estimate is changed 
if our estimate of the period of performance shortens or lengthens  the amount of revenue we recognize from non refundable  up front license fees and milestones could increase or decrease in the period the change in estimate becomes known 
future related revenues would be adjusted accordingly 
to date  changes to our estimates have not had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
research funding is recognized ratably over the period of effort  as earned 
milestones that are based on designated achievement points and that are considered at risk and substantive at the inception of the collaborative contract  are recognized as earned when the corresponding payment is considered reasonably assured 
we evaluate whether milestones are at risk and substantive based on the contingent nature of the milestone  specifically reviewing factors such as the technological and commercial risk that must be overcome and the level of investment required 
under eitf  in multiple element arrangements  license payments are recognized together with any up front payment and the research and development funding as a single unit of accounting  unless the delivered technology has stand alone value to the customer and we have objective and reliable evidence of fair value of the undelivered elements in the arrangement 
license payments received during the course of a collaboration that do not meet the separation criteria above are recognized  when earned  in proportion to the period of time completed on the contract relative to the total contracted or estimated period of performance on the underlying research and development collaboration  with the remaining amount deferred and recognized ratably over the remaining period of performance 
payments received after performance obligations are complete are recognized when earned 
we did not receive any license payments in royalty revenue is recognized based upon actual and estimated net sales of licensed products in licensed territories  as provided by our collaborative partner  and is recognized in the period the sales occur 
differences between actual royalty revenues and estimated royalty revenues  which have not been historically significant  are reconciled and adjusted for in the quarter they become known 
research and development costs all research and development costs  including amounts funded by research and development collaborations  are expensed as incurred 
research and development expenses are comprised of costs incurred in performing research and development activities including salaries and benefits  facilities costs  overhead costs  clinical trial costs  contract services and other outside costs 
clinical trial  contract services and other outside costs require that we make estimates of the costs incurred in a given accounting period and record accruals at period end as the third party service periods and billing terms do not always coincide with our period end 
we base our estimates on our knowledge of the research and development programs  services performed for the period  past history for related activities and the expected duration of the third party service contract where applicable 
results of operations the following discussion of revenues and expenses is based only on the results of our continuing operations 
we sold the assets of the discovery tools and services business in two independent transactions in march and december in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets sfas no 
 the results of operations associated with the assets sold have been reclassified on the consolidated financial statements under the heading discontinued operations for all periods presented 
the reclassification of the amounts to discontinued operations have been prepared using estimates and assumptions we have deemed appropriate based upon the information currently available 
prior to  the discovery tools and services business was not separately managed operationally or financially and therefore  we have estimated certain operating expenses  based on certain assumptions  including relative costs of the business being sold compared to historical site costs 
amounts reclassified to discontinued operations are not necessarily indicative of the results that would have been achieved had the discovery tools and services business operated on a stand alone basis during the periods presented 
as a result of the disposition of these assets  we now operate in a single operating segment pharmaceuticals

total revenues decreased to  in compared to  in in  revenue was comprised of  in royalties and  in collaborative and other research and development revenue  as compared with  in royalties and  in collaborative research and development revenue in royalties consist primarily of agenerase royalty revenue 
agenerase royalty revenue is based on actual and estimated worldwide net sales of agenerase 
we began earning royalties on sales of lexiva in the united states in november we expect to receive marketing approval for lexiva in the european union in we pay a royalty to a third party on sales of agenerase and lexiva 
collaborative and other research and development revenue decreased  or in as compared with the decrease in collaborative and other research and development revenue is due to the conclusion of certain of our collaborative research and development arrangements  mainly in late  partially offset by additional revenue recognized under our novartis collaboration and a milestone payment received from glaxosmithkline in connection with fda approval of lexiva

research and development expenses remained relatively consistent at  in compared to  in research expenditures were  in compared with  in development expenditures were  in compared with  in our investment in research has decreased due to the operational restructuring in june while our investment in development has increased as a result of our proprietary drug candidates entering and advancing through clinical development 
in our clinical trials focused on multiple drug candidates 
the results of these trials enabled us to focus our clinical pipeline on two core therapeutic areas viral and inflammatory diseases 
our lead drug candidates in these areas are merimepodib hcv  vx hcv and vx inflammatory diseases 
in our development investment also focused on drug candidates with potential therapeutic indications outside our current core therapeutic areas  such as vx acute coronary syndromes  vx autoimmune diseases  vx oncology and vx oncology 
in and future periods we will seek to identify licensing opportunities for these drug candidates in order to continue their clinical development 
we continue to focus our main drug discovery efforts on the protein kinase and ion channel gene families as well as other targeted areas

vertex may elect by june  to continue the development of vx under the original terms of the novartis agreement  in which event novartis will hold an option on worldwide commercial rights 
to date we have incurred in excess of billion in research and development costs associated with drug discovery and development 
we expect research and development expenses in to remain comparable with however  our anticipated research and development expenses could vary materially  depending on the occurrence and timing of clinical trials 
we anticipate that research and development expenses will increase in future periods as we add personnel and capabilities to support the advancement of our lead drug candidates 
however  we do not expect that our research expenses will increase significantly unless we obtain a significant amount of funding from new collaborations 
we estimate that it takes to years the industry average is years to discover  develop and bring to market a new pharmaceutical product in the us as outlined below phase objective estimated duration discovery lead identification and target validation to years pre clinical initial toxicology for preliminary identification of risks for humans  gather early pharmacokinetic data to years phase i evaluate safety in humans  study how the drug works  metabolizes and interacts with other drugs to years phase ii establish effectiveness of the drug and its optimal dosage  continue safety evaluation to years phase iii confirm efficacy  dosage regime and safety profile of the drug to years fda approval approval by the fda to sell and market the drug under approved labeling months to years animal and other nonclinical studies are typically conducted during each phase of human clinical studies 
the successful development of our products is highly uncertain and subject to a number of risk factors 
the duration of clinical trials may vary substantially according to the type  complexity and novelty of the pharmaceutical product 
the fda and comparable agencies in foreign countries impose substantial requirements on the introduction of therapeutic pharmaceutical products through lengthy and detailed laboratory and clinical testing procedures  sampling activities and other costly and time consuming procedures 
data obtained from preclinical  nonclinical and clinical activities at any step in the testing process may be adverse and lead to discontinuation of development 
data obtained from these activities also are susceptible to varying interpretations  which could delay  limit or prevent regulatory approval 
the duration and the cost related to discovery  preclinical  nonclinical and clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a project and are difficult to predict 
therefore  accurate and meaningful estimates of the ultimate costs to bring our drug candidates to market are not available 
the most significant costs associated with drug discovery and development are those costs associated with phase ii and phase iii clinical trials 
given the uncertainties related to development  we are currently unable to reliably estimate when  if ever  our drug candidates will generate revenue and cash flows 
we do not expect to receive net cash inflows from any major discovery and development products until a drug candidate becomes a profitable commercial product 
sales  general and administrative expenses decreased  or  to  in from  in  due primarily to a reduction in personnel resulting from our consolidation of certain general and administration functions to our corporate office location in cambridge  massachusetts  and from our restructuring in the second quarter of restructuring and other expense for the twelve months ended december  was million

it is possible that those estimates and assumptions could change in the future resulting in incremental expense or  alternatively  in reversal of expense  and the effect of any such adjustments could be material 
interest income decreased approximately  to  in from  in the decrease is mainly the result of both a lower level of invested funds and lower portfolio yields due to a reduced interest rate environment
