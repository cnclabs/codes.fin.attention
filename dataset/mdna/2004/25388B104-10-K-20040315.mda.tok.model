item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
we are a provider of comprehensive electronic commerce outsourcing solutions 
we were incorporated in february and commenced offering products for sale through our clients web stores in august from inception through august  we had no sales  and our activities related primarily to the development of our proprietary technology platform  known as cns 
in  we began to focus our business development efforts on the software industry  building our inventory of software products through contracts with software publishers 
in  we began to develop software distribution relationships through contracts with online retailers 
as of march   we had more than  software publisher clients and online channel partners 
in late  we began to offer our comprehensive electronic commerce outsourcing services in the form of a transaction fee based e commerce service to clients outside of the software industry 
as of march   we were providing electronic commerce services such as web commerce development and hosting  transaction processing  fraud screening  digital delivery  integration to physical fulfillment  merchandising services  analytical marketing and customer service to over physical goods clients  we well as operating nearly  small business physical goods sites 
prior to january   we managed our physical goods clients through a division formerly our e business services division that was separate from our software and digital commerce services division 
beginning in january  this divisional structure was consolidated  and we announced that we will no longer report our activities as separate business segments 
nonetheless  we remain committed to serving existing and new clients in the important vertical market of physical goods 
we have approximately seven years of operating history upon which investors may evaluate our business and prospects 
until  we have incurred significant losses  and as of december   had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
we intend to expend financial and management resources on the development of additional services  sales and marketing  technology and operations to support larger scale operations and greater service offerings 
although we expect to generate positive cash flow from operations in  there can be no assurance that our revenue will increase or even continue at its current level or that we will maintain profitability or generate cash from operations in future periods 
our prospects must be considered in light of the risks  expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in new and rapidly evolving markets such as electronic commerce 
to address these risks  we must  among other things  attract and retain software publishers and online retailers as clients  attract and retain physical goods clients  introduce new web sites  web stores or services  continue to upgrade and develop our systems and infrastructure to meet emerging market needs and remain competitive in our service offerings  and retain and attract personnel commensurate with our business needs 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in addressing these risks  and any failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our current and future expense levels are based largely on our planned operations and estimates of future revenue 
revenue and operating results generally depend on the volume and timing of orders received  which are difficult to forecast 
we may be unable to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall 
accordingly  any significant shortfall in revenue could have an immediate adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are also likely to continue to see revenue fluctuate on a seasonal basis  which is typical for the software publishing market in general and for our existing physical goods clients 
we believe that our first and fourth quarters tend to be seasonally stronger than our second and third quarters due to the timing of demand for tax preparation software and the holiday season selling period 
in addition  we believe that software publishers avoid new product releases in the summer months 
in view of the rapidly evolving nature of our business  we are unable to accurately forecast our revenue and believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
critical accounting policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
as such  we are required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon the information available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
the significant accounting policies which we believe are the most critical in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results are the following revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue from services rendered once all the following criteria for revenue recognition have been met pervasive evidence of an agreement exists  the services have been rendered  the fee is fixed and determinable and not subject to refund or adjustment  and collection of the amounts due is reasonably assured 
we derive our revenue primarily from transaction fees based on a percentage of the products sale price and fees from services rendered associated with the e commerce services provided to our clients 
these services include web commerce development and hosting  transaction processing  fraud screening  digital delivery  integration to physical fulfillment  merchandising services  analytical marketing and customer service 
we report our revenue on a net basis and therefore record only the net service fees and transaction fees as our revenue 
we act as the merchant of record on most of the transactions processed and have contractual relationships with our clients  which obligate us to pay to the client a specified percentage of each sale 
we retain our transaction fee and also charge fees for services rendered 
we also derive revenue from integration  development and consulting services 
signed contracts are obtained from clients prior to recognition of these revenues 
fees for any integration and development work required to provide on going hosting services for the client are recognized ratably over the term of the contract once collection is reasonably assured 
clients do not have the right to take possession of the software applications used in the delivery of services 
payments received in advance of rendering the service  even if non refundable  are recorded as deferred revenue until earned 
revenues from consulting services are recognized using the percentage of completion method for fixed fee arrangements or as the services are provided for time and materials arrangements 
if we do not accurately estimate the resources required or the scope of work to be performed  or do not manage our projects properly within the planned periods of time or satisfy our obligations under the contracts  future margins may be negatively affected 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
estimates are used in determining our allowance for doubtful accounts and are based on our historical experience and current trends 
management must make estimates of the uncollectability of our billed accounts receivable 
management specifically analyzes accounts receivable and historical bad debts  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with the allowance in any accounting period 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our operating results for any period if management makes different judgments or utilizes different estimates 
credit card chargeback reserve 
estimates are also used in determining our accrued chargeback expenses and are based on our historical experience and current trends 
management makes an estimate of anticipated future credit card chargebacks related to current period revenue by analyzing the timing of historical credit card chargebacks as well as reviewing the current charge back trends and applying a conservative anticipated rate to current period revenues 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with the accrued expenses in any accounting period 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our operating results for any period if management makes different judgments or utilizes different estimates 
goodwill  intangibles and other long lived assets 
we amortize property  plant and equipment  certain intangibles and certain other long lived assets with definite lives over their useful lives 
useful lives are based on management s estimates of the period that the assets will generate revenue 
assets with definite lives are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
our evaluation considers nonfinancial data such as changes in the operating environment and business strategy  competitive information  market trends and operating performance 
in july  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
under sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized but are reviewed annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise for impairment 
for acquisitions consummated by us subsequent to july   we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
effective july  we adopted the full provisions of sfas no 
effective january  upon adoption of sfas no 
 we discontinued the amortization of goodwill 
we complete our annual goodwill impairment test using a two step approach based on reportable segments in the fourth quarter of each year and reassess goodwill recorded in connection with earlier acquisitions

we complete our annual goodwill impairment test using a two step approach based on reportable segments in the fourth quarter of each year 
our assessment has indicated that there is no impairment of goodwill for the years ended december  and and thus we did not record any expense related to goodwill in or income loss from operations 
our income from operations in was million compared to a loss of million in  and a loss of million in  resulting primarily from increased revenue without corresponding increases in operating expenses 
in  the software and digital commerce services division generated income from operations of million compared to income of million in and million in in  the income from operations related to the e business services division was million compared to a loss of million in and a loss of million in in calculating segment income or loss  we do not include depreciation and amortization of property and equipment  amortization of goodwill and other intangibles and acquisition related costs  or litigation charges 
interest income 
interest income consists of earnings on our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments 
interest income increased to million in from million in and decreased from million in  resulting primarily from net effects in changes in average cash and cash equivalent and short term investment balances 
income taxes 
we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million as of december  included in this amount is approximately million of deductions resulting from disqualifying dispositions of stock options 
when these deductions relating to disqualifying dispositions are realized for financial statement purposes they will not result in a reduction in income tax expense  rather the benefit will be recorded as additional paid in capital 
these income tax net operating loss carryforwards expire beginning in the year deductions from disqualifying dispositions of stock options are included in net operating loss carryforwards with a corresponding valuation allowance 
because of the uncertainty of future realization  a valuation allowance equal to the deferred tax asset has been recorded 
ownership changes resulting from the issuance of additional equity will limit future annual realization of the tax net operating loss carryforwards to a specified percentage of our value under section of the internal revenue code 
liquidity and capital resources our primary source of internal liquidity is our operating activities

additionally  in april  we initiated a share repurchase program of up to million of our outstanding shares of common stock 
repurchases are at our discretion based on ongoing assessments of the capital needs of the business and the market price of our shares 
no time limit was set for the completion of the repurchase program 
during and  no shares were repurchased under the repurchase program

significant components of our working capital are cash and cash equivalents  short term investments and short term receivables net of client and merchant payables 
our principal commitments consisted of long term obligations outstanding under operating leases 
although we have no material commitments for capital expenditures  we anticipate an increase in the rate of capital expenditures consistent with our anticipated growth in operations  infrastructure and personnel 
we anticipate that over the next months we will expend approximately million on capital expenditures and approximately million on product research and development  based on our current anticipated growth rate in operations 
we also anticipate that we will continue to experience growth in our operating expenses for the foreseeable future and that our operating expenses will be a material use of our cash resources 
we expect to continue to evaluate and consider a wide array of potential strategic transactions  including business combinations and acquisitions of businesses  products  services and other assets as well as licenses of technology related to our current business 
at any given time  we may be engaged in discussions or negotiations with respect to one or more such transactions 
any such transactions could have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
there is no assurance that any such discussions or negotiations will result in the consummation of any transaction 
the process of integrating any acquisition may create unforeseen challenges for our operational  financial and management information systems  as well as unforeseen expenditures and other risks  including diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  the potential loss of key customers  employees and business partners  difficulties in managing facilities and employees in different geographic areas  and difficulties in entering markets in which we have no or limited direct prior experience and where competitors in such markets have stronger market positions 
in addition  an acquisition may cause us to assume liabilities or become subject to litigation 
further  there can be no assurance that we will realize a positive return on any acquisition or that future acquisitions will not be dilutive to our current shareholders percentage ownership or to earnings 
we have allocated significant valuation in the form of goodwill and intangibles for the companies we acquired in the past  which is subject to impairment testing on a regular basis 
if the individual businesses do not perform as expected at the acquisition dates  we may incur impairment charges for goodwill  accelerated amortization of definite lived intangibles due to shortened expected lives of these assets  immediate write offs and restructuring or other related expenses 
contractual commitments payment due by period contractual obligations total amount committed more than years operating lease obligations total we believe that existing sources of liquidity and the results of our operations will provide adequate cash to fund our operations for at least the next months  although we may seek to raise additional capital during that period

of this amount  approximately million was utilized to issue common stock in our july public offering leaving approximately million available for future use 
the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities could result in additional dilution to our stockholders

recent accounting pronouncements in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas  accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas establishes standards for issuer classification and measurement of certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
instruments that fall within the scope of sfas must be classified as a liability  and is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may  for financial instruments issued prior to june   sfas is effective for the company in the second quarter of adoption is not expected to have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued fin no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities 
in addition  in december the fasb issued a revision of the interpretation the revised interpretation 
fin no 
states that companies that have exposure to the economic risks and potential rewards from another entity s assets and activities have a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity and should consolidate the entity  despite the absence of clear control through a voting equity interest 
the consolidation requirements apply to all variable interest entities for the first fiscal year or interim period ending after march  we do not believe that this statement will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin no 

fin no 
requires companies to recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
guarantees in existence at december  are grandfathered for the purposes of recognition and would only need to be disclosed 
we enter into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors  as well as in connection with our acquisitions 
it is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount under these agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement 
the adoption of fin no 
did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosure about market risk 
we do not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes and do not currently utilize derivative financial instruments 
our operations are conducted primarily in the united states currency and as such are not subject to material foreign currency exchange rate risk 
we have no long term debt 
however  the growth in our international operations is increasing our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations 
our functional currency is the us dollar 
we have foreign currency denominated net revenues  costs and expenses 
these income statement amounts are remeasured into us dollars at the average exchange rates in each applicable period 
to the extent the us dollar weakens against foreign currencies  the remeasurement of these foreign currency denominated transactions results in increased net revenues  operating expenses and net income 
conversely  our net revenues  operating expenses and net income will decrease when the us dollar strengthens against foreign currencies 
we expect international operations to continue to grow in significance as we develop and deploy our global marketplace presence 
as a result  foreign currency fluctuations in future periods could become more significant and may have a negative impact on our net revenues and net income
