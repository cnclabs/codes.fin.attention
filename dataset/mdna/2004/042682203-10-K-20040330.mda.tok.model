we undertake no obligation to publicly release the result of any revisions to these forward looking statements that may be made to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors including  but not limited to  those set forth elsewhere in this report 
please see risk factors  below  and in our other filings with the securities and exchange commission 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements contained in item of this report  and the notes thereto 
we have rounded amounts reported here to the nearest thousand  unless such amounts are more than million  in which event we have rounded such amounts to the nearest hundred thousand 
general we are a defense and security products and services company  engaged in three business areas interactive simulation for military  law enforcement and commercial markets  batteries and charging systems for the military  and high level armoring for military  paramilitary and commercial vehicles 
until september   we were known as electric fuel corporation 
we operate in three business units we develop  manufacture and market advanced hi tech multimedia and interactive digital solutions for use of force and driving training of military  law enforcement and security personnel  as well as offering security consulting and other services our simulation  training and consulting division  we manufacture and sell zinc air and lithium batteries for defense and security products and other military applications and we pioneer advancements in zinc air battery technology for electric vehicles our battery and power systems division  and we utilize sophisticated lightweight materials and advanced engineering processes to armor vehicles our armored vehicle division 
early in  we acquired two new businesses faac corporation  located in ann arbor  michigan  which provides simulators  systems engineering and software products to the united states military  government and private industry which we have placed in our simulation  training and consulting division  and epsilor electronic industries  ltd  located in dimona  israel  which develops and sells rechargeable and primary lithium batteries and smart chargers to the military and to private industry in the middle east  europe and asia which we have placed in our battery and power systems division 
prior to the acquisition of faac and epsilor  we were organized into two divisions defense and security products consisting of ies  mdt  mdt armor and arocon  and electric fuel batteries consisting of efl and efb 
we have reported our results of operations for and in accordance with these earlier divisions  and our financial results for and do not include the activities of faac or epsilor 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  allowance for bad debts  inventory  impairment of intangible assets and goodwill 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
under different assumptions or conditions  actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition and bad debt we generate revenues primarily from sales of multimedia and interactive digital training systems and use of force simulators specifically targeted for law enforcement and firearms training and from service contracts related to such sales  from providing lightweight armoring services of vehicles  from sale of zinc air battery products for defense applications  and  to a lesser extent  from development services and long term arrangements subcontracted by the u 
s government 
we recognize revenues in respect of products when  among other things  we have delivered the goods being purchased and we believe collectibility to be reasonably assured 
we do not grant a right of return to our customers 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition and we require collateral as deemed necessary 
we make judgments as to our ability to collect outstanding receivables and provide allowances for a portion of such receivables when and if collection becomes doubtful 
provisions are made based upon a specific review of all significant outstanding receivables 
in determining the provision  we analyze our historical collection experience and current economic trends 
if the historical data we use to calculate the allowance provided for doubtful accounts does not reflect the future ability to collect outstanding receivables  additional provisions for doubtful accounts may be needed and the future results of operations could be materially affected 
revenues from development services are recognized using contract accounting on a percentage of completion method  based on completion of agreed upon milestones and in accordance with the output method or based on the time and material basis 
provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are recognized in the period in which the likelihood of such losses is determined 
the complexity of the estimation process and the issues related to the assumptions  risks and uncertainties inherent with the application of the percentage of completion method of accounting affect the amounts of revenue and related expenses reported in our consolidated financial statements 
inventories our policy for valuation of inventory and commitments to purchase inventory  including the determination of obsolete or excess inventory  requires us to perform a detailed assessment of inventory at each balance sheet date  which includes a review of  among other factors  an estimate of future demand for products within specific time horizons  valuation of existing inventory  as well as product lifecycle and product development plans 
the estimates of future demand that we use in the valuation of inventory are the basis for our revenue forecast  which is also used for our short term manufacturing plans 
inventory reserves are also provided to cover risks arising from slow moving items 
we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
we may be required to record additional inventory write down if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by our management 
for fiscal  no significant changes were made to the underlying assumptions related to estimates of inventory valuation or the methodology applied 
goodwill our business acquisitions typically result in the recognition of goodwill and other intangible assets  which affect the amount of current and future period charges and amortization expenses 
the determination of value of these components of a business combination  as well as associated asset useful lives  requires our management to make various estimates and assumptions 
estimates using different  but each reasonable  assumptions could produce significantly different results 
we test goodwill for possible impairment on an annual basis and at any other time if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
such impairment loss is measured by comparing the recoverable amount of an asset with its carrying value 
the determination of the value of goodwill requires our management to make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of a respective asset 
if these estimates or the related assumptions change in the future  we could be required to record impairment charges 
any material change in our valuation of assets in the future and any consequent adjustment for impairment could have a material adverse impact on our future reported financial results 
impairment of long lived assets and intangibles long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles are reviewed for impairment in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of the carrying amount of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the assets 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less selling costs 
as of december   no impairment losses have been identified 
the determination of the value of such long lived and intangible assets requires management to make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
these estimates have been based on our business plans for the entities acquired 
if these estimates or the related assumptions change in the future  we could be required to record impairment charges 
any material change in our valuation of assets in the future and any consequent adjustment for impairment could have a material adverse impact on our future reported financial results 
functional currency we consider the united states dollar to be the currency of the primary economic environment in which we and our israeli subsidiary efl operate and  therefore  both we and efl have adopted and are using the united states dollar as our functional currency 
transactions and balances originally denominated in us dollars are presented at the original amounts 
gains and losses arising from non dollar transactions and balances are included in net income 
the majority of financial transactions of our israeli subsidiaries mdt and epsilor is in new israel shekels nis and a substantial portion of mdt s and epsilor s costs is incurred in nis 
management believes that the nis is the functional currency of mdt and epsilor 
accordingly  the financial statements of mdt and epsilor have been translated into us dollars 
all balance sheet accounts have been translated using the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date 
statement of operations amounts have been translated using the average exchange rate for the period 
the resulting translation adjustments are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in shareholders equity 
executive summary the following executive summary includes  where appropriate  discussion of our two new subsidiaries  faac incorporated and epsilor electronic industries  ltd  that we purchased early in the results of these subsidiaries are not included in our results of operations for and  but are included in this discussion to the extent that they are relevant to our anticipated financial condition and results of operations going forward 
divisions and subsidiaries we operate primarily as a holding company  through our various subsidiaries  which we have organized into three divisions 
our divisions and subsidiaries all owned  unless otherwise noted are as follows our simulation  training and consulting division  consisting of o ies interactive training  inc  located in littleton  colorado  which provides specialized use of force training for police  security personnel and the military ies  o faac incorporated  located in ann arbor  michigan  which provides simulators  systems engineering and software products to the united states military  government and private industry faac  and o arocon security corporation  located in new york  new york  which provides security consulting and other services  focusing on protecting life  assets and operations with minimum hindrance to personal freedom and daily activities arocon 
our battery and power systems division  consisting of o electric fuel battery corporation  located in auburn  alabama  which manufactures and sells zinc air fuel sells  batteries and chargers for the military  focusing on applications that demand high energy and light weight efb  o epsilor electronic industries  ltd  located in dimona  israel in israel s negev desert area  which develops and sells rechargeable and primary lithium batteries and smart chargers to the military and to private industry in the middle east  europe and asia epsilor  and o electric fuel efl ltd  located in beit shemesh  israel  which produces water activated lifejacket lights for commercial aviation and marine applications  and which conducts our electric vehicle effort  focusing on obtaining and implementing demonstration projects in the us and europe  and on building broad industry partnerships that can lead to eventual commercialization of our zinc air energy system for electric vehicles efl 
our armored vehicle division  consisting of o mdt protective industries  ltd  located in lod  israel  which specializes in using state of the art lightweight ceramic materials  special ballistic glass and advanced engineering processes to fully armor vans and cars  and is a leading supplier to the israeli military  israeli special forces and special services mdt owned  and o mdt armor corporation  located in auburn  alabama  which conducts mdt s united states activities mdt armor owned 
prior to the acquisition of faac and epsilor  we were organized into two divisions defense and security products consisting of ies  mdt  mdt armor and arocon  and electric fuel batteries consisting of efl and efb 
we have reported our results of operations for and in accordance with these earlier divisions 
overview of results of operations we incurred significant operating losses for the years ended december   and while we expect to continue to derive revenues from the sale of products that we manufacture and the services that we provide  there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve or maintain profitability on a consistent basis 
during  we substantially increased our revenues and reduced our operating loss  from million in to million in this was achieved through a combination of cost cutting measures and increased revenues  particularly from the sale of zinc air batteries to the military and from sales of interactive training systems by ies 
we believe that our new acquisitions  faac and epsilor  will contribute to our goal of achieving profitability 
we regard moving the company to a positive cash flow situation on a consistent basis to be an important goal  and we are focused on achieving that goal for the second half of and beyond 
in this connection  we note that most of our business lines historically have had weaker first halves than second halves  and weaker first quarters than second quarters 
we expect this to be the case for as well 
a portion of our operating loss during arose as a result of non cash charges 
these charges were primarily related to our acquisitions and to our raising capital 
because we anticipate continuing these activities during  we expect to continue to incur such non cash charges in the future 
non cash charges related to acquisitions arise when the purchase price for an acquired company exceeds the company s book value 
in such a circumstance  a portion of the excess of the purchase price is recorded as goodwill  and a portion as intangible assets 
in the case of goodwill  the assets recorded as goodwill are not amortized  instead  we are required to perform an annual impairment review 
if we determine  through the impairment review process  that goodwill has been impaired  we must record the impairment charge in our statement of operations 
intangible assets are amortized in accordance with their useful life 
accordingly  for a period of time following an acquisition  we incur a non cash charge in the amount of a fraction based on the useful life of the intangible assets of the amount recorded as intangible assets 
such non cash charges will continue during  additionally  our acquisitions of faac and epsilor will result in our incurring similar non cash charges beginning in as a result of the application of the above accounting rule  we incurred non cash charges in the amount of  during see critical accounting policies goodwill  above 
the non cash charges that relate to our financings occurred in connection with our sale of convertible debentures with warrants  and in connection with our repricing of certain warrants and grants of new warrants 
when we issue convertible debentures  we record an expense for a beneficial conversion feature that is amortized ratably over the life of the debenture 
when a debenture is converted  however  the entire remaining unamortized beneficial conversion feature expense is immediately recognized in the quarter in which the debenture is converted 
similarly  when we issue warrants in connection with convertible debentures  we record an expense for financial expenses that is amortized ratably over the term of the warrant  when the warrant is exercised  the entire remaining unamortized financial expense is immediately recognized in the quarter in which the warrant is exercised 
as and to the extent that our remaining convertible debentures and warrants are converted and exercised  we would incur similar non cash charges going forward 
as a result of the application of the above accounting rule  we incurred non cash charges in the amount of million during additionally  in an effort to improve our cash situation and our shareholders equity  and in order to reduce the number of our outstanding warrants  during we induced holders of certain of our warrants to exercise their warrants by lowering the exercise price of the warrants to approximately market value in exchange for immediate exercise of such warrants  and by issuing to such investors a lower number of new warrants at a higher exercise price 
under such circumstances  accounting rules require us to record a compensation expense in an amount determined based upon the fair value of the new warrants using a black scholes pricing model 
as and to the extent that we engage in similar warrant repricings and issuances in the future  we would incur similar non cash charges 
as a result of the application of the above accounting rule  we incurred non cash charges in the amount of  during we also incurred a non cash charge in the amount of  during arising out of the shares and warrants we granted to ies electronics in connection with the settlement of our litigation with them  as a result of and expense in an amount determined based upon the fair value of these warrants using a black scholes pricing model 
this charge is not expected to recur 
overview of financial condition and operating performance we shut down our money losing consumer battery operations and began acquiring new businesses in the defense and security field in since then  we have concentrated on eliminating our operating deficit and moving arotech to cash flow positive operations 
in order to do this  we have focused on acquiring businesses with strong revenues and profitable operations 
in our defense and security products division  mdt experienced a slowdown in revenues during because mdt s primary customer  the israel defense forces  reduced orders as a result of cuts in that portion of its budget that it can spend in israel 
we noted this trend in and began to work on reversing it by opening production facilities for mdt armor in auburn  alabama 
as of december   our backlog for mdt totaled  most of which was from orders from customers other than the israel defense forces 
ies had record sales in  ies sales have grown from million in before we owned it to more than million in we attribute this to a number of substantial orders  such as orders from the german police and from the united states department of health and human services 
since sales of new ies simulation systems as opposed to upgrades and add ons have a very long sales cycle  it is difficult to predict what sales will be like in as of december   our backlog for ies totaled  in our electric fuel batteries division  efb had its first sales in these sales were almost exclusively from the united states army  which continues to use our ba zinc air battery for its cecom division 
we believe the war in iraq had a substantial positive effect on our sales in however  we are hopeful that since the war came at a time when we were just beginning the introduction of our batteries to the army  much of the falloff in use of our products that would normally be expected to occur at the war s end which is not presently anticipated to occur in the immediate future will be offset by growing acceptance of our batteries by soldiers in the field and their supply officers 
as of december   our backlog for efb totaled million 
we do not anticipate a substantial change in our revenues from efl  either from the water activated battery line or from the electric vehicle 
in this connection  we have begun an effort to find external financing for development of our electric vehicle in the form of a partnership or joint venture  but there can be no assurance that we will succeed in this effort  and we do not anticipate that our electric vehicle program will provide significant revenues in we anticipate that our acquisitions of epsilor and faac  which occurred in january  will add to our revenues  our gross profit and our cash flow in results of operations preliminary note results for the years ended december  and include the results of ies and mdt for such periods as a result of our acquisitions of these companies early in the third quarter of however  the results of ies and mdt were not included in our operating results for the full year ended december  accordingly  the following year to year comparisons should not necessarily be relied upon as indications of future performance 
in addition  results are net of the operations of the retail consumer battery products  which operations were discontinued in the third quarter of following is a table summarizing our results of operations for the years ended december  and  after which we present a narrative discussion and analysis year ended december  revenues defense and security products   electric fuel batteries   all other cost of revenues defense and security products   electric fuel batteries   all other research and development expenses

this increase was the direct result of all factors presented above  most notably the increased sales of ies and efb  as well as the inclusion of ies and mdt in our results for the full year of but only part of in  ies contributed million to our gross profit  efb contributed million  and mdt contributed  research and development expenses 
research and development expenses for were million  compared to  in  an increase of  or 
this increase was primarily because certain research and development personnel who had worked on the discontinued consumer battery operations during the expenses of which are not reflected in the number above were reassigned to military battery research and development in sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses for were million  compared to million in  an increase of million  or 
this increase was primarily attributable to the following factors the inclusion of the sales and marketing expenses of ies and mdt in our results for the full year of but only part of an increase in ies s sales activity during  which resulted in both increased sales and increased sales and marketing expenses during  and we incurred expenses for consultants in the amount of  in connection with our cecom battery program with the us army and  in connection with our security consulting business

financial expense totaled approximately million in compared to financial income of  in  an increase of million 
this increase was due primarily to amortization of compensation related to the issuance of convertible debentures issued in december and during in the amount of million  and interest expenses related to those debentures in the amount of  tax expenses 
we and our israeli subsidiary efl incurred net operating losses during and and  accordingly  we were not required to make any provision for income taxes 
mdt and ies had taxable income  and accordingly we were required to make provision for income taxes in the amount of  in we were able to offset ies s federal taxes against our loss carryforwards 
in we did not accrue any tax expenses due to our belief that we would be able to utilize our loss carryforwards against mdt s taxable income  estimation was revised in of the amount accrued in  approximately  was accrued on account of income in amortization of intangible assets and in process research and development 
amortization of intangible assets totaled  in  compared to  in  an increase of  or  resulting from amortization of these assets subsequent to our acquisition of ies and mdt in of this  increase   was attributable to ies and  was attributable to mdt 
loss from continuing operations 
due to the factors cited above  we reported a net loss from continuing operations of million in  compared to a net loss of million in  an increase of million  or 
profit loss from discontinued operations 
in the third quarter of  we decided to discontinue operations relating to the retail sales of our consumer battery products 
accordingly  all revenues and expenses related to this segment have been presented in our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended december  and in an item entitled loss from discontinued operations 
profit from discontinued operations in was  compared to a net loss of million in  a decrease of million 
this decrease was the result of the elimination of the losses from these discontinued operations beginning with the fourth quarter of the profit from discontinued operations was primarily from cancellation of past accruals made unnecessary by the closing of the discontinued operations 
net loss 
due to the factors cited above  we reported a net loss of million in  compared to a net loss of million in  a decrease of million  or 
fiscal year compared to fiscal year revenues 
revenues from continuing operations for the year ended december  totaled million  compared to million for  an increase of million  or 
this increase was primarily the result of the inclusion of ies and mdt in our results in during  we recognized revenues from the sale of interactive use of force training systems through our ies subsidiary  from payments under vehicle armoring contracts through our mdt subsidiary  and from the sale of lifejacket lights  as well as under contracts with the us army s cecom for deliveries of batteries and for design and procurement of production tooling and equipment 
we also recognized revenues from subcontracting fees received in connection with phase ii of the united states department of transportation dot program  which began in the fourth quarter of and was completed in july  and phase iii of the dot program  which began in october we participate in this program as a member of a consortium seeking to demonstrate the ability of the electric fuel battery system to power a full size  all electric transit bus 
the total program cost of phase ii was million  of which was covered by the dot subcontracting fees 
subcontracting fees cover less than all of the expenses and expenditures associated with our participation in the program 
in  we derived revenues principally from the sale of lifejacket lights  under contracts with the us army s cecom for deliveries of batteries and for design and procurement of production tooling and equipment and from subcontracting fees received in connection with the dot program 
in  revenues were million for the defense and security products division compared to in  due to the inclusion of ies and mdt in our results  and million for the electric fuel batteries division compared to million in the comparable period in  a decrease of  or  due primarily to  in revenues from a german consortium project relating to our electric vehicle that were included in but that did not exist in of the million increase in defense and security products revenues  million was attributable to the inclusion of ies in our results in and million was attributable to the inclusion of mdt in our results in cost of revenues and gross profit

this increase was primarily the result of the inclusion of ies  which accounted for  of the increase  in our results 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses for were million  compared to  in  an increase of million  or 
this increase was primarily attributable to the following factors we had sales and marketing expenses in related to ies of  which we did not have in  we had sales and marketing expenses in related to mdt of  which we did not have in  and we incurred expenses for consultants  primarily lobbyists  in the amount of  in connection with our electric vehicle program and  in connection with our cecom battery program with the us army 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses for were million compared to million in  an increase of  or 
this increase was primarily attributable to the inclusion of ies and mdt in our results beginning with the third quarter  which increased general and administrative expenses by approximately  this increase was offset by a decrease in general and administrative expenses of  resulting from the dismissal of our litigation with electrofuel inc  which resulted in a decrease in litigation related legal expenses  and the settlement of our dispute with a former employee on terms that resulted in a savings to us over the amount that we had set aside on our books 
financial income 
financial income  net of interest expenses and exchange differentials  totaled approximately  in compared to  in  a decrease of  or 
this decrease was due primarily to lower interest rates and lower balances of invested funds as a result of our use of the proceeds of private placements of our securities 
income taxes 
we and our israeli subsidiary efl incurred net operating losses during and and  accordingly  we were not required to make any provision for income taxes 
mdt had taxable income  but we may use efl s losses to offset mdt s income  and accordingly mdt has made no provision for income taxes 
amortization of intangible assets 
amortization of intangible assets totaled  in  compared to in  due to the inclusion of ies and mdt in our results

in the third quarter of  we decided to discontinue operations relating to the retail sales of our consumer battery products 
accordingly  all revenues and expenses related to this segment have been presented in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december  in an item entitled loss from discontinued operations 
loss from discontinued operations in was million  compared to million in  an increase of  or 
this increase was the result of a write off of fixed inventory and assets in the amount of million in connection with our discontinuation of the operations relating to the retail sales of our consumer battery products at the end of the third quarter of  which was not entirely offset by the elimination of the losses from these discontinued operations beginning with the fourth quarter of net loss 
due to the factors cited above  we reported a net loss of million in  compared to a net loss of million in  an increase of million  or 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately million  compared with million as of december   an increase of million  or 
the increase in cash was primarily the result of sales of our securities during in january  we raised an additional million  net of expenses  through additional sales of our securities 
as of february   our cash totaled approximately million  not including approximately million held in restricted deposits to fund future obligations in connection with such acquisitions  primarily as a result of our use of cash for the epsilor and faac acquisitions 
we used available funds in primarily for working capital needs 
we increased our investment in fixed assets by  during the year ended december   primarily in the electric fuel batteries division 
our fixed assets amounted to million as at year end 
net cash used in operating activities from continuing operations for and was million and million  respectively  a decrease of  or 
this decrease was primarily the result of changes in operating assets and liabilities  such as accounts payable and inventory 
net cash used in investing activities for and was million and million  respectively  a decrease of million  or 
this decrease was primarily the result of our investment in the acquisition of ies and mdt in net cash provided by financing activities for and was million and million  respectively  an increase of million  or 
this increase was primarily the result of higher amounts of funds raised through sales of our securities in compared to during  certain of our employees exercised options under our registered employee stock option plan 
the proceeds to us from the exercised options were approximately  on september  we issued and sold to various institutional investors an aggregate  principal amount of secured convertible debentures due september   as more fully described in the current report on form k that we filed with the securities and exchange commission on october on december  we issued and sold to various institutional investors an aggregate  principal amount of secured convertible debentures due december   as more fully described under item market for registrant s common equity and related stockholder matters recent sales of unregistered securities  above 
we have approximately million in long term debt outstanding  of which million was convertible debt  and approximately million in short term debt 
we believe that our present cash position and anticipated cash flows from operations should be sufficient to satisfy our current estimated cash requirements through the next year 
over the long term  we will need to become profitable  at least on a cash flow basis  and maintain that profitability in order to avoid future capital requirements 
additionally  we would need to raise additional capital in order to fund any future acquisitions 
our current debt agreements grant to our investors a right of first refusal on any future financings  except for underwritten public offerings in excess of million 
we do not believe that this covenant will materially limit our ability to undertake future financings 
effective corporate tax rate arotech and efl have incurred net operating losses or had earnings arising from tax exempt income during the years ended december   and and accordingly no provision for income taxes was required 
taxes in these entities paid in  and are primarily composed of united states federal alternative minimum taxes 
as of december   we had us net operating loss carry forwards of approximately million that are available to offset future taxable income  expiring primarily in  and foreign net operating and capital loss carry forwards of approximately million  which are available indefinitely to offset future taxable income 
contractual obligations the following table lists our contractual obligations and commitments as of december  contractual obligations payment due by period total less than year years years more than years long term debt   short term debt   operating lease obligations    severance obligations     includes convertible debentures in the gross amount of  unamortized financial expenses related to the beneficial conversion feature of these convertible debentures amounted to  at year end 
risk factors the following factors  among others  could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward looking statements made in this report and presented elsewhere by management from time to time 
business related risks we have had a history of losses and may incur future losses 
we were incorporated in and began our operations in we have funded our operations principally from funds raised in each of the initial public offering of our common stock in february  through subsequent public and private offerings of our common stock and equity and debt securities convertible into shares of our common stock  research contracts and supply contracts  funds received under research and development grants from the government of israel  and sales of products that we and our subsidiaries manufacture 
we have incurred significant operating losses since our inception 
additionally  as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
there can be no assurance that we will ever be able to maintain profitability consistently or that our business will continue to exist 
our existing indebtedness may adversely affect our ability to obtain additional funds and may increase our vulnerability to economic or business downturns 
our indebtedness aggregated approximately million as of december  accordingly  we are subject to the risks associated with indebtedness  including o we must dedicate a portion of our cash flows from operations to pay debt service costs and  as a result  we have less funds available for operations  future acquisitions of consumer receivable portfolios  and other purposes  o it may be more difficult and expensive to obtain additional funds through financings  if available at all  o we are more vulnerable to economic downturns and fluctuations in interest rates  less able to withstand competitive pressures and less flexible in reacting to changes in our industry and general economic conditions  and o if we default under any of our existing debt instruments or if our creditors demand payment of a portion or all of our indebtedness  we may not have sufficient funds to make such payments 
the occurrence of any of these events could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition and adversely affect our stock price 
the agreements governing the terms of our debentures contain numerous affirmative and negative covenants that limit the discretion of our management with respect to certain business matters and place restrictions on us  including obligations on our part to preserve and maintain our assets and restrictions on our ability to incur or guarantee debt  to merge with or sell our assets to another company  and to make significant capital expenditures without the consent of the debenture holders 
our ability to comply with these and other provisions of such agreements may be affected by changes in economic or business conditions or other events beyond our control 
failure to comply with the terms of our debentures could result in a default that could have material adverse consequences for us 
a failure to comply with the obligations contained in our debenture agreements could result in an event of default under such agreements which could result in an acceleration of the debentures and the acceleration of debt under other instruments evidencing indebtedness that may contain cross acceleration or cross default provisions 
if the indebtedness under the debentures or other indebtedness were to be accelerated  there can be no assurance that our assets would be sufficient to repay in full such indebtedness 
we have pledged a substantial portion of our assets to secure our borrowings 
our debentures are secured by a substantial portion of our assets 
if we default under the indebtedness secured by our assets  those assets would be available to the secured creditors to satisfy our obligations to the secured creditors  which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition and adversely affect our stock price 
we need significant amounts of capital to operate and grow our business 
we require substantial funds to market our products and develop and market new products 
to the extent that we are unable to fully fund our operations through profitable sales of our products and services  we may continue to seek additional funding  including through the issuance of equity or debt securities 
however  there can be no assurance that we will obtain any such additional financing in a timely manner or on acceptable terms 
if additional funds are raised by issuing equity securities  stockholders may incur further dilution 
if additional funding is not secured  we will have to modify  reduce  defer or eliminate parts of our anticipated future commitments and or programs 
we may not be successful in operating a new business 
prior to the acquisitions of ies and mdt in and the acquisitions of faac and epsilor early in  our primary business was the marketing and sale of products based on primary and refuelable zinc air fuel cell technology and advancements in battery technology for defense and security products and other military applications  electric vehicles and consumer electronics 
as a result of our acquisitions  a substantial component of our business is the marketing and sale of hi tech multimedia and interactive training solutions and sophisticated lightweight materials and advanced engineering processes used to armor vehicles 
these are new businesses for us and our management group has limited experience operating these types of businesses 
although we have retained our acquired companies management personnel  we cannot assure that such personnel will continue to work for us or that we will be successful in managing this new business 
if we are unable to successfully operate these new businesses  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially impaired 
our acquisition strategy involves various risks 
part of our strategy is to grow through the acquisition of companies that will complement our existing operations or provide us with an entry into markets we do not currently serve 
growth through acquisitions involves substantial risks  including the risk of improper valuation of the acquired business and the risk of inadequate integration 
there can be no assurance that suitable acquisition candidates will be available  that we will be able to acquire or manage profitably such additional companies or that future acquisitions will produce returns that justify our investments therein 
in addition  we may compete for acquisition and expansion opportunities with companies that have significantly greater resources than we do 
furthermore  acquisitions could disrupt our ongoing business  distract the attention of our senior managers  make it difficult to maintain our operational standards  controls and procedures and subject us to contingent and latent risks that are different  in nature and magnitude  than the risks we currently face 
we may finance future acquisitions with cash from operations or additional debt or equity financings 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to generate internal cash or obtain financing from external sources or that  if available  such financing will be on terms acceptable to us 
the issuance of additional common stock to finance acquisitions may result in substantial dilution to our stockholders 
any debt financing may significantly increase our leverage and may involve restrictive covenants which limit our operations 
we may not successfully integrate our new acquisitions 
in light of our recent acquisitions of ies  mdt  faac and epsilor  our success will depend in part on our ability to manage the combined operations of these companies and to integrate the operations and personnel of these companies along with our other subsidiaries and divisions into a single organizational structure 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to effectively integrate the operations of our subsidiaries and divisions and our newly acquired businesses into a single organizational structure 
integration of these operations could also place additional pressures on our management as well as on our key technical resources 
the failure to successfully manage this integration could have an adverse material effect on us 
if we are successful in acquiring additional businesses  we may experience a period of rapid growth that could place significant additional demands on  and require us to expand  our management  resources and management information systems 
our failure to manage any such rapid growth effectively could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
if we are unable to manage our growth  our operating results will be impaired 
we are currently experiencing a period of growth and development activity which could place a significant strain on our personnel and resources 
our activity has resulted in increased levels of responsibility for both existing and new management personnel 
many of our management personnel have had limited or no experience in managing growing companies 
we have sought to manage our current and anticipated growth through the recruitment of additional management and technical personnel and the implementation of internal systems and controls 
however  our failure to manage growth effectively could adversely affect our results of operations 
a significant portion of our business is dependent on government contracts 
many of the customers of ies and faac to date have been in the public sector of the us  including the federal  state and local governments  and in the public sectors of a number of other countries  and most of mdt s customers have been in the public sector in israel  in particular the ministry of defense 
additionally  all of efb s sales to date of battery products for the military and defense sectors have been in the public sector in the united states 
a significant decrease in the overall level or allocation of defense spending or law enforcement in the us or other countries could have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial condition 
mdt has already experienced a slowdown in orders from the ministry of defense due to budget constraints and a requirement of us aid to israel that a substantial proportion of such aid be spent in the us  where mdt has only recently opened a factory in operation 
sales to public sector customers are subject to a multiplicity of detailed regulatory requirements and public policies as well as to changes in training and purchasing priorities 
contracts with public sector customers may be conditioned upon the continuing availability of public funds  which in turn depends upon lengthy and complex budgetary procedures  and may be subject to certain pricing constraints 
moreover  us government contracts and those of many international government customers may generally be terminated for a variety of factors when it is in the best interests of the government and contractors may be suspended or debarred for misconduct at the discretion of the government 
there can be no assurance that these factors or others unique to government contracts or the loss or suspension of necessary regulatory licenses will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial condition 
our us government contracts may be terminated at any time and may contain other unfavorable provisions 
the us government typically can terminate or modify any of its contracts with us either for its convenience or if we default by failing to perform under the terms of the applicable contract 
a termination arising out of our default could expose us to liability and have a material adverse effect on our ability to re compete for future contracts and orders 
our us government contracts contain provisions that allow the us government to unilaterally suspend us from receiving new contracts pending resolution of alleged violations of procurement laws or regulations  reduce the value of existing contracts  issue modifications to a contract and control and potentially prohibit the export of our products  services and associated materials 
a negative audit by the us government could adversely affect our business  and we might not be reimbursed by the government for costs that we have expended on our contracts 
government agencies routinely audit government contracts 
these agencies review a contractor s performance on its contract  pricing practices  cost structure and compliance with applicable laws  regulations and standards 
if we are audited  we will not be reimbursed for any costs found to be improperly allocated to a specific contract  while we would be required to refund any improper costs for which we had already been reimbursed 
therefore  an audit could result in a substantial adjustment to our revenues 
if a government audit uncovers improper or illegal activities  we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions  including termination of contracts  forfeitures of profits  suspension of payments  fines and suspension or debarment from doing business with united states government agencies 
we could suffer serious reputational harm if allegations of impropriety were made against us 
a governmental determination of impropriety or illegality  or an allegation of impropriety  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we may be liable for penalties under a variety of procurement rules and regulations  and changes in government regulations could adversely impact our revenues  operating expenses and profitability 
our defense and commercial businesses must comply with and are affected by various government regulations that impact our operating costs  profit margins and our internal organization and operation of our businesses 
among the most significant regulations are the following o the us federal acquisition regulations  which regulate the formation  administration and performance of government contracts  o the us truth in negotiations act  which requires certification and disclosure of all cost and pricing data in connection with contract negotiations  and o the us cost accounting standards  which impose accounting requirements that govern our right to reimbursement under certain cost based government contracts 
these regulations affect how we and our customers do business and  in some instances  impose added costs on our businesses 
any changes in applicable laws could adversely affect the financial performance of the business affected by the changed regulations 
with respect to us government contracts  any failure to comply with applicable laws could result in contract termination  price or fee reductions or suspension or debarment from contracting with the us government 
our operating margins may decline under our fixed price contracts if we fail to estimate accurately the time and resources necessary to satisfy our obligations 
some of our contracts are fixed price contracts under which we bear the risk of any cost overruns 
our profits are adversely affected if our costs under these contracts exceed the assumptions that we used in bidding for the contract 
in  approximately of our revenues were derived from fixed price contracts for both defense and non defense related government contracts 
often  we are required to fix the price for a contract before we finalize the project specifications  which increases the risk that we will mis price these contracts 
the complexity of many of our engagements makes accurately estimating our time and resources more difficult 
if we are unable to retain our contracts with the us government and subcontracts under us government prime contracts in the competitive rebidding process  our revenues may suffer 
upon expiration of a us government contract or subcontract under a us government prime contract  if the government customer requires further services of the type provided in the contract  there is frequently a competitive rebidding process 
we cannot guarantee that we  or if we are a subcontractor that the prime contractor  will win any particular bid  or that we will be able to replace business lost upon expiration or completion of a contract 
further  all us government contracts are subject to protest by competitors 
the termination of several of our significant contracts or nonrenewal of several of our significant contracts  could result in significant revenue shortfalls 
we cannot assure you of market acceptance of our electric vehicle technology 
our batteries for the defense industry and a signal light powered by water activated batteries for use in life jackets and other rescue apparatus are the only commercial zinc air battery products we currently have available for sale 
significant resources will be required to develop and produce additional products utilizing this technology on a commercial scale 
additional development will be necessary in order to commercialize our technology and each of the components of the electric fuel system for electric vehicles 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully develop  engineer or commercialize our zinc air energy system 
the likelihood of our future success must be considered in light of the risks  expenses  difficulties and delays frequently encountered in connection with the operation and development of a relatively early stage business and with development activities generally 
we believe that public pressure and government initiatives are important factors in creating an electric vehicle market 
however  there can be no assurance that there will be sufficient public pressure or that further legislation or other governmental initiatives will be enacted  or that current legislation will not be repealed  amended  or have its implementation delayed 
in addition  we are subject to the risk that even if an electric fuel vehicle market develops  a different form of zero emission or low emission vehicle will dominate the market 
in addition  we cannot assure you that other solutions to the problem of containing emissions created by internal combustion engines will not be invented  developed and produced 
any other solution could achieve greater market acceptance than electric vehicles 
the failure of a significant market for electric vehicles to develop would have a material adverse effect on our ability to commercialize this aspect of our technology 
even if a significant market for electric vehicles develops  there can be no assurance that our technology will be commercially competitive within that market 
some of the components of our electric vehicle technology and our products pose potential safety risks which could create potential liability exposure for us 
some of the components of our electric vehicle technology and our products contain elements that are known to pose potential safety risks 
also  because electric vehicle batteries contain large amounts of electrical energy  they may cause injuries if not handled properly 
in addition to these risks  and there can be no assurance that accidents in our facilities will not occur 
any accident  whether occasioned by the use of all or any part of our products or technology or by our manufacturing operations  could adversely affect commercial acceptance of our products and could result in significant production delays or claims for damages resulting from injuries 
any of these occurrences would materially adversely affect our operations and financial condition 
we may face product liability claims 
in the event that our products  including the products manufactured by mdt  fail to perform as specified  users of these products may assert claims for substantial amounts 
these claims could have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
there is no assurance that the amount of the general product liability insurance that we maintain will be sufficient to cover potential claims or that the present amount of insurance can be maintained at the present level of cost  or at all 
our fields of business are highly competitive 
the competition to develop defense and security products and electric vehicle battery systems  and to obtain funding for the development of these products  is  and is expected to remain  intense 
our defense and security products compete with other manufacturers of specialized training systems  including firearms training systems  inc  a producer of interactive simulation systems designed to provide training in the handling and use of small and supporting arms 
in addition  we compete with manufacturers and developers of armor for cars and vans  including o gara hess eisenhardt  a division of armor holdings  inc our battery technology competes with other battery technologies  as well as other zinc air technologies 
the competition in this area of our business consists of development stage companies  major international companies and consortia of such companies  including battery manufacturers  automobile manufacturers  energy production and transportation companies  consumer goods companies and defense contractors 
many of our competitors have financial  technical  marketing  sales  manufacturing  distribution and other resources significantly greater than ours 
various battery technologies are being considered for use in electric vehicles and defense and safety products by other manufacturers and developers  including the following lead acid  nickel cadmium  nickel iron  nickel zinc  nickel metal hydride  sodium sulfur  sodium nickel chloride  zinc bromine  lithium ion  lithium polymer  lithium iron sulfide  primary lithium  rechargeable alkaline and zinc air 
if we are unable to compete successfully in each of our operating areas  especially in the defense and security products area of our business  our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
our business is dependent on proprietary rights that may be difficult to protect and could affect our ability to compete effectively 
our ability to compete effectively will depend on our ability to maintain the proprietary nature of our technology and manufacturing processes through a combination of patent and trade secret protection  non disclosure agreements and licensing arrangements 
litigation  or participation in administrative proceedings  may be necessary to protect our proprietary rights 
this type of litigation can be costly and time consuming and could divert company resources and management attention to defend our rights  and this could harm us even if we were to be successful in the litigation 
in the absence of patent protection  and despite our reliance upon our proprietary confidential information  our competitors may be able to use innovations similar to those used by us to design and manufacture products directly competitive with our products 
in addition  no assurance can be given that others will not obtain patents that we will need to license or design around 
to the extent any of our products are covered by third party patents  we could need to acquire a license under such patents to develop and market our products 
despite our efforts to safeguard and maintain our proprietary rights  we may not be successful in doing so 
in addition  competition is intense  and there can be no assurance that our competitors will not independently develop or patent technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology 
moreover  in the event of patent litigation  we cannot assure you that a court would determine that we were the first creator of inventions covered by our issued patents or pending patent applications or that we were the first to file patent applications for those inventions 
if existing or future third party patents containing broad claims were upheld by the courts or if we were found to infringe third party patents  we may not be able to obtain the required licenses from the holders of such patents on acceptable terms  if at all 
failure to obtain these licenses could cause delays in the introduction of our products or necessitate costly attempts to design around such patents  or could foreclose the development  manufacture or sale of our products 
we could also incur substantial costs in defending ourselves in patent infringement suits brought by others and in prosecuting patent infringement suits against infringers 
we also rely on trade secrets and proprietary know how that we seek to protect  in part  through non disclosure and confidentiality agreements with our customers  employees  consultants  and entities with which we maintain strategic relationships 
we cannot assure you that these agreements will not be breached  that we would have adequate remedies for any breach or that our trade secrets will not otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors 
we are dependent on key personnel and our business would suffer if we fail to retain them 
we are highly dependent on the presidents of our ies and faac subsidiaries and the general managers of our mdt and epsilor subsidiaries  and the loss of the services of one or more of these persons could adversely affect us 
we are especially dependent on the services of our chairman  president and chief executive officer  robert s 
ehrlich 
the loss of mr 
ehrlich could have a material adverse effect on us 
we are party to an employment agreement with mr 
ehrlich  which agreement expires at the end of we do not have key man life insurance on mr 
ehrlich 
there are risks involved with the international nature of our business 
a significant portion of our sales are made to customers located outside the us  primarily in europe and asia 
in  and  without taking account of revenues derived from discontinued operations   and  respectively  of our revenues  were derived from sales to customers located outside the us we expect that our international customers will continue to account for a substantial portion of our revenues in the near future 
sales to international customers may be subject to political and economic risks  including political instability  currency controls  exchange rate fluctuations  foreign taxes  longer payment cycles and changes in import export regulations and tariff rates 
in addition  various forms of protectionist trade legislation have been and in the future may be proposed in the us and certain other countries 
any resulting changes in current tariff structures or other trade and monetary policies could adversely affect our sales to international customers 
investors should not purchase our common stock with the expectation of receiving cash dividends 
we currently intend to retain any future earnings for funding growth and  as a result  do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
market related risks the price of our common stock is volatile 
the market price of our common stock has been volatile in the past and may change rapidly in the future 
the following factors  among others  may cause significant volatility in our stock price o announcements by us  our competitors or our customers  o the introduction of new or enhanced products and services by us or our competitors  o changes in the perceived ability to commercialize our technology compared to that of our competitors  o rumors relating to our competitors or us  o actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results  and o general market or economic conditions 
if our shares were to be delisted  our stock price might decline further and we might be unable to raise additional capital 
one of the continued listing standards for our stock on the nasdaq national market is the maintenance of a bid price 
our stock price has periodically traded below in the recent past 
if our bid price were to go and remain below for consecutive business days  nasdaq could notify us of our failure to meet the continued listing standards  after which we would have calendar days to correct such failure or be delisted from the nasdaq national market 
although we would have the opportunity to appeal any potential delisting  there can be no assurances that this appeal would be resolved favorably 
as a result  there can be no assurance that our common stock will remain listed on the nasdaq national market 
if our common stock were to be delisted from the nasdaq national market  we might apply to be listed on the nasdaq smallcap market  however  there can be no assurance that we would be approved for listing on the nasdaq smallcap market  which has the same minimum bid and other similar requirements as the nasdaq national market 
if we were to move to the nasdaq smallcap market  current nasdaq regulations would give us the opportunity to obtain an additional day grace period and an additional day grace period after that if we meet certain net income  stockholders equity or market capitalization criteria 
while our stock would continue to trade on the over the counter bulletin board following any delisting from the nasdaq  any such delisting of our common stock could have an adverse effect on the market price of  and the efficiency of the trading market for  our common stock 
also  if in the future we were to determine that we need to seek additional equity capital  it could have an adverse effect on our ability to raise capital in the public equity markets 
in addition  if we fail to maintain nasdaq listing for our securities  and no other exclusion from the definition of a penny stock under the securities exchange act of  as amended  is available  then any broker engaging in a transaction in our securities would be required to provide any customer with a risk disclosure document  disclosure of market quotations  if any  disclosure of the compensation of the broker dealer and its salesperson in the transaction and monthly account statements showing the market values of our securities held in the customer s account 
the bid and offer quotation and compensation information must be provided prior to effecting the transaction and must be contained on the customer s confirmation 
if brokers become subject to the penny stock rules when engaging in transactions in our securities  they would become less willing to engage in transactions  thereby making it more difficult for our stockholders to dispose of their shares 
a substantial number of our shares are available for sale in the public market and sales of those shares could adversely affect our stock price 
sales of a substantial number of shares of common stock into the public market  or the perception that those sales could occur  could adversely affect our stock price or could impair our ability to obtain capital through an offering of equity securities 
as of february   we had  shares of common stock issued and outstanding 
of these shares  most are freely transferable without restriction under the securities act of  and a substantial portion of the remaining shares may be sold subject to the volume restrictions  manner of sale provisions and other conditions of rule under the securities act of in connection with a stock purchase agreement dated september  between leon s 
gross and us  we also entered into a registration rights agreement with mr 
gross dated september   providing registration rights with respect to the shares of common stock issued to mr 
gross in connection with the offering 
these rights include the right to make two demands for the registration of the shares of our common stock owned by mr 
gross 
in addition  mr 
gross was granted unlimited rights to piggyback on registration statements that we file for the sale of our common stock 
mr 
gross presently owns  shares  of which  have never been registered 
exercise of our warrants  options and convertible debt could adversely affect our stock price and will be dilutive 
as of february   there were outstanding warrants to purchase a total of  shares of our common stock at a weighted average exercise price of per share  options to purchase a total of  shares of our common stock at a weighted average exercise price of per share  of which  were vested  at a weighted average exercise price of per share  and outstanding debentures convertible into a total of  shares of our common stock at a weighted average conversion price of per share 
holders of our options  warrants and convertible debt will probably exercise or convert them only at a time when the price of our common stock is higher than their respective exercise or conversion prices 
accordingly  we may be required to issue shares of our common stock at a price substantially lower than the market price of our stock 
this could adversely affect our stock price 
in addition  if and when these shares are issued  the percentage of our common stock that existing stockholders own will be diluted 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law contain provisions that could discourage a takeover 
provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation may have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire  or of discouraging a third party from attempting to acquire  control of us 
these provisions could limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 
these provisions o divide our board of directors into three classes serving staggered three year terms  o only permit removal of directors by stockholders for cause  and require the affirmative vote of at least of the outstanding common stock to so remove  and o allow us to issue preferred stock without any vote or further action by the stockholders 
the classification system of electing directors and the removal provision may tend to discourage a third party from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us and may maintain the incumbency of our board of directors  as the classification of the board of directors increases the difficulty of replacing a majority of the directors 
these provisions may have the effect of deferring hostile takeovers  delaying changes in our control or management  or may make it more difficult for stockholders to take certain corporate actions 
the amendment of any of these provisions would require approval by holders of at least of the outstanding common stock 
israel related risks a significant portion of our operations takes place in israel  and we could be adversely affected by the economic  political and military conditions in that region 
the offices and facilities of three of our subsidiaries  efl  mdt and epsilor  are located in israel in beit shemesh  lod and dimona  respectively  all of which are within israel s pre borders 
most of our senior management is located at efl s facilities 
although we expect that most of our sales will be made to customers outside israel  we are nonetheless directly affected by economic  political and military conditions in that country 
accordingly  any major hostilities involving israel or the interruption or curtailment of trade between israel and its present trading partners could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
since the establishment of the state of israel in  a number of armed conflicts have taken place between israel and its arab neighbors and a state of hostility  varying in degree and intensity  has led to security and economic problems for israel 
historically  arab states have boycotted any direct trade with israel and to varying degrees have imposed a secondary boycott on any company carrying on trade with or doing business in israel 
although in october  the states comprising the gulf cooperation council saudi arabia  the united arab emirates  kuwait  dubai  bahrain and oman announced that they would no longer adhere to the secondary boycott against israel  and israel has entered into certain agreements with egypt  jordan  the palestine liberation organization and the palestinian authority  israel has not entered into any peace arrangement with syria or lebanon 
moreover  since september  there has been a significant deterioration in israel s relationship with the palestinian authority  and a significant increase in terror and violence 
efforts to resolve the problem have failed to result in an agreeable solution 
continued hostilities between the palestinian community and israel and any failure to settle the conflict may have a material adverse effect on our business and us 
moreover  the current political and security situation in the region has already had an adverse effect on the economy of israel  which in turn may have an adverse effect on us 
some of our employees are currently obligated to perform annual reserve duty in the israel defense forces and are subject to being called for active military duty at any time 
no assessment can be made of the full impact of such requirements on us in the future  particularly if emergency circumstances occur  and no prediction can be made as to the effect on us of any expansion of these obligations 
however  further deterioration of hostilities with the palestinian community into a full scale conflict might require more widespread military reserve service by some of our employees  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
service of process and enforcement of civil liabilities on us and our officers may be difficult to obtain 
we are organized under the laws of the state of delaware and will be subject to service of process in the united states 
however  approximately of our assets are located outside the united states 
in addition  two of our directors and all of our executive officers are residents of israel and a portion of the assets of such directors and executive officers are located outside the united states 
there is doubt as to the enforceability of civil liabilities under the securities act of  as amended  and the securities exchange act of  as amended  in original actions instituted in israel 
as a result  it may not be possible for investors to enforce or effect service of process upon these directors and executive officers or to judgments of us courts predicated upon the civil liability provisions of us laws against our assets  as well as the assets of these directors and executive officers 
in addition  awards of punitive damages in actions brought in the us or elsewhere may be unenforceable in israel 
exchange rate fluctuations between the us dollar and the israeli nis may negatively affect our earnings 
although a substantial majority of our revenues and a substantial portion of our expenses are denominated in us dollars  a portion of our costs  including personnel and facilities related expenses  is incurred in new israeli shekels nis 
inflation in israel will have the effect of increasing the dollar cost of our operations in israel  unless it is offset on a timely basis by a devaluation of the nis relative to the dollar 
in  the inflation adjusted nis appreciated against the dollar  which raised the dollar cost of our israeli operations 
some of our agreements are governed by israeli law 
israeli law governs some of our agreements  such as our lease agreements on our subsidiaries premises in israel  and the agreements pursuant to which we purchased ies  mdt and epsilor 
while israeli law differs in certain respects from american law  we do not believe that these differences materially adversely affect our rights or remedies under these agreements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk it is our policy not to enter into interest rate derivative financial instruments  except for hedging of foreign currency exposures discussed below 
we do not currently have any significant interest rate exposure 
foreign currency exchange rate risk since a significant part of our sales and expenses are denominated in us dollars  we have experienced only insignificant foreign exchange gains and losses to date  and do not expect to incur significant gains and losses in our research  development and production activities are primarily carried out by our israeli subsidiary  efl  at its facility in beit shemesh  and accordingly we have sales and expenses in new israeli shekels 
additionally  our mdt and epsilor subsidiaries operate primarily in new israeli shekels 
however  the majority of our sales are made outside israel in us dollars  and a substantial portion of our costs are incurred in us dollars 
therefore  our functional currency is the us dollar 
please see impact of inflation and currency fluctuations  above and note b to the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
while we conduct our business primarily in us dollars  some of our agreements are denominated in foreign currencies 
specifically  at the end of our ies contract with the german national police  which accounted for of our revenues on a consolidated basis in  was denominated in euros 
thus  we are exposed to market risk  primarily related to fluctuations in the value of the euro 
therefore  due to the volatility in the exchange rate of the euro versus the us dollar  we decided to hedge part of the risk of a devaluation of the u 
s dollar  which could have an adverse effect on the revenues that we incur in ies 
during the year we hedged revenues derived from the german national police in order to protect against a decrease in value of forecasted foreign currency cash flows resulting from revenues payments denominated in euro 
we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes
