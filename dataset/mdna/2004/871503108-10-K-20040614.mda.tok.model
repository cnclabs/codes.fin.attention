critical accounting estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related notes requires us to make estimates  which include judgments and assumptions  that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we have based our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances and we evaluate our estimates on a regular basis and make changes accordingly 
historically  our estimates relative to our critical accounting estimates have not differed materially from actual results  however actual results may differ from these estimates under different conditions 
a critical accounting estimate is based on judgments and assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made 
different estimates that reasonably could have been used  or changes in accounting estimates could materially impact the financial statements 
we believe that the estimates described below represent our critical accounting estimates  as they have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements 
we also refer you to our summary of significant accounting policies beginning on page in this annual report on form k 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles that have been prescribed for the software industry 
revenue recognition requirements in the software industry are very complex and they require us to make many estimates 
in applying our revenue recognition policy  we must determine which portions of our revenue are recognized currently and which portions must be deferred 
in order to determine current and deferred revenue  we make estimates with regard to future deliverable products and services and the appropriate pricing for those products and services 
our estimates regarding future products and services could differ from actual events 
we defer revenue relating to products  primarily in our consumer products and enterprise administration segments  that we have shipped into our distribution and reseller channels to the extent that inventory levels are in excess of certain specified inventory levels for these channels 
we defer this revenue as an offset to accounts receivable 
we estimate the excess inventory in these channels by analyzing channel inventory levels and distribution and reseller sell through trends obtained from our channel partners  as well as various historical trends on a product basis 
in addition  we consider other factors in assessing these specified inventory levels  such as product seasonality  current market conditions  economic trends  existing security threats and timing of new product releases 
on the same basis  we defer the associated cost of revenues related to this deferred revenue 
if we made different estimates  material differences may result in the amount and timing of our net revenues and cost of revenues for any period presented 
in arrangements that include multiple elements  including perpetual software licenses and maintenance and or services  and packaged products with content updates  we allocate and defer revenue for the undelivered items based on vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe  of fair value of the undelivered elements  and recognize the difference between the total arrangement fee and the amount deferred for the undelivered items as revenue 
our deferred revenue consists primarily of the unamortized balance of enterprise product maintenance and consumer product content updates and totaled million as of march   of which million was represented as long term deferred revenue  on the consolidated balance sheet 
vsoe of each element is based on the price for 
table of contents which the undelivered element is sold separately 
we determine fair value of the undelivered elements based on historical evidence of our stand alone sales of these elements to third parties 
when vsoe does not exist for undelivered items such as maintenance  then the entire arrangement fee is recognized ratably over the performance period 
changes to the elements in a software arrangement  the ability to identify vsoe for those elements  the fair value of the respective elements  and changes to a product s estimated life cycle could materially impact the amount of earned and unearned revenue 
reserves for product returns end users may return our products  primarily within our consumer products and enterprise administration segments  through distributors and resellers or to us directly for a full refund within a reasonably short period from the date of purchase 
our estimated reserves for such end user product returns  which are recorded as an offset to revenue  are based primarily on historical trends 
we also consider other factors such as the timing of upgrades and new versions of products  current market conditions  economic trends and changes in technology 
in addition  we fully reserve for obsolete products in the distribution channels as an offset to revenue 
if we made different estimates  material differences may result in the amount and timing of our net revenues for any period presented 
more or less product may be returned from what was estimated and or the amount of inventory in the channel could be different than what is estimated 
these factors and unanticipated changes in the economic and industry environment could make our return estimates differ from actual results 
reserves for rebates we estimate and record reserves as an offset to revenue for channel and end user rebates  related primarily to products within our consumer products  enterprise security and enterprise administration segments 
our estimated reserves for channel volume incentive rebates are based on distributors and resellers actual performance against the terms and conditions of volume incentive rebate programs  which are typically entered into quarterly 
our reserves for end user rebates are estimated on the terms and conditions of the promotional programs  actual sales during the promotion  amount of actual redemptions received  historical redemption trends by product and by type of promotional program and the value of the rebate 
we also consider current market conditions and economic trends when estimating our reserves for rebates 
if we made different estimates  material differences may result in the amount and timing of our net revenues for any period presented 
business combinations when we acquire businesses  we allocate the purchase price to tangible assets and liabilities acquired and identifiable intangible assets 
any residual purchase price is recorded as goodwill 
we engage independent third party appraisal firms to assist in determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
such a valuation requires management to make significant estimates  especially with respect to intangible assets 
these estimates are based on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies 
these estimates can include  but are not limited to  the cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future  the appropriate weighted average cost of capital  and the cost savings expected to be derived from acquiring an asset 
these estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
in addition  unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates 
at march   goodwill was billion  acquired product rights was million  and other identifiable intangible assets was million 
we assess the impairment of goodwill within our reportable units annually  or more often if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
we assess the impairment of acquired product rights and other identifiable intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss would be recognized when the sum of the discounted future net cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition is less than its carrying amount 
such impairment loss would be measured as the difference between the carrying amount of the asset and its fair value 
the estimate of cash flow is based upon  among other things  certain assumptions about expected future operating performance and an appropriate discount rate determined by our management 
our estimates of discounted cash flows may differ from actual cash flows due to  among other things  economic conditions  changes to the business model or changes in operating performance 
if we made different estimates  material differences may result in write downs of net long lived and intangible assets  which would be reflected by charges to our operating results for any period presented 
accounting for excess facilities 
table of contents we have estimated expenses for excess facilities related to consolidating  moving and relocating various groups or sites as a result of restructuring activities and business acquisitions 
in determining our estimates  we obtained information from third party leasing agents to calculate anticipated third party sublease income and the vacancy period prior to finding a sub lessee 
market conditions will affect our ability to sublease facilities on terms consistent with our estimates 
our ability to sublease facilities on schedule or to negotiate lease terms resulting in higher or lower sublease income than estimated will affect our accrual for site closures 
differences between estimates of related broker commissions  tenant improvements and related exit costs may increase or decrease our accrual upon final negotiation 
if we made different estimates regarding these various components of our excess facilities costs  the amount recorded for any period presented could vary materially from those actually recorded 
income taxes we make significant estimates to determine our current provision for income taxes  as well as deferred tax assets and liabilities and our income taxes payable 
our estimates relative to the current provision for income taxes take into account current tax laws  our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities 
changes in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of current and future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our financial position and results of operations 
we also assess the likelihood that our net deferred tax assets will be realized 
realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent upon future united states taxable income and future taxable income in certain foreign jurisdictions  as well as our implementation of prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
our estimates regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions  changes in united states or international tax laws and other factors 
to the extent we believe it is more likely than not that some portion or all of our net deferred tax assets will not be realized  we establish a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or change the allowance in a period  we reflect the change with a corresponding increase or decrease to our tax provision in our consolidated statements of operations 
legal contingencies from time to time  we are involved in disputes that arise in the ordinary course of business  and we do not expect this trend to change in the future 
we are currently involved in the legal proceedings as discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
when the likelihood of the incurrence of costs related to our legal proceedings is probable and management has the ability to estimate such costs  we provide for estimates of external legal fees and any probable losses through charges to our consolidated statements of operations 
these estimates have been based on our assessment of the facts and circumstances at each balance sheet date and are subject to change based upon new information and intervening events 
our accrual for legal contingencies as of march  represented insignificant amounts related to external legal fees and no amounts were accrued for probable losses  as we believe that we have meritorious defenses to the claims against us  and we will defend ourselves vigorously 
however  even if we are successful  estimated costs for external legal fees could be more than anticipated 
and  if we are unsuccessful  we might be forced to pay significant damages and licensing fees  or modify our business practices for which we have not accrued any amounts for loss contingencies 
any such results could materially harm our business and could result in a material adverse impact on the financial position  results of operations or cash flows 

table of contents results of operations overview our goal for fiscal was to continue serving customer needs while reshaping the competitive landscape by offering integrated solutions 
within the consumer products segment  we grew our base of individual users and accelerated our expansion into the small business market 
in addition  we released new versions of our award winning consumer products  including norton internet security  norton antivirus  norton personal firewall  norton antispam and norton systemworks  which includes norton password manager

in addition  we maintained our focus on delivering strong integrated solutions  enhanced manageability  and more comprehensive intrusion protection 
within the enterprise administration segment  sales of our pcanywhere product continued to decline and we expect this trend to continue due to the extended functionality of microsoft operating system products 
conversely  the enterprise administration segment benefited from our new product introductions related to our business acquisitions of on technology and powerquest in the second half of fiscal net revenue during fiscal increased as compared to fiscal due primarily to increased sales of our consumer and enterprise security products  which can be attributable to the numerous security threat outbreaks that occurred during fiscal  including the beagle  welchia  blaster  sobig  mydoom and netsky viruses 
in addition  increased demand for our security protection solutions from large organizations as well as from small businesses and consumers also contributed to the growth 
net revenue during fiscal increased as compared to fiscal due primarily to increased sales of our consumer and enterprise security products  which can be attributable to the numerous security threat outbreaks that occurred during fiscal  including the code red  nimda  klez  bugbear and slammer viruses

strength in major foreign currencies during fiscal  as compared to the average major foreign currency rates during fiscal  positively impacted our international revenue growth by million due primarily to the strength of the euro 
we are unable to predict the extent to which revenues in future periods will be impacted by changes in foreign currency rates 
if international sales become a greater proportion of our total sales in the future  changes in foreign exchange rates may have a potentially greater impact on our revenues and operating results 
gross margin year ended march  change change fiscal fiscal in thousands to to gross profit gross margin 
table of contents gross profit represents net revenues less cost of revenues 
cost of revenues consists primarily of costs for producing manuals and cds  packaging costs  fee based technical support costs  amortization of acquired product rights  payments to original equipment manufacturers under revenue sharing arrangements  costs of services  royalties paid to third parties under technology licensing agreements  and manufacturing expenses 
gross margin remained flat at approximately during fiscal year  and we anticipate that our services revenues may grow and comprise a higher percentage of our total revenues in future periods  in which case our gross margin would likely decrease  as our services typically have higher cost of revenues than our software products 
acquired product rights acquired product rights are comprised of purchased product rights  technologies  databases and revenue related order backlog and contracts from acquired companies

the increased headcount was the direct result of the growth of the company  including business acquisitions completed in fiscal and fiscal amortization of goodwill during fiscal  we recorded million of amortization of goodwill 
in accordance with sfas no 
 the carrying values of goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are no longer amortized as of april  therefore  there was no corresponding expense in fiscal and goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis 
we completed our annual goodwill impairment required by sfas no 
during the march quarter and determined that there was no impairment of goodwill 
we will continue to test for impairment during the fourth quarter of each year  or earlier if indicators of impairment exist 
amortization of other intangibles from acquisitions year ended march  change change fiscal fiscal in thousands to to expenses percentage of total net revenues percentage not meaningful the increase in amortization of other intangibles from acquisitions in fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily related to the amortization of other intangible assets acquired with the purchase of on technology in february  powerquest in december and nexland in july this increase was offset by certain other intangibles being fully amortized during fiscal the increase in amortization of other intangibles from acquisitions in fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily related to the amortization of other intangibles acquired with the purchase of recourse and securityfocus in august acquired in process research and development year ended march  change change fiscal fiscal in thousands to to expenses percentage of total net revenues percentage not meaningful 
table of contents acquired in process research and development during fiscal resulted from our acquisitions of on technology  powerquest and nexland 
acquired in process research and development during fiscal resulted from our acquisitions of riptech  securityfocus and recourse 
the efforts required to develop the acquired in process technology principally relate to the completion of all planning  design  development and test activities that are necessary to establish that the product or service can be produced to meet its design specifications including features  functions and performance 
we determined the fair value of the acquired in process technology for each of the purchases by estimating the projected cash flows related to these projects and future revenues to be earned upon commercialization of the products 
we discounted the resulting cash flows back to their net present values 
we based the net cash flows from such projects on our analysis of the respective markets and estimates of revenues and operating profits related to these projects 
on technology the in process technology acquired in the on technology acquisition consisted primarily of research and development related to its next generation ccm icommand and ipatch products  which enable organizations and service providers to manage the full lifecycle of their computing systems over corporate networks

patent settlement in august  we purchased a security technology patent as part of a settlement in hilgraeve  inc versus symantec corporation 
as part of the settlement  we also received licenses to the remaining patents in hilgraeve s portfolio 
the total cost of purchasing the patent and licensing additional patents was million  which was paid in cash in august under the transaction  we recorded million of patent settlement costs in the june quarter  representing costs related to benefits received by us in and prior to the june quarter 
during the september quarter  we recorded acquired product rights of million  which are being amortized to cost of goods sold over the remaining life of the primary patent  which expires in june there was no corresponding expense recorded during fiscal or fiscal litigation judgment during the march quarter  we accrued litigation expenses of million for post judgment interest and other costs related to a judgment by a canadian court on a decade old copyright action assumed by us as a result of our acquisition of delrina corporation 
for further discussion on our current litigation  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
there was no corresponding expense recorded during fiscal or fiscal operating income year ended march  change change fiscal fiscal in thousands to to operating income percentage of total net revenues percentage not meaningful operating income increased during fiscal as compared to fiscal due primarily to increased revenue growth of during fiscal  offset by increased headcount related costs and related operating expenses 
operating income increased during fiscal as compared to fiscal due primarily to the adoption of sfas no 
as a result  in fiscal  we recorded no amortization of goodwill  compared with a charge of million during fiscal in addition  revenue growth of contributed to the increase in operating income during fiscal 
table of contents interest and other income expense  net year ended march  change change fiscal fiscal in thousands to to interest income percentage of total net revenues interest expense percentage of total net revenues other income expense  net percentage of total net revenues percentage not meaningful the increase in interest income in fiscal as compared to fiscal was due to higher average invested cash balances  partially offset by lower average interest rates 
the increase in interest income in fiscal as compared to fiscal was due to higher average invested cash balances 
interest expense during fiscal  and was primarily related to the issuance of our million convertible subordinated notes in october other income expense  net during fiscal  and was comprised primarily of immaterial amounts of rental income  offset by banking fees 
income  net of expense  from sale of technologies and product lines year ended march  change change fiscal fiscal in thousands to to income percentage of total net revenues percentage not meaningful income  net of expense  from sale of technologies and product lines primarily related to royalty payments received in connection with the licensing of substantially all of the act product line technology to interact commerce corporation for a period of four years through december during fiscal  this royalty income was offset by the write off of million of developed technology related to the web access management products due to impairment 
the december quarter payments represent the final royalty and buy out payments related to the divestiture of our act product line as interact exercised its option to purchase the licensed technology from us for million less all royalties paid to us to date 
provision for income taxes year ended march  change change fiscal fiscal in thousands to to provision percentage of total net revenues effective tax rate our effective tax rate on income before taxes was approximately  and during fiscal  and respectively 
the higher effective tax rate in fiscal reflects the non deductibility of acquired in process research and development and substantially all of the goodwill amortization 
realization of our net deferred tax asset at march  is dependent primarily upon future united states taxable income and our implementation of tax planning strategies 
we believe it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will be realized based on historical earnings and expected levels of future taxable income as well as the implementation of tax planning strategies 

table of contents levels of future taxable income are subject to the various risks and uncertainties discussed in the business risk factors set forth in this item an additional valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets may be necessary if it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the net deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we will assess the need for an additional valuation allowance on a quarterly basis 
liquidity and capital resources year ended march  in thousands net cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents net change in cash and cash equivalents our principal source of liquidity as of march  is our existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of billion  as well as cash that we generate over time from our operations 
during fiscal  cash and cash equivalents increased by million and short term investments increased by million 
this increase is primarily due to cash provided by operations and proceeds from the sale of common stock through our employee benefit plans  offset by payments for business acquisitions  purchases of intangible assets and capital expenditures 
operating activities the increase in operating cash flow in fiscal  as compared with fiscal  was primarily the result of an increase in net income of million  an increase in deferred revenue of million and an increase in income taxes payable of million 
the increase in deferred revenue was due to a greater volume and term of software maintenance agreements and the increase in income taxes payable was due to improved profitability 
the increase in operating cashflow was partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of million due to higher sales in the month of march compared to the month of march the higher march sales resulted from greater sales of our consumer and enterprise products due to the security threat outbreaks that occurred during february  including the mydoom and netsky viruses 
the increase in operating cash flow in fiscal  as compared with fiscal  was primarily the result of improved profitability 
net income increased million  however fiscal net income included a non cash charge of million for the amortization of goodwill 
we ceased amortizing goodwill in fiscal in accordance with sfas excluding the amortization of goodwill  net income increased million in fiscal  compared to fiscal the increase in operating cash flow in fiscal was also the result of increased deferred revenue of million and an increase in income taxes payable of million 
the increase in deferred revenue was due to a greater volume of software maintenance agreements and the increase in income taxes payable was due to improved profitability 
the increase in operating cashflow was partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of million due to higher sales in the month of march compared to the month of march due to an unusually low net trade accounts receivable balance at march  as compared to the prior six quarter end balances 
in prior quarters  we had generated a larger percentage of net revenues during the last month of each quarter 
investing activities during the past three fiscal years our investing activities have included purchases of property and equipment  purchases of businesses and intangible assets  and purchases and sales of short term available for sale securities 
net cash used in investing activities decreased in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  due primarily to a decrease in net purchases of marketable securities of million and a decrease in capital expenditures of million 
the higher capital expenditures in fiscal resulted from our purchase of four of our facilities that were classified as operating leases under synthetic lease transactions by purchasing the land and buildings 
the decrease in cash used in investing activities was also affected by a million increase in cash payments for acquisitions of businesses and intangible assets during fiscal 
table of contents net cash used in investing activities decreased in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  due primarily to a decrease in net purchases of marketable securities and restricted investments of million  offset by a million increase in cash payments for acquisitions of businesses and technologies and a million increase in capital expenditures during fiscal financing activities during the past three fiscal years  our financing activities have included cash proceeds from the sale of our common stock through employee benefit plans  cash payments for the repurchase of our common stock and the issuance of our million convertible subordinated notes 
net cash provided by financing activities increased in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  due to an increase of million of net proceeds from the sale of common stock through our employee benefit plans 
net cash provided by financing activities decreased in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  due to the million of proceeds received upon the issuance of our convertible subordinated notes  net of debt issuance costs 
this decrease was offset by a million decrease in cash spent to repurchase our common stock 
on october   we completed a private offering of million of convertible subordinated notes due november   the net proceeds of which were million 
the notes are convertible into shares of our common stock by the holders at any time before maturity at a conversion price of per share  subject to certain adjustments 
during fiscal and  an insignificant principal amount of our notes were converted into shares of our common stock 
no shares were converted during fiscal we may redeem the remaining notes on or after november   at a redemption price of of stated principal during the period november  through october  and thereafter 
interest is paid semi annually and we commenced making these payments on may  debt issuance costs of million related to the notes is amortized on a straight line basis through november  we have reserved million shares of common stock for issuance upon conversion of the notes 
on january   the board of directors replaced an earlier stock repurchase program with a new authorization to repurchase up to million of symantec common stock  not to exceed million shares  with no expiration date 
on january   the board of directors increased the dollar amount of the company s authorized stock repurchase program from million to million  without any specific limit on the number of shares to be repurchased 
in connection with the additional million authorization  we adopted a repurchase plan under rule b and intend to repurchase million of shares during each calendar quarter 
during fiscal  we repurchased million shares under the amended stock repurchase program  at prices ranging from to per share  for an aggregate amount of million 
during fiscal  we repurchased million shares at prices ranging from to per share  for an aggregate amount of million 
during fiscal  we repurchased million shares at prices ranging from to per share  for an aggregate amount of million 
as of march   million remained authorized for future repurchases  of which million is expected to be utilized through the b plan through december contractual obligations the contractual obligations presented in the table below represent our estimates of future payments under fixed contractual obligations and commitments 
changes in our business needs  cancellation provisions  changing interest rates and other factors may result in actual payments differing from the estimates 
we cannot provide certainty regarding the timing and amounts of payments 
we have presented below a summary of the most significant assumptions used in our information within the context of our consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows

on may   we entered into an agreement to purchase brightmail  inc for an estimated million 
the completion of this acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions  and is expected to close in july we expect to integrate this technology into our enterprise security segment

table of contents business risk factors fluctuations in our quarterly operating results have affected our stock price in the past and could affect our stock price in the future 
our quarterly operating results have fluctuated in the past  and are likely to vary significantly in the future  based on a number of factors related to our industry and the markets for our products 
if our quarterly operating results or our predictions of future operating results fail to meet the expectations of analysts and investors  our stock price could be negatively affected 
factors that are likely to cause our operating results to fluctuate include reduced demand for any given product  uncertainty about and customer confidence in current economic conditions  unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  the market s transition between new releases of operating systems  the introduction of competitive products  seasonality in the end of period buying patterns of foreign and domestic software customers  and the timing of announcements and releases of new or enhanced versions of our products and product upgrades 
in addition  during fiscal  and  our operating results were materially affected by non standard charges  including the following acquired in process research and development  restructuring  site closures and other charges  litigation settlements  and asset impairment charges any volatility in our quarterly operating results may make it more difficult for us to raise capital in the future or pursue acquisitions that involve issuances of our common stock or securities convertible or exercisable into our common stock 
there is uncertainty as to whether or not we will be able to sustain the growth rates in sales of our products  particularly in consumer security products 
over the last nine quarters  we experienced a higher than expected rate of growth in sales of our consumer security protection products  and we expect that we will not be able to sustain this high growth rate on a consistent basis 
we believe that consumer security protection sales have been spurred by a number of factors over this period of time  including increased broadband usage and increased awareness of security threats to consumer systems  including the recently well publicized  beagle  welchia  blaster  sobig  mydoom  netsky and sasser viruses 
the impact of these factors may diminish over time  and it is possible that our growth rates in sales of security protection products may decline 
we have grown  and may continue to grow  through acquisitions that give rise to risks that could adversely affect our future operating results 
we completed four acquisitions each during fiscal and fiscal  and announced an agreement to complete an acquisition in the first quarter of fiscal and we will likely pursue future acquisitions 
integrating acquired businesses has been and will continue to be a complex  time consuming and expensive process 
to integrate acquired businesses  we must implement our technology systems in the acquired operations and assimilate and manage the personnel of the acquired operations 
our success in completing the integration of acquired businesses may impact the market acceptance of such acquisitions  and our willingness to acquire additional businesses in the future 
further  the difficulties of integrating acquired businesses could disrupt our ongoing business  distract our management focus from other opportunities and challenges  and increase our expenses and working capital requirements 
we may face difficulties in entering markets in which we have no or limited direct prior experience and where competitors in such markets have stronger market positions 
our acquisitions may cause us to recognize substantial amounts of goodwill and other intangible assets that will be subject to impairment testing and amortization  and we may assume liabilities 
in addition  acquisitions may result in substantial restructuring and other related expenses and write offs of acquired in process research and development costs 
further  we may need to issue equity or incur additional debt to finance future acquisitions  which could be dilutive to our existing stockholders or could increase our leverage 
any of these and other factors could harm our ability to achieve anticipated levels of profitability from acquired operations or to realize other anticipated benefits of an acquisition 
mergers and acquisitions of high technology companies are inherently risky  and no assurance can be given that our previous or future acquisitions will be successful and will not materially adversely affect our business  operating results or financial condition 

table of contents introduction and integration of new products and technologies may adversely affect our financial results 
we have recently introduced new products  such as symantec tm enterprise security architecture  or sesa tm  newly acquired products and products incorporating newly acquired technology  including technologies acquired in the following transactions on february   we completed the acquisition of on technology corp  a provider of solutions which enable organizations and service providers to manage the full lifecycle of their computing systems over corporate networks 
on december   we completed the acquisition of powerquest inc  a global provider of automated deployment and recovery solutions for corporations and individual users 
on october  we acquired safeweb  inc  a provider of ssl vpn appliances 
on july   we completed the acquisition of nexland  inc  a technology driven internet security company whose internet protocol based networking appliances are installed at enterprise branches and telecommuter offices worldwide 
these technologies may not achieve market acceptance and or may not be able to compete with products either currently in the market or introduced in the future 
if these technologies do not achieve market success  our financial results  and the trading price of our common stock could be adversely affected 
our efforts to develop and sell appliances and integrated solutions may not be successful and our future net revenues and operating results could be adversely affected 
we have been in the appliance business for a short period of time 
because of our limited experience with the manufacturing of appliances  and because our appliances generate lower gross margins than our software products  our efforts to develop and sell appliances may not be as successful as we anticipate 
in addition  our strategy for future growth includes integrating our various security technologies  management  customer service and support into a single enterprise security solution 
we have begun implementing this strategy by selling integrated solutions  such as symantec gateway security and symantec client security 
our integrated solutions may not achieve market acceptance and may not be able to compete with solutions either currently in the market or introduced in the future 
if we are unable to achieve market acceptance or compete effectively with solutions of our competitors  our future net revenues and operating results could be adversely affected 
economic conditions  and conditions affecting the network security market in particular  may have a negative impact on our revenues and margins 
the market for our products depends on various economic conditions including those affecting the network security  internet infrastructure and other related markets 
consumer demand for our products depends  in part  on global economic conditions 
on the enterprise side  any slowdown in corporate earnings or tightening of corporate budgets may cause potential customers to delay or cancel security projects  reduce their overall or security specific information technology budgets  or reduce or cancel orders for our products 
further  if economic conditions deteriorate  customers may experience financial difficulty  cease operations or fail to budget for the purchase of our products 
this  in turn  may lead to longer sales cycles  price pressures and collection issues  causing us to realize lower revenues and margins 
in addition  many parts of the world are experiencing economic instability  and we cannot predict how these conditions may affect our customers or business 
our international operations involve risks  and may be subject to political or other non economic barriers in certain countries 
in light of recent terrorist activity and political and military instability internationally  governments could enact additional regulations or restrictions on the use  import or export of encryption technologies 
further  our failure to obtain any required export approval of our technologies  particularly our encryption technologies  could impede our international sales 
the additional regulation of encryption technologies could delay or prevent the acceptance and use of encryption products and public networks for secure communications 
this might decrease demand for our products and services 
we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  which could adversely affect our financial results 
a significant portion of our manufacturing costs and operating expenses result from transactions outside of the united states  often in foreign currencies 
international sales comprised approximately  and of our total sales in fiscal  and  respectively 
although our fiscal operating results have been positively affected by changes in foreign currency rates  our future operating results will continue to be subject to 
table of contents fluctuations in foreign currency rates  and we may be negatively affected by fluctuations in foreign currency rates in the future  especially if international sales continue to grow as a percentage of our total sales 
our markets are competitive and our financial results and financial condition could be adversely affected if we are unable to anticipate or react to this competition 
our markets are competitive 
if we are unable to anticipate or react to this competition  our operating results could be adversely affected by reducing our sales or the prices we can charge for our products 
many of our competitors have significantly lowered  and may continue to lower  the price of their products and we may have to do the same to remain competitive 
our ability to remain competitive depends  in part  on our ability to enhance our products or develop new products that are compatible with new hardware and operating systems 
we have no control over  and limited insight into  development efforts by third parties with respect to new hardware and operating systems  and we may not respond effectively or timely to such changes in the market 
in addition  we have limited resources and we must make strategic decisions as to the best allocation of our resources to position ourselves for changes in our markets 
we may from time to time allocate resources to projects or markets that do not develop as rapidly or fully as we expect 
we may also fail to allocate resources to third party products  to markets or to business models that are ultimately more successful than we anticipate 
operating system providers and network equipment and computer hardware manufacturers are becoming substantial competitors in the market for security solutions  which could adversely affect our financial results 
large operating system providers and network equipment and computer hardware manufacturers with significantly greater financial  marketing or technological resources than we have may leverage their strengths at the computing platform  security layer and network tier levels to compete more aggressively in the market for security solutions 
our failure to adapt effectively to the continued development  acquisition  or licensing of security solutions technology or product rights by one or more of these competitors could negatively impact our competitive position in the market for security solutions 
for example  the continued inclusion of security  remote access or virus protection tools in new operating systems and hardware packages could adversely affect our sales 
in particular  microsoft has added security and remote access features to new versions of its operating system products that provide some of the same functions offered in our products 
this competition may decrease or delay the demand for certain of our products  including those currently under development 
furthermore  as hardware vendors incorporate security functions in their network equipment or integrate security within their network and system management products  the demand for some of our products may decrease  including those currently under development 
the trend toward consolidation in the software industry could impede our ability to compete effectively 
consolidation is underway among companies in the software industry as firms seek to offer more extensive suites and broader arrays of software products  as well as integrated software and hardware solutions 
changes resulting from this consolidation may negatively impact our competitive position 
in addition  to the extent that we seek to expand our product lines  managerial and technical personnel skills and capacity through acquisitions  the trend toward consolidation may result in our encountering competition  and paying higher prices  for acquired businesses 
demand for our products is subject to seasonal trends  which could make our stock price more volatile 
although there is no assurance this trend will continue  our sales of consumer products have been seasonal  with higher sales generally in our december and march quarters 
to the extent seasonality makes it more difficult to predict our revenues and value our business  our stock price may suffer and the volatility of our stock may increase 
military actions around the globe could create economic conditions that reduce demand for our products and services by businesses  consumers and government agencies 
political and military instability could slow spending within our target markets  delay sales cycles and otherwise adversely affect our ability to generate revenue and operate effectively 
government demand for our products and services is dictated by budgetary cycles and funding availability and this demand may be adversely affected by a redirection of spending for military or other objectives 
our financial forecasts may not be achieved  due to the unpredictability of end of period buying patterns  which could make our stock price more volatile 
the risk of quarterly fluctuations is increased by the fact that a significant portion of our quarterly net revenues has historically been generated during the last month of each fiscal quarter 
most resellers have tended to make a majority of their purchases at the end of a fiscal quarter 
in addition  many enterprise customers negotiate site licenses near the end of each quarter 
due to these end of period buying 
table of contents patterns  forecasts may not be achieved  either because expected sales do not occur or because they occur at lower prices or on terms that are less favorable to us 
this increases the chances that our results could diverge from the expectations of investors and analysts  which could make our stock price more volatile 
increased reliance on sales of enterprise licenses may result in greater fluctuations in  or otherwise adversely affect  our financial results 
sales of enterprise licenses through our enterprise security segment represent a major portion of our business 
enterprise licensing arrangements involve a longer sales cycle than sales through other distribution channels  require greater investment of resources in establishing the enterprise relationship  may involve greater pricing pressure and sometimes result in lower operating margins 
in addition  the timing of the execution of volume licenses  or their non renewal by large customers  could cause our results of operations to vary significantly from quarter to quarter and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 
in addition  longer license periods impede our ability to increase prices due to increased costs and may adversely impact our operating margins 
if we are unable to attract and retain personnel in a competitive marketplace  the growth and success of our business could be adversely affected 
we believe that our future success will depend in part on our ability to recruit and retain highly skilled management  sales  marketing and technical personnel 
to accomplish this  we believe that we must provide personnel with a competitive compensation package  including stock options 
increases in shares available for issuance under our stock options plans require stockholder approval in many cases  and institutional stockholders  or stockholders generally  may not approve future increases 
additionally  the fasb proposed a new standard that would require companies to include compensation expense in their statement of operations relating to the issuance of employee stock options 
as a result  we may decide to issue fewer stock options and may be impaired in our efforts to attract and retain necessary personnel 
we are dependent upon certain partners to distribute our products and we would be adversely affected if these relationships terminate or diminish 
a large portion of our enterprise sales are made through value added and other resellers  and a large portion of our consumer sales are made through the retail distribution channel 
reliance on these channels subjects us to events that cause unpredictability in demand 
this increases the risk that we may not plan effectively for the future  which could result in adverse operating results in future periods 
our distribution partners may also offer our competitors products 
their decisions to sell our products are partly a function of pricing  terms and special promotions offered by our competitors and other factors that we do not control and cannot predict 
our agreements with partners are generally nonexclusive and may be terminated by them or by us without cause 
we would be adversely affected if companies in our partner program chose to sell greater amounts of competitive offerings relative to the amount they sell of our offerings 
in addition  we sell our consumer products through original equipment manufacturers  or oems  who bundle our antivirus and other products with their pcs 
we continuously seek to establish new oem relationships and  conversely  may encounter oems that decide either to replace third party security software with their own or switch to a competitor s product 
when we lose an oem relationship  our consumer sales could be adversely affected unless and until we are able to establish new relationships of similar significance 
some distribution partners have experienced financial difficulties in the past  and may experience them in the future 
if these partners do suffer financial difficulties  we may have reduced sales or increased write offs  which would adversely affect our operating results 
if we are unable to effectively adapt to changes in the dynamic technological environment  our future revenues and operating results could be adversely affected 
we are increasingly focused on the internet security market  which  in turn is dependent on further acceptance and increased use of the internet 
the following critical issues concerning the use of the internet remain unresolved and may affect the market for our products and the use of the internet as a medium to distribute or support our software products and the functionality of some of our products security  reliability  cost  ease of use  accessibility  quality of service  and potential tax or other government regulations 
in addition  new technologies are gaining acceptance 
we must adapt to these changing technological demands 
if we are unable to timely assimilate changes brought about by the internet and wireless based environments  our future net revenues and operating results could be adversely affected 

table of contents our research and development efforts may be more costly and time consuming than anticipated and the results may be unsuccessful  which could adversely impact our financial results 
we will need to continue to incur significant research and development expenditures in future periods as we strive to remain competitive 
the length of our product development cycle for new products and product enhancements has frequently been greater than we originally expected  and we are likely to experience delays in future product development 
in addition  a portion of our development efforts has not been technologically successful and certain products have not achieved market acceptance 
as a result  the products we are currently developing or may develop in the future may not be technologically successful  achieve market acceptance or compete effectively with products of our competitors 
our products are complex and operate in a wide variety of computer configurations  which could result in errors or product failures 
because we offer very complex products  undetected errors  failures or bugs may occur when they are first introduced or when new versions are released 
our products often are installed and used in large scale computing environments with different operating systems  system management software and equipment and networking configurations  which may cause errors or failures in our products or may expose undetected errors  failures or bugs in our products 
in the past  we have discovered software errors  failures and bugs in certain of our product offerings after their introduction and have experienced delays or lost revenues during the period required to correct these errors 
our customers computer environments are often characterized by a wide variety of standard and non standard configurations that make pre release testing for programming or compatibility errors very difficult and time consuming 
despite testing by us and by others  errors  failures or bugs may not be found in new products or releases after commencement of commercial shipments 
errors  failures or bugs in products released by us could result in negative publicity  product returns  loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products or claims by customers or others 
in addition  if an actual or perceived breach of network security occurs in one of our end customer s security systems  regardless of whether the breach is attributable to our products  the market perception of the effectiveness of our products could be harmed 
because the techniques used by computer hackers to access or sabotage networks change frequently and may not be recognized until launched against a target  we may be unable to anticipate these techniques 
alleviating any of these problems could require significant expenditures of our capital and resources and could cause interruptions  delays or cessation of our product licensing  which could cause us to lose existing or potential customers and would adversely affect results of operations 
most of our license agreements with customers contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential product liability claims 
it is possible  however  that these provisions may not prove effective in limiting our liability 
product returns may negatively affect our net revenues 
product returns can occur when we introduce upgrades and new versions of products or when distributors or retailers have excess inventories  subject to various contractual limitations 
our return policy allows distributors  subject to these contractual limitations  to return purchased products in exchange for new products or credit towards future purchases 
end users may return our products for a full refund within a reasonably short period from the date of purchase 
future returns could exceed the reserves we have established for product returns  which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
increased customer demands on our technical support services may adversely affect our financial results 
we may be unable to respond quickly enough to short term increases in customer demand for support services 
we also may be unable to modify the format of our support services to compete with changes in support services provided by competitors 
further customer demand for these services  without corresponding revenue could increase costs and adversely affect our operating results 
we have outsourced the majority of our worldwide consumer support functions 
as such  we are highly dependent on the on going business success of the companies with whom we have contracted to provide these services 
if these companies experience financial difficulties  do not maintain sufficiently skilled workers and resources to satisfy our contracts or otherwise fail to perform at a sufficient level under these contracts  the level of support services to our customers may be significantly disrupted  which could materially harm our relationships with these customers 
our inability to timely distribute our products and services over the internet  including security patches and updated virus definitions via our liveupdate feature  could adversely affect our business 
our ability to maintain and increase the speed with which we provide services to consumers and to increase the scope of these services is limited by and dependent upon the speed and reliability of the internet 
as we incorporate the liveupdate technology into more of our products  we are increasingly reliant on the internet as a means to distribute our security patches and updated virus definitions to our customers 
accordingly  if we  or our customers  are unable to utilize the 
table of contents internet due to a failure of technology  infrastructure or other reasons  our ability to provide services may suffer  which could lead to a decrease in revenues 
in addition  the infrastructure required to support the increase in on line sales may be insufficient  if our on lines sales increase at a rate significantly greater than anticipated 
terrorist activity could target the internet  computer systems and networks  and security providers  which could adversely affect our ability to generate revenue 
any significant interruption of the internet  computer systems and or networks could adversely impact our ability to rapidly and efficiently provide anti virus and other product updates to our customers 
our software products and web site may be subject to intentional disruption  which could adversely impact our reputation and future sales 
although we believe we have sufficient controls in place to prevent intentional disruptions  we expect to be an ongoing target of attacks specifically designed to impede the performance of our products 
similarly  experienced computer programmers  or hackers  may attempt to penetrate our network security or the security of our web site and misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions of our services 
uninterrupted online availability of our web site is becoming increasingly important  as online subscription renewals comprise a larger portion of our revenues 
our activities could be adversely affected  and our reputation and future sales harmed  if these intentionally disruptive efforts are successful 
we are subject to litigation that could adversely affect our financial results 
from time to time  we are subjected to product liability claims  including claims that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of others  as well as other legal claims incidental to our business 
we are currently involved in a number of lawsuits  all of which we intend to defend vigorously 
however  it is possible that we could suffer an unfavorable outcome in one or more of these cases 
depending on the amount and timing of any unfavorable resolutions of these lawsuits  our future results of operations or cash flows could be materially adversely affected in a particular period 
although infringement claims may ultimately prove to be without merit  they are expensive to defend and may consume our resources or divert our attention from day to day operations 
if a third party alleges that we have infringed their intellectual property rights  we may choose to litigate the claim and or seek an appropriate license from the third party 
if we engage in litigation and the third party is found to have a valid patent claim against us and a license is not available on reasonable terms  our business  operating results and financial condition may be materially adversely affected 
for example  in the june quarter  we paid million in relation to the hilgraeve technology patent settlement  of which million was charged to operating expenses in the june quarter  and the remainder was capitalized and will be amortized to cost of revenues through june piracy of our software may have a significant adverse impact on our net revenues 
although we are unable to quantify the extent of piracy of our software products  software piracy may depress our net revenues 
while this would adversely affect revenue domestically  lost revenue is believed to be even more significant outside of the united states  particularly in countries where laws are less protective of intellectual property rights 
we engage in efforts to educate consumers on the benefits of licensing genuine products and to educate lawmakers on the advantages of a business climate where intellectual property rights are protected  and we cooperate with the business software alliance in their efforts to combat piracy 
however  these efforts may not affect the piracy of our products 
our intellectual property and proprietary rights may not be adequately protected from all unauthorized uses  which could adversely impact our financial results 
we regard our software and underlying technology as proprietary 
we seek to protect our proprietary rights through a combination of confidentiality agreements and copyright  patent  trademark and trade secret laws 
third parties may copy aspects of our products or otherwise obtain and use our proprietary information without authorization or develop similar technology independently 
all of our products are protected by copyright laws  and we have a number of patents and patent applications pending 
we may not achieve the desired protection from  and third parties may design around  our patents 
in addition  existing copyright laws afford limited practical protection 
furthermore  the laws of some foreign countries do not offer the same level of protection of our proprietary rights as the laws of the united states  and we may be subject to unauthorized use of our products 
any legal action that we may bring to protect proprietary information could be expensive and may distract management from day to day operations 
we continue to make substantial changes to our information systems that could disrupt our business and our financial results 
we plan to continuously improve our enterprise resource planning  customer relationship management and data warehouse information systems to support the form  functionality and scale of the business 

table of contents these types of transitions frequently prove disruptive to the underlying business of an enterprise and may cause us to incur higher costs than we anticipate 
failure to manage a smooth transition to the new systems and the ongoing operations and support of the new systems could materially harm our business operations 
in addition  our order management and product shipping centers are geographically dispersed 
a business disruption could occur as a result of natural disasters or the interruption in service by communications carriers 
if our communications between these centers are disrupted  particularly at the end of a fiscal quarter  we may suffer an unexpected shortfall in net revenues and a resulting adverse impact on our operating results 
communication outages  internet connectivity disruptions  and or increased volumes of electronic distribution transactions may also cause delays in customer access to our internet based services or product sales 
we hold minority interests in non public companies and if these companies face financial difficulties in their operations  our investments could be impaired and could adversely affect our financial results 
we continue to hold minority interests in privately held companies 
these investments are inherently risky because these companies are still in the development stage and depend on third parties for financing to support their ongoing operations 
in addition  the markets for their technologies or products are typically in the early stages and may never develop 
if these companies do no have adequate cash funding to support their operations  or if they encounter difficulties developing their technologies or products  our investments in these companies may be impaired and could adversely affect our financial results 
we may be subject to a higher effective tax rate that could negatively affect our financial results and financial position 
our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by several factors  many of which are outside of our control 
our future effective tax rate could be unfavorably affected by unanticipated changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates 
we are also subject to changes in tax laws or their interpretations in the various jurisdictions in which we operate which may adversely impact our effective tax rate 
in addition  our effective tax rate could be affected by the changes in accounting and tax treatment of stock based compensation 
if the carrying value of our long lived assets is not recoverable  an impairment loss must be recognized which would adversely affect our financial results 
we evaluate our long lived assets  including property and equipment  goodwill  acquired product rights and other intangible assets  whenever events or circumstances occur which indicate that these assets might be impaired 
in addition  goodwill is evaluated annually for impairment in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year  regardless of events and circumstances 
we will continue to evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of our long lived assets  and we may incur substantial impairment charges  which could adversely affect our financial results 

table of contents item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk related to fluctuations in market prices  interest rates  and foreign currency exchange rates 
we use certain derivative financial instruments to manage these risks 
all financial instruments used are in accordance with our global investment policy and global foreign exchange policy 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
we also hold equity interests in ten privately held companies 
these investments were recorded at cost  and are classified as other long term assets on the consolidated balance sheets 
these investments are inherently risky and we could lose our entire initial investment in these companies 
as of march   these investments had an aggregate carrying value of million 
interest rate sensitivity we consider investments in highly liquid instruments purchased with an original maturity of days or less to be cash equivalents 
all of our cash equivalents and short term investments are classified as available for sale securities as of the balance sheet dates 
our available for sale securities are reported at fair market value and any unrealized gains and losses are included as a component in stockholders equity in accumulated other comprehensive income loss on our consolidated balance sheet 
our cash equivalents and short term investments consist primarily of corporate securities  taxable auction rate securities  us government and government sponsored securities and money market funds

exchange rate sensitivity we conduct business in international currencies through our worldwide operations 
we believe that the use of foreign exchange forward contracts should reduce the risks that arise from conducting business in international markets 
we hedge risks associated with certain foreign currency cash  investments  receivables and payables in order to minimize the impact of changes in foreign currency fluctuations on these assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
foreign exchange forward contracts as of march  were as follows in millions resulting increase decrease in fv of foreign forward exchange contracts given x appreciation devaluation of foreign currency foreign forward notional exchange contracts amount purchased sold we believe that these foreign exchange forward contracts do not subject us to undue risk from the movement of foreign exchange rates because gains and losses on these contracts are offset by losses and gains on the underlying assets and liabilities 
all contracts have a maturity of no more than days 
gains and losses are accounted for as other income expense  net each period 
we regularly review our hedging program and may make changes as a result of this review
