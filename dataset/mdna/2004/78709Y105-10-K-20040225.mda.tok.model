item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition executive overview the company s business is highly correlated to the industrial economy 
the company is focused on increasing volume within existing geographies while managing both the mix and yield of business to achieve increased profitability 
the company s business is both labor intensive and capital intensive 
the company looks for opportunities to leverage technology  improve safety and achieve better asset utilization primarily tractors and trailers to improve cost and productivity 
the company grew year over year revenue by percent in despite a flat economy as measured by blue chip economic indicators  which estimated percent year over year growth in industrial production 
revenue growth was primarily attributable to the company s growth in less than truckload ltl tonnage which management believes reflects market share gains due to various sales initiatives 
the ltl pricing environment remained competitive and the company saw only modest year over year improvement in ltl revenue per hundredweight  one measure of yield 
incremental margins from increased tonnage volume within its existing network  along with cost and productivity improvements realized in  more than offset structural cost increases in wages  health insurance claims  public company costs and other expense items 
this resulted in an overall improvement in the company s operating ratio operating expenses divided by operating revenue of basis points to percent in the company generated cash flows from operations of million in the company improved its financial capacity to pursue opportunistic growth strategies by increasing its cash balance to million and availability under its revolving credit facility to million at december  there was no significant change in the company s outstanding indebtedness during general the following management s discussion and analysis describes the principal factors affecting the results of operations  liquidity and capital resources  as well as the critical accounting policies  of scs transportation  inc also referred to as scst 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements  which include additional information about our significant accounting policies  practices and the transactions that underlie our financial results 
scst is a leading transportation company providing regional and interregional ltl and selected truckload tl service solutions to more than  customers across the united states 
our operating subsidiaries are saia motor freight line  inc saia  based in duluth  georgia  and jevic transportation  inc jevic  based in delanco  new jersey 
on september   yellow corporation yellow completed a tax free distribution to its shareholders of percent of the outstanding common stock of scst the spin off 
our business is highly correlated to the industrial economy and is impacted by a number of other external factors including the weather  price and availability of fuel and regulation 
the key factors that affect our operating results are the volumes of shipments transported through our networks  as measured by our average daily shipments and tonnage  the prices we obtain for our services  as measured by revenue per hundredweight yield and revenue per shipment  our ability to manage our cost structure for capital expenditures and operating expenses such as salaries  wages and benefits  purchased transportation  claims and insurance expense  fuel and maintenance  and our ability to match operating costs to shifting volume levels

year ended december  revenue and volume the percent increase in consolidated revenue to million was the result of volume increases in both shipments and ltl tonnage while year over year yield was relatively flat  as pricing remains very competitive 
fuel surcharge revenue  which was percent of total revenue in  is intended to reduce the company s exposure to rising diesel prices and was higher by approximately million in saia had operating revenue of million in  an increase of percent over operating revenue of million 
saia s operating revenue excluding fuel surcharge was million in  up percent from million in saia ltl revenue per hundredweight excluding fuel surcharge a measure of yield increased percent to per hundredweight for  while ltl tonnage was up percent to million tons and ltl shipments were up percent to million shipments 
the flat yield is a combination of freight mix and competitive pricing pressure in regional markets 
management believes that saia continues to grow volume by providing high quality service for its customers and from sales initiatives in specific market segments 
saia has approximately percent of revenue that is subject to individual customer price adjustment negotiations that occur intermittently throughout the year 
the remaining percent of revenue is subject to the annual general rate increase 
on june   saia implemented a percent general rate increase for this smaller group of customers 
competitive factors  customer turnover and mix changes impact the extent to which customer rate increases are retained over time 
jevic had operating revenue of million in  a percent increase over million in jevic s operating revenue excluding fuel surcharge was million in  up percent from million in jevic revenue per hundredweight excluding fuel surcharge increased percent to per hundredweight  while tonnage was down percent to million tons and shipments were up percent to million shipments 
jevic s revenue increase is due to increased ltl volume  improved yields and increased brokerage revenue  partially offset by lower truckload volumes 
the increase in yield is primarily a result of a planned mix shift toward higher yielding ltl business 
jevic has approximately percent of revenue that is subject to individual customer price adjustment negotiations that occur intermittently throughout the year 
the remaining percent of revenue is subject to the annual general rate increase 
on june   jevic implemented a percent general rate increase on ltl business and a percent increase on truckload business for this smaller group of customers 
competitive factors  customer turnover and mix changes impact the extent to which customer rate increases are retained over time 
operating expenses and margin the percent increase in consolidated operating income reflects higher margin contribution on year over year volume increases and cost and productivity improvements partially offset by structural cost increases 
the operating ratio operating expenses divided by operating revenue was compared to in both saia and jevic continued initiatives to improve productivity and control variable costs as monthly volumes fluctuated 
these costs and productivity initiatives were partially offset by structural cost increases in wage rates  healthcare costs  casualty insurance premiums and other operating expenses 
higher fuel prices exclusive of taxes  in conjunction with volume changes  caused million of the increase in operating expenses and supplies 
these fuel price increases were more than offset by increased revenues from the fuel surcharge program 
saia had operating income of million in  compared to million in the operating ratio at saia was in compared to in despite the relatively flat yield discussed above  saia improved its operating income through continued strong cost controls and productivity initiatives that improved performance metrics in pickup and delivery  linehaul and dock areas of the company 
these improvements in labor productivity  safety initiatives and other expense reductions offset higher healthcare costs  a general wage increase in august and other wage adjustments during the year 
as of the end of  saia s wage rates were percent higher than the end of saia s overall increase in wage expense was partially offset by a decrease in purchased transportation  as saia more efficiently utilized purchased transportation in meeting its peak capacity needs 
jevic operating income was million in  up from million in jevic s revenue and yield improvement offset structural cost increases in the operating ratio at jevic was in compared to in jevic reduced its frequency rate for workers compensation claims in workers compensation expense in included million higher than anticipated costs relating to unfavorable development in the severity of open claims and the implementation of a more conservative  actuarial estimate for establishing workers compensation reserves 
this level of profitability was obtained despite a percent average wage increase over jevic increased its use of purchased transportation to fill peak capacity needs during versus the prior year  principally due to operational challenges related to a continuing shortage of drivers throughout the year 
holding company operating expenses for were million in excess of costs allocated to the operating companies 
these holding company costs included a million charge related to the appreciation of scst stock accounted for in the capital accumulation plan  a million charge for the estimated payout of our long term incentive plan related to the appreciation of scst stock  million related to reserve increases on older casualty claims and million for a consulting project 
these older casualty claims were incurred prior to our september spin off  and had been subject to a deductible buy down program with our former parent 
the increase in reserves was appropriate to estimate the increased severity potential of these claims 
the holding company had million in operating expenses in excess of costs allocated to the operating companies in  which was not indicative of post spin off operations 
other substantially all scst nonoperating expenses represent interest expense 
the increase in interest cost is a result of the company s post spin off capital structure consisting of predominantly longer term  higher fixed rate instruments versus the principally shorter term floating rate structure with the former parent company 
the consolidated effective tax rate was percent in compared to percent in the decrease in the effective tax rate is due to the tax benefit for previously unrecognized state operating loss carryforwards of million  due to changes in state tax laws enacted in  together with the reduced impact of nondeductible business expenses on higher income before income taxes 
the results include a charge of million recorded in the first quarter of from the cumulative effect of a change in accounting for goodwill 
the notes to the consolidated financial statements provide an analysis of the income tax provision and the effective tax rate and additional discussion on the charge for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting for goodwill 
working capital capital expenditures the change in working capital is predominantly the result of a higher invested cash balance and increases in accounts receivable  due to higher revenues in december versus december  offset by increases in wage and employee benefits accruals  primarily related to increased accruals for profit sharing and vacation 
restrictions on prepayment of long term fixed rate debt resulted in a higher cash and cash equivalent balance from operations in 
the capital investments primarily represent replacement of revenue equipment and investment in technology equipment and software 
year ended december  vs 
year ended december  revenue and volume revenue of million in reflected relatively flat year over year growth resulting from small volume increases and competitive pricing pressures brought on by the sluggish economy 
in addition  fuel surcharge revenue was lower by approximately million in saia had operating revenue of million in  an increase of percent over operating revenue of million 
saia s operating revenue excluding fuel surcharge was million in  up percent from million in saia ltl revenue per hundredweight excluding fuel surcharge a measure of yield decreased percent to per hundredweight for  while ltl tonnage was up percent to million tons and ltl shipments were up percent to million shipments 
the decrease in yield is a combination of freight mix and competitive pricing pressure 
saia had approximately percent of revenue that was subject to individual customer price adjustment negotiations that occur intermittently throughout the year 
the remaining percent of revenue was subject to the annual general rate increase 
on july   saia implemented a percent general rate increase for this group of customers 
competitive factors  customer turnover and mix changes impact the extent to which customer rate increases are retained over time 
jevic had operating revenue of million in  consistent with million in jevic s operating revenue excluding fuel surcharge was million in  up percent from million in jevic yield excluding fuel surcharge increased percent to per hundredweight  while tonnage was down percent to million tons and shipments were up percent to  shipments 
jevic experienced improved quarter over quarter volume comparisons in the second half of after several quarters of declining trends due to the economic downturn and competition 
the increase in yield was due to some firming in the pricing environment 
jevic had approximately percent of revenue that was subject to individual customer price adjustment negotiations that occur intermittently throughout the year 
the remaining percent of revenue was subject to the annual general rate increase 
on august   jevic implemented a percent general rate increase for this smaller group of customers 
competitive factors  customer turnover and mix changes impact the extent to which customer rate increases are retained over time 
operating expenses and margin the increase in operating income is a combination of cost management efforts  a modest increase in shipping volumes and the elimination of prior year integration charges and goodwill amortization 
the operating income in included million of costs for the integration of westex and action express into saia and goodwill amortization of approximately million that was eliminated in both saia and jevic continued initiatives to improve productivity and control variable costs as volumes fluctuated 
however  these cost reduction and productivity initiatives were partially offset by increases in wage rates total employees increased by only percent to  at year end  casualty insurance premiums and other operating expenses 
the company had a million decrease in operating expense and supplies as a result of declines in fuel prices and volume changes which reduced total year over year fuel costs 
saia had operating income of million in  compared to million in including integration charges of million 
the operating ratio at saia was in compared to in despite the decrease in yield discussed above  saia improved its operating income due to strong cost controls and improved operating efficiencies 
improvements in productivity offset higher workers compensation costs and pay increases 
saia implemented a wage increase in august  which was substantially offset by labor productivity gains and other expense reductions 
as of the end of  saia s wage rates were percent higher than the end of reflecting some changes in wage structure as well 
saia increased its use of purchased transportation to fill peak capacity needs during versus the prior year 
jevic operating income was million in  down from million in the operating ratio at jevic was in compared to in jevic s profitability benefited from the elimination of goodwill amortization of approximately million that was included in however  jevic results for also include million higher than anticipated workers compensation expense relating to unfavorable development in the severity of open claims and the implementation of a more conservative  actuarial estimate for establishing workers compensation reserves 
this level of profitability was obtained despite a percent average wage increase over the wage increase was offset by a reduction in purchased transportation as jevic more efficiently utilized purchased transportation in meeting its peak capacity needs 
other borrowings for the first nine months of and full year reflect lower rate  shorter term financing with yellow  the former parent 
however  the interest expense reflects higher average debt balances 
the consolidated effective tax rate was percent in compared to percent in the decrease in effective tax rate is due to the lessened impact of nondeductible business expenses on higher income before income taxes along with the elimination of nondeductible goodwill amortization in the results include a charge of million in the first quarter of from the cumulative effect of a change in accounting for goodwill 
the notes to the consolidated financial statements provide an analysis of the income tax provision and the effective tax rate and additional discussion on the charge for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting for goodwill 
working capital capital expenditures the change in working capital is a result of increases in accounts receivable due to higher revenues in december versus december working capital was further increased by a reduction of current maturities of long term debt and a substantial increase in cash and cash equivalents in cash from operations in was used to pay down short term variable rate debt  however  restrictions on prepayment of long term fixed rate debt resulted in a higher cash and cash equivalent balance 
the capital investments primarily represent replacement of revenue equipment and the purchase of three service facilities for saia  net of proceeds from the sale of an existing saia service facility 
outlook our business is highly correlated to the general economy  and in particular industrial production 
however  in  we achieved revenue growth and profitability improvement despite a relatively flat industrial economic environment 
for  we anticipate an improving economy that will allow continued growth in our existing geography and subsidiary specific profit improvement initiatives  focused on cost management  productivity and asset utilization that will help offset anticipated structural cost increases in wages and healthcare claims 
we also believe an improving economy will provide the opportunity for improved pricing and yield management 
our priorities in include a continued focus on providing top quality service  improving safety performance and investing in management and infrastructure for future growth 
actual results for will depend upon a number of factors  including the timing  speed and magnitude of the economic recovery  our ability to match capacity with shifting volume levels  competitive pricing pressures  insurance claims and integration risks

financial condition scst liquidity needs arise primarily from capital investment in new equipment  land and structures and information technology  as well as funding working capital requirements 
in connection with the spin off  scst issued million in senior notes under a million master shelf agreement with prudential investment management  inc and certain of its affiliates 
scst also entered into a million agented revolving credit agreement the credit agreement with bank of oklahoma  na  as agent  which has subsequently been increased to million 
proceeds from the senior notes and a portion of the credit agreement were used for payments due yellow discussed below 
scst had approximately million outstanding under line of credit agreements with yellow immediately prior to the spin off  of which million was repaid to yellow under the terms of the spin off 
the remaining million reduction in the line of credit with yellow was a capital contribution to scst from yellow 
the company s long term debt at december  includes million in senior notes that are unsecured with a fixed interest rate of percent and an average maturity of eight years 
payments due under the senior notes are interest only until june  and at that time semi annual principal payments begin  with the final payment due december under the terms of the senior notes  scst must maintain several financial covenants including a maximum ratio of total indebtedness to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  amortization and rent ebitdar  a minimum interest coverage ratio and a minimum tangible net worth  among others 
at december   scst was in compliance with these covenants 
in addition  scst has third party borrowings of approximately million in subordinated notes 
on november   the credit agreement was amended to million to increase the company s capacity for letters of credit in support of self insured retentions for casualty and workers compensation claims without diminishing its borrowing capacity 
the amended million credit agreement is unsecured with an interest rate based on libor or prime at the company s option  plus an applicable spread  in certain instances  and matures in september the availability under the credit agreement is limited to scst s qualified receivables as defined in the credit agreement 
at december   scst had no borrowings under the credit agreement  million in letters of credit outstanding under the credit agreement and availability of million based on scst s qualified receivables 
the available portion of the credit agreement may be used for future capital expenditures  working capital and letter of credit requirements as needed 
under the terms of the credit agreement  scst must maintain several financial covenants including a maximum ratio of total indebtedness to ebitdar  a minimum interest coverage ratio and a minimum tangible net worth  among others 
at december   scst was in compliance with these covenants 
at december  yellow provided on behalf of scst approximately million in outstanding surety bonds 
these bonds  issued by insurance companies  serve as collateral support primarily for workers compensation programs in states where scst is self insured 
the price and availability of surety bonds fluctuates over time with general conditions in the insurance market 
a lack of availability of surety bonds could result in the need for yellow to issue additional letters of credit 
at december   yellow has provided on behalf of scst million in outstanding letters of credit under historical insurance programs  which saia participated with other yellow affiliates 
the collateral support by yellow is expected to remain in place until claims for these prior years are closed 
under the master separation and distribution agreement entered into in connection with the spin off  scst pays yellow s actual cost of the collateral through october after which time it is cost plus basis points through october projected net capital expenditures for are approximately million  an approximately million increase from net capital expenditures 
approximately million of the capital budget was committed at december  net capital expenditures pertain primarily to replacement of revenue equipment at both subsidiaries and additional investments in information technology  land and structures 
the company has historically generated cash flows from operations that have funded its capital expenditure requirements 
cash flows from operations were million for the year ended december   which were million more than net capital expenditures 
the timing of capital expenditures can largely be managed around the seasonal working capital requirements of the company 
however  the company has adequate sources of capital to meet short term liquidity needs through its cash million at december  and availability under its revolving credit facility million at december  
in addition to these sources of liquidity  the company has million under its long term debt facilities  which is available to fund other longer term strategic investments 
the february  acquisition of clark bros 
transfer  inc utilized approximately million in cash 
future operating cash flows are primarily dependent upon the company s profitability and its ability to manage its working capital requirements  primarily accounts receivable  accounts payable and wage and benefit accruals 
the company has the ability to adjust its capital expenditures in the event of a shortfall in anticipated operating cash flows 
the company believes its current capital structure and availability under its borrowing facilities along with anticipated cash flows from future operations will be sufficient to fund planned replacements of revenue equipment and investments in technology 
additional sources of capital may be needed to fund future long term strategic growth initiatives 
actual net capital expenditures are summarized in the following table in millions year ended land and structures additions sales revenue equipment  net technology and other total in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  our operating leases are not recorded in our balance sheet  however  the minimum lease payments related to these leases are disclosed in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this form k  and in contractual cash obligations table below 
in addition to the principal amounts disclosed in the tables below  the company has interest obligations of approximately million for and decreasing for each year thereafter  based on borrowings outstanding at december  contractual cash obligations the following tables set forth a summary of our contractual cash obligations and other commercial commitments as of december  in millions payments due by year thereafter total contractual cash obligations long term debt obligations revolving line of credit long term debt operating leases purchase obligations total contractual obligations see note to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements in this form k

amount of commitment expiration by year thereafter total other commercial commitments available line of credit letters of credit surety bonds total commercial commitments critical accounting policies and estimates scst makes estimates and assumptions in preparing the consolidated financial statements that affect reported amounts and disclosures therein 
in the opinion of management  the accounting policies that generally have the most significant impact on the financial position and results of operations of scst include claims and insurance accruals 
scst has self insured retention limits generally ranging from  to  per claim for medical  workers compensation  auto liability  casualty and cargo claims 
for the current policy year  the company has an aggregate exposure limited to an additional  above its  per claim deductible under its auto liability program 
the liabilities associated with the risk retained by scst are estimated in part based on historical experience  third party actuarial analysis  demographics  nature and severity  past experience and other assumptions 
the liabilities for self funded retention are included in claims and insurance reserves based on claims incurred  with liabilities for unsettled claims and claims incurred but not yet reported being actuarially determined with respect to workers compensation claims and with respect to all other liabilities  estimated based on management s evaluation of the nature and severity of individual claims and historical experience 
however  these estimated accruals could be significantly affected if the actual costs of scst differ from these assumptions 
these estimates tend to be historically accurate over time  however  assumptions regarding severity of claims  medical cost inflation  as well as specific case facts can create short term volatility in estimates 
revenue recognition and related allowances 
revenue is recognized on a percentage of completion basis for shipments in transit while expenses are recognized as incurred 
in addition  estimates included in the recognition of revenue and accounts receivable include estimates of shipments in transit and estimates of future adjustments to revenue and accounts receivable for billing adjustments and collectibility 
revenue is recognized in a systematic process whereby estimates of shipments in transit are based upon actual shipments picked up  scheduled day of delivery and current trend in average rates charged to customers 
since the cycle for pick up and delivery of shipments is generally days  typically less than percent of a total month s revenue is in transit at the end of any month 
estimates for credit losses and billing adjustments are based upon historical experience of credit losses  adjustments processed and trends of collections 
billing adjustments are primarily made for discounts and billing corrections 
these estimates are continuously evaluated and updated  however  changes in economic conditions  pricing arrangements and other factors can significantly impact these estimates 
depreciation and capitalization of assets 
under the scst accounting policy for property and equipment  management establishes appropriate depreciable lives and salvage values for scst s revenue equipment tractors and trailers based on their estimated useful lives and estimated fair values to be received when the equipment is sold or traded in 
these estimates are continuously evaluated and updated when circumstances warrant 
however  actual depreciation and salvage values could differ from these assumptions based on market conditions and other factors 
recovery of goodwill 
annually  scst assesses goodwill impairment by applying a fair value based test 
this fair value based test involves assumptions regarding the long term future performance of the operating subsidiaries of scst  fair value of the assets and liabilities of scst  cost of capital rates and other assumptions 
however  actual recovery of remaining goodwill could differ from these assumptions based on market conditions and other factors 
in the event remaining goodwill is determined to be impaired a charge to earnings would be required 
these accounting policies  and others  are described in further detail in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to adopt accounting policies and make significant judgments and estimates to develop amounts reflected and disclosed in the financial statements 
in many cases  there are alternative policies or estimation techniques that could be used 
we maintain a thorough process to review the application of our accounting policies and to evaluate the appropriateness of the many estimates that are required to prepare the financial statements 
however  even under optimal circumstances  estimates routinely require adjustment based on changing circumstances and the receipt of new or better information

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk scst is exposed to a variety of market risks  including the effects of interest rates and fuel prices 
the detail of scst s debt structure is more fully described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
to mitigate our risk to rising fuel prices  saia and jevic each have implemented fuel surcharge programs 
these programs are well established within the industry and customer acceptance of fuel surcharges remains high 
since the amount of fuel surcharge is based on average national diesel fuel prices and is reset weekly  exposure of scst to fuel price volatility is significantly reduced
