executive summary discontinued operations czech republic and the uncitral arbitration l on may   we received us million from the czech republic government in final settlement following our uncitral arbitration 
this receipt concludes our dispute with regard to our former czech republic operations and should not be deemed to be recurring 
l on june   our board of directors decided to withdraw from czech operations and on october  we sold our participation interest in cnts  our czech operating company  for us million  million of which has been received to date 
the remainder is due by july and is fully secured 
l on february  we arrived at a negotiated settlement with the dutch tax authorities on the taxability of the uncitral award 
under this agreement  we have agreed to pay total tax of us million 
we have paid an initial us million and will ensure that taxes payable on profits arising in the netherlands are at least us million per year for the years and us million for l these events bring certainty to the amount received following our exit from the czech republic market 
management changes l on february   michael n 
garin was appointed chief executive officer  succeeding fred t 
klinkhammer who continues to serve as vice chairman 
continuing operations the following table provides a summary of our consolidated results for each of the three years to december  page for the year ended december  us s movement movement net revenues operating income loss before corporate expenses operating income loss net income loss from continuing operations net income loss the principal events of are as follows l we redeemed or repurchased all of our corporate debt  including our us senior notes us million and euro senior notes euro million  approximately us million  our outstanding debt and accrued interest with goldentree asset management in the sum of us million  and our outstanding debt and accrued interest to czech sporitelna bank for a sum of kc million approximately us million 
l in  each of our operating segments achieved  for the first time  a segment ebitda operating margin of greater than segment ebitda is defined and reconciled t o our consolidated us gaap results in part ii  item  note  segment data 
l we increased our holding in our slovenian operations to 
l we gained direct control of most of the principal broadcasting licenses in our romanian operations 
l as at december  we had us million of unrestricted cash 
future trends l during our board  after extensive discussions with both management and outside advisors  agreed a strategic plan focusing on expansion through acquisition of additional shares in our existing stations and of appropriate additional businesses in new markets 
it was decided that our geographic focus would remain in central and eastern europe  and that our core business would be television 
we are also prepared to consider relevant opportunities in related media 
l three categories of development are currently under consideration l acquisition of additional ownership in our present operations  which is regarded as the strategy with the lea st risk due to our knowledge of the value of these operations  l acquisition of one or more established businesses in the balkans  in particular states of the former yugoslavia using the expertise of our successful slovenian management team  and l acquisition of a broadcaster in one of the substantially larger markets of central or eastern europe  which may give rise to a significant step change in the scale of our business 
l in the second half of we conducted country and in some cases station specific research throughout the central and eastern european market to assess possible acquisition opportunities 
the general review is now complete and management is now assessing more specific opportunities 
l this strategy may result in the acquisition of a significant business in a major central or eastern european market 
such an acquisition would likely require funding beyond our current available resources 
this could be achieved through funds raised in the form of debt or a public offering 
we expect to be able to raise the necessary funding through a debt offering  but would consider partial funding through an equity offering if the share price rose to a level that would make this attractive 
page ii 
general market information markets our revenue generating operations are located in central and eastern europe  namely romania  the slovak republic  slovenia and ukraine 
revenues primarily result from the sale of advertising time 
we  like other television operators  experience seasonality  with advertising sales tending to be lowest during the third quarter of each calendar year due to the summer holiday period typically july and august  and highest during the fourth quarter of each calendar year 
see part ii  item  quarterly results and seasonality for further discussion 
potential for market growth the markets in which we operate are subject to higher levels of political and economic uncertainty than most western european markets  but we believe the lower level of economic development implies a greater potential for future growth 
zenith optimedia have published the following projections for the development of television advertising spending per capita for a select group of eastern and western european markets 
although this projection does not include our markets  the projection of eastern european growth may be indicative of the potential for our markets 
as a comparative we have added our historic segment net revenue for the years according to the same scale 
indexed to western europe average eastern europe average cme segment net revenue a a a a a a a a a f f a f f a f f f f f f f f source zenith optimedia tv in western europe and tv in eastern europe 
this data should be used for indicative comparative purposes only 
it may not be an accurate forecast for the markets or region 
a actuals f forecast page television advertising markets there is no objective source for reliable information on the size of television advertising expenditures in our markets 
the following table sets out our estimates of the development of these expenditures by market in us millions 
country us millions romania slovak republic slovenia ukraine regulation and legal environment the countries in which we operate have economic and legal systems  local standards of corporate governance and business practices which continue to develop 
we do not anticipate that the rate of market development will be constant in any market 
government policies could be altered significantly  especially in the event of a change in leadership  social or political disruption or unforeseen circumstances affecting economic  political or social life 
this may materially affect our results  either negatively or positively 
european union expansion slovenia and the slovak republic have been approved for entry into the european union eu in may it is currently anticipated that romania will be admitted sometime after all countries joining the eu become subject to eu legislation and the ongoing progress towards eu entry reduces the political risk of operating in these emerging markets 
the reduction in political risk factors may encourage increased foreign investment that will be supportive of economic growth 
eu accession may also cause a period of local economic uncertainty as the adoption of eu rules affect industry and employment

analysis of segment results overview we manage our business on a geographic basis  and review the performance of each geographic segment using data that reflects of operating and license company results 
our segments are comprised of romania  slovak republic  slovenia and ukraine 
we evaluate the performance of our segments based on segment net revenues  segment ebitda  segment ebitda margin and segment broadcast cash flow 
all segment data includes sts and markiza our operating and license companies in the slovak republic and studio our license company in ukraine  neither of which is consolidated under us gaap 
our key measure of the efficiency of our segments is their ebitda margin 
we define segment ebitda margin as segment ebitda as a percentage of segment net revenue 
we believe a segment ebitda margin can be achieved and sustained by each station 
page our assets and liabilities are managed centrally and are reported internally in the same manner as the consolidated financial statements  thus no additional information is provided 
segment ebitda is determined as segment net income loss  which includes costs for program rights amortization  before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization of intangible assets 
items that are not allocated to our segments for purposes of evaluating their performance  and therefore are not included in segment ebitda  include l expenses presented as corporate expenses in our consolidated statements of operations ie  corporate operating costs  net arbitration related costs proceeds  stock based compensation and amortization of goodwill  l changes in the fair value of derivatives  l foreign currency exchange gains and losses  l certain unusual or infrequent items eg  gains and losses impairments on assets or investments 
segment ebitda is also used as a target for management bonuses 
acquired program costs are a significant proportion of our tv stations cost structure and cash flow 
we use segment broadcast cash flow to help us monitor these costs 
segment broadcast cash flow is determined as segment ebitda excluding charges for program rights amortization but reduced by cash paid for program rights 
when compared with segment ebitda  this indicates to management whether the cash investment in program rights in the period was greater or less than the accounting charge for program rights amortization 
if the cash investment is greater ie if segment broadcast cash flow is lower than segment ebitda  this provides a signal to management that future program rights amortization costs may increase 
segment broadcast cash flow takes no account of possible changes in the quanti ty of programming rights held for future broadcast 
for a full reconciliation of our segment net revenues  segment ebitda and segment broadcast cash flow by operation to our consolidated us gaap results for the years ended december   and see part ii  item  note  segment data 
a summary of our total segment net revenues  segment ebitda  segment ebitda margin and segment broadcast cash flow is as follows

pro tv and acasa a cable channel are second and fifth in the market with national all day audience shares in of and  respectively 
the major competitors for audience share are the state channel tvr with and antena  an independent channel  with 
tvr has a higher share because it is the only significant broadcaster with coverage across the majority of the country 
advertisers  however  evaluate audience share within a network s coverage area and by this measure pro tv ranks first and acasa fourth of seven stations ranked in all day audience 
both of our stations cover the important urban markets 
during our romanian operation plans to launch a second cable channel 
l net revenues for increased by over due to several factors 
approximately us million was due to the growth in the television advertising market 
strong programming increased our combined station prime time national audience share to in from in  enabling us to raise our advertising prices 
the balance of the increase in net revenues  approximately us million  was due to i a consolidation of our sales functions  eliminating internal competition and allowing us to reduce our average discount rates and ii the conversion of a prior related party barter agreement to a normal transaction structure 
net revenues for increased by over  reflecting stable market share in a growing market 
l ebitda for increased by over  delivering an ebitda margin of  a significant increase on the margin delivered in the prior year 
costs charged in arriving at ebitda grew by us million or over the cost of programming in increased by us million or over primarily due to a increase in the charge for amortization of acquired programming rights and an increase of in self production costs 
the increase in amortization of acquired programming was the result of a combination of planned investment in stronger programming  including the sports programming that was previously subject to a barter agreement  and an increase in the price of acquired programming 
operating costs and expenses in grew by us million over primarily as a result of an increase in salary costs 
this increase was caused by i a change in domestic legislation with effect from january which inc reased employers liability for social security charges  ii salary increases that had been deferred for two years  and iii bonus incentive payments reflecting outstanding performance 
ebitda for grew by us million compared to in we recognized a charge of us million in respect of bad debts 
apart from this charge for bad debts  costs charged in arriving at ebitda operating costs for increased by only over  primarily due to higher amortization of programming rights  partly offset by savings in production  broadcast operation and staff costs 
page l broadcast cash flow for all years to was lower than ebitda by us million  us million and us million  respectively 
this indicates that there has been continued significant investment in programming over and above the syndication charged for these years 
l on our consolidated balance sheet as at december   our provision in respect of romanian bad debts was us million 
since that time we have taken significant measures to reduce the days outstanding on romanian receivables 
as at december   of the romanian subsidiaries accounts receivable balance was more than days old and was in the day category  compared to more than days and in the day category as at december  accordingly  us million of our total romanian bad debt provision was released in the fourth quarter of resulting in a total decrease to our total romanian bad debt provision of us million in the twelve months ended december  on our consolidated balance sheet at december   the total pr ovision for bad debt is us million us million  of which our provision for romanian bad debts is us million us million 
there are no significant issues with regard to the collection of debts in our other operations 
b slovak republic segment financial information for the years ended december  us s movement movement slovak republic net revenues slovak republic ebitda slovak republic ebitda margin slovak republic broadcast cash flow market background we estimate that the television advertising market in grew by approximately to in local currency terms driven by local inflation 
the short term effect of eu accession in may is unclear 
measured in us dollars the television advertising market grew by an estimated to in due to the weakening of the us dollar in the period 
markiza tv is the premier broadcaster with a national all day national audience share in of  followed by stv  a state channel  with 
the share of tv joj  the only other significant independent  grew from in to in we expect peoplemeters  an instrument for measuring audience viewing levels  to be introduced during traditionally  the introduction of peoplemeters results in some reduction to the measured share of premier broadcasters 
l net revenues grew by in compared to approximately us million of this growth was due to the weaker us dollar 
local currency revenue growth in was due to the expanding television advertising market  and an increase in our rate card the quoted price of advertising slots early in net revenues grew in compared to  again largely due to a weakening us dollar 
local currency revenues grew in compared to  in line with market growth 
page l ebitda grew in compared to and the ebitda margin grew to in from in local currency ebitda growth was in compared to costs charged in arriving at ebitda in include a us million provision for a shareholder disagreement 
excluding this provision  local currency operating costs were flat year on year reflecting improved cost control 
ebitda in increased by over  with underlying local currency growth of against the ebitda margin increased from in to in l broadcast cash flow has been greater than ebitda in the years to  although the difference has narrowed in each period  indicating growing correlation between the cash investment in programming and the charge for programming amortization 
c slovenia segment financial information for the years ended december  us s movement movement slovenian net revenues slovenian ebitda slovenian ebitda margin slovenian broadcast cash flow market background slovenia is our most prosperous market with a per capita gdp in of  we estimate that in the television advertising market fell in local currency terms by between and from levels  which benefited from the participation of the slovenian national team in the soccer world cup 
the market also decreased slightly due to reduced activity of certain large advertisers 
we expect the market to revert to slow growth in  although the short term effect of eu accession in may is unclear 
measured in us dollars the slovenian television advertising market grew by an estimated to in compared to due to the weakening of the us dollar 
pop tv and kanal a were ranked first and fourth of four stations ranked in the market with national all day audience shares of and  but were ranked first and third in prime time  respectively 
the main competitors are state broadcasters slo and slo with national all day audience shares of with and  respectively 
l net revenues increased by in over  due solely to the weaker us dollar which contributed approximately us million 
local currency revenues decreased by in compared to  when additional revenues were generated by the soccer world cup 
without the effect of the soccer world cup our underlying local currency net revenues would have shown a small increase 
this performance was due to our increasing focus on the prime time schedule 
net revenues for grew by over in us dollar terms and by in local currency terms principally due to the soccer world cup  when small domestic businesses advertised on tele vision for the first time  and to a higher rate card the quoted price of advertising spots enabling us to increase our share of an otherwise flat local television advertising market 
l ebitda grew by in over to deliver an ebitda margin of in compared to in this reflects the local management s ability to recognise the need for cost control measures and to implement these measures in the face of current market conditions 
in  operating costs grew by over when measured in us dollars but fell by against in local currency terms 
savings were recognized principally in programming costs  assisted by the elimination of one off production costs associated with the soccer world cup 
page ebitda grew by in over due to effective cost control measures limiting cost base growth to including the one off soccer world cup costs compared to in consequence the ebitda margin in increased to  an improvement of over l broadcast cash flow is broadly in line with ebitda over the three years to this indicates a similarity over time between the cash invested in programming and the related amortization charge  albeit with small differences in individual years due to timing 
d ukraine segment financial information for the years ended december  us s movement movement ukrainian net revenues ukrainian ebitda ukrainian ebitda margin ukrainian broadcast cash flow market background ukraine has the highest population million of all the markets in which we operate  but is the least economically advanced  with a per capita gdp in of only us following some years of hyper growth  the television advertising market growth slowed in to an estimated  and we currently anticipate that growth will continue at similar levels in studio has a license to broadcast for only hours per day and is the number two station of stations ranked with an all day audience share of in its coverage area 
the number one position is held by inter which holds a license permitting it to broadcast for hours per day 
inter had an all day audience share of in studio s prime time audience share is compared to inter s 
novi kanal is the number three station with a all day audience share and generates effective national coverage through a collection of regional licences 
l net revenues grew by in over  less than our estimate of television advertising market growth  due to a reduction in prime time audience share from to 
net revenues for grew by over due to a combination of a strong market and increased russian programming which generated the highest ratings for l ebitda for grew by over to us million  delivering an ebitda margin of for  in line with costs charged in arriving at ebitda grew by us million in compared to  an increase of in line with revenue growth 
this included a us million increase in the cost of programming  of which approximately us million related to a reallocation of employment costs from station operating costs and expenses in order to create a more accurate reflection of local production costs 
the balance related primarily to the increased cost of russian programming  the price of which has grown by approximately year on year 
russian programming continues to generate the highest ratings and is essential to maintain strong prime time ratings 
this increase was partly offset by a reduction in the provision charged for withholding tax 
ebitda grew by in compared to to deliver an ebitda margin of compared to in this growth was principally due to revenue growth outperforming the increase in costs charged in arriving at ebitda 
the cost increase was principally due to a change in programming strategy which shifted emphasis from western mainly us programming to more expensive  but more popular russia programming  as well as to the provision for withholding tax referred to above 
page l broadcast cash flows for was in line with ebitda  in there was an additional us million invested in programming over and above the syndication charge for the year  and the investment in programming for was us million less than the syndication charged 
these fluctuations are caused by timing differences between cash investment and utilisation as indicated by the amortisation charge in a rapidly developing market where the cost of programming is rising

no such fair valuation was recorded in gain on sale of subsidiaries a gain on the sale of a subsidiary of us million was realized in  relating to the sale of video vision  a romanian post production company 
foreign currency gain loss the foreign currency exchange loss in is a result of a significant weakening of the us dollar during against the euro and the czech koruna

the euro denominated senior notes and the czech koruna denominated debt were retired in august and may  respectively when the us dollar was particularly weak against these currencies 
the foreign currency exchange loss in arose for the same reasons as in following a weakening of the us dollar in page provision for income taxes provision for income taxes was us million in and in provision for income taxes was us million in compared to us million in  primarily as a result of a provision being made in respect of dutch tax on continuing operations in minority interest in loss income of consolidated subsidiaries minority interest in the income of consolidated subsidiaries was us million in compared to us million in and a loss of us million in under us gaap the controlling shareholder normally consolidates all losses on the basis that other shareholders cannot be compelled to and are not expected to be able to fund the company s losses

sources and uses of ca sh our ongoing source of cash in the operating stations is primarily the receipt of payments from advertisers and advertising agencies 
this may be augmented from time to time by local borrowing 
surplus cash generated in this manner  after funding the ongoing station operations  may be remitted to corporate  or to other shareholders where appropriate 
surplus cash is remitted to corporate in the form of debt interest payments and capital repayments  dividends  and other distributions and loans from our subsidiaries and equity accounted investments 
the laws under which our operating companies are organized provide generally that dividends may be declared by the partners or shareholders out of yearly profits subject to the maintenance of registered capital  required reserves and after the recovery of accumulated losses 
in the case of our dutch and netherlands antilles subsidiaries  our voting power is sufficient to compel the making of distributions 
in the case of pro tv  distributions may be paid from the profits of pro tv subject to a reserve of of annual profits until the aggregate reserves equal of pro tv s registered capital 
a majority vote can compel pro tv to make distributions 
in slovenia distributions may be paid from the profits of pro plus  subject to a reserve equal to of registered capital being established from accumulated profits 
in the case of sts  distributions may be paid from net profits subject to an initial reserve requirement of of net profits until the reserve fund equals of registered capital 
subsequently  the reserve requirement is equal to of net profits until the reserve fund equals of registered capital 
we cannot compel the distributions of dividends by sts 
our voting power in the studio group is sufficient to compel the distribution of dividends 
to date  sts is the only operating entity to pay dividends 
our operations in romania and the ukraine are not currently able to pay us dividends  and generally remit cash to corporate by means of loan or debt repayment

cash outlook our future cash needs  over and above working capital requirements  will depend on our overall financial performance and our future acquisition and development decisions 
we believe that  taken together  our current cash balances  internally generated cash flow and local financing of broadcast operations should result in us hav ing adequate cash resources to meet our debt service and other financial obligations for the next months 
during our board  after extensive discussions with both management and outside advisors  agreed a strategic plan focusing on expansion through acquisition of additional shares in our existing stations and of appropriate additional businesses in new markets 
this strategy may result in the acquisition of a significant business in a major central or eastern european market 
such an acquisition would likely require funding beyond our current available resources 
this could be achieved through funds raised in the form of debt or a public offering 
we expect to be able to raise the necessary funding through a debt offering  but would consider partial funding through an equity offering if the share price rose to a level that would make this attractive

there is currently no date set for this hearing

critical accounting policies and estimates our accounting policies affecting our financial condition and results of operations are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements that are included in part ii  item of this form k 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make judgements in selecting appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates  which inherently contain some degree of uncertainty 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis of making judgements about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgements and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements program rights cost programming acquired from third parties forms an important component of our station schedules 
these costs are amortized on a systematic basis over their expected useful lives 
we have determined that the life and value of the asset is dependent upon the airing of the program 
feature films are amortized by for the first run and for the second run  all other programming is amortized by on a first showing 
acquisition and program usage is dependent upon market conditions 
we periodically review the appropriateness of our amortization policy for program costs  including the expected lives assigned to our programs 
if conditions warrant a change in the policy  we would amend the policy which could have an impact on our amortization charge within the statement of operations 
valuation of intangible assets we have acquired significant intangible assets that are valued and recorded 
intangible assets include goodwill  broadcast license costs license acquistion costs and trademarks  all of which are not amortized under fas we assess the carrying value of these assets if events or changes in circumstances indicate that such carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important  which could trigger an impairment review are under performance of projected results  changes in the manner of utilization of the asset  and negative market condition or economic trends 
if it is determined that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable  we perform an impairment analysis based on discounted cash flows 
when an impairment review is undertaken  certain variables are utilized in determining cash flows discount rates  terminal values  the number of years on which to base the cash flow projections as well as the assumptions and estimates used to determine the cash inflows and outflows 
we believe that our assumptions are appropriate 
bad debt provision we maintain a bad debt provision for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate additional allowances may be required in future periods 
we periodically review the accounts receivable balances and our historical bad debt  customer concentrations  customer creditworthiness when evaluating the adequacy of our provision 
deferred tax we recognise deferred tax assets if it is probable that sufficient taxable income will be available in future periods against which the temporary differences and unused tax losses can be utilised 
we have considered future taxable income and tax planning strategies in assessing whether deferred tax assets should be recognised

related party matters overview there is a limited local market for many specialist tv services in the countries in which we operate  many of which are provided by parties known to be connected to our local shareholders 
therefore  we cannot consider it possible to provide an assurance that fair market prices and payment terms are always in place for such services 
we continue to review all of these arrangements 
a related party is one in which we have determined that a shareholder has direct control or influence  a connected party is one in which we are aware of a family or business connection to a shareholder 
romania we  mr sarbu and mr tiriac are all shareholders in mpi the operating company  pro tv and media pro the license holding companies 
the cooperation agreement between us  mr sarbu and mr tiriac requires that related party transactions be approved by the shareholders 
the approval process for related party transactions was exercised verbally for the period from to late beginning in formal  written records have been required and reviews of related party transactions have been performed 
approval of these has been made at local mpi board and shareholder meetings 
mr sarbu  the general director and minority shareholder in our romanian operations  has extensive business interests in romania  particularly in the media sector 
due to the limited local market for many specialist television services in romania  companies related or connected to mr sarbu were often the sole or primary supplier of the services that mpi required  and much of the romanian business was developed based on services supplied by mr sarbu s companies 
following a review of related party transactions  in  the shareholders of mpi decided to review related party transactions  bring services in house where possible and place additional controls over the remaining related party transactions 
description of related party transactions in romania in we loaned inter media srl us million to purchase an interest in the building in which mpi operates 
at the time of the loan mr 
sarbu owned inter media srl and we believe he continues to have an economic interest in such company 
the interest in the building was to be sold to mpi at a fair market valuation that was to be determined 
in an independent valuation of the building was obtained by us 
this valuation was substantially less than mr 
sarbu s view of the building s value and the transaction could not therefore be concluded 
mpi still operates from the building under a lease agreement 
the original loan amount plus interest remains outstanding and we are currently negotiating its repayment with mr 
sarbu 
in addition to the above loan  there is an additional loan due that has been guaranteed by mr sarbu and one of his companies  media pro pictures 
this loan was originally granted to video vision international  a romanian subsidiary we disposed of in  of which mr sarbu was the other shareholder 
the loan was originally given for working capital 
as at december   there was an outstanding balance of us million 
the total purchases from companies related or connected with mr sarbu in were approximately us million us million  us million 
these were for mainly for various production and administrative related services 
the total sales to companies related or connected with mr sarbu in were approximately us million us million  us million 
at december   companies connected to mr sarbu had an outstanding balance due to us of us million us million 
at december   companies related to mr sarbu had an outstanding balance due to us of us million us million 
at december   companies related to mr sarbu had an outstanding balance due to them of us million us millio n 
page in the past  companies in which mr sarbu had interests paid mpi more slowly than independent third parties  while amounts due to his companies were paid promptly by mpi 
this combination resulted in a decrease in cashflow to mpi to the detriment of its stockholders  including ourselves 
throughout mpi has brought the timing of cashflow in line 
further  in december a significant offset of related party receivables and payables was achieved  significantly reducing outstanding net balances  most notably old debt 
in march  as a result of the increasing amount and age of the related and connected party receivables in romania  our audit committee commissioned an investigation into the related party transactions occurring in its romanian operations 
a report was provided to the committee by independent accountants not our auditors which confirmed that a number of transactions entered into by our subsidiaries in romania with parties related to mr sarbu had not been properly approved by the shareholders of the subsidiaries 
further  related party receivables of the subsidiaries were significantly in arrears while related party payables were paid promptly 
additionally  a number of transactions not declared as related party transactions may have been related party transactions 
as a result the committe e recommended strict controls to prevent future occurrences of any such irregularities and to improve the collection of receivables  credit management and authorization of related party transactions in the romanian operations 
to implement this  the shareholders of mpi have unanimously approved resolutions requiring a higher level of review and control over related party transactions  credit control and collection of receivables 
during  we did not include any amount us million for related party barter in exchange for programming rights from mr sarbu s companies in our revenue and expenses for the romanian operations 
at the end of  our year end internal audit process detected that some advertising time had been bartered to businesses related to mr 
sarbu  in excess of amounts that had been approved 
the most significant barter arrangement was with a programming provider related to mr 
sarbu which sold advertising spots in exchange for programming 
we do not believe we experienced any monetary loss as a result of this unauthorized barter because otherwise unsold time was so bartered 
this sale of airtime was brought in house from january  and since then airtime spot sales have been made directly to clients rather than bartered for programming supplied by mr 
sarbu s company 
airtime is measured in grps gross rating points the percentage of all possible viewers watching the show in any second period  so that rating point represents of all possible viewers watching a show 
our controls showed that approximately  unapproved grps were transferred in excess of the contractual agreement 
 grps are available in a year if we sell all theoretically available airtime at our romanian stations 
we sell approximately  grps per year at our romanian stations 
since unsold advertising time was also available in this period  it is not possible to make a realistic estimate of the monetary value of the unapproved airtime 
it is difficult to determine whether we received fair value in these transactions due to the limited local market for many specialist television services in romania and the fact that many of the companies providing these services are related or connected to mr 
sarbu 
since the value of this barter is shown as both revenue and expense in our financial statements and the impact on our net income is zero  we do not believe the related party nature of these barter transactions has had a material effect on our financial statements 
our internal controls detected these unauthorized related party transactions  and further review has led us to implement new internal controls at mpi and our head office to discourage repetition of related party barter by ensuring discovery in a more timely manner 
these include improved local controls over the reconciliation of invoicing to the actual advertising spots shown on tv as well as a quarterly review by our corporate staff of advertising sales figures to ensure that all airtime is correctly invoiced 
however  no control can prevent an executive manager from exceeding his authority 
page these unapproved related party barter transactions were in violation of the co operation agreement and mr sarbu s employment agreement 
mr 
sarbu has been informed  orally and in writing  and through a board resolution passed by the local mpi board  that disciplinary action will result from further unauthorized related party transactions 
we believe that the local board resolution has impressed upon mr 
sarbu the importance of strict and formal adherence to our internal control framework 
the outstanding receivable balance between our romanian operations and connected parties was us million at december  us million of which us million is over days old us million 
the outstanding receivable balance between our romanian operations and related parties at december  was us million us million of which us million is over days old us million 
accounting for related party barter in romania the romanian operations undertake a small number of mpi board approved related party barter arrangements 
under us gaap these are accounted for at fair market value 
due to the limited local market for many specialist television services in romania  and as many of the companies providing these services are related parties  we have devised an appropriate method of valuation for the receipt of programming 
this methodology takes into account the average cost per hour of acquired programming to pro tv as well as the time at which the bartered programming is shown 
slovenia in connection with the restructuring of our slovenian operations  we have entered into a put call arrangement with the general director of pro plus  marijan jurenec  who owns the remaining voting and profits interests of pro plus the operating company

given the recent excellent performance of sts  the other local shareholders have now suggested that they are also entitled to fees for their services to sts 
we dispute this issue  but realize that their claim may have some merit and have made a provision of us million in our consolidated statement of operations representing our share of a potential us million charge against sts
