item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction fiscal was another record year for the company in terms of both sales and earnings 
net sales for fiscal were million compared to million for fiscal  an increase of million  or 
the net sales growth was accomplished through double digit increases throughout all major distribution channels 
the sales growth experienced in fiscal follows a increase in fiscal net income increased to million  an increase of million  or  over net income in fiscal the company believes that a portion of the increase in net sales for fiscal is attributable to the growing awareness of the health benefits of nuts and the current trend toward a low carbohydrate high protein diet 
the company continually reviews nut consumption data prepared by various trade associations  marketing organizations and the usda to monitor trends in the business 
crop estimates are also reviewed to determine the available supply of various nuts  although due to the susceptibility of crops to wide year over year variations  this information is typically only useful for short periods of time 
business strategies are developed through analysis of this consumption and supply information 
the company s gross profit margin was in fiscal  a slight improvement over the achieved in fiscal improvements in gross profit margin  realized due primarily to higher unit volume  were offset by significantly higher commodity costs 
selling and administrative expenses decreased to of net sales for fiscal compared to of net sales for fiscal this decrease was due primarily to the fixed nature of certain of these expenses in relation to a larger revenue base 
the increase of million in selling and administrative expenses for fiscal compared to fiscal was due primarily to increases in freight and broker commissions  directly related to the increase in net sales  and increases in incentive compensation due to improved operating results 
in april  the company completed an underwritten stock offering of an additional  shares of common stock at a price of per share  or after the underwriting discount 
total net proceeds to the company were approximately million  after deducting offering costs 
approximately million of the net proceeds were used to prepay long term debt  and the remaining million was used to reduce outstanding balances under the company s bank credit facility 
debt extinguishment fees of million  or per share after taxes  were recorded related to the debt prepayments 
total debt at june  was million  compared to million at june  due to the net proceeds received from the stock offering and positive cash flow from operating activities during fiscal the company s business is seasonal 
demand for peanut and other nut products is highest during the months of october  november and december 
peanuts  pecans  walnuts  almonds and cashews  the company s principal raw materials  are purchased primarily during the period from august to february and are processed throughout the year 
as a result of this seasonality  the company s personnel and working capital requirements peak during the last four months of the calendar year 
this seasonality also impacts capacity utilization at the company s chicago area facilities  as these facilities are routinely operating at full capacity for the last four months of the calendar year 
the possibility of continued growth at current levels  and the seasonality of the company s business that has caused full capacity utilization rates at the company s chicago area facilities  has led the company to explore additional means of expanding its production capacity and enhancing its operations efficiency 
as a result  the company is planning for the consolidation of its five chicago area facilities into a single location through the construction of a new production facility  currently contemplated in elgin  illinois 
this facility consolidation project is anticipated to achieve two primary objectives 
first  the consolidation is intended to generate cost savings through the elimination of redundant costs and improvements in manufacturing efficiencies 
second  the new facility is expected to initially increase production capacity by to and would provide substantially more square footage than the aggregate space now available in the company s existing chicago area facilities to support future growth in the company s business 
the company has already taken certain preliminary steps in furtherance of this facility consolidation project  including the company and certain partnerships controlled by executive officers and directors of the company entering into a development agreement with the city of elgin for the development and purchase of the land where the new facility would be constructed 
the development agreement is subject to certain conditions  including but not limited to the completion of environmental and asbestos remediation procedures  the inclusion of the property in the elgin enterprise zone and the establishment of a tax incremental financing district covering the property 
the company has paid a thousand deposit to the state of illinois in connection with the purchase of this land 
the company currently expects to break ground during fiscal it is anticipated that the project will take four to five years from the time that the property is acquired to the time the new facility is fully placed in service 
the company estimates the total cost of the project to be between and million  which would be financed through a combination of debt  proceeds from the sale of existing facilities and available cash flow from operations  provided that the project occurs 
although the company believes the new facility would be accretive within three to four years of groundbreaking  there can be no assurances as to the timing or the impact on the company s net income 
see factors that may affect future results risks and uncertainties regarding facility consolidation project 
the company faces a number of challenges as it works to continue its record growth 
as a result of recent unit volume sales growth  the company s chicago area processing facilities operate at full capacity at certain times during the year 
if the company continues to experience growth in unit volume sales  it could exceed its capacity to meet the demand for its products  especially prior to the completion of the planned facility consolidation project 
assuming the company proceeds with the facility consolidation project  which will require approximately four to five years to complete  the company nevertheless faces potential disruptive effects on its business  such as cost overruns for the construction of the new facility or business interruptions that may result from the transfer of production to the new facility 
in addition  the company will continue to face the ongoing challenges of its business such as food safety and regulatory issues  the antitrust investigation of a portion of the peanut shelling industry and the maintenance and growth of its customer base 
see factors that may affect future results 
total inventories were approximately million at june   an increase of approximately million  or  over the balance at june  this increase is due primarily to an increase in the quantity of inshell pecans on hand due to greater purchases in fiscal than in fiscal net accounts receivable were approximately million at june   an increase of approximately million  or  over the balance at june  this increase is due primarily to higher monthly sales in june than in june the company s fiscal year ends on the final thursday of june each year  and typically consists of fifty two weeks four thirteen week quarters

fiscal vs 
net sales gross profit selling expenses administrative expenses income from operations fiscal compared to fiscal net sales 
net sales increased to approximately million for fiscal from approximately million for fiscal  an increase of approximately million or 
the increase in net sales was due primarily to higher unit volume sales in all of the company s distribution channels and across all major nut types 
unit volume increased approximately for fiscal compared to fiscal the unit volume increases are attributable primarily to the growth of the industry as a whole due to the growing awareness of the health benefits of nuts and the current trend toward high protein low carbohydrate diets 
in addition to the overall growth of the nut industry  the company was able to increase its sales to certain mass merchandisers 
the company s focus on providing these customers with a broad based portfolio of products  the increased shelf space for the company s products in their stores and the further leveraging of the fisher brand name were also contributing factors to the company s growth in net sales 
the remainder of the increase in net sales for fiscal compared to fiscal was due to higher average selling prices  primarily in the industrial and export distribution channels for most of the company s major nut types 
the company experienced significant growth in most of its key distribution channels 
the increase in net sales in the consumer distribution channel was due primarily to an increase in fisher brand and private label business through the expansion of business to existing customers 
a significant portion of this expansion in the distribution of fisher products came from short term promotional activity  which may not result in a permanent increase in net sales 
this increase was driven by higher nut consumption and the company s increased fisher brand marketing and promotions  especially in the chicago area 
the increase in net sales in the industrial distribution channel was due primarily to the increased usage of nuts as ingredients in food products such as cereals and food bars  and higher selling prices on fixed price contracts due to higher commodity costs 
the increase in net sales in the export distribution channel was due primarily to higher almond and pecan sales to the asian and european markets 
the increase in net sales in the food service distribution channel was due primarily to the food service industry rebounding from a decline in business during fiscal net sales in the contract packaging distribution channel increased as new products were introduced by the company s larger customers in this channel 
the company believes it is well positioned for sales growth throughout its major distribution channels 
the company expects the increased demand for nuts to continue and thereby generate new selling opportunities in the near term  especially in the consumer distribution channel 
the company believes that industrial customers will continue to develop new products that contain nuts as an ingredient in the near term in order to capitalize on the increasing awareness of the health benefits of nuts 
the company also expects its food service business to improve as nuts are used more frequently in menu choices

also  various uncertainties could result in additional uses of cash  such as those pertaining to the antitrust investigation of a portion of the peanut shelling industry or other litigation 
cash flows from operating activities have historically been driven by income from operations but are also influenced by inventory balances  which can change based upon fluctuations in both quantities and market prices of the various nuts the company sells 
current market trends in nut prices and crop estimates also impact nut procurement

critical accounting policies the accounting policies as disclosed in the notes to consolidated financial statements are applied in the preparation of the company s financial statements and accounting for the underlying transactions and balances 
the policies discussed below are considered by the company s management to be critical for an understanding of the company s financial statements because the application of these policies places the most significant demands on management s judgment  with financial reporting results relying on estimation regarding the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
specific risks  if applicable  for these critical accounting policies are described in the following paragraphs 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
preparation of this annual report on form k requires the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the company s financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results may differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue when a persuasive arrangement exists  title has transferred based upon terms of shipment  price is fixed  delivery occurs and collection is reasonably assured 
the company sells its products under various arrangements which include customer contracts which fix the sales price for periods typically of up to one year for some industrial customers and through specific programs  consisting of promotion allowances  volume and customer rebates and marketing allowances  among others  to consumer and food service customers 
revenues are recorded net of rebates and promotion and marketing allowances 
while customers do have the right to return products  past experience has demonstrated that product returns have been insignificant 
provisions for returns are reflected as a reduction in net sales and are estimated based upon customer specific circumstances 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out or market 
inventory costs are reviewed each quarter 
fluctuations in the market price of peanuts  pecans  walnuts  almonds and other nuts may affect the value of inventory and gross profit and gross profit margin 
if expected market sales prices were to move below cost  the company would record adjustments to write down the carrying values of inventories to fair market value 
the results of the company s shelling process can also result in changes to its inventory costs 
impairment of long lived assets the company reviews long lived assets to assess recoverability from projected undiscounted cash flows whenever events or changes in facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable  for example  in connection with the company s planned facility consolidation project if it proceeds 
an impairment loss is recognized in operating results when future undiscounted cash flows are less than the assets carrying value 
the impairment loss would adjust the carrying value to the assets fair value 
to date the company has not recorded any impairment charges 
promotion and advertising costs promotion allowances  customer rebates and marketing allowances are recorded at the time revenue is recognized and are reflected as reductions in sales 
annual volume rebates are estimated based upon projected volumes for the year  while promotion and marketing allowances are recorded based upon the terms of the actual arrangements 
coupon incentives have not been significant and are recorded at the time of distribution 
the company expenses the costs of advertising  which include newspaper and other advertising activities  as incurred 
introductory funds the ability to sell to certain retail customers often requires upfront payments to be made by the company 
such payments are frequently made pursuant to contracts that stipulate the term of the agreement  the quantity and type of products to be sold and any exclusivity requirements 
the cost of these payments is recorded as an asset and is amortized on a straight line basis over the term of the contract 
the company expenses payments if no written arrangement exists 
related party transactions as discussed in notes and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  the company leases space from related parties and transacts with other related parties in the normal course of business 
the company believes that these related party transactions are conducted on terms that are competitive with other non related entities 
recent accounting pronouncements in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
and a revised interpretation of fin no 
r in december fin requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
fin became effective immediately for all new variable interest entities created or acquired after january  for variable interest entities created or acquired prior to february   the provisions of fin became effective during the second quarter of fiscal the adoption of fin did not have a significant effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in april  the fasb issued sfas  amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities  which amends and clarifies financial accounting and reporting for certain derivative instruments 
sfas became effective during the first quarter of fiscal the adoption of sfas did not have any effect on the company s consolidated financial statements  as the company does not have any derivative instruments 
in may  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity  which establishes standards for the classification and measurement of certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity

forward looking statements the statements contained in this annual report on form k  and in the chairman s letter to stockholders accompanying the annual report on form k delivered to stockholders  that are not historical including statements concerning the company s expectations regarding market risk are forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements  which generally are followed and therefore identified by a cross reference to factors that may affect future results or are identified by the use of forward looking words and phrases such as intends  may  believes and expects  represent the company s present expectations or beliefs concerning future events 
the company cautions that such statements are qualified by important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements  including the factors described below under factors that may affect future results  as well as the timing and occurrence or non occurrence of transactions and events which may be subject to circumstances beyond the company s control 
consequently  results actually achieved may differ materially from the expected results included in these statements 
factors that may affect future results availability of raw materials and market price fluctuations the availability and cost of raw materials for the production of the company s products  including peanuts  pecans  almonds  walnuts and other nuts are subject to crop size and yield fluctuations caused by factors beyond the company s control  such as weather conditions  plant diseases and changes in government programs 
additionally  the supply of edible nuts and other raw materials used in the company s products could be reduced upon any determination by the united states department of agriculture usda or other government agencies that certain pesticides  herbicides or other chemicals used by growers have left harmful residues on portions of the crop or that the crop has been contaminated by aflatoxin or other agents 
if worldwide demand for nuts continues at recent rates  and supply does not expand to meet demand  a reduction in availability and an increase in the cost of raw materials would occur 
this type of increase was experienced during the last half of fiscal for most of the company s major nut types 
the company does not hedge against changes in commodity prices  and thus  shortages in the supply of and increases in the prices of nuts and other raw materials used by the company in its products to the extent that cost increases cannot be passed on to customers could have an adverse impact on the company s profitability 
furthermore  fluctuations in the market prices of nuts may affect the value of the company s inventories and profitability 
the company has significant inventories of nuts that would be adversely affected by any decrease in the market price of such raw materials 
see introduction 
competitive environment the company operates in a highly competitive environment 
the company s principal products compete against food and snack products manufactured and sold by numerous regional and national companies  some of which are substantially larger and have greater resources than the company  such as planters and ralcorp holdings  inc the company also competes with other shellers in the industrial market and with regional processors in the retail and wholesale markets 
in order to maintain or increase its market share  the company must continue to price its products competitively  which may lower revenue per unit and cause declines in gross margin  if the company is unable to increase unit volumes as well as reduce its costs 
dependence upon customers the company is dependent on a few significant customers for a large portion of its total sales  particularly in the consumer channel 
sales to the company s five largest customers represented approximately and of its consolidated gross sales in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
wal mart alone accounted for approximately and of the company s net sales for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the loss of one of the company s largest customers  or a material decrease in purchases by one or more of its largest customers  would result in decreased sales and adversely impact the company s income and cash flow 
pricing pressures as the retail grocery trade continues to consolidate and the company s retail customers grow larger and become more sophisticated  the company s retail customers are demanding lower pricing and increased promotional programs 
further  these customers may begin to place a greater emphasis on the lowest cost supplier in making purchasing decisions  particularly if buying techniques such as reverse internet auctions increase in popularity 
an increased focus on the lowest cost supplier could reduce the benefits of some of the company s competitive advantages 
the company s sales volume growth could slow  and it may become necessary to lower the company s prices and increase promotional support of the company s products  any of which would adversely affect its gross profit margins 
production limitations the company has experienced significant sales growth as its customer demand has increased 
if the company continues to experience comparable increases in customer demand  particularly prior to the completion of the company s facility consolidation project  it may be unable to fully satisfy its customers supply needs 
if the company becomes unable to supply sufficient quantities of products  it may lose sales and market share to its competitors 
food safety and product contamination the company could be adversely affected if consumers in the company s principal markets lose confidence in the safety of nut products  particularly with respect to peanut and tree nut allergies 
individuals with peanut allergies may be at risk of serious illness or death resulting from the consumption of the company s nut products 
notwithstanding existing food safety controls  the company processes peanuts and tree nuts on the same equipment  and there is no guarantee that the company s peanut free products will not be cross contaminated by peanuts 
concerns generated by risks of peanut and tree nut cross contamination and other food safety matters may discourage consumers from buying the company s products  cause production and delivery disruptions  or result in product recalls 
product liability and product recalls the company faces risks associated with product liability claims and product recalls in the event its food safety and quality control procedures fail and its products cause injury or become adulterated or misbranded 
a product recall of a sufficient quantity  or a significant product liability judgment against the company  could cause the company s products to be unavailable for a period of time and could result in a loss of consumer confidence in the company s food products 
these kinds of events  were they to occur  would have a material adverse effect on demand for the company s products and  consequently  the company s income and liquidity 
retention of key personnel the company s future success will be largely dependent on the personal efforts of its senior operating management team  including michael j 
valentine  the company s executive vice president finance  chief financial officer and secretary  jeffrey t 
sanfilippo  the company s executive vice president sales and marketing  and jasper b 
sanfilippo  jr  the company s executive vice president of operations  which has assumed management of the day to day operation of the company s business over the past two years 
in addition  the company s success depends on the talents of james m 
barker  senior vice president sales and marketing  everardo soria  senior vice president pecan operations and procurement  walter r 
tankersley  jr  senior vice president industrial sales  charles m 
nicketta  senior vice president of manufacturing and arthur l 
timp  senior vice president of corporate operations 
the company believes that the expertise and knowledge of these individuals in the industry  and in their respective fields  is a critical factor to the company s continued growth and success 
the company has not entered into an employment agreement with any of these individuals  nor does the company have key officer insurance coverage policies in effect 
the loss of the services of any of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and prospects if the company were unable to identify a suitable candidate to replace any such individual 
the company s success is also dependent upon its ability to attract and retain additional qualified marketing  technical and other personnel  and there can be no assurance that the company will be able to do so 
risks and uncertainties regarding facility consolidation project the planned facility consolidation project may not result in significant cost savings or increases in efficiency  or allow the company to increase its production capabilities to meet expected increases in customer demand 
moreover  the company s expectations with respect to the financial impact of the facility consolidation project are based on numerous estimates and assumptions  any or all of which may differ from actual results 
such differences could substantially reduce the anticipated benefit of the project 
more specifically  the following risks  among others  may limit the financial benefits of the facility consolidation project cost overruns in the construction of and equipment for the new facility are possible and could offset other cost savings expected from the consolidation  the facility consolidation project is likely to have a negative impact on the company s earnings during the four to five year construction period  the proceeds the company receives from selling or renting its existing facilities may be less than it expects  and the timing of the receipt of those proceeds and the acquisition of a replacement site may be later than the company has planned  the facility consolidation project may not eliminate as many redundant processes as the company presently anticipates  the company may not realize the expected increase in demand for its products necessary to justify additional production capacity created by the facility consolidation  the company may not be able to transfer production from its existing facilities to the new facility without a significant interruption in its business  moving the company s facilities to a new location may cause attrition in its personnel at levels that result in a significant interruption in its operations  and the company expects to incur additional annual compensation costs of approximately  to facilitate the retention of certain of its key personnel while the facility consolidation project is in process  and the company expects to fund a portion of the facility consolidation project through third party financing  which may be at rates less favorable than its current credit facilities 
if for any reason the company were to realize less than the expected benefits from the facility consolidation project  its future income stream  cash flows and debt levels could be materially adversely affected 
in addition  the facility consolidation project is in the early stages of planning and unanticipated risks may develop as the project proceeds

government regulation the company is subject to extensive regulation by the united states food and drug administration  the united states department of agriculture  the united states environmental protection agency and other state and local authorities in jurisdictions where its products are manufactured  processed or sold 
among other things  these regulations govern the manufacturing  importation  processing  packaging  storage  distribution and labeling of the company s products 
the company s manufacturing and processing facilities and products are subject to periodic compliance inspections by federal  state and local authorities 
the company is also subject to environmental regulations governing the discharge of air emissions  water and food waste  and the generation  handling  storage  transportation  treatment and disposal of waste materials 
amendments to existing statutes and regulations  adoption of new statutes and regulations  increased production at the company s existing facilities as well as its expansion into new operations and jurisdictions  may require the company to obtain additional licenses and permits and could require it to adapt or alter methods of operations at costs that could be substantial 
compliance with applicable laws and regulations may adversely affect the company s business 
failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could subject the company to civil remedies  including fines  injunctions  recalls or seizures  as well as possible criminal sanctions  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
economic  political and social risks of doing business in emerging markets the company purchases a substantial portion of its cashew inventories from india  brazil and vietnam  which are in many respects emerging markets 
to this extent  the company is exposed to risks inherent in emerging markets  including increased governmental ownership and regulation of the economy  greater likelihood of inflation and adverse economic conditions stemming from governmental attempts to reduce inflation  such as imposition of higher interest rates and wage and price controls  potential for contractual defaults or forced renegotiations on purchase contracts with limited legal recourse  tariffs and other barriers to trade that may reduce the company s profitability  and civil unrest and significant political instability 
the existence of these risks in these and other foreign countries that are the origins of the company s raw materials could jeopardize or limit its ability to purchase sufficient supplies of cashews and other imported raw materials and may adversely affect the company s income by increasing the costs of doing business overseas 
fixed price commitments from time to time  the company enters into fixed price commitments with its customers 
such commitments represented approximately to of the company s annual net sales in fiscal  and in many cases are entered into after the company s cost to acquire the nut products necessary to satisfy the fixed price commitment is substantially fixed 
the company expects to continue to enter into fixed price commitments with respect to certain of its nut products prior to fixing its acquisition cost in order to maintain customer relationships or when  in management s judgment  market or crop harvest conditions so warrant 
to the extent the company does so  however  these fixed price commitments may result in reduced gross profit margins that have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
the company s results of operations were adversely affected during the last half of fiscal as outside purchases of almonds and pecans were required to fulfill obligations under fixed price contracts 
inventory measurement the company purchases its nut inventories from growers and farmers in large quantities at harvest times  which are primarily during the second and third quarters of the company s fiscal year  and receives nut shipments in bulk truckloads 
the weights of these nuts are measured using truck scales at the time of receipt  and inventories are recorded on the basis of those measurements 
the nuts are then stored in bulk in large warehouses to be shelled or processed throughout the year 
bulk stored nut inventories are relieved on the basis of continuous high speed bulk weighing systems as the nuts are shelled or processed or on the basis of calculations derived from the weight of the shelled nuts that are produced 
while the company performs various procedures to confirm the accuracy of its bulk stored nut inventories  these inventories are estimates that must be periodically adjusted to account for positive or negative variations  and such adjustments directly affect earnings 
the precise amount of the company s bulk stored nut inventories is not known until the entire quantity of the particular nut is depleted  which may not necessarily occur every year 
prior crop year inventories may still be on hand as the new crop year inventories are purchased 
there can be no assurance that such inventory quantity adjustments will not have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations in the future 
farm bill the farm security and rural investment act of the farm bill terminated the federal peanut quota program beginning with the crop year 
the farm bill replaced the federal peanut quota program with a fixed payment system through the crop year that can be either coupled or decoupled 
a coupled system is tied to the actual amount of production  while a decoupled system is not 
the series of loans and subsidies established by the farm bill is similar to the systems used for other crops such as grains and cotton 
to compensate farmers for the elimination of the peanut quota  the farm bill provides a buy out at a specified rate for each pound of peanuts that had been in that farmer s quota under the prior program 
additionally  among other provisions  the secretary of agriculture may make certain counter cyclical payments whenever the secretary believes that the effective price for peanuts is less than the target price 
the termination of the federal peanut quota program has reduced the company s costs for peanuts and resulted in a higher gross margin than the company has historically achieved 
although this margin is now similar to the company s total gross profit margin  the company may be unable to maintain these higher gross profit margins on the sale of peanuts  and the company s business  financial position and results of operations would thus be materially adversely affected 
public health security and bioterrorism preparedness and response act of the events of september  reinforced the need to enhance the security of the united states 
congress responded in part by passing the public health security and bioterrorism preparedness and response act of the bioterrorism act 
the bioterrorism act includes a number of provisions to help guard against the threat of bioterrorism  including new authority for the secretary of health and human services hhs to take action to protect the nation s food supply against the threat of international contamination 
the food and drug administration fda  as the food regulatory arm of hhs  is responsible for developing and implementing these food safety measures  which fall into four broad categories i registration of food facilities  ii establishment and maintenance of records regarding the sources and recipients of foods  iii prior notice to fda of imported food shipments and iv administrative detention of potentially affected foods 
fda has issued rules in each of these categories  which rules generally took effect on december  there can be no assurances that the effects of the bioterrorism act and the related rules  including any potential disruption in the company s supply of imported nuts  which represented approximately of the company s total nut purchases in fiscal  will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial position or results of operations in the future 
peanut shelling industry antitrust investigation on june   the company received a subpoena for the production of documents and records from a grand jury in connection with an investigation of a portion of the peanut shelling industry by the antitrust division of the united states department of justice 
the company believes the investigation relates to procurement pricing practices but  given the early stage of the investigation  it could concern other or additional business practices 
the company has responded to the subpoena and has produced documents to the department of justice  and two employees of the company received subpoenas to appear before the grand jury 
the investigation  of which the company and the employees are subjects  is on going 
the investigation may have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations  and on the peanut shelling industry 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to the impact of changes in interest rates and to commodity prices of raw material purchases 
the company has not entered into any arrangements to hedge against changes in market interest rates  commodity prices or foreign currency fluctuations 
the company is unable to engage in hedging activity related to commodity prices  since there are no established futures markets for nuts 
approximately of nut purchases for fiscal were made from foreign countries  and while these purchases were payable in us dollars  the underlying costs may fluctuate with changes in the value of the us dollar relative to the currency in the foreign country 
the company is exposed to interest rate risk on the bank credit facility  its only variable rate credit facility 
a hypothetical adverse change in weighted average interest rates would have had an immaterial impact on the company s net income and cash flows from operating activities
