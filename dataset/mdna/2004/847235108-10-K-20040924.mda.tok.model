information provided at the website includes  among other items  the annual report on form k  quarterly reports on form q  quarterly earnings releases  news releases  and the code of ethics  as well as various corporate charters 
the company s operations are in one line of business  electronic contract manufacturing services ems 
sparton s capabilities range from product design and development through aftermarket support  specializing in total business solutions for government  medical scientific instrumentation  aerospace and industrial markets 
this includes the design  development and or manufacture of electronic parts and assemblies for both government and commercial customers worldwide 
governmental sales are mainly sonobuoys 
the private securities litigation reform act of reflects congress determination that the disclosures of forward looking information is desirable for investors and encourages such disclosure by providing a safe harbor for forward looking statements by corporate management 
this report on form k contains forward looking statements within the scope of the securities act of and the securities exchange act of the words expects  anticipates  believes  intends  plans  and similar expressions  and the negatives of such expressions  are intended to identify forward looking statements 
in addition  any statements which refer to expectations  projections or other characterizations of future events or circumstances are forward looking statements 
the company undertakes no obligation to publicly disclose any revisions to these forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring subsequent to filing this form k with the securities and exchange commission sec 
these forward looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties  including  without limitation  those discussed below 
accordingly  sparton s future results may differ materially from historical results or from those discussed or implied by these forward looking statements 
the company notes that a variety of factors could cause the actual results and experience to differ materially from anticipated results or other expectations expressed in the company s forward looking statements 
sparton  as a high mix  low to medium volume supplier  provides rapid product turnaround for customers 
high mix pertains to customers needing multiple product types with generally lower volume manufacturing runs 
as a contract manufacturer with customers in a variety of markets  the company has substantially less visibility of end user demand and  therefore  forecasting sales can be problematic 
customers may cancel their orders  change production quantities and or reschedule production for a number of reasons 
depressed economic conditions may result in customers delaying delivery of product  or the placement of purchase orders for lower volumes than previously anticipated 
unplanned cancellations  reductions  or delays by customers may negatively impact the company s results of operations 
as many of the company s costs and operating expenses are relatively fixed within given ranges of production  a reduction in customer demand can disproportionately affect the company s gross margins and operating income 
the majority of the company s sales have historically come from a limited number of customers 
significant reductions in sales to  or a loss of  one of these customers could materially impact business if the company were not able to replace those sales with new business 
other risks and uncertainties that may affect operations  performance  growth forecasts and business results include  but are not limited to  timing and fluctuations in us and or world economies  competition in the overall ems business  availability of production labor and management services under terms acceptable to the company  congressional budget outlays for sonobuoy development and production  congressional legislation  foreign currency exchange rate risk  uncertainties associated with the costs and benefits of new facilities and the closing of others  uncertainties associated with the outcome of litigation  changes in the interpretation of environmental laws and the uncertainties of environmental remediation 
a further risk factor is the availability and cost of materials 
the company has encountered availability and extended lead time issues on some electronic components in the past when market demand has been strong  which have resulted in higher prices and late deliveries 
additionally  the timing of sonobuoy sales to the us navy is dependent upon access to  and successful passage of  product tests performed by the us navy 
reduced governmental budgets have made access to the test range less predictable and less frequent than in the past 
finally  the sarbanes oxley act of has required changes in  and formalization of  some of the company s corporate governance and compliance practices 
the sec and new york stock exchange have also passed new rules and regulations requiring additional compliance activities 
compliance with these rules has increased administrative costs  and it is expected that certain of these costs will continue indefinitely 
management cautions readers not to place undue reliance on forward looking statements  which are subject to influence by the enumerated risk factors as well as unanticipated future events 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto

table of contents sales for the year ended june   totaled  a decrease of  from fiscal overall  sales remained below original expectations given the continued depressed economic markets that our customers serve 
all markets declined with the exception of aerospace 
the decline in government sales was mainly due to a decline in foreign demand  including one delayed foreign sonobuoy sale of million  which due to unforeseen shipping complications did not occur until july prior year s sales in the industrial market benefited from strong demand for homeland security products  principally driven by the demand for chemical trace detection equipment in both the us and canadian airports 
these sales totaled approximately million in fiscal compared to million last year 
this decline in the industrial market was partially offset by increased sales to other customers 
the increase in aerospace sales was primarily due to increased sales to one existing customer  this customer has shown consistent growth over past years

fiscal s gross margin declined to 
margins on government programs improved as the company concluded production of several problem plagued sonobuoy contracts during however  an engineering redesign on an existing proprietary product line this year resulted in charges of  of which  occurred during the first quarter of gross margin was further reduced in the fourth quarter of by a charge of  for obsolete inventory at two locations 
the inventory involved was previously used in the production of certain proprietary products 
upon the recent evaluation of these products  and based on their decreased demand and changes in product specifications  the inventory was deemed excess or abandoned 
in addition  pension costs increased due to a lower than expected return on pension assets  and a current year amortization charge relating to the plan s unrecognized actuarial loss which has substantially increased over the past two years 
the majority of pension costs   in and  in  were charged to cost of goods sold 
finally  several programs were in start up mode during and contributed minimal or negative margins 
given the on going reduced level of sales  the company continues to experience underutilized capacity  which due to the fixed nature of many of the company s costs continues to negatively impact margins 
selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales in and in increased slightly from as the company increased research and development activities primarily related to government contracts 
unreimbursed research and development expenses  which are included in selling and administrative expenses as they were not customer funded  totaled  for the year ended june   compared to  for the prior year

the favorable tax rate credit was principally attributable to foreign currency translation and transactions related to the company s canadian facility 
a nontaxable translation gain of  for the year  combined with an unrealized transaction gain of  as of june   for which no deferred income tax expense was recorded due to the canadian facility s net operating loss carryover position  increased the effective tax rate credit by 
with this change in the effective tax rate a tax credit of  was recognized in the fourth quarter 
the tax credit of  included an approximately  credit reflecting the change in effective tax rates on results through the third quarter and  of expense attributable to the profits of the fourth quarter 
the effective tax rate used in earlier periods of fiscal was based on assumptions regarding activity that was anticipated to occur in the fourth quarter  which did not materialize 
in addition  the significant impact from foreign currency translation and transactions  and the higher than expected canadian facility s profitability  were not anticipated 
the combination of these two factors in the fourth quarter  and the final tax provision calculation  greatly affected the final tax benefit in the fourth quarter in a manner not previously anticipated

table of contents operating profits of  and  were reported for the fiscal years ended june  and  respectively 
fiscal gross margins were consistent with prior year 
margins on government programs improved during as the company concluded production of several problem plagued sonobuoy contracts 
these contracts carried no gross margin and their revenues totaled million for fiscal and million for fiscal at june   these contracts were complete 
cost estimates on another contract  which was completed during the first half of fiscal  had previously included costs for estimated rework  which rework was not required  resulting in increased margins of  during this period 
inventory and rework issues for two other customers reduced margins by  during the year 
given the reduced level of sales  the company continued to experience underutilized capacity

the company s effective tax rate for fiscal was  compared to the statutory us federal tax rate of 
the favorable tax rate was principally due to the tax benefit attributable to foreign sales and the utilization of a contribution carryforward benefit from in addition  a portion of the canadian net operating loss carryforward from prior years was utilized 
a valuation allowance had been recorded on both of these carryforwards at june  the tax effect of foreign currency transactions and translation further reduced the effective tax rate

liquidity and capital resources the primary source of liquidity and capital resources has historically been from operations 
short term credit facilities have been used in the past  but not recently 
certain government contracts provide for interim progress billings based on costs incurred 
these progress billings reduce the amount of cash that would otherwise be required during the performance of these contracts 
as the volume of us defense related contract work declines  so has the relative importance of progress billings as a liquidity resource 
at the present time  the company plans on using its investment securities to provide working capital and to strategically invest in additional property  plant and equipment to accommodate growth 
growth is expected to be achieved through internal expansion and or acquisition or joint venture 
sparton has continued to pursue the establishment of operations in vietnam to provide increased growth opportunities 
as the company has not previously done business in this emerging market  there are many uncertainties and risks inherent in this potential venture 
on april   the board of directors approved a proposal to proceed with this expansion 
the new operation will carry the name spartronics and will not be conducted as a joint venture as previously described  as the potential partner has voluntarily withdrawn from the plan 
meetings have been held with architects and contractors and construction commenced in august it is estimated that sparton will invest approximately million  which includes land  building  and initial operating expenses  over the next months 
the company is also continuing a program to identify and evaluate potential acquisition candidates in both the defense and medical markets 
the company has purchased a manufacturing facility in albuquerque  new mexico 
this facility will replace an existing plant in rio rancho  new mexico 
the facility was purchased for approximately million 
estimated additional costs totaling approximately million are anticipated to be incurred as the company completes its transition between facilities 
at june   million for the new facility is carried as construction in progress in the property  plant and equipment section of the consolidated balance sheet 
the existing rio rancho plant was sold in june for approximately million million after expenses related to the sale  resulting in a  gain 
the company will continue to lease the rio rancho facility until the transition to the new facility is completed 
the transition between facilities is anticipated to be completed by november the company s market risk exposure to foreign currency and interest rates are not considered to be material  principally due to their short term nature and minimal receivables and payables designated in foreign currency 
the company has had no short term debt since december  and currently has an unused informal line of credit totaling million

table of contents cash flows provided by operating activities were   and  in the fiscal years ended  and  respectively 
the increase in cash provided by operating activities in was mainly attributable to the doe settlement of  of which  and  was received in and  respectively 
cash flow for was increased by the collection of accounts receivable  which was reflective of receipt of payment for the large volume of sales recognized in the increased cash flow in from accounts payable  salaries and wages  accrued liabilities and income taxes included  of accrued estimated health costs 
as of january   the company began a self insured health insurance program 
health insurance had previously been provided under an insured plan 
a primary use of cash flows was an increase in inventories and prepaid expenses  partially due to the delay in sales of million of sonobuoys  which occurred in july cash flows used by investing activities totaled   and  in the fiscal years ended  and  respectively 
the major use of cash by investing activities was the purchase of investment securities  as well as the purchase of the albuquerque  new mexico facility in june the new facility was purchased using invested funds  which is reflected in the proceeds from sales of investment securities 
cash flows provided by financing activities were  and  in fiscal and  respectively  primarily from the exercise of stock options 
cash flows used by financing activities was  in fiscal  related to the purchase of shares of common stock for the treasury 
at june   the company had  in working capital  a working capital ratio  and total shareowners equity of  for the foreseeable future months the company believes it has sufficient liquidity for its recurring business needs 
contractual obligations the company s current obligations  which are due within twelve months  for the payment of accounts payable  accruals  and other liabilities totaling  which includes the  current portion of the environmental liability and  of the standby letters of credit  at june   are reflected in the consolidated balance sheets included in item the following tables summarize the company s significant contractual obligations and other commercial commitments as of june  payments due by fiscal period contractual obligations total thereafter operating leases environmental liabilities noncancelable purchase orders total amount of commitment by fiscal expiration period other commercial commitments total thereafter standby letters of credit operating leases see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this report for further discussion of operating leases 
environmental liabilities see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this report for a description of the accrual for environmental remediation 
of the  environmental liabilities   is classified as a current liability and  is classified as a long term liability  both of which were included on the balance sheet as of june  noncancelable purchase orders orders the company has placed with suppliers that are subject to each supplier s quality and performance 
standby letters of credit the company has standby letters of credit outstanding aggregating approximately  at june   principally to support self insured programs and certain foreign contracts 
approximately  of the potential liabilities related to these letters of credit are reflected as accrued liabilities in the company s financial statements 
it is estimated that sparton will invest approximately million  including land  building and initial operating expenses  over the next months for the company s planned new facility in vietnam

table of contents critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported as assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
estimates are regularly evaluated and are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the company believes that of its significant accounting policies as discussed in note included to the consolidated financial statements  which is included in part ii  item  the following involve a higher degree of judgement and complexity 
environmental contingencies one of sparton s former manufacturing facilities  located in albuquerque  new mexico coors road  has been the subject of ongoing investigations and remediation efforts conducted with the environmental protection agency epa under the resource conservation and recovery act rcra 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item  sparton has accrued its estimate of the minimum future non discounted financial liability 
the estimate was developed using existing technology and excludes legal and related consulting costs 
the minimum cost estimate includes equipment  operating and monitoring costs for both onsite and offsite remediation 
sparton recognizes legal and consulting services in the periods incurred and reviews its epa accrual activity quarterly 
uncertainties associated with environmental remediation contingencies are pervasive and often result in wide ranges of reasonably possible outcomes 
it is possible that cash flows and results of operations could be materially affected by the impact of changes in these estimates 
government contract cost estimates government production contracts are accounted for based on completed units accepted with respect to revenue recognition and their estimated average cost per unit regarding costs 
losses for the entire amount of the contract are recognized in the period when such losses are determinable 
significant judgment is exercised in determining estimated total contract costs including  but not limited to  cost experience to date  estimated length of time to contract completion  costs for materials  production labor and support services to be expended  and known issues on remaining units to be completed 
estimated costs developed in the early stages of contracts can change significantly as the contracts progress  and events and activities take place 
significant changes in estimate can also occur when new designs are initially placed into production 
the company formally reviews its costs incurred to date and estimated costs to complete on all significant contracts on a quarterly basis and revised estimated total contract costs are reflected in the financial statements 
depending upon the circumstances  it is possible that the company s financial position  results of operations and cash flows could be materially affected by changes in estimated costs to complete on one or more significant contracts 
commercial inventory valuation allowances inventory valuation allowances for commercial customer inventories require a significant degree of judgment and are influenced by the company s experience to date with both customers and other markets  prevailing market conditions for raw materials  contractual terms and customers ability to satisfy these obligations  environmental or technological materials obsolescence  changes in demand for customer products  and other factors resulting in acquiring materials in excess of customer product demand 
contracts with some commercial customers may be based upon estimated quantities of product manufactured for shipment over estimated time periods 
raw material inventories are purchased to fulfill these customer requirements 
within these arrangements  customer demand for products frequently changes  sometimes creating excess and obsolete inventories 
the company regularly reviews raw material inventories by customer for both excess and obsolete quantities  with adjustments made accordingly 
wherever possible  the company attempts to recover its full cost of excess and obsolete inventories from customers or  in some cases  through other markets 
when it is determined that the company s carrying cost of such excess and obsolete inventories cannot be recovered in full  a charge is taken against income and a valuation allowance is established for the difference between the carrying cost and the estimated realizable amount 
conversely  should the disposition of adjusted excess and obsolete inventories result in recoveries in excess of these reduced carrying values  the remaining portion of the valuation allowances are reversed and taken into income when such determinations are made 
it is possible that the company s financial position  results of operations and cash flows could be materially affected by changes to inventory valuation allowances for commercial customer excess and obsolete inventories 
allowance for possible losses on receivables the accounts receivable balance is recorded net of allowances for amounts not expected to be collected from customers 
the allowance is estimated based on historical experience of write offs  the level of past due amounts  information known about specific customers with respect to their ability to make payments  and future expectations of conditions that might impact the collectibility of accounts 
accounts receivable are generally due under normal trade terms for the industry 
credit is granted  and credit evaluations are periodically performed  based on a customers financial condition and other factors 
although the company does not generally require collateral  cash in advance or letters of credit may be required from customers in certain circumstances  including some foreign customers 
when management determines that it is probable that an account will not be collected  it is charged against the allowance for possible losses 
the company reviews the adequacy of its allowance monthly 
the allowance for doubtful accounts was  and  at june  and  respectively 
if the financial condition nyse spa sparton 
table of contents of customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payment  additional allowances may be required 
the significant reduction in the allowance for doubtful accounts from june   was primarily due to the write off of  for one account 
the account  which was previously reserved  was deemed uncollectible due to the customer filing bankruptcy and  therefore  written off 
given the company s significant balance of government receivables and letters of credit from foreign customers  collection risk is considered minimal 
historically  uncollectible accounts have been insignificant and the minimal allowance is deemed adequate 
pension obligations the company calculates the cost of providing pension benefits under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
the key assumptions required within the provisions of sfas no 
are used in making these calculations 
the most significant of these assumptions are the discount rate used to value the future obligations and the expected return on pension plan assets 
the discount rate is consistent with market interest rates on high quality  fixed income investments 
the expected return on assets is based on long term returns and assets held by the plan  which is influenced by historical averages 
if actual interest rates and returns on plan assets materially differ from the assumptions  future adjustments to the financial statements would be required 
while changes in these assumptions can have a significant effect on the pension benefit obligation and the unrecognized gain or loss accounts disclosed in the notes to the financial statements  the effect of changes in these assumptions is not expected to have the same relative effect on net periodic pension expense in the near term 
while these assumptions may change in the future based on changes in long term interest rates and market conditions  there are no known expected changes in these assumptions as of june  as indicated above  to the extent the assumptions differ from actual results  there would be a future impact on the financial statements 
the extent to which this will result in future expense is not determinable at this time as it will depend upon a number of variables  including trends in interest rates and the actual return on plan assets 
for example  an increase in the return on the plan assets due to improved market conditions would reduce the unrecognized net actuarial loss account and thus reduce future expense 
during the quarter ended march   the annual actuarial valuation of the pension plan was received 
based on this valuation  net periodic pension expense for fiscal was estimated to be  versus the prior year s expense of  the components of net periodic pension expense are detailed in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
the following factors primarily contributed to the  increase the overall equity markets at june  the valuation date used in determining fiscal net periodic pension expense were very low  resulting in a significant decrease in the fair value of the pension plan s assets and an associated  reduction in the expected return on plan assets component of fiscal net periodic pension expense 
in addition  the discount rate assumption decreased from at june  to at june  this reduction in the discount rate  combined with the reduction in the fair value of the plan s assets  contributed significantly to the increase in the pension plan s unrecognized net actuarial loss from  at june  to  at june  as this unrecognized net actuarial loss account exceeds certain limits  it is subject to an amortized charge to expense over future years 
while  as indicated above  this substantial increase as of the beginning of fiscal did not have a comparable effect on fiscal expense  it did result in an increase in the recognized net actuarial loss component of net pension cost of  while net periodic pension expense has increased during the past two years  no cash payments are expected to be required for the next several years due to the plan s funded status 
other litigation one of sparton s facilities  located in albuquerque  new mexico  has been the subject of ongoing investigations conducted with the environmental protection agency epa under the resource conservation and recovery act rcra 
the investigation began in the early s and involved a review of onsite and offsite environmental impacts 
at june   sparton has an accrual of  as its estimate of the future undiscounted minimum financial liability with respect to this matter 
the company s cost estimate is based upon existing technology and excludes legal and related consulting costs  which are expensed as incurred 
the company s estimate includes equipment and operating costs for onsite and offsite operations and is based on existing methodology 
uncertainties associated with environmental remediation contingencies are pervasive and often result in wide ranges of reasonably possible outcomes 
estimates developed in the early stages of remediation can vary significantly 
normally a finite estimate of cost does not become fixed and determinable at a specific point in time 
rather  the costs associated with environmental remediation become estimable over a continuum of events and activities that help to frame and define a liability 
it is possible that cash flows and results of operations could be affected by the impact of the ultimate resolution of this contingency 
sparton is currently involved with two legal actions  which are disclosed in part i legal proceedings  item of this report 
at this time  the company is unable to predict the outcome of either of these two claims

table of contents item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk market risk exposure the company manufactures its products in the united states and canada 
sales of the company s products are made in the us and canada  as well as other foreign markets 
the company is potentially subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk relating to intercompany activity and balances and to receipts from customers and payments to suppliers in foreign currencies 
also  adjustments related to the translation of the company s canadian financial statements into us dollars are included in current earnings 
as a result  the company s financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the domestic and foreign markets in which the company operates 
however  minimal third party receivables and payables are denominated in foreign currency and  historically  foreign currency gains and losses related to intercompany activity and balances have not been significant 
the company does not consider the market risk exposure relating to currency exchange to be material 
the company has financial instruments that are subject to interest rate risk  principally short term investments 
historically  the company has not experienced material gains or losses due to such interest rate changes 
based on the current holdings of short term investments  the interest rate risk is not considered to be material
