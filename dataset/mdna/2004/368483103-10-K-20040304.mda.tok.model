accounting pronouncements in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
fin 
fin clarifies the application of accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements to certain entities in which  among others  equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
the consolidation provisions of fin  as revised  are effective immediately for interests created after january  and are effective on march  for interests created before february  as of december   the company does not own an interest in any variable interest entities 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  net sales and expenses 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions and materially impact the carrying value of the assets and liabilities 
the company believes the following accounting policies are critical to the company s business operations and the understanding of the company s results of operations and financial condition 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company s accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for amounts that may be uncollectible in the future 
in circumstances where the company is aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations  a specific reserve for bad debts is recorded against the accounts receivable balance to reduce the amount due to the net amount reasonably expected to be collected 
additionally  a general percentage of past due receivables is reserved  based on the company s past experience of collectibility 
if circumstances change ie  higher than expected defaults or an unexpected material adverse change in a major customer s ability to meet its financial obligations  estimates of the recoverability of amounts due could be reduced by a material amount 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market value 
cost is determined using the last in  first out lifo method for the majority of the company s inventories 
in valuing inventory  management is required to make assumptions regarding the level of reserves required to value potentially obsolete or slow moving items to the lower of cost or market value 
inventory reserves are established taking into account inventory age and frequency of use or sale 
while calculations are made involving these factors  significant management judgment regarding expectations for future events is involved 
future events that could significantly influence management s judgment and related estimates include general economic conditions in markets where the company s products are sold  as well as new products and design changes introduced by the company 
accrued warranty the company establishes reserves related to the warranties provided on its products 
specific reserves are maintained for programs related to known machine safety and reliability issues 
when establishing specific reserves  estimates are made regarding the size of the population  the type of program  costs to be incurred and estimated participation 
additionally  general reserves are maintained based on the historical percentage relationships of warranty costs to machine sales and applied to current equipment sales 
if these estimates and related assumptions change  reserve levels may require adjustment 
accrued product liability the company records a general reserve for potential product liability claims based on the company s prior claim experience and specific reserves for known product liability claims 
specific reserves for known claims are valued based upon the company s prior claims experience  including consideration of the jurisdiction  circumstances of the accident  type of loss or injury  identity of plaintiff  other potential responsible parties  analysis of outside counsel  and analysis of internal product liability counsel 
actual product liability costs could be different due to a number of variables  including decisions of juries or judges 
goodwill impairment in connection with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  the company is required to perform goodwill impairment reviews  at least annually  using a fair value based approach 
the company performs its annual impairment review as of december as part of the annual impairment review  an estimate of the fair value of the company s construction equipment segment the entire carrying amount of goodwill is allocated to the construction segment  primarily by using a discounted cash flow analysis  is performed 
significant assumptions used in this analysis include expected future revenue growth rates  operating profit margins  working capital levels and a weighted average cost of capital 
changes in assumptions could significantly impact the estimate of the fair value of the construction equipment segment  which could result in a goodwill impairment charge and could have a significant impact on the results of the construction equipment segment and the consolidated financial statements 
pension and postretirement benefits pension and postretirement benefit costs and obligations are dependent on assumptions used in calculation of these amounts 
these assumptions  used by actuaries  include discount rates  expected return on plan assets for funded plans  rate of salary increases  health care cost trend rates  mortality rates and other factors 
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  actual results that differ from the actuarial assumptions are accumulated and amortized to future periods and therefore affect recognized expense and recorded obligations in future periods 
while the company believes that the assumptions used are appropriate  differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may materially effect its financial position or results of operations

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates as well as fluctuations in currency 
see further disclosure relating to variable rate debt under management s discussion and analysis and results of operations liquidity and capital resources borrowing arrangements included in item of this form k 
interest rate risk the company s facility is primarily libor based and is subject to interest rate movements 
a increase or decrease in the average cost of the company s variable rate debt would result in a change in pre tax interest expense of approximately  based upon borrowings outstanding at december  commodity risk the company is exposed to fluctuations in market prices for commodities  especially steel 
due to increasing global demand for steel  coupled with steel supply constraints  the cost of steel has increased during the early part of at this time  the company is unable to predict the potential impact of rising steel costs on the cost of the company s products 
in addition  at this time  the company is unable to predict its ability  if any  to increase the selling price of its products to cover such costs 
the company has established arrangements to manage the negotiations of commodity prices and  where possible  to limit near term exposure to fluctuations in raw material prices 
currency risk the company has limited exposure to foreign currency exchange fluctuations 
certain sales are made in canadian dollars  however  to minimize this exposure  the company borrows in canadian dollars under the facility 
the company purchases certain inventory components and finished goods from suppliers in europe and japan 
to the extent the us dollar strengthens or weakens against the euro and the yen  the company s purchase price could be affected
