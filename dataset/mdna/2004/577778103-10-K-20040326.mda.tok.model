the decrease in the effective tax rate in compared with was due primarily to the favorable impact of eliminating goodwill amortization 
impact of inflation 
inflation did not have a material impact on our   or net sales or earnings 
we value inventory principally on a lifo basis  and as a result  the current cost of merchandise is reflected in current operating results 
financial condition return on equity 
return on equity is our principal measure for evaluating our performance for shareowners and our ability to invest shareowners funds profitably 
return on beginning equity was in  compared with in and in restructuring charges reduced return on equity by in and in return on net assets 
return on net assets measures performance independent of capital structure

business combinations in included the purchase of certain assets of gingiss formalwear  desmonds formalwear  and modern tuxedo 
in  business combinations included the acquisition of after hours  priscilla of boston  and nine department stores in the tennessee and louisiana markets 
liquidity and available credit 
we finance our activities primarily with cash flows from operations  borrowings under credit facilities  and issuances of long term debt 
we have billion of credit under unsecured revolving facilities consisting of a million multi year credit agreement expiring july   and a million day credit agreement expiring august  these credit agreements support our commercial paper borrowings 
financial covenants under the credit agreements include a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and a maximum debt to capitalization ratio 
we also maintain a million credit facility with a group of minority owned banks 
in addition  we have filed a shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission that enables us to issue up to million of debt securities 
annual maturities of long term debt  including sinking fund requirements and capital lease obligations  are million  million  million  million  and million for through maturities of long term debt are scheduled over the next years  with the largest single year principal repayment being million 
interest payments on long term debt are typically paid on a semi annual basis 
in february  our board of directors approved the repurchase of up to million of may common stock  and we announced our plans for early redemption of million of debentures due in we will incur costs of approximately million for the early redemption expected in august both the share repurchase and the debt redemption will be accomplished with internally generated funds 
off balance sheet financing 
we do not sell or securitize customer accounts receivable 
we have not entered into off balance sheet financing or other arrangements with any special purpose entity 
our existing operating leases do not contain any significant termination payments if lease options are not exercised 
the present value of operating leases minimum rents was million as of january  financial ratios 
our debt to capitalization and fixed charge coverage ratios are consistent with our capital structure objective 
our capital structure provides us with substantial financial and operational flexibility 
our debt to capitalization ratios were   and for   and  respectively 
for purposes of the debt to capitalization ratio  we define total debt as short term and long term debt including the employee stock ownership plan 
esop 
debt reduced by unearned compensation and the capitalized value of all leases  including operating leases 
we define capitalization as total debt  noncurrent deferred taxes  esop preference shares  and shareowners equity 
see profit sharing on page for discussion of the esop 
our fixed charge coverage ratios were x in  x in  and x in restructuring charges reduced the fixed charge coverage ratio by x in and x in employee stock options 
effective february   we began expensing the fair value of all stock based compensation granted after february  we adopted the fair value method prospectively 
the expense associated with stock options issued in was million  or per share 
common stock dividends and market prices 
our dividend policy is based on earnings growth and capital investment requirements 
we increased the annual dividend by to per share effective with the march dividend 
this is our th consecutive annual dividend increase 
we have paid consecutive quarterly dividends since the quarterly price ranges of the common stock and dividends per share in and were market price dividends market price dividends quarter high low per share high low per share first second third fourth year the approximate number of common shareowners as of march   was  contractual obligations 
the following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations as of january  in millions less than more than total year years years years long term debt   capital lease obligations operating lease obligations total   in the ordinary course of business  we enter into arrangements with vendors to purchase merchandise up to months in advance of expected delivery 
these purchase orders do not contain any significant termination payments or other penalties if cancelled 
critical accounting policies accounts receivable allowance 
in  approximately of our net sales were made under our department store credit programs  which resulted in customer accounts receivable balances of approximately billion at january  we have significant experience in managing our credit programs 
our allowance for doubtful accounts is based upon a number of factors including account write off experience  account aging  and year end balances 
we do not expect actual experience to vary significantly from our estimate 
retail inventory method 
under the retail inventory method  we record markdowns to value merchandise inventories at net realizable value 
we closely monitor actual and forecasted sales trends  current inventory levels  and aging information by merchandise categories 
if forecasted sales are not achieved  additional markdowns may be needed in future periods to clear excess or slow moving merchandise  which could result in lower gross margins 
asset impairments 
when a store experiences unfavorable operating performance  we evaluate whether an impairment charge should be recorded 
a store s assets are evaluated for impairment by comparing its estimated undiscounted cash flows with its carrying value 
if the cash flows are not sufficient to recover the carrying value  the assets are written down to fair value 
prior to  impairment losses associated with these reviews were not significant 
in  we recorded an asset impairment loss of million because of the planned divestiture of department stores 
in the future  if store for store sales decline and general economic conditions are negative  impairment losses could be significant 
self insurance reserves 
we self insure a portion of the exposure for costs related primarily to workers compensation and general liability 
expenses are recorded based on actuarial estimates for reported and incurred but not reported claims considering a number of factors  including historical claims experience  severity factors  litigation costs  inflation  and other actuarial assumptions 
although we do not expect the amount we will ultimately pay to differ significantly from our estimates  self insurance reserves could be affected if future claims experience differs significantly from the historical trends and our assumptions 
pension plans 
we use various assumptions and estimates to measure the expense and funded status of our pension plans 
those assumptions and estimates include discount rates  rates of return on plan assets  rates of future compensation increases  employee turnover rates  and anticipated mortality rates 
the use of different assumptions and estimates in our pension plans could result in a significantly different funded status and plan expense 
based on current estimates and assumptions  we believe our pension expense will be approximately million 
impact of new accounting pronouncements in may  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas no 
establishes standards that require companies to classify certain financial instruments as liabilities that were previously classified as equity 
we did not reclassify any financial instruments as a result of adopting sfas no 
in the first quarter of fiscal  we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which eliminates goodwill amortization and prescribes a new approach for assessing potential goodwill impairments 
our transitional assessment of potential goodwill impairments under sfas no 
did not identify any impairment 
goodwill amortization incurred in was million  or per share 
net earnings in  excluding goodwill amortization  were million  or per share 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk arises primarily from changes in interest rates on short term debt 
short term debt has generally been used to finance seasonal working capital needs  resulting in minimal exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
long term debt is at fixed interest rates 
our merchandise purchases are denominated in united states dollars 
operating expenses of our international offices located outside the united states are generally paid in local currency and are not material 
during fiscal   and  we were not party to any derivative financial instruments
