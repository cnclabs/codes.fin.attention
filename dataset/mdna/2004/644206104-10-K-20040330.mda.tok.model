item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereof appearing elsewhere in this report

as a result of the economic climate since  there has been a softening of the entire rental market where the partnership operates 
the softening resulted in industry wide declines in occupancy and revenue and increases in occupancy costs 
while the partnership was not immune to the overall market forces  it believes its active management  planned capital spending of prior years and response to competitive market forces reflect no decline in total same property rents and higher than industry standard occupancy 
increased marketing and turnover costs are reflected in the operations of the portfolio 
management believes that in the long run  the properties curb appeal and competitive position in the marketplace will result in higher revenue and stabilized operating costs 
management believes that will require continuing additional operational costs to sustain high occupancy levels 
however  management actively uses its purchasing power to mitigate utility cost increases  turnover costs  waste disposal costs and increases in insurance premiums while also pursuing aggressive tax abatement processes 
while future results may be negatively impacted by the economy  management also believes the acquisition of school street will offset some of the negative trends

in addition to the management fee  from time to time the partnership pays hamilton for repair and maintenance services  legal services  construction services and accounting services

of the funds paid to hamilton for this purpose  the great majority was to cover the cost of services provided by the hamilton maintenance department  including plumbing  electrical and carpentry services  snow removal and the use of equipment such as fork lifts

for more information on related party transactions  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements  in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  requires the partnership to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
the partnership regularly and continually evaluates its estimates  including those related to acquiring  developing and assessing the carrying values of its real estate properties and its investments in and advances to joint ventures 
the partnership bases its estimates on historical experience  current market conditions and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
see note to the consolidated financial statements  principles of consolidation 
revenue recognition revenues from rental properties are recognized when due from tenants 
residential leases are generally for terms of one year  and commercial leases are generally for five to ten years  with renewal options at increased rents 
significant commercial leases with stepped increases over the term of the lease are recorded on the straight line basis 
real estate and depreciation real estate assets are stated at the lower of cost or fair value  less accumulated depreciation 
costs related to the acquisition  development  construction and improvement of properties are capitalized  including interest  internal wages and benefits  real estate taxes and insurance 
capitalization usually begins with commencement of development activity and ends when the property is ready for leasing 
replacements and improvements such as hvac equipment  structural replacements  windows  appliances  flooring  carpeting  kitchen bath replacements and renovations are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives as follows depreciation is computed on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the related assets 
in assessing estimated useful lives  the partnership makes assumptions based on historical experience acquired from both within and outside the partnership 
these assumptions have a direct impact on the partnership s net income 
ordinary repairs and maintenance  such as unit cleaning and painting and appliance repairs  are expensed 
if there is an event or change in circumstances that indicates an impairment in the value of a property  the partnership s policy is to assess the impairment by making a comparison of the current and projected operating cash flows of the property over its remaining useful life  on an undiscounted basis  to the carrying amount of the property 
if the carrying value is in excess of the estimated projected operating cash flows of the property  the partnership would recognize an impairment loss equivalent to the amount required to adjust the carrying amount to its estimated fair value 
the partnership has not recognized an impairment loss since with respect to investments in and advances to joint ventures  the partnership looks to the underlying properties to assess performance and the recoverability of carrying amounts for those investments in a manner similar to direct investments in real estate properties 
an impairment charge is recorded if the carrying value of the investment exceeds its fair value 
legal contingencies the partnership is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise  from time to time  in the ordinary course of business 
these matters are frequently covered by insurance 
if it is determined that a loss is likely to occur  the estimated amount of the loss is recorded in the financial statements 
both the amount of the loss and the point at which its occurrence is considered likely can be difficult to determine
