the company intends to file grant thornton s report in an amended annual report on form k as soon as it is received 
the following analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements  including the notes thereto  contained elsewhere in this form k 
general the company is a holding company  which currently conducts business through its wholly owned subsidiaries through two divisions  the dhb armor group and the dhb sports group 
the armor group represented approximately  and of consolidated revenues of the company during  and  respectively 
the company s products are sold both nationally and internationally 
the armor group s sales are derived primarily from law enforcement agencies and military services 
sales to the us military comprise the largest portion of the armor group s business  followed by sales to federal  state and local law enforcement agencies  including correctional facilities 
accordingly  any substantial increase or reduction in government spending or change in emphasis in defense and law enforcement programs could have a material effect on the armor group s business 
the sports group manufactures and markets a variety of sports medicine  protective gear  health supports and magnetic therapy products under its own labels  private labels and house brands for major retailers 
the company derives substantially all of its revenues from sales of its products 
as indicated in the financial information included in this report  the company has experienced substantial increases in its revenues in the past several years  which has been attributable primarily to product demand from the us military and federal  state and local law enforcement 
the company s ability to maintain these revenue levels will be highly dependent on continued demand for body armor and projectile resistant clothing  and although the company does not foresee an immediate material reduction in such demand  there is no assurance that governmental agencies will not refocus their expenditures based on changed circumstances or otherwise 
due to its growth  the company has out grown its small business status under government procurement regulations 
the company is now recognized as having the ability to manage larger contracts 
this allows the company to competively bid on large procurements and maintain support of small businesses as subcontractors 
the company s market share is highly dependent upon the quality of its products  and its ability to deliver its products in a prompt and timely fashion 
to meet projected demand  and to maintain its ability to deliver quality products in a timely manner  the company has recently entered into a long term lease for a new  expanded production facility in pompano beach  florida 
however  there is no assurance that  in the long term  demand for the company s products will remain at recent levels  or that the company will be able to diversify into alternate markets or alternate products  or to increase its market share through acquisitions of other businesses 
management s current strategic focus is on quality and delivery  which management believes are the key elements in obtaining additional and repeat orders under to the company s existing procurement contracts with the us military and other governmental agencies
