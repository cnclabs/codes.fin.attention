item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation general the following discussion and analysis should be read with the financial statements and accompanying notes  included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
it is intended to assist the reader in understanding and evaluating our financial position 
overview we are involved in the development of controlled drug delivery systems and products 
our products are in varying stages of development and testing 
we also conduct research and development  from time to time  on behalf of other pharmaceutical companies although these activities have generated only limited revenue to date 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion addresses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgment  including those related to bad debts  intangible assets  income taxes  workers compensation  and contingencies and litigation 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
our most critical accounting policies include the recognition of revenue upon completion of certain phases of projects under research and development contracts 
the company also assesses a need for an allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that it believes is more likely than not to be realized 
the company assesses the recoverability of long lived assets and intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable 
the company assesses its exposure to current commitments and contingencies 
it should be noted that actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
during the year ended march   we elected to prospectively recognize the fair value of stock options granted to employees and members of the board of directors  effective as of the beginning of the fiscal year  which resulted in our taking a charge of  and  during the years ended march  and  respectively 
the fair value of stock options held by employees and members of the board of directors which have been granted or repriced subsequent to march  is expected to continue to affect the results of operations of future periods  as we continue to grant or reprice stock options to reward our management team 
year ended march  vs 
year ended march  our auditor s report on the accompanying financial statements states that such financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern 
we have incurred a significant loss and negative cash flows during our fiscal year ended march  which have significantly decreased our working capital and increased our accumulated deficit 
our auditors have stated in their report that these conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
the financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of the assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty 
management believes that cost reductions already implemented will reduce losses in the future  and with our existing working capital levels  anticipate that we will be able to continue our operations at least through the end of our current fiscal year 
our revenues for the year ended march  were  a decrease of  over the comparable prior year  or approximately from the prior year 
for the year ended march   revenues consisted of product formulation fees of  earned in conjunction with our joint venture in erl which terminated on september  of our revenues for the years ended march  and march    and  respectively  were research and development and testing fees earned in conjunction with our distinct development  license and manufacturing agreements 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended march  were  an increase of  or approximately from the prior year 
the increase in general and administrative expenses was substantially due to increases in legal and consulting fees as well as approximately  in expenses including  as compensation  resulting from a settlement of litigation instituted by our former president with respect to the termination of his employment agreement 
research and development costs for the year ended march   were  an increase of  or approximately from the prior year  due primarily due to increased research and development wages  additional biostudies  laboratory supplies and raw materials used in our research and development processes 
we expect our research and development costs to continue to increase in future periods as a result of the erl joint venture termination as we will be solely responsible to fund product development  which we will do from internal resources or through loans or investment by third parties 
we are unable to provide a break down of the specific costs associated with the research and development of each product on which we devoted resources because a significant portion of the costs are generally associated with salaries  laboratory supplies  laboratory and manufacturing expenses  utilities and similar expenses 
we have not historically allocated these expenses to any particular product 
in addition  we cannot estimate the additional costs and expenses that may be incurred in order to potentially complete the development of any product  nor can we estimate the amount of time that might be involved in such development because of the uncertainties associated with the development of controlled release drug delivery products as described in this report 
other expenses for the year ended march  were  an increase of  or approximately from the prior year 
the increase was primarily due to charges related to the modification of the warrant exchange offer  the issuance of stock options and warrants valued at  an increase of  and the reduction in interest income due to lower rates and compensating balances in the amount of  partially offset by increases in sale of new jersey tax losses of  and the related settlement of vendor litigation for  our net loss for the year ended march  was  as compared to  in the prior year  or an increase of approximately from the prior year  primarily due to the decrease in net revenues  and increases in research and development and administrative expenses  including increased charges of  due to the issuance of stock options  warrants and the modification of warrant exchange offer
