health card derives its revenue from the provision of comprehensive pharmacy benefit management services to sponsors of prescription benefit plans 
substantially all of the services health card provides to its sponsors are related to pharmacy benefit programs and services 
health card also recognizes administrative fees and earns rebates at the time of claims adjudication 
revenue for the pbm division is earned and recognized as follows administrative fees are agreed upon with the sponsor on either a per claim charge or a per plan participant per month charge 
per claim fees are billed to sponsors for the claims adjudicated during the period 
per plan participant per month fees are generally billed to sponsors at the beginning of the month 
the amount of revenue related to the drugs dispensed by pharmacies participating in health card s pharmacy network is recognized at the time of dispensing the drug as the cost is incurred 
the amount of revenue recognized is reduced by the amount of rebates that health card shares with its sponsors 
the specific terms of the contracts that health card enters into with its sponsors will determine whether health card recognizes the gross revenue related to the cost of the prescriptions filled 
in certain cases  the company has not recognized the gross revenue or cost related to prescriptions filled for a specific sponsor 
this has no impact on the company s gross profit since neither the prescription revenue nor the related cost of the prescriptions is recorded 
the following table sets forth the breakdown of health card s revenues relating to pharmaceuticals dispensed and administrative fees in thousands years ended june  revenues relating to pharmaceuticals    administrative fees and other    total revenues    health card does not take possession or legal ownership of the pharmaceuticals dispensed by the retail pharmacy network or its out sourced mail order facilities  although health card assumes the legal responsibility and financial risk of paying for dispensed pharmaceuticals whether or not health card is paid by its sponsors 
health card does take possession and dispenses pharmaceuticals from its mail order facility and its specialty pharmacy as of august  health card utilizes its comprehensive pharmacy benefit database to perform outcome studies and to develop disease information programs which are used to reduce overall healthcare costs 
the company s integrail division uses its software tools to analyze and predict outcomes for both medical and pharmacy data 
these programs currently produce a small amount of revenue  but are starting to attract interest in the marketplace 
health card believes that these value added information based services are becoming a more important component of managed care as well as management of the overall healthcare dollar  and therefore these services may provide an increasing source of revenue for health card in the future 
mail order recognizes revenue at the point of shipment for both the co pay collected from the individual member  as well as for the sale of the prescription to the pbm at specified prices 
revenue from this intercompany sale is elimiated in consolidation 
to date  mail order only fills prescriptions for nmhc plan sponsors 
revenue is recognized by ascend at the point of shipment to the member 
ascend invoices individual members  sponsors  and insurance companies as well as medicare and medicaid 
cost of claims includes the amounts paid to network pharmacies  including mail service pharmacies  for pharmaceutical claims  and reductions resulting from the gross rebates received from drug manufacturers 
cost of claims are recognized as follows the contractual obligation of health card to pay for these drugs is recorded as cost of claims at the time of dispensing of the drug by the pharmacy network 
cost of claims is reduced by the rebates that health card receives 
rebates are earned from drug manufacturers based on drugs utilized by plan participants at the time of dispensing 
these rebates  which varies by sponsor  is recorded monthly based upon the claims adjudicated in that month 
the amount of rebates recognized as reductions to revenue or cost of claims is based on estimates tied to actual claims data 
health card processes its rebate claims either direct with the drug manufacturers  through its wholly owned subsidiary  specialty  for which it receives administrative fees  or through a third party rebate administrator 
effective july   health card has entered into an agreement with a third party administrator to handle all of its consolidated rebate claims which it does not otherwise submit direct to the drug manufacturers 
the third party administrator provides estimates to health card based on its analysis of the amount of rebates that health card s claims should generate 
these estimates are prepared based on estimates of how health card s claims might influence the market share of a particular drug covered under an agreement with a drug manufacturer 
market share is generally defined as the percentage of utilization of a certain drug or drugs within its therapeutic class 
under health card s contract with the administrator  health card receives a specified minimum amount per claim days after the end of a quarter 
amounts above the minimum are shared between the administrator and health card with final settlement twelve months after a quarter end 
health card accrues rebates based upon an estimate provided by the administrator 
health card computes the amount of rebates due direct from the drug manufacturers based on the actual claims data  the criteria established in each individual contract  and the specified payment schedules 
the drug manufacturers are obligated to reimburse health card for earned rebates within a specified period of time 
quarterly  health card reconciles its estimates to amounts received from the manufacturers 
certain of health card s sponsors are entitled to all or a portion of rebates received by health card  which portion varies contractually by sponsor 
the manufacturer rebates retained by health card  after the sponsors receive their contractual amounts  have historically had a significant impact on health card s financial performance 
for the fiscal years ended june   and the rebates retained by health card has equaled  and  respectively  of the company s total gross profit 
due to the expected continued growth and diversification of health card s business  health card expects rebates to continue to account for a significant  but declining  percentage of its total gross profit 
if such rebate programs were to be discontinued or adversely altered by drug manufacturers  or government action  or if the terms of health card s rebate sharing arrangements with its sponsors were adversely altered when these arrangements expire  there could be a material adverse effect on health card s business  operating results and financial condition 
credit risk relating to the rebates receivable is evaluated based on the financial strength of the rebate administrator and the drug manufacturers plus health card s collection history 
the drug manufacturers contracted with are primarily fortune companies and health card has not had a history of write offs related to rebate receivables 
health card does not believe a credit risk reserve is necessary 
the pharmacy benefit management industry is intensely competitive  generally resulting in continuous pressure on health card s gross profit as a percentage of total revenue 
in recent years  industry consolidation and dramatic growth in managed healthcare have led to increasingly aggressive pricing of pharmacy benefit management services 
given the pressure on all parties to reduce healthcare costs  health card expects this competitive environment to continue for the foreseeable future 
health card plans to continue its organic growth through increased marketing of its services and by expanding the range of services offered  including value added consulting and information based services through its integrail division  mail order services through its facility in florida  and specialty pharmacy services through its ascend division 
health card believes these services to be in growing demand within the healthcare industry 
in addition  health card intends to continue to pursue an acquisition program to supplement its organic growth by making acquisitions of other pharmacy benefit management service providers  as well as related services providers

 results of operations fiscal year ended june  compared to fiscal year ended june  revenue increased million  or approximately  from million for the fiscal year ended june   to million for the fiscal year ended june  revenue recognized for contracts recorded on a gross revenue basis was million for the fiscal year ended june  and million for the fiscal year ended june  revenue recognized for contracts recorded on a net revenue basis was million for the fiscal year ended june  and million for the fiscal year ended june  the specific terms of the contracts that health card enters into with its sponsors will determine whether health card recognizes the gross revenue related to the cost of the prescriptions filled 
for those contracts that health card recognizes net revenue  there is no impact on gross profit since neither the prescription revenue nor the related costs of the prescriptions is recorded 
health card includes in revenue only those co payments collected in its mail order facility in miramar  florida 
for the twelve months ended june   there were approximately million of co payments included in revenue versus zero for the twelve months ended june  co payments retained by pharmacies on prescriptions filled for health card s members and not included in health card s revenue were million and million  for the twelve months ended june  and  respectively 
of the million increase in revenue in fiscal  million was due to the inclusion of revenues from ascend and inteq  which were included in the revenue for the twelve months ended june   but not in the twelve months ended june  another approximate million of the overall gross revenue increase was due to revenue related to new sponsors or new services offered during fiscal excluding contracts recorded on a net revenue basis 
an additional increase of approximately million was attributable to other existing sponsors as a result of several factors including higher charges relating to increased cost of pharmaceuticals  new drugs  plan participant growth and an increase in the average number of claims per plan participant 
these increases were partially offset by revenue decreases related to three factors the termination of existing customer contracts throughout the fiscal year including one major sponsor which terminated their contract effective december   leading to a reduction in revenue of approximately million  and there was one contract during the twelve months ended june  that the company recognized on a net revenue basis that was recognized on a gross revenue basis for four months during the twelve months ended june  due to a change in the contract terms effective november   this customer s revenue was recognized on a net basis from that point 
the revenue impact of this change was a year over year reduction of gross revenue of approximately million 
the third decrease occurred when rebates payable to the company s sponsors increased by million for the twelve months ended june  as compared to the twelve months ended june  since these rebates are treated as a reduction in revenue  this led to a reduction in the overall year over year revenue increase 
cost of claims increased million  or approximately  from million for the fiscal year ended june   to million for the fiscal year ended june  ascend and inteq accounted for million  of the net increase 
new sponsors and the growth in existing sponsors accounted for million of the increase 
this increase was partially offset by the three factors described in the previous paragraph  namely  the loss of sponsors which reduced cost of claims by million  the recognizing of a certain contract on a net revenue basis which reduced cost of claims by million  and an increase of million in gross rebates received  which is treated as a reduction in cost of claims 
as a percentage of revenue  cost of claims decreased from to for the fiscal years ended june  and june   respectively 
the same factors contributed to the declining costs as a percentage of revenue 
the major sponsor  which terminated its contract  is a managed care organization 
industry wide  managed care clients have a greater cost of claims  and consequently a lower gross margin  than other types of business in the pbm industry 
the new business the company brought on during the fiscal year ended june   for the most part was not managed care  so consequently the cost of claims on the new business was lower than on the business it replaced 
in addition  the contracts recognized on a net revenue basis decrease the overall company costs as a percentage of revenue due to the cost not being recognized on the contracts recorded on the net revenue basis 
gross profit increased from million for the fiscal year ended june  to million for the fiscal year ended june   a million  or  increase 
in addition to the revenue volume increase described above  ascend and inteq accounted for million  or  of the increase 
the increase in rebates and administrative fees related to the collection of rebates after accounting for the amount of rebates that are shared with sponsors  accounted for another million  or 
the balance of the increase relates to the margins on the new business that replaced the lost business and growth in the existing business from additional services provided 
gross profit  as a percentage of revenue  increased from to for the twelve months ended june  and june   respectively 
the contracts the company recognizes on a net revenue basis have the effect of improving the gross margin as a percent of revenue due to the lower revenue base 
the new activities at nmhcmail and ascend also led to an increase in gross profit percentage  year over year 
partially offsetting the impact of the net revenue and new activities  the company has seen some decline in profit margins due to competitive pressures 
selling  general  and administrative expenses  which include amounts charged by affiliates  increased million  or approximately  from million for the fiscal year ended june  to million for the fiscal year ended june  approximately million  or  of this increase in selling  general  and administrative expenses is related to new entities which were part of the company in the twelve months ended june  which were not part of the company during all of the twelve months ended june  the services provided by these entities include specialty pharmacy distribution through the company s acquisition of ppp  predictive modeling and consulting services through the company s acquisition of integrail  and mail order distribution through the company s owned facility in miramar  florida 
in addition  pbm services were complemented and enhanced by the acquisition of inteq 
the major components of the million increase in expenses related to new services was salaries and benefits approximately  postage and supplies approximately  equipment rental approximately  insurance approximately  marketing approximately  depreciation and amortization approximately  commissions to outside brokers approximately  and postage and shipping approximately  included in selling  general and administrative expenses for the twelve months ended june  were approximately  of non recurring expenses related to the new mountain transaction including transaction bonuses and a severance payment totaling  a non cash compensation charge of approximately  related to the acceleration of stock options for two directors who resigned upon the closing of the new mountain transaction and a non cash compensation charge and related expenses of approximately  related to stock options issued in lieu of a transaction bonus 
of the remaining approximate million increase in selling  general and administrative expenses during the twelve months ended june   the majority of the increase is related to the increased revenue and volume in the pbm 
salary and benefits related to new hires  temporary help  travel and entertainment  and commissions to internal sales people as well as external brokers have all increased year over year due to the increased volume of activity 
selling  general  and administrative expenses as a percent of revenue increased from for the fiscal year ended june  to for the fiscal year ended june  the main reasons for the increase are the impact of recognizing more contracts on a net revenue basis  as that has the effect of dividing these same expenses over a smaller gross revenue base  the million of non recurring expenses related to new mountain which added basis points  and the start up of nmhcmail 
for the fiscal year ended june   the company earned other income  net  of approximately  for the fiscal year ended june   the company incurred other expense  net  of approximately  the components of the approximate  increase in other income  net were an approximate  decrease in interest expense  an approximate  increase in interest income  slightly offset by an approximate  reduced gain on assets sold 
the primary reasons for the net increase in income were interest expense declined due to the reduced borrowings under the company s revolving credit facility due to increasing profitability and additional cash flow from operations see item  description of business recent acquisitions and developments  and note to the consolidated financial statements comprising item hereof  and interest income increased due to the interest portion of a settlement  with an outside party  related to past due rebates owed to the company  and excess cash balances related to some of the company s acquisitions 
the company entered into a new sale leaseback with an unrelated third party in november this led to an approximate  gain on the sale of assets during the twelve months ended june  the total gain from this transaction was approximately  which was recorded as deferred revenue and is being recognized over the life of the lease  which is thirty six months 
see note to the consolidated financial statements comprising item hereof 
this gain was offset by approximately  related to assets written off when ascend moved to a new facility in portland 
income before the provision for income taxes increased approximately million  or  from approximately million  for the fiscal year ended june   to approximately million for the fiscal year ended june  the primary reason for the increase was the improving efficiencies that come with scale arising from the integration of the acquisitions the company has completed 
the start up of the mail order facility had the impact of reducing overall profitability in the year ended june  the effective tax rate decreased from for the twelve months ended june  to for the twelve months ended june  the main reason for the decrease was a decline in the company s federal statutory rate 
net income for the fiscal year ended june  was approximately million as compared to approximately million for the fiscal year ended june   a increase 
net income for the twelve months ended june  includes the million after tax impact of the new mountain transaction items 
there were three other charges recorded to determine income loss available to common stockholders related to the new mountain transaction 
these include i series a preferred stock cash dividends approximately  the preferred stock provides for an initial cash dividend equal to of the investment amount currently million  which decreases to after the fifth anniversary of issuance see note to the consolidated financial statements comprising item hereof the dividend of approximately  represents the amount accrued and paid for the days from the closing of the new mountain transaction on march  to june   ii beneficial conversion feature million 
this non recurring  non cash charge represents the difference between the fair market value of the company s common stock on the date of the closing of the new mountain transaction and the effective conversion price of  and which is limited to the million purchase price for the series a preferred stock  and iii accretion of transaction expenses approximately  certain transaction costs related to the new mountain transaction of approximately million are deducted from net proceeds and the carrying value of the series a preferred stock 
these transaction costs are accreted to the series a preferred stock carrying value over the ten year life of the series a preferred stock investment 
the approximate  charge represents the accretion from march  to june  after deducting these three charges from net income there was a net loss available to common stockholders of approximately million for the twelve months ended june  since there was a loss  diluted eps for the twelve months ended june  equals basic eps of 
while net income and net income available to common stockholders excluding non recurring new mountain transaction items are not measures of financial performance under us generally accepted accounting principles  they are provided as information for investors for analysis purposes in evaluating the effect of the new mountain transaction on net income and net income available to common stockholders 
net income and net income available to common stockholders excluding non recurring new mountain transaction items are not meant to be considered a substitute or replacement for net income or net income loss available to common stockholders as prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the reconciliation from net income to net income available to common stockholders excluding non recurring new mountain transaction items  is as follows all amounts are in thousands  except per share amounts twelve months ended june  june  net income  as reported   add back transaction bonuses and severance payment  net of income tax benefit compensation charge related to stock option issued in lieu of transaction bonus  net of income tax benefit compensation charge related to the acceleration of directors options  net of income tax benefit net income excluding non recurring new mountain transaction items c   less preferred dividends  accretion of transaction expenses net income available to common shareholders excluding non recurring new mountain transaction items a   earnings per share excluding non recurring new mountain transaction items basic a b diluted c d weighted average number of shares outstanding basic b   diluted d   diluted weighted average number of shares assumes the conversion of the  shares of redeemable convertible preferred stock and dilutive common stock options and warrants 
the company has no off balance sheet transactions 
fiscal year ended june  compared to fiscal year ended june  revenue increased million  or approximately  from million for the fiscal year ended june   to million for the fiscal year ended june  revenue recognized for contracts recorded on a gross revenue basis was million for the fiscal year ended june  and million for the fiscal year ended june  revenue recognized for contracts recorded on a net revenue basis was million for the fiscal year ended june  and million for the fiscal year ended june  the specific terms of the contracts that health card enters into with its sponsors will determine whether health card recognizes the gross revenue related to the cost of the prescriptions filled 
for those contracts that health card recognizes net revenue  there is no impact on gross profit since neither the prescription revenue nor the related costs of the prescriptions is recorded 
of the million increase in revenue in fiscal  million was due to the inclusion of revenues from centrus  since it was acquired on january  and included a full fiscal year in compared to a little over five months in the fiscal year ended june  this increase due to centrus is a net amount and reflects the fact that one major sponsor terminated their contract effective december  and a new major sponsor was added in april another million of the overall gross revenue increase was due to revenue related to new sponsors or new services offered during fiscal unrelated to centrus customers and excluding contracts recorded on a net revenue basis 
also  million of the increase was from other existing sponsors as a result of several factors including higher charges relating to increased cost of pharmaceuticals  new drugs  plan participant growth and an increase in the average number of claims per plan participant 
these increases were partially offset by non centrus revenue decreases related to three factors the termination of existing customer contracts throughout the fiscal year including one major sponsor which terminated their contract effective june   leading to a reduction in revenue of approximately million  there was one contract during the twelve months ended june  that the company recognized on a net revenue basis that was recognized on a gross revenue basis during the twelve months ended june  due to a change in the contract terms effective november   this customer s revenue was recognized on a net basis from that point 
the revenue impact of this change was a year over year reduction of gross revenue of approximately million  and rebates payable to the company s non centrus sponsors increased by million for the twelve months ended june  as compared to the twelve months ended june  since these rebates are treated as a reduction in revenue  this led to a reduction in the overall year over year revenue increase 
cost of claims increased million  or approximately  from million for the fiscal year ended june   to million for the fiscal year ended june  centrus accounted for million  of the net increase 
this increase was partially offset by the three factors described in the previous paragraph  namely  the loss of sponsors which reduced cost of claims by million  the recognizing of a certain contract on a net revenue basis which reduced cost of claims by million  and 
an increase of million in gross rebates received  which is treated as a reduction in cost of claims 
the balance of the increase in cost of claims is related to the increased revenue as described above related to both new and existing sponsors 
as a percentage of revenue  cost of claims decreased from to for the fiscal years ended june  and june   respectively 
the same factors contributed to the declining costs as a percentage of revenue 
the two major sponsors  which terminated their contracts  are managed care organizations 
industry wide  managed care clients have a greater cost of claims  and consequently a lower gross margin  than other types of business in the pbm industry 
while not all of the revenue associated with these two sponsors was replaced by new business  the new business  for the most part was not managed care  so consequently the cost of claims on the new business was lower than on the business it replaced 
in addition  the contracts recognized on a net revenue basis decrease the overall company costs as a percentage of revenue due to the cost not being recognized on the contracts recorded on the net revenue basis 
the decline in cost of claims as a percentage of revenue was moderated by the higher cost of claims on the centrus book of business  which serves managed care clients primarily 
centrus cost of claims for the fiscal year ended june  ran about percentage points greater than the rest of the company s business  and since centrus accounted for of the company s revenue in the fiscal year  this impacted the overall cost of claims percentage 
gross profit increased from million for the fiscal year ended june  to million for the fiscal year ended june   a million  or  increase 
in addition  to the revenue volume increase  centrus accounted for million  or  of the increase 
the increase in rebates and administrative fees related to the collection of rebates after accounting for the amount of rebates that are shared with sponsors  accounted for another million  or 
gross profit  as a percentage of revenue  increased from to for the twelve months ended june  and june   respectively 
the contracts the company recognizes on a net revenue basis have the effect of improving the gross margin as a percent of revenue due to the lower revenue base 
partially offsetting this impact  the company has seen some decline in profit margins due to competitive pressures 
selling  general  and administrative expenses  which include amounts charged by affiliates  increased million  or approximately  from million for the fiscal year ended june  to million for the fiscal year ended june  this increase is primarily related to the acquisition of centrus 
while the expenses specifically related to centrus were million greater in the twelve months ended june  as compared to the five months since the acquisition in the twelve months ended june   this was partially offset by reductions in other areas of the company related to the full integration of centrus 
the company analyzed every department in the company and made decisions concerning the most efficient way to operate regardless of location 
this evaluation has led to synergies across the company and has allowed the company to maximize the utilization of its resources 
it is anticipated that this kind of analysis and deployment of resources will continue as the company grows 
selling  general  and administrative expenses also increased in the twelve months ended june  due to the start up of two new activities in the quarter ended december  the company acquired integrail as of november  see note to the consolidated financial statements comprising item hereof 
in the months since the company acquired integrail  approximately million of expenses were incurred primarily related to salary and benefits and depreciation and amortization 
the other activity was the start up of the build out of a mail order facility in miramar  florida 
prior to july   the company out sourced the total actual fulfillment of prescriptions that are ordered by mail 
by bringing these services in house the company will be better able to control service and cost for its customers 
for the twelve months ended june   approximately  of expenses were incurred on this endeavor 
the division started dispensing pharmaceuticals as of july  due to the additions of integrail and the mail order facility along with centrus for the full twelve months in the fiscal year ended june   the company s expenses increased million for expenditures related to increases in compensation and benefits  primarily associated with new employees including senior management 
some of this increase was also related to the replacement of resources from related parties with full time employees see below 
in addition  the company incurred the following additional expenses in the twelve months ended june  approximately  of expenses incurred related to two acquisitions which the company did not complete  approximately  related to a settlement of a new york state sales tax audit  and the payment of  related to a terminated consulting agreement 
general and administrative expenses charged by affiliates decreased approximately million  or  year over year from million to million for the fiscal years ended june  and june   respectively 
the company has eliminated many of the related party transactions effective january  the majority of the decrease related to reduced information technology services and management and consulting services procured from affiliated companies 
the hiring of full time employees and the use of outside consultants replaced the use of affiliated companies to update the information technology infrastructure 
selling  general  and administrative expenses as a percent of revenue increased from for the fiscal year ended june  to for the fiscal year ended june  the main reason for the increase is the impact of recognizing more contracts on a net revenue basis  as that has the effect of dividing these same expenses over a smaller gross revenue base 
in addition  the acquisition of integrail and the start up of nmhcmail led to an increase in this percentage 
for the fiscal year ended june   the company incurred other expense  net  of approximately  for the fiscal year ended june   the company incurred other expense  net  of approximately  the components of the approximate  increase in net expense were an approximate  increase in interest expense  an approximate  decrease in interest income  offset by an approximate  additional gain on assets sold during the fiscal year ended june  the primary reasons for the net increase in expense were the interest expense incurred on the company s revolving credit facility and on the note offering to finance the acquisition of centrus and integrail see item  description of business recent acquisitions  and notes and to the consolidated financial statements comprising item hereof  and the reduction in interest income since all cash balances go towards paying off the revolving credit facility 
partially offsetting the increase in other expense was an approximate  increase in deferred gain on the sale of assets related to a sale leaseback transaction  which gain of approximately  was recorded as deferred revenue and is being recognized over the life of the lease  which is thirty six months 
see note to the consolidated financial statements comprising item hereof 
income before the provision for income taxes increased approximately million  or  from approximately million  for the fiscal year ended june   to approximately million for the fiscal year ended june  the primary reason for the increase was the improving efficiencies that come with scale arising from the integration of the acquisitions the company has completed 
as mentioned previously  the acquisition of integrail and the start up of the mail order facility had the impact of reducing profitability in the year ended june  the effective tax rate increased from for the fiscal year ended june  to for the fiscal year ended june  the increase stemmed primarily from an increase in the state tax rate as more of the company s income has been allocated to higher taxed states 
net income for the fiscal year ended june  was approximately million as compared to approximately million for the fiscal year ended june   a increase 
earnings per diluted share increased by  to for the fiscal year ended june  the company has no off balance sheet transactions 
liquidity and capital resources the company s primary cash requirements are for capital expenditures and operating expenses  including cost of pharmaceuticals  software and hardware upgrades and the funding of accounts receivable 
effective july  the company requires cash to carry inventory in its mail order facility and specialty pharmacy 
the company also requires cash for potential acquisitions of other pharmacy benefit management companies or of companies providing related services 
as of june   the company had a working capital deficit of million as compared to a working capital deficit of million as of june  the primary reason for the improvement in working capital was the profitability generated by the company during the fiscal year ended june  the cash flow generated from operations million  plus the net proceeds of the new mountain transaction million  plus the proceeds the company received upon the exercise of stock options million  plus the repayment of affiliate loans million  were used to fund the acquisitions of inteq million and ppp million see item  description of business recent acquisitions and developments and note to consolidated financial statements comprising item hereof  repay the company s credit facility million  purchase capital assets million  pay preferred dividends million and pay additional consideration related to the centrus acquisition million 
the company s acquisitions have increased goodwill and other intangible assets which are long term assets  while decreasing working capital 
the company has now acquired six companies since july utilizing primarily cash 
this has had the effect of increasing the company s working capital deficits until sufficient profitability is generated to pay back the cost of the acquisitions 
net cash provided by operating activities was million and million for the fiscal years ended june  and  respectively 
one factor leading to the million increase in cash provided by operations was the million of incremental net income generated during the fiscal year ended june  as compared to the fiscal year ended june  another factor in the increase in cash was the growth in income tax payables and other current and long term liabilities which increased approximately million 
historically  the timing of the company s accounts receivable and accounts payable has generally been a net source of cash from operating activities 
this is the result of the terms of trade in place with plan sponsors on the one hand  and the company s pharmacy network on the other hand 
these terms generally lead to the company s payments to participating pharmacies being slower than its corresponding collections from plan sponsors 
the company believes that this situation is not unusual in the pharmacy benefit management industry and expects to operate on similar terms for the foreseeable future 
however  there can be no assurance that such terms of trade will continue in the future and  if they were to change materially  the company could require additional working capital financing 
the company has put in place a million revolving credit facility for acquisitions and working capital financing 
however  if such terms of trade were to change materially  and or if the company were unable to obtain additional working capital financing  there could be a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  or results of operations 
net cash used in investing activities was million for the twelve months ended june   as compared to million for the twelve months ended june  the primary differences in the two periods were the acquisition of inteq and ppp and the repayment of affiliate loans in the twelve months ended june   as compared to the acquisition of integrail in the twelve months ended june  in addition  there was a million increase in capital expenditures for the twelve months ended june  as compared to the twelve months ended june  the net cash outlay for inteq was million  representing the initial payment of million to the sellers and million to escrow plus approximately  of related expenses 
cash in the amount of approximately million was assumed in the acquisition 
the net cash outlay for ppp was million  representing the initial payment of million to the sellers   to pay off ppp s bank debt plus  of related expenses 
cash in the amount of approximately  was assumed in the acquisition 
in addition  approximately  has been accrued through june  as additional purchase price related to an earn out provision  which was paid in september see note to consolidated financial statements comprising item hereof 
the net cash outlay for integrail was million  representing the initial payment of million plus  of related expenses 
no cash was assumed in this acquisition 
during the year ended june  the company repaid a net of approximately million under its revolving credit facility 
the company also paid million towards its outstanding capital lease and other debt obligations during the fiscal year ended june  as stated previously  the company received a net of million from the new mountain transaction see item  description of business recent acquisitions  and note to the consolidated financial statements comprising item hereof  plus million from the exercise of stock options 
the company used some of these funds to pay million of preferred dividends for the twelve months ended june  on january   the company entered into a million revolving credit facility  details of which are set forth in item above and in note to the consolidated financial statements comprising item hereof 
borrowings of million under the facility were used to finance part of the purchase price of the company s acquisition of centrus 
the facility contains various covenants that  among other things  require the company to maintain certain financial ratios  as defined in the agreements governing the facility 
as of september   approximately million was outstanding under the facility  and the company was in compliance with its financial ratios covenants 
three of these financial covenants are based upon the ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization generated by the company over specified periods of time 
these covenants  ebitda for the current fiscal quarter  interest coverage ratio  and debt service coverage for the previous twelve months  are evaluated by the lender as a measure of the company s liquidity and its ability to meet all of its obligations under the facility 
ebitda is presented as cash flow from operations plus or minus the net changes in assets and liabilities and the changes in certain non cash reconciling items from net cash from operations to net income over the reported periods 
while ebitda is not a measure of financial performance nor liquidity under us generally accepted accounting principles  it is provided as information for investors for analysis purposes in light of the financial covenants referred to above 
ebitda is not meant to be considered a substitute or replacement for net income as prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the reconciliation from net cash from operations to ebitda is as follows see consolidated statement of cash flows comprising item hereof for more details year ended june  cash flow from operations    provision for income taxes    interest income expense  net net change in assets and liabilities    non cash items to reconcile net cash from operations to net income  ebitda    the company has entered into various capital lease transactions for hardware and software 
the company has also assumed various capital leases through its acquisitions

critical accounting policies and estimates general health card s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon health card s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires health card to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  these estimates and judgments also affect related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  health card evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  bad debt  intangible assets  income taxes  and financing operations 
health card bases its estimates on experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes that of its significant accounting policies see note to the consolidated financial statements comprising item hereof  the following may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity than others revenue recognition a since january   all services provided by the company have been on a fee for services basis 
under the fee for service arrangement  the company is paid by its sponsors for the company s contractually agreed upon rates based upon actual claims adjudicated  plus a fixed transaction fee 
revenue under the fee for service arrangement is recognized when the claims are adjudicated 
included as revenue are the company s administrative fees and charges relating to pharmaceuticals dispensed by the company s network of pharmacies 
revenue is reduced by the amount of rebates paid to the company s sponsors 
b the specific terms of the contracts that health card enters into with its sponsors will determine whether health card recognizes the gross revenue related to the cost of the prescriptions filled 
there are several factors from eitf that led the company to recognize the majority of its revenue on a gross basis 
these include the company acts as a principal and not an agent and is the primary obligor in the relationship among the pharmacies  the sponsors and the company  the company has credit risk  the company has certain latitude in establishing price  and the company has discretion in supplier selection 
in certain cases  primarily because the amount the company earns is fixed  the company has not recognized the gross revenue or cost related to prescriptions filled for a specific sponsor 
this has no impact on the company s gross profit since neither the prescription revenue nor the related cost of the prescriptions is recorded 
c health card includes in revenue only those co payments collected from individual members by its mail order facility in miramar  florida 
co payments retained by pharmacies on the remainder of the prescriptions filled for health card s members are not included in health card s reported revenue 
health card discloses these amounts parenthetically on the face of its consolidated statement of income 
d rebates are recognized when the company is entitled to them in accordance with the terms of its arrangements with drug manufacturers  third party rebate administrators  and sponsors  and when the amount of the rebates is determinable 
the company records the gross rebate receivable and the appropriate payable to the sponsors based on estimates  which are subject to final settlement 
the estimates are based upon the claims submitted and the company s rebate experience  and are adjusted as additional information becomes available 
bad debt health card maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the liability of its sponsors to make required payments 
if the financial condition of health card s sponsors were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
goodwill and intangible asset impairment in assessing the recoverability of the company s goodwill and other intangibles  the company must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to record impairment charges for these assets not previously recorded 
on july  the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  and will be required to analyze its goodwill for impairment issues on a periodic basis thereafter 
to date  the company has not recorded any impairment losses related to goodwill and other intangible assets 
deferred taxes health card periodically considers whether or not it should record a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while health card has considered future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event health card were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should health card determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made
