sequenom  spectrochip  and massarray tm are trademarks of sequonom  inc overview we are a genetics company organized into two distinct business units sequenom genetic systems and sequenom pharmaceuticals 
we have created high performance dna analysis technology and a platform that efficiently and precisely measures genetic variation 
both business units capitalize on this platform together with our detailed knowledge of specific genetic variations in humans 
since our inception  we have incurred significant losses 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we expect sequenom genetic systems to reduce its losses going forward  and expect to continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future in sequenom pharmaceuticals as we continue our research and development efforts in that unit 
sequenom genetic systems 
this business unit includes the sales and support of our massarray hardware  consumables and software product offerings  and research and development directed toward new products and applications for the massarray platform 
we have sold our products to genetics  pharmacogenetics  diagnostic  and agricultural biotechnology companies  as well as leading research institutions  in north america  europe  and asia 
as of december   our product revenues consisted of revenues from the sales of massarray systems and massarray consumables  maintenance agreements for systems  and sales and licensing of proprietary software 
in  we began marketing the massarray compact system  a smaller and lower throughput benchtop version of our massarray platform 
this version provides comparable data quality to the higher throughput version but has an upfront capital cost of approximately one half of that of the higher throughput version  which may expand our market potential 
we expect sequenom genetic systems to launch other new products and product applications periodically 
the impact of the massarray compact system and other new products and product applications on revenues  margins  expenses  and cash flows is uncertain and depends on many factors as described in this annual report on form k under the caption risks and uncertainties related to our business 
sequenom pharmaceuticals 
this business unit includes the provision of genetic services and operations relating to disease gene discovery  target identification  functional validation  and ultimately potential diagnostic and therapeutic product development 
sequenom pharmaceuticals applies human genetics to systematically identify potential disease associated genes that affect significant portions of the overall population 
this segment s revenues consist of genetic validation services  royalties on licensed technology  and research 
prior to december   we completed scans of the human genome 
through these scans  we identified over candidate genes indicating association with the following diseases breast cancer  lung cancer  prostrate cancer  
table of contents melanoma  schizophrenia  type ii diabetes  obesity  dyslipidemia hdl cholesterol  hypertension  osteoarthritis and osteoporosis 
we typically replicate our initial disease association findings in additional independent populations followed by appropriate biological confirmation experiments where feasible 
we have begun internal development on a small number of our validated genetic targets 
our goal is to develop these disease related gene targets to ultimately produce therapeutic and diagnostic products  predominantly through partnering with pharmaceutical  diagnostic and biotechnology companies 
revenues may fluctuate significantly as revenues are expected to be based upon out licensing of gene and target related intellectual property  and the obligations and timing of any licensing and milestone payments and the timing of any future diagnostic and therapeutic product sales 
these are all factors that are uncertain and difficult to predict 
to reach the ultimate goal of diagnostic or therapeutic product sales  significant dollar amounts will need to be invested in research and development efforts and regulatory approvals over several years 
the timing and impact of revenues and expenses is uncertain and depends on many factors as described in this annual report on form k  under the caption risks and uncertainties related to our business 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes 
certain of these accounting policies that we believe are the most critical to our investors understanding of our financial results and condition are discussed below 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
in preparing these financial statements  management uses its judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of certain estimates 
the application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of estimates and assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
revenue recognition in accordance with staff accounting bulleting sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  revenues are recognized  when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is fixed and determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we consider eitf  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  and for massarray system sales  the arrangement consideration is allocated among the separate units of accounting based on their relative fair values 
the separate units of accounting are typically the system and software itself and maintenance contracts sold at the time of the system sale 
revenue is deferred for fees received before earned 
revenues from sales of the massarray system and consumables are recognized generally upon shipment and transfer of title to the customer 
our contracts do not contain refund or cancellation clauses 
revenues from the sale or licensing of our proprietary software are recognized over the duration of the software license or upon transfer of title to the customer 
we recognize revenue allocated to maintenance fees for ongoing customer support over the maintenance period 
revenues from snp validation services are recognized at the completion of key stages in the performance of the service  which is generally delivery of snp assay information 
grant revenue is recorded as the research expenses relating to the grants are incurred  provided that the amounts received are not refundable if the research is not successful 
amounts received that are refundable if the research is not successful would be recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as revenue upon the grantor s acceptance of the success of the research results 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 

table of contents significant estimates are as follows accrued acquisition and integration costs 
to the extent that exact amounts were not determinable at the time of acquisition  we estimated amounts for direct costs of the acquisition of gemini genomics and axiom biotechnologies and the related integration costs in accordance with eitf  recognition of liabilities in connection with a purchase business combination 
amounts accrued relating to acquisition and integration costs totaled million and as of december  approximately million remained accrued 
this amount represents the remaining balance of what we expect to incur related to our surplus facility lease costs 
we do not know how long it will take us to sublease our remaining surplus space 
the amount accrued at december  represents approximately months of remaining lease payments  net of sublease income from existing subleased space  and if we do not sublease the remaining space by the end of that term we will incur additional expense of approximately  per month for more months 
impairment of long lived assets 
we periodically re evaluate the original assumptions and rationale utilized in the establishment of the carrying value and estimated lives of our long lived assets 
the criteria used for these evaluations include management s estimate of the asset s continuing ability to generate income from operations and positive cash flows in future periods as well as the strategic significance of any intangible assets in our business objectives 
if assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment recognized is the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
no impairment of long lived assets was recorded in a total impairment charge of million was recognized during the year ended december  intangible assets  primarily resulting from the acquisition of gemini genomics  totaled million  net of accumulated amortization  at december  reserves for obsolete and slow moving inventory 
we operate in an industry characterized by rapid improvements and changes to our technology and products 
the introduction of new products by us or our competitors can result in our inventory being rendered obsolete or requiring us to sell items at a discount to cost 
we estimate the recoverability of our inventory by reference to our internal estimates of future demands and product life cycles 
if we incorrectly forecast demand for our products or inadequately manage the introduction of new product lines  we could materially impact our financial statements by having excess inventory on hand 
our future estimates are subjective and could be incorrect 
during  slow moving inventory reserves of million were charged to cost of goods sold  and the total reserve was million at december  new accounting pronouncements in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas no 
affects the issuer s accounting for three types of freestanding financial instruments  a mandatorily redeemable shares which the issuing company is obligated to buy back in exchange for cash or other assets  b put options and forward purchase contracts that do or may require the issuer to buy back some of its shares in exchange for cash or other assets  and c obligations that can be settled with shares  the monetary value of which is fixed  ties solely or predominantly to a variable such as a market index  or varies inversely with the value of the issuer s shares 
sfas no 
also requires disclosures about alternative ways of settling the instruments and the capital structure of entities 
sfas no 
is effective for all financial instruments entered into or modified after may  and for all periods beginning after june  except for mandatorily redeemable financial instruments of nonpublic entities which are subject to the provisions of sfas no 
for the first fiscal period beginning after december  the adoption of sfas no 
has not had and we do not anticipate will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in november  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
fin requires a liability to be recorded in the guarantor s balance sheet upon issuance of a guarantee 
in addition  fin requires disclosures about the guarantees that an entity has issued  including a reconciliation of changes in the entity s product warranty liabilities 
the initial recognition and initial measurement provisions of fin are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  the disclosure requirements of fin are effective for financial statements ending after december  the adoption of fin has not had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
fin requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
in december  the fasb issued fin r  a revision to fin fin r provides a broad deferral of the latest date by which all public entities must apply fin to certain variable interest entities to the first reporting period ending after march  we do not expect the adoption of fin to have a material impact upon our financial position  cash flows or results of operations 
results of operations consolidated years ended december   and overview revenues total revenues were million  million and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
during the years ended december   and  product revenues were derived from the sale of massarray systems  consumables including our proprietary spectrochip bioarray  sales and licensing of our proprietary software and license fees from end users 
from the year ended december  to the year ended december   consumable revenues increased by million  or  due to increased numbers of systems in place with customers and an increase in the average consumable spend per installed system 
during the same period  massarray hardware sales declined by to million from million as the marketplace for high throughput systems became increasingly saturated 
service revenues decreased to million in  from million in and from million in the continued reduction in service revenue is because we have chosen to dedicate most of our capacity to internal discovery genetics programs and not to pursuing low margin collaborative genotyping services as our existing contracts were completed 
we expect that future revenues will be affected by  among other things  customer budgets  new product and application introductions  competitive conditions and government research funding 
cost of product and service revenues cost of product and service revenues were million  million and million and gross margins were  and for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the increasing gross margin reflects the shift in revenue from lower margin genetic service contracts towards higher margin consumables and hardware sales 
research and development costs research and development costs decreased to million from million after increasing from million in the years ending december    and  respectively 
the reduction in costs from to resulted from site consolidation following the gemini genomics and axiom acquisitions in the fourth quarter of and  respectively  reducing expenses by million  reduced headcount following cost reductions in late reducing salary expenses by million  a reduction in laboratory supplies of million  increased absorption of production costs into inventory of million  an elimination of bonuses paid to senior management reducing costs by million and million of general cost reduction 
we expect headcount in this area to increase during as we develop internal resources to help move our genetic discoveries towards proven drug targets 
the increase in costs from to was primarily a result of the acquisition of gemini genomics and axiom 
sales  general and administrative costs sales  general and administrative costs decreased by million to million in the year ended december  after increasing to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  the increase of million from to was largely due to increased costs resulting 
table of contents from the acquisition of gemini genomics and axiom in the fourth quarters of and  respectively 
the decrease in related to cost savings in settlement agreements for legal disputes of million  a reduction in legal fees of million due to fewer legal disputes  million from overseas headcount and site reduction following the closure of locations and elimination of headcount acquired during the mergers that were considered to be in excess of our current and future needs  reducing salary expenses by million  an elimination of bonuses paid to senior management reducing costs by million 
the remaining reduction of million was a result of general expense control 
we expect headcount to increase during as we strengthen our sales and field support operations 
impairment of assets and goodwill the impairment of assets and goodwill charge of million in the year ended december  consisted of two elements 
following the adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets we performed the annual test for impairment of goodwill at october  as a result of this test  we recognized a non cash charge of million to write off all the remaining goodwill in the sequenom pharmaceuticals segment arising from the acquisitions of gemini genomics and axiom biotechnologies 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we examine our tangible and intangible assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the long lived asset might not be recoverable 
as a result of this examination  we determined that long lived assets with a carrying amount of million were impaired and wrote them down to their estimated fair value of million 
fair value was based on discounted expected future cash flows to be generated by these assets 
these assets included licensed intellectual property  prepayments  software acquired as part of the gemini genomics acquisition  and fixed assets 
an impairment charge of million was accordingly recorded in the fourth quarter of for these assets  million relating to sequenom pharmaceuticals and the remaining million relating to sequenom genetic systems 
in process research and development in connection with the acquisition of axiom biotechnologies in and gemini genomics in  we recorded a non cash in process research and development charge of and million  respectively 
both amounts represented the value of the research and development projects acquired from axiom biotechnologies and gemini genomics that had not reached technological feasibility and did not have alternative future uses as of the date of acquisition 
integration costs the million integration charge in relates to our decision to close our uppsala  sweden facility that we acquired in the amount consisted primarily of book value of the assets at time of closure 
we do not anticipate any additional charges related to the closure of this facility 
amortization of acquired intangibles in connection with the acquisition of gemini genomics  we acquired approximately million of intangible assets  including clinical data collections and patent rights 
in connection with the acquisition of axiom biotechnologies  we acquired approximately million of intangible assets  including patent rights  human cell banks  and assay technology 
these intangible assets will be amortized over three to five years 
the amortization of million represents the amortization of all these assets held throughout the year 
the reduction in the amortization charge of million from to primarily relates to the loss of access to clinical data collections following the closure of our uppsala  sweden facility 
the amortization of million represents the amortization of the gemini genomics intangible assets throughout the year and the amortization of the axiom biotechnologies intangible assets from the date of acquisition 
the amortization of approximately million represents the amortization of the gemini genomics intangible assets from the date of acquisition in september through the end of 
table of contents amortization of deferred stock based compensation deferred stock compensation represents the difference between the estimated fair value of our common stock and the exercise price of options at the date of grant 
during the year ended december   we recorded amortization of deferred stock compensation totaling million  compared to million in and million in these amounts all relate to stock options granted prior to our initial public offering in january and were amortized over the vesting periods of the individual stock options in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
amortization was completed during we do not expect any additional deferred compensation or amortization of deferred compensation in interest income interest income was million in  compared to million in  and million in the decrease from to and from to resulted from lower interest rates and lower average balances of interest bearing investments 
interest expense interest expense was million in  compared to million in  and million in the increase over the three years is from the increase in the amount of debt outstanding during those years 
interest expense in all years resulted primarily from interest payments under our capital lease obligations and long term debt 
deferred income tax benefit the deferred tax benefit of million and million in and  respectively  is due to the amortization on the intangible assets  including clinical data collections and patent rights  acquired from gemini genomics 
cumulative effect of accounting change effective january   we adopted sfas no 
 which requires that goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have an indefinite useful life will no longer be amortized but will be reviewed for impairment upon adoption of sfas no 
and annually thereafter 
upon adoption of sfas no 
we recognized a non cash charge of million to reduce the carrying value of our goodwill 
the charge is non operational in nature and is reflected as a cumulative effect of an accounting change in the consolidated statement of operations 
under sfas no 
 goodwill impairment is deemed to exist if the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value 
no amortization on the goodwill arising as a result of our acquisition of gemini genomics in september was recognized during in accordance with the transition arrangements in sfas no 
quarterly and annual results as reported are therefore comparable 
income taxes as required by statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  we recognize tax assets on the balance sheet if it is more likely than not that they will be realized on future tax returns 
at december   we have provided a full valuation allowance against deferred tax assets of million  reflecting uncertainties associated with future profitability 
at december   we have federal and state tax net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively 
the difference between the federal and state tax loss carryforwards is attributable to the capitalization of research and development expenses for state tax purposes and the limitation on the california loss carryforwards 
the federal tax loss carryforwards will begin to expire in  unless previously utilized 
approximately  of the state tax loss carryforwards will expire in and the state tax loss carry forwards will continue to expire in unless previously utilized 

table of contents we also have german and united kingdom uk net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively  which may be carried forward indefinitely 
approximately million of the uk net operating loss carry forwards was acquired with the purchase of gemini genomics and is fully reserved by the valuation allowance 
to the extent these uk net operating loss carryforwards are utilized  such benefit will be recorded as a purchase accounting adjustment 
the deferred tax asset includes a future tax benefit of approximately million related to stock option deductions  which  if recognized  will be allocated to additional paid in capital 
we also have federal and state research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively 
the federal research and development tax credit carryforwards will begin to expire in unless previously utilized 
pursuant to internal revenue code sections and  use of the company s federal net operating loss and credit carryforwards may be limited due to a cumulative change in ownership of more than within a three year period 
use of our uk net operating loss carryforwards may be limited upon the occurrence of certain events such as the discontinuation or change in the nature or conduct of the business

genetic service revenue of approximately million and associated cost of product and service revenue of approximately allocated to sequenom genetic systems in the year ended december   have been reallocated to sequenom pharmaceuticals to conform with current year presentation in the segmental information provided above 
prior to  we operated in one business segment making it impracticable to provide separate financial information for sequenom genetic systems and sequenom pharmaceuticals 

table of contents we do not currently segregate assets by segment because a significant portion of our total assets are assets commonly used by both segments and cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
we are evaluating the feasibility and usefulness of assigning our other assets to sequenom genetic systems and sequenom pharmaceuticals segments and may report assets by segment in the future 
results of operations sequenom genetic systems years ended december  and revenues revenues for the year ended december  increased by million  or  from the year ended december   from million to million  primarily from an increase in sales of consumables from million to million offsetting a reduction in hardware sales from million in to million in consumable sales increased as the installed base of massarray systems and the average value of consumables used by each system increased in from hardware sales slowed during the same period as the market for high throughput systems became increasingly saturated 
we anticipate that commercial sales of the compact system during the first quarter of may increase hardware sales by addressing the needs of customers with smaller throughput requirements 
domestic and non us revenues were million and million for the year ended december and million and million for the year ended december   respectively 
we expect the decline in hardware sales volume to be reversed in through the introduction of our lower throughput massarray compact system 
cost of product revenues and gross margin cost of product revenues for the years ended december  and was million and million  respectively 
gross margin for the years ended december  and was and  respectively 
the decrease in the gross margin percentage in compared to resulted from a change in the overall mix of products sold in the product mix in included fewer massarray system hardware components but more higher margin consumable sales  offset by the phase out of old products as a result of new product offerings 
gross margin in future periods will be affected by  among other things  the mix of products sold  competitive conditions  sales volumes  and royalty payments on in licensed technologies 
research and development expenses these expenses consist primarily of salaries and related personnel costs  and costs related to developing next generation massarray products and product applications 
research and development expenses declined by million to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december   primarily resulting from a decrease in personnel and research spending of million  the transfer of resources to the sequenom pharmaceuticals segment decreasing segmental expenses by million  and million from an increase in costs absorbed into cost of product revenues  and offset by million in costs relating to products discontinued in the research and development phase in selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses for the years ended december  and decreased to million from million 
these expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs for sales and marketing  customer support  legal  finance and human resource personnel  and their related functions expenses 
the million decrease from to resulted from a transfer of resources to the pharmaceutical segment of million compared to spending levels  and a reduction of expenses from a reduction in personnel costs of million and other associated costs 

table of contents results of operations sequenom pharmaceuticals years ended december  and revenues total revenues for the sequenom pharmaceuticals segment decreased to million from million for the years ended december  and  respectively  following the completion of a major collaboration in june  we derived these revenues from the completion of significant phases of genetic service projects 
total domestic and non us revenues were million and million  respectively  for the year ended december and million and million  respectively  for the year ended december  the service revenue marketplace is competitive  tends to be lower margin  and we do not anticipate significant revenue from this area in the short term  if at all 
we are not actively pursuing further large genetic service contracts  focusing our resources on internal research and development programs 
research revenues for the year ended december  were approximately  decreasing from  for the year ended december  in   resulted from a research contract assumed in connection with the acquisition of axiom  for which we recognized  in this research contract was completed during the first quarter of and no further revenue is anticipated 
the remaining decrease arose from other research contracts and grant funding received 
we expect that future revenues will be affected by  among other things  customer budgets  competitive conditions and government research funding 
cost of revenue and gross margin cost of revenues for the years ended december  and were million and million  respectively 
gross margin for the years ended and were and  respectively 
gross margins on services are dependent on the particular contract terms of the work undertaken in each year 
research and development expenses research and development expenses for the years ended december  and were million and million  respectively 
these expenses consist primarily of salaries and related personnel costs  materials costs  costs related to our disease gene discovery programs  and costs relating to work performed under research contracts 
the million decrease resulted from the disposition of two foreign locations in  reducing our headcount and operating expenses by million  headcount reduction and reduced research spend of million  partially offset by reallocation of existing resources toward pharmaceutical research from the genetic systems segment increasing segmental expenses by million 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses for the years ended december  and were million and million  respectively 
these expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs for business development  legal  finance and human resource personnel  and their related expenses

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk short term investments the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities that we invest in may have market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the fair value of the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
for example  if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the then prevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises  the fair value of the principal amount of our investment will probably decline 
to minimize this risk in the future  we intend to maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  including commercial paper  money market funds  government and non government debt securities rated bbb or above by standard poors 
our investment policy includes a minimum quality rating for all new investments 
if an investment we hold falls below this level  we research the reasons for the fall and determine if we should continue to hold the investment in order to minimise our exposure to market risk of the investment 
we have not experienced any significant losses in our investment portfolio as a result of rating changes 
the average duration of all of our investments has generally been less than one year 
due to the short term nature of these investments  we believe we have no material exposure to interest rate risk arising from our investments 
therefore  no quantitative tabular disclosure is provided 
foreign currency rate fluctuations we have foreign subsidiaries whose functional currencies are the great british pound gbp and the euro eur 
the subsidiaries accounts are translated from the relevant functional currency to the us dollar using the current exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date  for balance sheet accounts  and using the average exchange rate during the period for revenues and expense accounts 
the effects of translation are recorded as a separate component of stockholders equity 
our subsidiaries conduct their business with customers in local currencies 
exchange gains and losses arising from these transactions are recorded using the actual exchange differences on the date of the transaction 
we have not taken any action to reduce our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  such as options or futures contracts  with respect to transactions with our subsidiaries or transactions with our customers where the invoicing currency is not the us dollar 
the table below sets forth our currency exposure ie  those transactional exposures that give rise to the net currency gains and losses recognized in the income and expenditure account on our net monetary assets and liabilities 
these exposures consist of our monetary assets and liabilities that are not denominated in the functional currency used by us or our subsidiary having the asset or liability 
as of december  net foreign monetary assets liabilities functional currency of operations euro us dollars gbp in millions great british pound euro a movement of in the us dollar to pound exchange rate would create an unrealized gain or loss of approximately  a movement of in the us dollar to euro exchange rate would create an unrealized gain or loss of approximately  we had no off balance sheet  or unrecognized  gains and losses in respect of financial instruments used as hedges at the beginning or end of the year ended december  we had no deferred gains or losses during the years ended december   or inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material adverse impact on our business or operating results during the periods presented
