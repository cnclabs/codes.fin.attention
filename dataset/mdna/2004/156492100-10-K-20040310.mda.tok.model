for the company  distractions from major construction in the casino  limited access to the casino from the adjoining parking lot during the first four months of the year  and poor weather conditions  particularly in march and april  had an adverse effect on casino revenue and overall operating results 
the casino has expanded the use of both radio and tv advertising in its efforts to compete for the pool of entertainment dollars 
management continues to focus on the marketing of the casino through the expansion of the successful gold club 
however  covered parking garages provided by two of our competitors  completed by september  have impacted the casino  particularly during inclement weather providing both with a significant number of close proximity parking places  an advantage previously held by womacks 
both competitors also have a large number of hotel rooms  providing them with an advantage during inclement weather and the peak tourist season 
the company has not yet decided on the next phase of expansion  but owns all of the vacant property adjacent to the casino and is able to expand if it concludes that the expansion is in the company s best interest 
when comparing to  there was a increase in the cripple creek market

on a portion of the leases  the manufacturer is guaranteed a minimum fee per day that can range from dollars to dollars for the duration of the lease 
in most instances  the branded games that are being introduced to the market are not available for purchase 
for financial reporting purposes  the net win on the slot machines is included in our revenue and the amount due to the manufacturer is recorded as an expense  in the period during which the revenue is earned  as casino operating cost 
management makes its decisions to introduce these machines based on the consumer demand for the product 
the amount paid under these agreements was  and in  and  respectively 
hotel  food and beverage when comparing and  an increase of in restaurant revenues is primarily a result of the visibility obtained by opening bob s grill on the gaming floor 
in the third quarter of womacks introduced bob s grill on the first floor of the casino and operated the gold mine restaurant on a limited schedule 
relocation of the restaurant to the first floor increased its visibility 
in february  we doubled the capacity of bob s grill and limited the use of the former gold mine restaurant  which is located on the second floor  to weekend and holiday buffets 
when comparing to  a decrease of in restaurant revenues is primarily attributable to reduced operating hours of gold mine restaurant 
in july  womacks introduced bob s grill on the main gaming floor to improve customer convenience and converted the upstairs restaurant to a fine dining restaurant with limited operating hours 
all of the revenue generated by the hotel operations is derived from comps to better players 
womacks hotel occupancy rate was in compared to in and in other comparing to  the increase in general and administrative costs is primarily attributable to womacks contributions to the campaign organized by colorado s gaming industry against the proposed introduction of video lottery terminals vlt s see liquidity and capital resources

since the purchase of the remaining interest in ccal in january  the company has focused on marketing the resort as a unified property  offering its guests an array of amenities that complement the gaming experience 
these include a room hotel  a variety of dining experiences  and the historic mineral hot spring spa 
the increase in casino expenses in excess of the increase in the corresponding revenue is attributable to the increased cost of marketing the casino  period cost associated with routine maintenance to the property  and to the effect of inflation 
ccal competes against a much larger competitor located in a more populous area of the western cape 
when comparing and  the increase in the gross casino revenue is primarily the result of the increase in number of slot machines and successful marketing efforts 
the relatively nominal increase in casino expenses  resulting in an improved casino margin was a result of management s ability to contain costs while increasing gaming revenue

goodwill and other intangible assets the company s goodwill results from the acquisitions of casino and hotel operations 
effective january  the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards board sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
addresses the methods used to capitalize  amortize and to assess impairment of intangible assets  including goodwill resulting from business combinations accounted for under the purchase method 
effective with the adoption of sfas no 
 the company no longer amortizes goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives  principally unamortized casino license costs 
in evaluating the company s capitalized casino license cost related to ccal  which comprises principally all of its other intangible assets  management considered all of the criteria set forth in sfas no 
in determining its useful life 
of particular significance in that evaluation was the existing regulatory provision for annual renewal of the license at minimal cost and the current practice of the western cape gambling and racing board board of granting such renewals as long as all applicable laws are complied with as well as compliance with the original conditions of the casino operator license as set forth by the board 
based on that evaluation  the company has deemed the casino license costs to have an indefinite life 
included in assets at december  is unamortized goodwill of approximately  and unamortized casino license costs of approximately the company completed its initial impairment test on each of the reporting units for which it has recorded goodwill in the company contracted third party valuation firms to complete the analysis of each reporting unit and continues to use the same methodology when updating its assessment on an annual basis 
in completing its analysis of the fair value of wmck venture corporation  parent company of womacks casino and hotel  the company uses the discounted cash flow dcf method in which the reporting unit is valued by discounting the projected cash flows  to a period in which the annual growth rate is expected to stabilize  to their present value based on a risk adjusted discount rate 
in completing its assessment in  cash flows were projected through  based on historical results  adjusted based on management s conservative projection of future revenue growth given existing market conditions 
a risk adjusted discount rate which estimates the return demanded by third party investors  taking into account market risks  and the cost of equity and after tax debt in the optimal hypothetical capital structure  was used in the dcf calculation of wmck venture corp 
in completing its analysis of the fair market value of century casinos caledon pty ltd  the owner of the caledon hotel  spa casino  the company also applied the dcf method and the results were compared to other methods of valuation  most notably the net asset value of caledon in order to further justify the range of values 
cash flows were projected through the end of a risk adjusted rate  taking into account risk free rates of return  the return demanded by the south african equity market and a risk factor which measures the volatility of caledon relative to the equity markets  was used in the dcf calculation of caledon 
the company also tests intangible assets deemed to have an indefinite useful life unamortized casino license costs  for impairment using the same methodology that it follows to assess goodwill 
the company has completed its assessment of the goodwill and other intangibles for the goodwill and other intangibles for impairment at december  and determined that there have been no significant changes in the fair value of the assets  no adverse changes in the projected cash flows or any events or circumstances that would lead management to believe that the fair value of the assets is less than the current carrying value of the reporting units 
the company will continue to assess goodwill and other intangibles for impairment at least annually hereafter

except for equity transactions and balances denominated in us dollars  the balance sheet is re valued based on the exchange rate at the end of the period 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk principally related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
to mitigate some of these risks  we utilize derivative financial instruments to hedge these exposures 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
all of the potential changes noted below are based on information available at december  actual results may differ materially 
interest rate sensitivity the company is subject to interest rate risk on the outstanding borrowing under the rcf with wells fargo bank 
interest on the agreement is variable based on the interest rate option selected by the company  whereby the interest on the outstanding debt is subject to fluctuations in the prime interest rate as set by wells fargo  or libor 
in order to minimize the risk of increases in the prime rate or libor  the company has two interest rate swap agreements on a total of million notional amount of debt 
in  the company entered into a five year interest rate swap agreement which matured on october  on million notional amount of debt under the rcf  whereby the company paid a libor based fixed rate of and received a libor based floating rate reset quarterly based on a three month rate 
in may  the company entered into a second five year interest rate swap agreement which matures on july  on million notional amount of debt under the rcf  whereby the company pays a libor based fixed rate of and receives a libor based floating rate reset quarterly based on a three month rate 
generally  the swap arrangement is advantageous to the company to the extent that interest rates increase in the future and disadvantageous to the extent that they decrease 
therefore  by entering into the interest rate swap agreements  we have a cash flow risk when interest rates drop 
for example  for each hypothetical basis points decrease in the three month libor rate below the fixed rate paid by the company less the applicable margin results in an increased use of in cash on an annual basis 
with the expiration of the swap agreement on the million notional amount of debt on october   the same hypothetical basis point increase results in an increased use of in cash on an annual basis 
in an environment of falling interest rates  as we have seen in the last two years  the swap agreements are disadvantageous 
without the swap agreements the weighted average interest rate on the rcf would have been in  in and in the company has not entered into any new swap agreements subsequent to october  foreign currency exchange risk the majority of our revenue  expense  and capital purchasing activities are transacted in us dollars 
however  since a portion of our operations are conducted outside of the us  we enter into transactions in other currencies  primarily the south african rand 
fluctuations in the rand affect the value of the company s investment in the caledon hotel  spa casino 
a hypothetical devaluation of in the dollar vs 
the rand based on the exchange rate as of december  would reduce the value of the company s investment by approximately million 
foreign currency fluctuations also have an impact on reported earnings  primarily those of the company s south african subsidiaries 
the company has reported its significant foreign currency activity  primarily south africa  in both rand and in us dollars  in its discussion and analysis of the south african segment beginning on page hereof
