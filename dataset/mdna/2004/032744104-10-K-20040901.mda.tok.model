the following discussion  other than historical facts  contains forward looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties 
the company s results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including factors described elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview the consolidated financial statements present the financial condition of the company as of june  and  and the consolidated results of operations and cash flows of the company for the years ended june   and the company designs  develops and markets microwave components and assemblies for the wireless communications  satellite communications and defense electronics markets 
the company s distinctive manufacturing and packaging techniques enable it to cost effectively produce compact  lightweight microwave products for use in base stations for wireless communications systems  in satellites and in defense electronics systems 
in  the company introduced new components addressing consumer wireless applications such as wireless local area networks  bluetooth  cellular handsets and satellite telecommunications 
the company sells its products to leading wireless communications equipment manufacturers such as ericsson  lucent technologies  motorola  nokia  nortel networks  and andrews and to satellite communications and defense electronics companies such as boeing satellite  itt  lockheed martin  northrup grumman and raytheon 
the company generally recognizes sales at the time products are shipped to customers  provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the sales price is fixed or easily determinable  collectibility is reasonably assured and title and risk of loss have passed to the customer 
title and the risks and rewards of ownership of products are generally transferred at the time of shipment 
payments received from customers in advance of products delivered are recorded as customer advance payments until earned 
annually  a small percentage of sales are derived from long term fixed price contracts for the sale of large space and defense electronics products 
sales and estimated profits under long term contracts are recognized using the percentage of completion method of accounting on a units of delivery basis 
profit estimates are revised periodically based upon changes in sales value and costs at completion 
any losses on these contracts are recognized in the period in which such losses are determined 
in march  as a result of the continuing low level of business at the company s rf power subsidiary  the decision was made to downsize the workforce at that facility 
sixteen people were subsequently terminated at a cost of  which has been recognized as a restructuring charge in the income statements 
in april  based on the then weak wireless market conditions and the financial performance of the company  the company s anaren microwave  inc subsidiary reduced its workforce by people 
in conjunction with this action  the company recorded a restructuring charge of  in the fourth quarter of fiscal on july   after several restructurings  the company announced its decision to dispose of its anaren europe subsidiary due to continuing low sales levels and large operating losses 
this facility ceased production during the first quarter of fiscal  an auction was held and all remaining equipment was sold in september this subsidiary is now being accounted for as a discontinued operation in the statements of earnings for the three years ended   and included in the results of discontinued operations for fiscal are a loss from european operations of million and a us tax benefit of million resulting from investment losses attributable to anaren europe

results of operations net sales from continuing operations for the year ended june  were million  up from million for fiscal income from continuing operations for fiscal was million  or of net sales  up million  or from income from continuing operations of million in fiscal the following table sets forth the percentage relationships of certain items from the company s consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated years ended june  net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses marketing research and development general and administrative restructuring total operating expenses operating income other income expense interest expense other  primarily interest income total other income income from continuing operations before income taxes income taxes net income from continuing operations discontinued operations income loss from discontinued operations of anaren europe income tax benefit net income loss from discontinued operations 
net income loss the following table sets forth the company s net sales by industry segment for the periods indicated years ended june  in thousands wireless    space defense    year ended june  compared to year ended june  net sales 
net sales increased million  or  to million for the year ended june   compared to million for fiscal this increase resulted from a million rise in sales of wireless infrastructure equipment which more than offset a million decline in sales of space and defense products 
the increase in sales of wireless products  which consisted of standard components  ferrite components  and custom subassemblies for use in building wireless base station equipment  was the result of a significant increase in worldwide demand for wireless base station components over the last twelve months 
this demand generated increased orders from a majority of the company s base station infrastructure original equipment manufacturing customers in fiscal sales of standard components and custom subassemblies rose million  or in the current year compared to fiscal this increase was partially offset by a million  or decrease in sales of ferrite component products in fiscal compared to last year as a result of the company s continuing efforts to eliminate unprofitable and low margin ferrite products in fiscal space and defense products consist of custom components and assemblies for communication satellites and defense radar and countermeasure subsystems for the military 
sales in the space and defense group fell million  or in fiscal to million  compared to fiscal this decrease in sales resulted from the completion of shipments under the boeing spaceway program in the fourth quarter of fiscal this program accounted for over million in shipments in fiscal this decline in commercial space revenue in fiscal was partially off set by a million increase in military space and defense product sales 
sales in the space and defense segment are expected to average between to million per quarter through the first half of fiscal gross profit 
cost of sales consists primarily of engineering design costs  materials  material fabrication costs  assembly costs  direct and indirect overhead  and test costs 
gross profit for fiscal was million of net sales  up million from million of net sales for fiscal the rise in gross margin as a percent of sales was a result of the million decrease in sales of unprofitable and low margin ferrite products  coupled with million increase in sales of higher margin surface mount and custom wireless products in fiscal compared to fiscal the company expects gross margins to continue at current levels over the next few quarters 
marketing 
marketing expenses consist mainly of employee related expenses  commissions paid to sales representatives  trade show expenses  advertising expenses and related travel expenses 
marketing expenses were million of net sales for fiscal  up  from million of net sales for fiscal this increase is a result of the addition of three new geographic product line marketing positions and a general increase in sales and marketing support costs to meet the increased demand in both the wireless and space and defense markets that the company has experienced over the last year 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist of material and salaries and related overhead costs of employees engaged in ongoing research  design and development activities associated with new products and technology development 
research and development expenses were million of net sales in fiscal  down from million of net sales for fiscal research and development expenditures are supporting further development of wireless infrastructure products and new wireless networking product opportunities 
research and development expenditures fell in fiscal compared to the prior year due to a significantly higher level of customer funded development activity in the space and defense group  resulting in a higher level of engineering costs being included in cost of goods sold 
despite the current temporary decline in spending  the company does not expect to significantly reduce its current research and development efforts in the long term and is presently working on a number of new standard wireless products 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist of employee related expenses  professional services  intangible amortization  travel related expenses and other corporate administrative costs 
general and administrative expenses increased to million of net sales for fiscal from million of net sales for last fiscal year 
this increase resulted primarily from rising administrative costs due to sarbanes oxley regulations  a rise in corporate donations to a local university to support development of new microwave engineering talent  and a one time charge of  to recognize the cost of settling the existing lease for amitron s current facility in north andover  net of offsetting decreases resulting from fiscal cost cutting initiatives 
restructuring 
there were no restructuring charges in fiscal in fiscal  the company recorded a restructuring charge of  related to the company s restructuring plans at its rf power and anaren microwave  inc subsidiaries 
these plans were primarily aimed at reducing the cost of excess personnel and included the termination of employees 
operating income operating income increased in fiscal to million of sales from million of net sales for fiscal on a reporting segment basis  wireless operating income was million for fiscal  an improvement of million from a wireless operating loss of million for fiscal the main reasons for the increase in wireless income in the current year were the company s restructuring and cost reduction activities in the second half of fiscal which lowered wireless operating costs  the discontinuation of some unprofitable and low margin wireless ferrite products  and the million increase in wireless sales in the current year compared to fiscal in fiscal  wireless operating margins are expected to approximate current levels depending on sales volume and product mix 
space and defense operating income fell  in fiscal to million  compared to million in fiscal this decrease resulted from the lower sales volume and a change in product mix during the current year compared to fiscal this year s sales included more volume attributable to military programs  while sales for fiscal consisted of more profitable shipments for commercial space programs 
going forward  we expect space and defense sales to be driven primarily by defense related programs 
other income 
other income is primarily interest income received on invested cash balances 
other income decreased to million of net sales for fiscal  from million of net sales for fiscal this decrease was caused by the decline in market interest rates over the last months brought about by reductions in the federal funds rate and the decrease in investable cash balances due to the million expenditure to repurchase shares of the company s common stock for treasury shares during fiscal interest income will fluctuate based on the level of interest rates and the size of investable cash balances 
income taxes income taxes for fiscal were million of net sales  representing an effective tax rate of 
this compares to income tax expense of  of net sales for fiscal  representing an effective tax rate of 
the company s effective tax rate is a direct result of the proportion of federally exempt state municipal bond income  federal tax credits and export tax benefits in relation to the anticipated levels of taxable income for the entire fiscal year 
discontinued operations 
on july   the company announced its decision to dispose of its anaren europe operation 
during the first quarter of fiscal  the company ceased production at anaren europe and the remaining net assets of that operation were liquidated 
effective with the company s form q quarterly report for the first quarter ended september   the results of operations for anaren europe for both the current and prior years have been reclassified as discontinued operations in the statement of earnings 
discontinued operations for the year ended june  included a loss from discontinued operations of million and a tax benefit of million from the write off of the company s investment resulting in a net gain of  for fiscal the company had a net loss from discontinued operations of million and a tax benefit of  resulting in a net loss of million 
year ended june  compared to year ended june  net sales 
net sales increased million  or  to million for fiscal  compared to million for the prior fiscal year 
this increase consisted of a million rise in wireless sales and a million increase in sales of space and defense products 
the million increase in fiscal wireless sales resulted from a combination of a new acquisition during fiscal and increased customer demand 
wireless sales for fiscal include a full twelve months of sales for amitron  while sales for fiscal included only ten months of sales for amitron 
the amitron acquisition resulted in additional sales in fiscal of million compared to fiscal sales levels 
additionally  customer wireless infrastructure demand rose slightly in the first and second quarters  coming mainly from asian infrastructure build outs 
sales in the space and defense group rose million  or  in fiscal  compared to the prior fiscal year 
this increase in shipments resulted from a number of defense contracts for digital frequency discriminators dfds and digital rf memories drfms for foreign applications  radar antenna feed networks and precision ranging subsystems prss for us government applications 
these products contributed to the rise in defense orders in the company s backlog during fiscal gross profit 
gross profit for fiscal was million of net sales  down million from million of net sales for fiscal the decline in margins as a percent of net sales in fiscal resulted from continuing price pressure from wireless customers  which has resulted in lower average sale prices year over year and from the million increase in sales of space and defense products which normally have a somewhat lower gross margin than typical wireless products 
marketing 
marketing expenses decreased to million of net sales for fiscal from million of net sales for fiscal marketing expense declined in fiscal due to a budgeted decline in advertising expenditures in fiscal compared to fiscal and the reassignment of some marketing personnel to other company functions 
research and development

general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist of employee related expenses  professional services  and intangible amortization  travel related expenses and other corporate costs 
general and administrative expenses increased to million of net sales for fiscal from million of net sales for fiscal this increase was due to professional services costs associated with the celeritek offer  costs incurred at the new china facility  and a full twelve months of general and administrative expenditures for amitron compared to ten months in fiscal restructuring 
in march  the company recorded a restructuring charge of  related to the company s restructuring plan at its rf power subsidiary 
this plan was primarily aimed at reducing the cost of excess personnel in this operation and included the termination of employees 
in june  the company also incurred a restructuring charge of  related to the company s restructuring plan to reduce overhead at its anaren microwave  inc subsidiary 
this plan was aimed at reducing the excess cost of indirect personnel at this operation and included the termination of individuals 
the remaining restructuring accrual will be paid in full during fiscal operating income 
operating income decreased million in fiscal to million of net sales from million of net sales for fiscal on a reporting segment basis  the wireless operating loss was million for fiscal  a decrease of million from a wireless operating loss of million in fiscal the main reason for the improvement in wireless operating income in fiscal was the million increase in wireless sales coupled with various cost cutting efforts which improved wireless gross margins year over year 
space and defense operating income fell million in fiscal to million compared to million in fiscal this decrease resulted from a change in product mix during fiscal compared to fiscal fiscal sales included more military programs  while sales in fiscal consisted of more profitable commercial space programs 
other income 
other income is primarily interest income received on invested cash balances 
other income decreased to million of net sales for the year ended june   from million of net sales for fiscal this decrease was caused mainly by the decline in market interest rates over the months ended june   brought about by reductions in the federal fund rates

critical accounting policies the methods  estimates and judgments management uses in applying the company s most critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results reported in the company s financial statements 
the us securities and exchange commission has defined the most critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of anaren s financial condition and results  and that require management to make the most difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
based on this definition  the company s most critical policies include valuation of accounts receivable  which impacts general and administrative expense  valuation of inventory  which impacts cost of sales and gross margin  the assessment of recoverability of goodwill and other intangible and long lived assets  which impacts write offs of goodwill  intangibles and long lived assets  and accounting for income taxes  which impacts the valuation allowance and the effective tax rate 
management reviews the estimates  including  but not limited to  allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory reserves and income tax valuations on a regular basis and makes adjustments based on historical experiences  current conditions and future expectations 
the reviews are performed regularly and adjustments are made as required by current available information 
the company believes these estimates are reasonable  but actual results could differ from these estimates 
the company s accounts receivable represent those amounts which have been billed to its customers but not yet collected 
the company analyzes various factors including historical experience  credit worthiness of customers and current market and economic conditions 
the allowance for doubtful accounts balance is established based on the portion of those accounts receivable which are deemed to be potentially uncollectible 
changes in judgments on these factors could impact the timing of costs recognized 
the company states inventories at the lower of cost or market  using a standard cost methodology to determine the cost basis for the inventory 
this method approximates actual cost on a first in first out basis 
the recoverability of inventories is based on the types and levels of inventory held  forecasted demand  pricing  competition and changes in technology 
the company records valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion of the amount may not be realized 
the company evaluates the need for valuation allowances on a regular basis and adjusts the allowance as needed 
these adjustments  when made  would have an impact on the company s financial statements in the period that they were recorded 
intangible assets with estimable useful lives are amortized to their residual values over those estimated useful lives in proportion to the economic benefit consumed 
long lived assets with estimated useful lives are depreciated to their residual values over those useful lives in proportion to the economic value consumed 
long lived assets are tested for impairment at the group level  which is usually an economic unit such as a manufacturing facility or department  which has a measurable economic output or product 
long lived assets are tested for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a long lived asset may not be recoverable and exceeds its fair market value 
this circumstance exists if the carrying amount of the assets in question exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset 
the impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of a long lived asset exceeds its fair value as determined by the discounted cash flow or in the case of negative cash flow  an independent market appraisal of the asset 
goodwill is tested annually  or sooner if indicators of impairment exist  for impairment by the company at the reporting unit level by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying value 
valuation methods for determining the fair value of the reporting unit include reviewing quoted market prices and discounted cash flows 
if the goodwill is indicated as being impaired the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount  the fair value of the reporting unit is then allocated to its assets and liabilities in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill 
this implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill is then compared with the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill and  if it is less  the company would then recognize an impairment loss 
the projection of future cash flows for the goodwill impairment analysis requires significant judgments and estimates with respect to future revenues related to the assets and the future cash outlays related to those revenues 
actual revenues and related cash flows or changes in anticipated revenues and related cash flows could result in changes in this assessment and result in an impairment charge 
the use of different assumptions could increase or decrease the related impairment charge 
liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operations for the years ended june   and was million  million and million  respectively 
the positive cash flow from operations was due primarily to profit before depreciation in each year 
in fiscal cash flow was decreased by a rise in receivables  while in fiscal and cash flows were increased due to a decline in receivables and inventory 
net cash provided by investing activities for fiscal was million and consisted of net maturities of marketable debt securities of million  and a return of capital dividend on equity securities celeritek  inc held for resale of million  less million used to fund capital equipment acquisitions 
additionally  in fiscal  million was generated in discontinued operations in europe through the auction sale of capital equipment 
net cash used in investing activities in fiscal was million and consisted of million in capital expenditures  million used to make business acquisitions and million related to the discontinued anaren europe operation 
additionally in fiscal  million was provided by maturities of marketable debt securities 
net cash used in investing activities in fiscal was million and consisted of million used to acquire capital equipment and net purchases of marketable debt securities amounting to million

of the fiscal amount   was generated from the exercise of stock options and million was expended to repurchase  of the company s stock 
the fiscal amount consisted of  provided by the exercise of stock options and million used to pay off acquisition loans 
the company expects to continue to purchase shares of its common stock in the open market and or through private negotiated transactions under the current board authorization  depending on market conditions 
at june   there were  shares remaining under the current board repurchase authorization 
on august   the board increased its repurchase authorization by two million shares  and for the period july through august  the company repurchased an additional  shares  leaving  under the current authorization 
at june   the company had approximately million in cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities and no debt  and has had positive operating cash flow for over eight years 
the company believes that its cash requirements for the foreseeable future will be satisfied by currently invested cash balances and expected cash flows from operations

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discusses the company s possible exposure to market risk related to changes in interest rates  equity prices and foreign currency exchange rates 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties 
results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including factors described elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
as of june   the company had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of million  of which approximately million consisted of highly liquid investments in marketable debt securities and million consisted of marketable equity securities 
the marketable debt securities at date of purchase normally have maturities between one and months  are exposed to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase 
a hypothetical decrease in market interest rate of from june  rates  or  would have reduced net income and cash flow by approximately  or per share for the year 
due to the relatively short maturities of the securities and its ability to hold those investments to maturity  the company does not believe that an immediate decrease in interest rates would have a significant effect on its financial condition or results of operations 
over time  however  declines in interest rates will reduce the company s interest income 
the company currently owns equity investments held for sale with a market value of approximately million 
fluctuations in market value of these securities are charged to stockholders equity monthly 
a theoretical decline in market value of these securities would result in a  reduction in stockholders equity 
in the future  if the decline in value of these securities is considered other than temporary  then the full decline in value experienced to the date of impairment will be reflected in the then current period income statement 
all of the company s sales from its domestic us subsidiaries to foreign customers are denominated in united states dollars and  accordingly  are not exposed to foreign currency exchange risk
