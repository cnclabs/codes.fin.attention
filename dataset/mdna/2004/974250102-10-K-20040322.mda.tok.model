critical accounting policies we prepare the consolidated financial statements of winmark corporation and subsidiary in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america

these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods presented 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from these estimates 
the following critical accounting policies that we believe are most important to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following revenue recognition the company collects royalties from each franchise based on a percentage of retail store gross sales 
the company recognizes royalties as revenue when earned 
at the end of each accounting period  estimates of royalty amounts due are made based on historical sales information 
if there are significant changes in the estimates of franchise sales our revenue would be impacted 
the company collects franchise fees when franchise agreements are signed and recognizes the franchise fees as revenue when the store is opened  which is when the company has performed substantially all initial services required by the franchise agreement 
franchise fees collected from franchisees but not yet recognized as income  are recorded as deferred revenue in the liability section of our balance sheet

revenue from sales at our company owned stores are recognized at the time of the merchandise sale 
allowance for doubtful accounts we must make estimates of the uncollectability of our accounts and notes receivables

if any of the above noted items would be significantly different than estimates  our results could be different 
inventory reserve the company values its inventory at the lower of cost  as determined by the average weighted cost method  or market

investors are cautioned to consider these forward looking statements in light of important factors which may result in variations from results contemplated by such forward looking statements including  but not limited to the risk factors discussed below 
risk factors dependence on renewals 
each of our franchise agreements is years long 
at the end of the term of each franchise agreement  each franchisee has the option to renew the franchise relationship by signing a new year franchise agreement 
in  of the franchisees that had their play it again sports franchise agreement expire  signed new year franchise agreements 
in  and   and play it again sports franchise agreements will expire  respectively 
we believe that renewing a significant number of these franchise relationships is extremely important to the success of the company 
if a significant number of such franchise relationships are not renewed  our financial performance may be materially and adversely affected 
in  of the franchisees that had their once upon a child franchise agreement expire  signed new year franchise agreements 
in  and   and once upon a child franchise agreements will expire  respectively 
we believe that renewing a significant number of these franchise relationships is extremely important to the continued success of the company 
if a significant number of such franchise relationships are not renewed  our financial performance may be materially and adversely affected 
decline in number of franchises 
in  play it again sports closed stores and opened stores  a net loss of stores 
in  play it again sports closed stores and opened stores  a net loss of stores 
in  play it again sports closed stores and opened stores  a net loss of stores 
in  play it again sports closed stores and opened stores  a net loss of stores 
in  play it again sports closed stores and opened stores  a net loss of stores 
in  play it again sports closed stores and opened stores  a net loss of stores 
it is very important to the future success of the company that the net loss of play it again sports stores be slowed and ultimately reversed 
we believe that a certain number of stores will close each year 
our objective is to minimize store closings by continuing our investment in franchisee support services such as franchisee training  winmark business solutions and the winmark computer support center  by investing capital to improve winmark s proprietary point of sale software system and continuing to train our field operations personnel to better serve franchisee needs 
dependence on new franchisees 
our ability to generate increased revenue and achieve higher levels of profitability depends on increasing the number of franchised stores open 
we believe that many larger and smaller markets will continue to provide significant opportunities for sales of franchises and that we can sustain approximately our current annual level of store openings 
however  there can be no assurance that we will sustain this level of store openings 
inability to collect accounts receivable 
in the event that our ability to collect accounts receivable significantly declines from current rates  we may incur additional charges that affect earnings 
unopened stores 
we believe that a substantial majority of stores sold but not opened will open within the time period permitted by the applicable franchise agreement or we will be able to resell the territories for most of the terminated or expired franchises 
however  there can be no assurance that substantially all of the currently sold but unopened franchises will open and commence paying royalties to us 
at december   we had franchise agreements for stores that are expected to open in dependence on supply of used merchandise 
our brands are based on offering customers a mix of used and new merchandise 
as a result  obtaining continuing supplies of high quality used merchandise is important to the success of our brands 
supply of used merchandise comes from the general public and is not regular or highly reliable 
there can be no assurance that we will avoid supply problems with respect to used merchandise 
lease terminations 
we have closed or sold a number of our company owned stores over the past several years 
we have been negotiating lease terminations relative to the closed stores 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully negotiate satisfactory terminations of such remaining leases 
we remain contingently liable with respect to the leases relating to certain company stores sold 
there can be no assurance that such independent third parties will comply with the terms and conditions of such leases  in which case we will be responsible to make payments owed under such leases 
we believe that we have adequate reserves to cover any prospective liability with respect to such leases 
competition 
retailing  including the sale of sporting goods  children and teenage apparel  and musical instruments  is highly competitive 
many retailers have significantly greater financial and other resources than us and our franchisees 
individual franchisees face competition in their markets from retailers of new merchandise and  in certain instances  resale  thrift and other stores that sell used merchandise 
to date  our franchisees and our company owned stores have not faced a high degree of competition in the sale of used merchandise  but do so in connection with the sale of new merchandise 
however  we may face additional competition as our franchise systems expand and if additional competitors enter the used merchandise market 
selling  general and administrative expense 
our ability to control the amount  and rate of growth in  selling  general and administrative expenses and the impact of unusual items resulting from our ongoing evaluation of our business strategies  asset valuations and organizational structures is important to our financial success 
we may incur additional expense in connection with the launch of winmark business solutions 
we cannot assure any investor that we will be able to control such items of expense 
government regulation 
as a franchisor  we are subject to various federal and state franchise laws and regulations 
although we believe we are currently in material compliance with existing federal and state laws  there is a trend toward increasing government regulation of franchising 
the promulgation of new franchising laws and regulations could adversely affect us
