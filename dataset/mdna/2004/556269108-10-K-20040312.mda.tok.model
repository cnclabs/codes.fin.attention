inflation the company does not believe that the relatively low rates of inflation experienced over the last few years in the united states  where it primarily competes  have had a significant effect on sales  expenses or profitability 
contractual obligations the company s contractual obligations as of december  were as follows payment due by period in thousands less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations      purchase obligations   other long term liabilities future minimum royalty payments     total      other considerations fashion industry risks the success of the company will depend in significant part upon its ability to anticipate and respond to product and fashion trends as well as to anticipate  gauge and react to changing consumer demands in a timely manner 
there can be no assurance that the company s products will correspond to the changes in taste and demand or that the company will be able to successfully market products that respond to such trends 
if the company misjudges the market for its products  it may be faced with significant excess inventories for some products and missed opportunities with others 
in addition  misjudgments in merchandise selection could adversely affect the company s image with its customers resulting in lower sales and increased markdown allowances for customers which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the industry in which the company operates is cyclical  with purchases tending to decline during recessionary periods when disposable income is low 
purchases of contemporary shoes and accessories tend to decline during recessionary periods and also may decline at other times 
while the company has fared well in recent years in a difficult retail environment  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to return to its historical rate of growth in revenues and earnings  or remain profitable in the future 
a recession in the national or regional economies or uncertainties regarding future economic prospects  among other things  could affect consumer spending habits and have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
in recent years  the retail industry has experienced consolidation and other ownership changes 
in the future  retailers in the united states and in foreign markets may consolidate  undergo restructurings or reorganizations  or realign their affiliations  any of which could decrease the number of stores that carry the company s products or increase the ownership concentration within the retail industry 
while such changes in the retail industry to date have not had a material adverse effect on the company s business or financial condition  there can be no assurance as to the future effect of any such changes 
inventory management the fashion oriented nature of the company s products and the rapid changes in customer preferences leave the company vulnerable to an increased risk of inventory obsolescence 
thus  the company s ability to manage its inventories properly is an important factor in its operations 
inventory shortages can adversely affect the timing of shipments to customers and diminish sales and brand loyalty 
conversely  excess inventories can result in lower gross margins due to the excessive discounts and markdowns that might be necessary to reduce inventory levels 
the inability of the company to effectively manage its inventory would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
dependence upon customers and risks related to extending credit to customers the company s customers consist principally of department stores and specialty stores  including shoe boutiques 
certain of the company s department store customers  including some under common ownership  account for significant portions of the company s wholesale business 
the company generally enters into a number of purchase order commitments with its customers for each of its lines every season and does not enter into long term agreements with any of its customers 
therefore  a decision by a significant customer of the company  whether motivated by competitive conditions  financial difficulties or otherwise  to decrease the amount of merchandise purchased from the company or to change its manner of doing business could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company sells its products primarily to retail stores across the united states and extends credit based on an evaluation of each customer s financial condition  usually without collateral 
while various retailers  including some of the company s customers  have experienced financial difficulties in the past few years which increased the risk of extending credit to such retailers  the company s losses due to bad debts have been limited 
pursuant to the factoring agreement between capital factors and the company  capital factors currently assumes the credit risk related to approximately of the company s accounts receivables 
however  financial difficulties of a customer could cause the company to curtail business with such customer or require the company to assume more credit risk relating to such customer s account receivable 
impact of foreign manufacturers substantial portions of the company s products are currently sourced outside the united states through arrangements with a number of foreign manufacturers in four different countries 
during the year ended december   approximately of the company s products were purchased from sources outside the united states  primarily from china  brazil  italy and spain 
risks inherent in foreign operations include work stoppages  transportation delays and interruptions  changes in social  political and economic conditions which could result in the disruption of trade from the countries in which the company s manufacturers or suppliers are located  the imposition of additional regulations relating to imports  the imposition of additional duties  taxes and other charges on imports  significant fluctuations of the value of the dollar against foreign currencies  or restrictions on the transfer of funds  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company does not believe that any such economic or political condition will materially affect the company s ability to purchase products  since a variety of materials and alternative sources are available 
the company cannot be certain  however  that it will be able to identify such alternative sources without delay if ever or without greater cost to the company 
the company s inability to identify and secure alternative sources of supply in this situation would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company s imported products are also subject to united states customs duties 
the united states and the countries in which the company s products are produced or sold  from time to time  impose new quotas  duties  tariffs  or other restrictions  or may adversely adjust prevailing quota  duty or tariff levels  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
possible adverse impact of unaffiliated manufacturers inability to manufacture in a timely manner  meet quality standards or to use acceptable labor practices as is common in the footwear industry  the company contracts for the manufacture of a majority of its products to its specifications through foreign manufacturers 
the company does not own or operate any manufacturing facilities and is therefore dependent upon independent third parties for the manufacture of all of its products 
the company s products are manufactured to its specifications by both domestic and international manufacturers 
the inability of a manufacturer to ship orders of the company s products in a timely manner or to meet the company s quality standards could cause the company to miss the delivery date requirements of its customers for those items  which could result in cancellation of orders  refusal to accept deliveries or a reduction in purchase prices  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
although the company enters into a number of purchase order commitments each season specifying a time frame for delivery  method of payment  design and quality specifications and other standard industry provisions  the company does not have long term contracts with any manufacturer 
as a consequence  any of these manufacturing relationships may be terminated  by either party  at any time 
although the company believes that other facilities are available for the manufacture of the company s products  both within and outside of the united states  there can be no assurance that such facilities would be available to the company on an immediate basis  if at all  or that the costs charged to the company by such manufacturers will not be greater than those presently paid 
the company requires its licensing partners and independent manufacturers to operate in compliance with applicable laws and regulations 
while the company promotes ethical business practices and the company s staff periodically visits and monitors the operations of its independent manufacturers  the company does not control such manufacturers or their labor practices 
the violation of labor or other laws by an independent manufacturer of the company or by one of the company s licensing partners  or the divergence of an independent manufacturer s or licensing partner s labor practices from those generally accepted as ethical in the united states  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
intense industry competition the fashion footwear industry is highly competitive and barriers to entry are low 
the company s competitors include specialty companies as well as companies with diversified product lines 
the recent market growth in the sales of fashionable footwear has encouraged the entry of many new competitors and increased competition from established companies 
most of these competitors  including diesel  kenneth cole  nine west  dkny  skechers  nike and guess  may have significantly greater financial and other resources than the company and there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully with other fashion footwear companies 
increased competition could result in pricing pressures  increased marketing expenditures and loss of market share  and could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company believes effective advertising and marketing  branding of the steve madden name  fashionable styling  high quality and value are the most important competitive factors and plans to continually employ these elements as it develops its products 
the company s inability to effectively advertise and market its products could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
expansion of retail business the company s continued growth depends to a significant degree on further developing the steve madden r  stevies  steven  steve madden mens  lei r  unionbay r and candie s r brands  creating new product categories and businesses and operating company owned stores on a profitable basis 
during the year ended december  the company opened six steve madden retail stores and has plans to open approximately eight to ten additional stores in the year the company s recent and planned expansion includes the opening of stores in new geographic markets as well as strengthening existing markets 
new markets have in the past presented  and will continue to present  competitive and merchandising challenges that are different from those faced by the company in its existing markets 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to open new stores  and if opened  that such new stores will be able to achieve sales and profitability levels consistent with management s expectations 
the company s retail expansion is dependent on a number of factors  including the company s ability to locate and obtain favorable store sites  the performance of the company s wholesale and retail operations  and the ability of the company to manage such expansion and hire and train personnel 
past comparable store sales results may not be indicative of future results  and there can be no assurance that the company s comparable store sales results can be maintained or will increase in the future 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the company s strategies to increase other sources of revenue  which may include expansion of its licensing activities  will be successful or that the company s overall sales or profitability will increase or not be adversely affected as a result of the implementation of such retail strategies 
the company s operations have increased and will continue to increase demand on the company s managerial  operational and administrative resources 
the company has recently invested significant resources in  among other things  its management information systems and hiring and training new personnel 
however  in order to manage currently anticipated levels of future demand  the company may be required to  among other things  expand its distribution facilities  establish relationships with new manufacturers to produce its products  and continue to expand and improve its financial  management and operating systems 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to manage future growth effectively and a failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
seasonal and quarterly fluctuations the company s results may fluctuate quarter to quarter as a result of the timing of holidays  weather  the timing of larger shipments of footwear  market acceptance of the company s products  the mix  pricing and presentation of the products offered and sold  the hiring and training of additional personnel  inventory write downs  the cost of materials  the product mix between wholesale and licensing businesses  the incurrence of other operating costs and factors beyond the company s control  such as general economic conditions and actions of competitors 
in addition  the company expects that its sales and operating results may be significantly impacted by the opening of new retail stores and the introduction of new products 
accordingly  the results of operations in any quarter will not necessarily be indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year or any future quarter 
trademark and service mark protection the company believes that its trademarks and service marks and other proprietary rights are important to its success and its competitive position 
accordingly  the company devotes substantial resources to the establishment and protection of its trademarks on a worldwide basis 
nevertheless  there can be no assurance that the actions taken by the company to establish and protect its trademarks and other proprietary rights will be adequate to prevent imitation of its products by others or to prevent others from seeking to block sales of the company s products on the basis that they violate the trademarks and proprietary rights of others 
moreover  no assurance can be given that others will not assert rights in  or ownership of  trademarks and other proprietary rights of the company or that the company will be able to successfully resolve such conflicts 
in addition  the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
the failure of the company to establish and then protect such proprietary rights from unlawful and improper utilization could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
foreign currency fluctuations the company generally purchases its products in us dollars 
however  the company sources substantially all of its products overseas and  as such  the cost of these products may be affected by changes in the value of the relevant currencies 
changes in currency exchange rates may also affect the relative prices at which the company and foreign competitors sell their products in the same market 
there can be no assurance that foreign currency fluctuations will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
outstanding options as of march  the company had outstanding options to purchase an aggregate of approximately  shares of common stock 
holders of such options are likely to exercise them when  in all likelihood  the market price of the company s stock is significantly higher than the exercise price of the options 
further  while its options are outstanding  they may adversely affect the terms on which the company could obtain additional capital  if required 
economic and political risks the present economic condition in the united states and concern about uncertainties could significantly reduce the disposable income available to the company s customers for the purchase of our products 
in addition  current unstable political conditions  including the potential or actual conflicts in iraq  north korea or elsewhere  or the continuation or escalation of terrorism  could have an adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company does not engage in the trading of market risk sensitive instruments in the normal course of business 
financing arrangements for the company are subject to variable interest rates primarily based on the prime rate 
an analysis of the company s credit agreement with capital factors  inc can be found in note c 
due from factor to the consolidated financial statements included in the company s annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended december  on december  and december   there were no direct borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement 
as of december   the company had investments in marketable securities valued at  which consists principally of federal and state obligations 
these obligations have various maturities through december these investments are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase 
the company currently has the ability to hold these investments until maturity 
should there be a significant increase in interest rates  the value of these investments would be negatively affected unless they were held to maturity 
in addition  any further decline in interest rates would reduce the company s interest income
