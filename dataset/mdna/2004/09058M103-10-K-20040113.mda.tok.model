critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and liquidity and capital resources discusses the consolidated financial statements of the company  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
preparation of these financial statements requires management to make judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
certain significant accounting policies applied in the preparation of the financial statements require management to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments  and are considered critical accounting policies by the company 
the company has identified the following areas as critical accounting policies 
revenue recognition the majority of the company s service contracts involve the processing of bioanalytical samples for pharmaceutical companies 
these contracts generally provide for a fixed fee for each assay method developed or sample processed and revenue is recognized under the specific performance method of accounting 
under the specific performance method  revenue and related direct costs are recognized when services are performed 
the company s other service contracts generally consist of pre clinical and clinical trial studies for pharmaceutical companies 
service revenue is recognized based on the ratio of direct costs incurred to total estimated direct costs under the proportional performance method of accounting 
losses on contracts are provided in the period in which the loss becomes determinable 
revisions in profit estimates are reflected on a cumulative basis in the period in which such revisions become known 
the establishment of contract prices and total contract costs involves estimates made by the company at the inception of the contract period 
these estimates could change during the term of the contract which could impact the revenue and costs reported in the consolidated financial statements 
projected losses on contracts are provided for in their entirety when known 
revisions to estimates have not been material to the company 
service contract fees received upon acceptance are deferred and classified within customer advances  until earned 
unbilled revenues represent revenues earned under contracts in advance of billings 
the company product revenue is derived primarily from sales of equipment utilized for scientific research 
revenue from equipment not requiring installation  testing or training is recognized upon shipment to customers 
one company product includes internally developed software and requires installation  testing and training  which occur concurrently 
revenue is recognized upon completion of the installation  testing and training 
impairment of long lived assets  including goodwill the company reviews long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles held and used for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
in evaluating the fair value and future benefits of its intangible assets  management performs an analysis of the anticipated undiscounted future net cash flows of the individual assets over the remaining amortization period 
the company recognizes an impairment loss if the carrying value of the asset exceeds the expected future cash flows 
goodwill is stated at cost 
prior to october   goodwill was amortized on a straight line basis 
beginning october   the company began to perform an annual test for impairment of goodwill 
this test is performed by comparing  at the reporting unit level  the carrying value of goodwill to its fair value 
the company assesses fair value based upon its best estimate of the present value of future cash flows that it expects to generate by the reporting unit 
the tests performed did not identify any instances of impairment 
however  changes in expectations as to the present value of the reporting unit s future cash flows might impact subsequent year s assessments of impairment 
other intangible assets are stated at cost and are amortized on a straight line basis 
the company completes an assessment of impairment of intangible assets whenever factors  events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the intangible assets to be held and used may not be recoverable 
assessment of impairment is based on the expected undiscounted cash flows of the assets 
if an asset is determined to be impaired  an impairment loss is recognized to the extent the carrying amount of the impaired asset exceeds fair value 
of the  of intangible assets acquired from lcr   was assigned to methodologies   to the customer relationships  and  to the regulated facility fda compliant laboratory site 
the company estimated the economic useful life of the acquired methodologies and customer relationships to be years with amortization recognized using the straight line method 
the company has determined that the acquired regulated facility fda compliant laboratory site is an indefinite lived intangible not subject to amortization 
of the  in preliminary value of the intangible assets acquired from pklb   in preliminary value was assigned to methodologies   in preliminary value to the customer relationships  and  in preliminary value to the regulated facility fda compliant laboratory site 
the company estimated the economic useful life of the acquired methodologies and customer relationships to be years with amortization recognized using the straight line method 
the company has determined that the acquired regulated facility fda compliant laboratory site is an indefinite lived intangible not subject to amortization 
the company s estimate of fair values and allocation of the purchase price is subject to change pending the conclusion of the company s analysis with the assistance of an independent valuation firm 
accordingly  the carrying value of assets subject to amortization and related estimated economic useful lives may change in future reporting periods until the company completes the allocation 
in connection with adopting sfas  the company also reassessed the useful lives and the classifications of its identifiable intangible assets and determined that they continue to be appropriate 
in  the financial accounting standards board approved the issuance of sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  which established new accounting and reporting requirements for goodwill and other intangible assets 
the new standard requires that all intangible assets acquired that are obtained through contractual or legal right  or are capable of being separately sold  transferred  licensed  rented or exchanged must be recognized as an asset apart from goodwill 
goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives are no longer amortized  but are subject to an annual assessment for impairment by applying a fair value based test 
the company applied the provisions of sfas beginning on october  the company has completed a fair value based impairment test  on its goodwill acquired before july   as of october  and then in the fourth quarter of the test indicated that the fair value of the goodwill is equivalent to or greater than the recorded value as of such dates 
income tax accounting income taxes are accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
sfas no 
requires recognition of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
these deferred taxes are measured by applying the provisions of tax laws in effect at the balance sheet date 
the company recognizes deferred tax assets in its balance sheet which typically represent items deducted currently in the financial statements that will be deducted in future periods in tax returns 
in accordance with sfas no 
 a valuation allowance is recorded against these deferred tax assets to reduce the total deferred tax assets to an amount that will  more likely than not  be realized in future periods 
the valuation allowance is based  in part  on management s estimate of future taxable income  the expected utilization of tax loss carry forwards and the expiration dates of tax loss carry forwards 
significant assumptions are used in developing the analysis of future taxable income for purposes of determining the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets which  in the opinion of management  are reasonable under the circumstances 
undistributed earnings in the company s foreign subsidiaries are considered by management to be permanently reinvested in such subsidiaries 
consequently  united states deferred tax liabilities on such earnings have not been recorded 
management believes that such united states taxes would be largely offset by foreign net operating loss carry forwards in applicable foreign jurisdictions 
new accounting pronouncements please refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recently issued accounting standards 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s primary market risk exposure with regard to financial instruments is the changes in interest rates 
the credit agreement between the company and the provident bank dated october  bears interest at a rate of either the bank s prime rate plus to basis points  or at libor plus to basis points  depending in each case upon the ratio of the company s interest bearing indebtedness less subordinated debt to ebitda  at the company s option 
historically  the company has not used derivative financial instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
the company estimates that a hypothetical adverse change in interest rates would not affect the consolidated operating results of the company 
the company operates internationally and is  therefore  subject to potentially adverse movements in foreign currency rates change 
the effect of movements in the exchange rates was not material to the consolidated operating results of the company in fiscal years and the company estimates that a hypothetical adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates would not affect the consolidated operating results of the company by a material amount
