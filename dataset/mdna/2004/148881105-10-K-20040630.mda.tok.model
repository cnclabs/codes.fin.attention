item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations explanatory note the following discussion should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in this annual report on form k 
certain statements in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements contained herein are based on current expectations and involve various risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward looking statements 
see the risks and uncertainties identified in certain risks that may affect our future results below and in the documents filed by us from time to time with the securities and exchange commission 
we undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward looking statements for any reason 
overview we design  develop and market a broad line of reprogrammable non volatile memory products and analog and mixed signal products 
our products are used by manufacturers of electronic products in a wide range of consumer  computing  communications  industrial and automotive applications 
we generally target high volume markets for our cost effective  high quality products 
we have been a committed long term supplier of memory products even through periods of tight manufacturing capacity and cyclical market downturns 
the market for our non volatile memory is competitive and market participants have relatively weak pricing power 
although average selling prices of our non volatile memory products have declined over time  prices are sensitive to conditions in our oem customers target markets 
for example  the average selling prices for most of our eeprom products weakened initially but ultimately increased in fiscal  whereas the market conditions improved and average selling prices for our low density flash increased consistently during the same period 
in general  we expect the average selling prices for a given memory product to decline in the future  primarily due to market competition  product availability and manufacturing capacity 
we are leveraging our extensive experience in high volume  reprogrammable memory products to develop complementary analog and mixed signal products that offer our customers a more complete system solution 
in fiscal  we strengthened and expanded the expertise of our research and development team by establishing our own development center in bucharest  romania and by hiring additional engineers in romania and in our sunnyvale  california headquarters 
we continue to make substantial investments in research and development to advance our non volatile memory products  as well as develop a broader solution with our line of analog and mixed signal products 
although analog and mixed signal products comprised of net revenues in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we expect net revenues from analog and mixed signal products to comprise a larger portion of our net revenues in the future 
our business is less capital intensive than traditional semiconductor companies since we outsource to third parties the manufacturing  assembling and testing of our products 
we use oki and x fab for foundry services and primarily use nseb for assembly and test services 
we strive to maintain long term relationships with our suppliers to ensure stability in our supply of products at a low cost 
in addition  in an effort to alleviate any potential wafer capacity constraints  we maintain a supply of wafers in a die bank for selected high volume products 
we market and sell our products directly through our sales force and indirectly through manufacturers representatives  distributors and resellers 
indirect sales were a majority of our total sales in fiscal and in fiscal our oem customer base  including end customers of our manufacturers representatives  distributors and resellers  is relatively diverse and during fiscal consisted of more than  customers 
we have approximately manufacturers representatives  distributors and resellers but the only party that accounted for more than of our net revenues in fiscal was alr company limited  a chinese reseller  which comprised of approximately of our net revenues 
our sales are generated by purchase orders and are typically shipped within a few weeks of receiving the order 
since industry practice allows customers to reschedule or cancel orders on relatively short notice  we do 
table of contents not use backlog to forecast our future net revenues 
cancellations of customer orders or distributor price protection and stock rotation rights  both industry standards  could result in the loss of future net revenues without allowing us sufficient time to reduce our inventory and operating expenses 
sales to customers outside the united states comprised the vast majority of our net revenues in recent periods 
this increasing non united states growth in net revenues was consistent with the current trend towards outsourcing of the manufacturing process  particularly to companies located in asia 
substantially all sales of our products are denominated in us dollars  minimizing the effects of currency fluctuations 
description of operating accounts net revenues 
net revenues consist of product sales  net of returns and allowances 
gross profit 
gross profit is net revenues less cost of revenues and is affected by a number of factors  including competitive pricing  product mix  foundry pricing and yields 
cost of revenues consists primarily of costs of manufacturing  assembly and testing of our products as well as compensation and associated costs related to manufacturing support  logistics and quality assurance personnel 
it also can include  on occasion  adjustments to inventory valuations based on demand and average selling prices expected in future periods 
research and development 
research and development expense consists primarily of compensation and associated costs for engineering  technical and support personnel  contract engineering services  depreciation of equipment and cost of wafers and mask sets used to evaluate new products and new versions of current products 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expense consists primarily of compensation and associated costs for sales  marketing and administrative personnel  commissions  promotional activities  professional fees and director and officer insurance 
proposed changes in accounting for stock based compensation we may be required to expense stock options and other share based payments to employees and directors  which would mean that we would record a significant charge to earnings 
on march   the fasb issued an exposure draft no 
 proposed statement of financial accounting standards share based payment  effective for fiscal periods beginning after december  this exposure draft outlines a methodology for the accounting treatment of stock options and certain other share based payments 
it requires these payments to be recorded as an operating expense 
it will supersede sfas  which allows for disclosure of this expense on a pro forma basis in notes to consolidated financial statements 
this pro forma compensation expense was million for fiscal adoption of this accounting standard will have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements 
we are currently evaluating our stock based compensation programs to determine what actions we may elect to take to reduce this potential charge if this exposure draft is enacted 
if we elect not to issue stock options at the levels we have in the past  we believe we will face a more difficult time in attracting and retaining the talented employees 
we believe it is likely that any expenses resulting from the implementation of the exposure draft would be included in the income statement line item where the related salary cost for the applicable employee or consultant is recorded  and that as a result  it may be difficult for investors to conduct period to period comparisons of our expenses if this exposure draft is adopted 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments based on historical experience and apply them on a consistent basis 
we believe that such consistent application results in financial statements and accompanying notes that fairly represent our financial condition  operating results and cash flows for all periods presented 
however  any factual errors or 
table of contents errors in these estimates and judgments may have a material impact on our financial conditions  operating results and cash flows 
recognition of revenues we generally recognize revenues as products are shipped if all of the following criteria are met we have evidence that an arrangement exists  we have delivered the products  we have performed the services  if any  the sales price is fixed or determinable  we believe that collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured  and we can reasonably estimate product returns 
we sell products directly to oem customers and indirectly through manufacturers representatives  distributors and resellers 
we recognize revenues upon delivery to oem customers and manufacturers representatives  distributors and resellers who have no  or limited  product return rights and no price protection rights 
we deem that delivery occurs when legal title and the risk of loss transfers to the customer 
delivery is generally defined by the customers shipping terms  as stated in the related purchase order 
if the customers purchase orders do not define the shipping terms  the shipping terms will be ex works as defined in our invoice 
we record an estimated allowance for returns from oem customers and manufacturers representatives  based on a percentage of our revenues 
this estimate is based on historical averages 
we sell to some of our distributors under agreements which provide for product return and price protection rights 
these agreements generally permit the distributor to return up to by value of the total products that the distributor has purchased from us in a specified six month period 
we defer recognition of revenues until the time the distributor sells the product to the end customer  at which time the sales price becomes fixed 
on a monthly basis  we receive point of sales information from each distributor 
using this information  we determine the amount of revenues to recognize 
for distributors who have product return rights  we also record an inventory reserve to address the cost of products we anticipate that we will not be able to resell after their return by the distributors 
for distributors who have price protection rights  distributors may take credits immediately and in general  we process the credits one or two months after the credit is taken by the distributor 
we record a reserve to cover the estimated liability of those unprocessed credits 
we re evaluate our policies periodically and no less often than annually 
inventory valuation we value our inventory at the lower of standard cost or net realizable value 
standard cost approximates actual cost on a first in  first out basis 
we routinely evaluate the value and quantities of our inventory in light of the current market conditions and market trends and we record reserves for quantities in excess of demand  cost in excess of market value and product age 
our analysis may take into consideration historical usage  expected demand  anticipated sales price  new product development schedules  the effect new products might have on the sales of existing products  product age  customer design activity  customer concentration and other factors 
our forecasts for our inventory may differ from actual inventory use and the time we have held finished goods in inventory 
the lives of our products are usually long and obsolescence has not been a significant factor historically in the valuation of our inventories 
we maintain inventory reserves for quantities in excess of demand equal to the cost of inventory that exceeds expected demand for approximately the next months 
if market conditions are less favorable than those we estimate  we may be required to write down inventory 
if we overestimate the future selling prices  we will incur additional losses when the inventory is sold for a lower price or when we establish additional reserves to cover the even lower estimated sales price 
once established  we do not reverse inventory reserves until the associated inventory has been sold or physically scrapped 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts we estimate the collectibility of our accounts receivable at the end of each reporting period 
we analyze the aging of accounts receivable and the bad debt history  payment history  customer concentration  customer credit worthiness and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts  which is created by charges to selling  general and administrative expenses 
our accounts receivable balance was million  net of allowance for doubtful accounts of  as of april  income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our current tax exposure and assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenues  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included on our balance sheet on a net basis 
we then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we include an expense in the tax provision in the statement of operations 
we make significant judgments in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax asset 
as of april   our gross deferred tax assets  consisting primarily of net operating loss carryforwards  tax credit carryforwards and nondeductible reserves and accruals  were valued at million and our valuation allowance was zero 
in fiscal  we concluded that all of our deferred tax assets will be realizable  based on available objective evidence and our recent history of net income before taxes 
accordingly  we reversed the million valuation allowance that we had previously established 
when the valuation allowance was reversed  million benefited net income  while million was credited to additional paid in capital 
the amount credited to additional paid in capital was attributable to deferred tax assets associated with employee stock options 
results of operations the following table sets forth the percentage of net revenues for certain items in our consolidated statements of operations for the periods indicated years ended april  net revenues gross profit operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative income from operations interest income  net income before income taxes income tax provision benefit net income 
table of contents the following table sets forth net revenues in thousands and percentage of net revenues by product group years ended april  eeprom flash analog and mixed signal net revenues comparison of the fiscal year ended april  and net revenues 
our net revenues increased million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal the increase in net revenues was primarily due to the increased sales volume and shift in product mix of our eeprom product line  for which net revenues increased million  primarily from the growth in our inter integrated circuit  or i c  product line 
our flash product revenues continued to decline as a percentage of net revenues but increased slightly in absolute dollars in fiscal as a result of increased average selling prices and increased sales volume  especially in the last quarter of fiscal as we began selling to new oem customers in europe 
our analog and mixed signal product revenues increased as we introduced more products to market and established product traction with our existing oem customer base 
sales to customers outside the united states represented approximately of net revenues in fiscal as compared to of net revenues in fiscal gross profit 
gross profit increased million  or  to for fiscal from million for fiscal gross margin  the result of gross profit divided by net revenues  was for fiscal and for fiscal the million improvement in gross profit in fiscal was primarily due to higher sales volume  lower average costs and greater benefit from net movements in inventory reserves 
this improvement was offset by lower average selling prices and a million charge relating to a one time payment we made to the philips corporation in settlement of disputed royalty obligations under a license agreement 
in fiscal and fiscal  charges to inventory reserves were  and million  respectively 
the sales of previously reserved inventory reduced cost of revenues by million for fiscal and million for fiscal the net impact of movements in inventory reserves was an improvement in gross profit of million in fiscal and of  in fiscal research and development 
research and development expense increased million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal as a percentage of net revenues  research and development expense was in fiscal and in fiscal the increase in research and development expense in fiscal was primarily attributable to an increase in personnel related expenses  including an increase in headcount 
additionally  there was a  increase in the depreciation and amortization of software  equipment and mask sets  which were purchased for development purposes 
as of april   we employed people in research and development activities  compared to employees as of april  selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expense increased million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal as a percentage of net revenues  selling  general and administrative expense was in fiscal and in fiscal the increase in absolute dollars was primarily attributable to a  increase in sales and marketing personnel related expenses  an increase in commissions paid to outside representatives of  and an increase of  for freight expense on higher shipping volume 
net interest income and expense 
we earned net interest income of  in fiscal compared to net interest income of  in fiscal our rate of return on our average balance of cash  cash 
table of contents equivalents and short term investments was approximately in fiscal and approximately in fiscal income tax provision benefit 
the effective income tax rate was a benefit of in fiscal  as compared to a benefit of in fiscal the difference between our fiscal and fiscal effective tax rates was primarily attributable to the reversal of our valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax asset 
comparison of the fiscal year ended april  and net revenues 
our net revenues increased million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal the increase in net revenues was primarily due to a million increase in net revenues for our eeprom products 
this increase was offset by a decline in net revenues for our flash products due to deteriorating market conditions for the lower density flash products that we produce 
net revenues from our analog and mixed signal products increased as we began to offer a greater number of products for sale 
sales outside the united states represented approximately of net revenues in fiscal as compared to of net revenues in fiscal the increase in sales outside the united states was primarily attributable to increased sales in japan and europe 
gross profit 
gross profit increased million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal gross margin was for fiscal and for fiscal the million improvement in gross profit in fiscal was primarily due to higher sales volume and lower costs  and a greater benefit from net movements in inventory reserves 
charges to inventory reserves were million for fiscal and million for fiscal the sales of previously reserved inventory reduced cost of revenues by million for fiscal from million for fiscal the net impact on inventory reserves was an improvement in gross profit of  for fiscal and a decrease in gross profit of  for fiscal research and development 
research and development expense increased  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal as a percentage of net revenues  research and development expense was for fiscal and for fiscal the increase was primarily attributable to a  increase in personnel related expenses and a  increase in the depreciation of software and equipment purchased for development purposes 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expense declined by  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal as a percentage of net revenues  selling  general and administrative expense was for fiscal and for fiscal the decrease was primarily attributable to a  decrease in commissions paid to outside representatives and a  decrease in bad debt expense 
net interest income and expense 
we earned net interest income of  in fiscal compared to net interest income of  in fiscal our rate of return on our average balance of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments was approximately in fiscal and approximately in fiscal income tax provision benefit 
the effective income tax rate was a benefit of in fiscal  as compared to a provision of in fiscal the difference between our fiscal and fiscal effective tax rates was primarily attributable to the reversal in fiscal of a portion of our valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax asset 
liquidity and capital resources at april   we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million 
our historical sources of cash and capital expenditures have come from our operating activities 
in fiscal  we began to invest our excess cash in short term financial instruments to generate interest income 
these 
table of contents instruments are us government debt securities  the majority of which have maturities that are less than one year 
they are highly liquid and can be converted to cash at any time 
they are classified as current assets in the balance sheet but are not considered cash and cash equivalents and are therefore excluded from our analysis of changes to cash and cash equivalents in our consolidated statement of cash flows included in this form k 
net cash from operating activities in fiscal  we had operating cash flows of million  which resulted from net income of million  adjusted for non cash charges including depreciation and amortization of million  additions to inventory reserves of  a reduction of gross inventories of million  an increase in accounts payable of million primarily due to the timing and amount of inventory purchases  an increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities of  related primarily to the tax provision and an increase of million for deferred gross profit on distributor sales due to increased distributor inventories 
these increases were partially offset by releases of inventory reserves of million resulting from shipments of previously reserved inventory and an increase in gross accounts receivable of million due to increased shipments 
in fiscal  we had operating cash flows of million  which resulted from net income of million  adjusted for non cash charges including depreciation and amortization of million  additions to inventory reserves of million  a reduction of gross accounts receivable of million  a reduction of gross inventories of  and an increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities of million primarily from tax related adjustments 
these increases were partially offset by releases of inventory reserves of million resulting from shipments of previously reserved inventory  a reduction in accounts payable of million primarily due to the timing and amount of inventory purchases  an increase in deferred tax assets of million and a decrease in the deferred gross profit on distributor sales due to decreased inventories and margins at distributors of  in fiscal  we had operating cash flows of million  which resulted from net income of  adjusted for non cash charges including depreciation and amortization of approximately million  an addition to the provision for doubtful accounts of  additions to inventory reserves of million  a decrease in gross accounts receivable of million related to decreased sales  an increase in accounts payable of  related to timing of our inventory purchases and an increase in other credits of million 
these increases were partially offset by releases of inventory reserves of million resulting from shipments of previously reserved inventory  an increase in gross inventories of  an increase in other current assets of  related to an expected refund of income taxes paid in a previous year and a decrease in accrued expenses of million 
net cash from investing activities in fiscal  investing activities provided million 
during fiscal  our short term investments declined by million as we transferred those funds to cash and cash equivalents 
we also used million primarily for the acquisition of test equipment 
in fiscal  investing activities used million 
during fiscal  we invested million in short term investments and we used million primarily for the acquisition of design software and equipment for research and development activities and our manufacturing operations 
in fiscal  investing activities used  primarily for the purchase of equipment for our manufacturing operations 
net cash from financing activities in fiscal  cash used by financing activities was million 
in a private transaction we purchased  shares from elex nv  our largest stockholder  for per share and an aggregate of million  which represented a discount from the closing market price on the nasdaq national market on the last trading date prior to the approval of the transaction by our board of directors 
separately  we purchased 
table of contents  shares of our common stock from the open market as part of our open market repurchase program 
we also received million of proceeds upon the exercise of stock options by employees 
in fiscal  cash used by financing activities was million 
we used million to purchase an aggregate of  shares of our common stock in the open market as part of our open market repurchase program 
we also received  of proceeds upon the exercise of stock options by employees 
in fiscal  cash used by financing activities was million 
in a private transaction we purchased million shares from elex nv for per share and an aggregate of million  which represented a discount from the closing market price on the nasdaq national market on the date of the purchase 
separately  we purchased  shares of our common stock for an aggregate of  from the open market as part of our open market repurchase program 
we used million to pay off our bank credit line and remaining capital lease obligations 
we also received  of proceeds upon the exercise of stock options by employees 
common stock repurchase plan in september  our board of directors authorized a program for the open market repurchase of up to million shares of our common stock 
in march  the board of directors increased the authorized limit to an aggregate of million shares 
the purpose of this share repurchase program is to reduce the long term potential dilution in earnings per share that might result from issuances under our stock option plans and to take advantage of the relatively low price of our common stock 
the following table summarizes the activity of the open market repurchase program through april  and does not include our repurchases of shares from elex nv years ended april  total shares repurchased in open market total cost of shares average cost per share contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of april  and the effects these obligations and commitments are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods in thousands years ended april  total contractual cash obligations operating leases sales purchase promissory agreement wafer purchases other purchase commitments total contractual cash obligations our primary facility lease is our business office in sunnyvale  california 
this lease expires in and allows us to exercise an option to extend the term by an additional five years 
on november   we entered into a sale purchase promissory agreement with sc hathor impex srl to purchase a building for catalyst semiconductor romania srl 
we expect to take possession of the building and complete the financial transaction by august  as part of our ongoing business  we do not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities of financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or 
table of contents special purpose entities  or spes  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purpose 
as of april   we are not involved in any spe transactions 
need for additional resources on june   we filed with the securities and exchange commission a registration statement on form s in connection with a proposed underwritten public offering of up to  newly issued shares of common stock and up to  shares of our common stock held by certain selling stockholders 
the registration statement is not yet effective 
although we currently intend to issue the shares to the public  we cannot be certain that the offering will be completed and that the shares will be issued 
we believe that the net proceeds from the above offering  if completed  together with our current cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating and capital requirements for at least the next months 
we have no current plans  nor are we currently negotiating  to obtain additional financing following the closing of the above offering 
our long term plan is to finance our core business operations with cash we generate from operations 
however  from time to time we may raise additional capital through a variety of sources  including the public equity market  private financings  collaborative arrangements and debt 
the additional capital we raise could be used for working capital purposes  to fund our research and development activities or our capital expenditures or to acquire complementary businesses or technologies 
if we raise additional capital through the issuance of equity or securities convertible into equity  our stockholders may experience dilution 
those securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of the holders of the common stock 
additional financing may not be available to us on favorable terms  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain financing  or to obtain it on acceptable terms  we may be unable to successfully support our business requirements 
effects of transactions with related parties elex nv during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we began taking delivery of wafers fabricated by x fab  a wholly owned subsidiary of elex nv  a belgian holding company  that owned  shares  or of our outstanding shares  as of april  mr 
roland duch telet  the chairman and chief executive officer of elex nv  serves as a member of our board of directors 
the wafers provided by x fab include wafers for our analog and mixed signal products and eeprom products 
we believe that the cost of the wafers we purchase from x fab is no greater than comparable materials available from alternative foundries 
we periodically negotiate the prices of wafers purchased from x fab with x fab management and compare those prices to quotes we obtain from other prospective foundries and pricing surveys published by various industry trade organizations 
we purchased million of wafers from x fab in fiscal as of april   and  the total amount owed to x fab was   and  respectively 
other than purchase orders currently open with x fab  there is no purchasing agreement in place with x fab 
on april   we purchased  shares of our common stock from elex nv for per share and an aggregate of million 
lxi corporation we had an informal arrangement from through january to obtain engineering services from lxi corporation  a california corporation  or lxi  a provider of engineering services through essex com srl  or essex  lxi s wholly owned subsidiary in romania 
the number of full time engineers we used was dependent upon the scope and number of research and development projects in process at a given time 
these services related to our key development projects including development  design  layout and test program development services 
we believe that we received these engineering services from lxi on terms and at rates that were at least as favorable  if not more favorable  than we could obtain from unaffiliated third parties 
two of our officers  gelu voicu and thomas e 
gay iii  owned approximately and  respectively  of lxi until 
table of contents february mr 
gay  who had served as a director of lxi  resigned from that position in january mr 
voicu and mr 
gay received no payments from lxi during fiscal  fiscal and fiscal other than  and  respectively  from the repurchase of their shares at net book value by lxi in february additionally  we believe that our former chief executive officer  radu vanco  continues to own a majority of the outstanding shares of lxi 
in january  we formed a wholly owned subsidiary in romania to perform these engineering design services on our behalf and discontinued our use of the engineering services of lxi 
allan advisors  inc one of our directors  lionel allan  has also served as a consultant to us through his consulting company  allan advisors  inc under the terms of his consulting agreement  we paid mr 
allan consulting fees of  per month throughout fiscal in april  we terminated the agreement and paid the  balance due as required by the agreement 
mr 
allan no longer provides consulting services to us and we have no continuing obligations to mr 
allan under the terminated agreement 
recent accounting pronouncements in may  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity  or sfas no 
sfas no 
establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity and further requires that an issuer classify as a liability  or an asset in some circumstances  financial instruments that fall within its scope because that financial instrument embodies an obligation of the issuer 
many of such instruments were previously classified as equity 
the statement is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise was effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
on december   the securities and exchange commission  or sec  issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  or sab no 
 which supersedes staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  or sab no 
sab no 
s primary purpose is to rescind accounting guidance contained in sab no 
related to multiple element revenue managements  superseded as a result of the issuance of emerging issues task force  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
sab no 
also rescinds the sec s revenue recognition in financial statements frequently asked questions and answers  or the faq  issued with sab no 
that had been codified in sec topic  revenue recognition 
selected portions of the faq have been incorporated into sab no 
while the wording of sab no 
reflects the issuance of eitf  the revenue recognition principles of sab no 
remain largely unchanged by the issuance of sab no 
eitf was effective for revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june  the adoption of sab no 
did not have a material impact upon our financial position  results of operations or cash flows for the fiscal in march  the fasb approved eitf issue  participating securities and the two class method under fas eitf issue supersedes the guidance in topic no 
d  effect of participating convertible securities on the computation of basic earnings per share  and requires the use of the two class method of participating securities 
the two class method is an earnings allocation formula that determines earnings per share for each class of common stock and participating security according to dividends declared or accumulated and participation rights in undistributed earnings 
in addition  eitf issue addresses other forms of participating securities  including options  warrants  forwards and other contracts to issue an entity s common stock  with the exception of stock based compensation unvested options and restricted stock subject to the provisions of opinion and sfas eitf issue is effective for reporting periods beginning after march  and should be applied by restating previously reported earnings per share 
we are currently in the process of evaluating the impact that adoption of eitf issue will have on our financial position and results of operations 

table of contents certain risks that may affect our future results the following lists some  but not all  of the risks and uncertainties which may have a material and adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
the risks and uncertainties set out below are not the only risks and uncertainties we face 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate due to many factors and are difficult to forecast  which may cause the trading price of our common stock to decline substantially 
our operating results have historically been and in the future may be adversely affected or otherwise fluctuate due to factors such as fluctuations in customer demand for the electronic devices into which our products are incorporated  volatility in supply and demand affecting semiconductor prices generally  such as the increases in supply of competitive products and significant declines in average selling prices we experienced most recently in fiscal  establishment of additional inventory reserves if sales of our inventory fall below our expected sales  or the anticipated selling prices of our products fall below the amounts paid to produce and sell certain parts  changes in our product mix including product category  density  package type or voltage  inadequate visibility of future demand for our products  timing of new product introductions and orders of our products  increases in expenses associated with new product introductions and promotions  process changes and or expansion of our sales channels  increases in wafer prices due to increased market demand and other factors  increases in prices charged by our suppliers due to increased costs  decreased competition and other factors  gains or losses of significant oem customers or indirect channel sellers  such as manufacturers representatives  distributors or resellers  fluctuations in manufacturing yields  charges to bad debt expense caused by accounts receivable we deem unlikely to be collected in a reasonable amount of time  if ever  and general economic conditions 
our net revenues and operating results are difficult to forecast 
we base our expense levels  in significant part  on our expectations of future net revenues and our expenses are therefore relatively fixed in the short term 
if our net revenues fall below our forecasts  our operating results are likely to be disproportionately adversely affected because our costs are relatively fixed in the short term 
we may never realize a material portion of our net revenues from our analog and mixed signal products  despite our expenditure of a disproportionate amount of our research and development resources on these products 
analog and mixed signal products accounted for of net revenues for fiscal  of net revenues for fiscal and of net revenues for fiscal we believe that the growth in our analog and mixed signal product revenues has been limited due to the small number of products we offer  extended product design cycles and a sales force that has limited experience selling these products 
despite limited product acceptance to date  we continue to invest in and devote research and development and marketing resources to analog and mixed signal products with the expectation that our standard analog and mixed signal 
table of contents products will be accepted by many of our current customers and that we will eventually qualify and sell custom analog and mixed signal products 
competition is intense as we have initially offered a limited range of products while our more established competitors are offering a much broader array of analog and mixed signal products 
if we are unable to realize more revenues from these products  our total revenues may not grow 
in addition  if we devote a disproportionate amount of our research and development resources to analog and mixed signal products  our development of new non volatile memory products may suffer and operating results may be harmed 
we may be unable to fulfill all our customers orders according to the schedule originally requested due to the constraints in our wafer supply and processing time from die bank to finished goods  which could result in reduced revenues or higher expenses 
due to the lead time constraints in our wafer supply  foundry activities and other manufacturing processes  from time to time we have been unable to fulfill all our customers orders on the schedule originally requested 
although we attempt to anticipate pending orders and maintain an adequate supply of wafers and communicate to our customers delivery dates that we believe we can reasonably expect to meet  our customers may not accept the alternative delivery date or may cancel their outstanding orders 
reductions in orders received or cancellation of outstanding orders would result in lower net revenues and reduced operating results  excess inventories and increased inventory reserves 
we may also be required to pay substantially higher per wafer prices to replenish our die bank  which could harm our gross margins 
if we were requested to pay rush charges to our manufacturing or foundry partners to meet a customer s requested delivery date  our expenses may increase and harm our operating results 
due to the lack of adequate product sales history and limited visibility in forecasting future demand  we do not have the same inventory levels of wafers and die bank for our newer products compared to our established products 
as a result  we may be unable to meet demand for those newer products if demand exceeds our expectations and we do not have adequate time or capacity to make the additional products 
we may forecast incorrectly and produce excess or insufficient inventories of particular products  which may adversely affect our results of operations 
since we must order products and build inventory substantially in advance of product shipments  we may forecast incorrectly and produce excess or insufficient inventories of particular products 
the ability of our customers to reschedule or cancel orders without significant penalty could adversely affect our liquidity  as we may be unable to adjust our purchases from our wafer suppliers to match any customer changes and cancellations 
as part of our business strategy  we maintain a substantial inventory of sorted wafers in a die bank but limit our investment in finished goods 
we may have adequate wafer inventory to meet customer needs but may be unable to finish the manufacturing process prior to the delivery date specified by the customer 
demand for our products is volatile and customers often place orders with short lead times 
our inventory may not be reduced by the fulfillment of customer orders and in the future we may produce excess quantities of our products 
it is our policy to fully write down all inventories that we do not expect to be sold in a reasonable period of time 
during recent fiscal years  as a result of reductions in estimated demand for our various products  we have taken charges for write down of inventories for certain products  primarily our flash and eeprom products 
for example  we took inventory write down charges of million in fiscal  which were partially offset by a benefit of million relating to products that were written off in prior years and sold during fiscal we may suffer reductions in values of our inventories in the future and we may be unable to liquidate our inventory at acceptable prices 
to the extent we have excess inventories of particular products  our operating results could be adversely affected by charges to cost of revenues that we would be required to recognize due to significant reductions in demand for our products or rapid declines in the market value of inventory  resulting in inventory write downs or other related factors 

table of contents we depend on a small number of suppliers for the supply of wafers and we may be unable to meet customer demand due to our inability to obtain wafers 
we do not manufacture or process the semiconductor wafers used for our products 
in  we began a relationship with oki electric industry co  ltd  or oki  in japan 
since  oki has supplied wafers to us and has been our principal foundry source 
at the end of fiscal  an additional foundry  x fab texas  inc  or x fab  began to provide products to us 
we primarily use oki for fabricating our memory products and x fab for fabricating our analog and mixed signal products 
we do not presently have a wafer supply agreement with oki or x fab and instead purchase wafers on a purchase order and acceptance basis 
our reliance on these independent foundries involves a number of risks  including inadequate wafer supplies to meet our production needs  increased prices charged by these independent foundries  unavailability of or interruption in access to required or more cost effective process technologies  and reduced control over delivery schedules  manufacturing yields and costs 
we have been unable and in the future we may be unable to obtain sufficient quantities of wafers from oki and x fab to fulfill customer demand 
to address our wafer supply concerns  we plan to continue expanding our primary foundry capability at oki by qualifying our products in multiple fabrication plants owned by oki and to expand our foundry capability with x fab 
however  we cannot be certain that these efforts will provide us with access to adequate capacity in the future at costs which enable us to remain profitable 
even if such capacity is available from another manufacturer  the qualification process and time required to make the foundry fully operational for us could take many months or longer and be subject to other factors described below and the prices could be materially higher 
our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by the loss of oki or x fab as a supplier  our inability to obtain additional capacity at oki or x fab  our inability to qualify oki or x fab for additional products  our inability to locate and qualify other wafer manufacturers for desired foundry capacity  or any other circumstances causing a significant interruption in our supply of semiconductor wafers 
we rely on manufacturers representatives  distributors and resellers for a substantial portion of our net revenues and if our relationships with one or more of those manufacturers representatives  distributors or resellers were to terminate  our operating results may be harmed 
we market and distribute our products primarily through manufacturers representatives  independent distributors and resellers  which typically offer competing products 
these distribution channels have been characterized by rapid change  including consolidations and financial difficulties 
manufacturers representatives  distributors and resellers have accounted for a significant portion of our net revenues in the past 
for fiscal  sales to alr company limited  a reseller in china  represented of our net revenues 
for fiscal  none of our direct or indirect customers represented more than of net revenues 
in fiscal  sales to future electronics  inc  a distributor  represented of our net revenues 
in addition  we have experienced and may continue to experience lower margins on sales to manufacturers representatives  distributors and resellers as a result of volume pricing arrangements 
we also do not typically enter into long term arrangements with our manufacturers representatives  distributors and resellers and we cannot be certain as to future order levels from our distributors and resellers 
when we do enter into long term arrangements  the contracts are generally terminable at the convenience of the manufacturers 
table of contents representatives  distributors and resellers and it may be difficult to replace that source of revenues in the short term upon cancellation 
our business depends on these third parties to sell our products 
as a result  our operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected by the loss of one or more of our current manufacturers representatives  distributors and resellers  additional volume pricing arrangements  order cancellations  delay in shipment by one of our major manufacturers representatives  distributors or resellers or the failure of our manufacturer s representatives  distributors or sellers to successfully sell our products 
if we are required to expense share based payments to our employees  our financial statements will have a significant material adverse charge 
if we are required to expense stock options and other share based payments to employees and directors  we will record a significant charge to earnings 
on march   the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued an exposure draft no 
 proposed statement of financial accounting standards share based payment  effective for fiscal periods beginning after december  this exposure draft outlines a methodology for the accounting treatment of stock options and certain other share based payments 
it requires these payments to be recorded as an operating expense 
it will supersede statement of financial accounting standards no 
 or sfas  which allows for disclosure of this expense on a pro forma basis in notes to consolidated financial statements 
our pro forma stock compensation expense was million for fiscal adoption of this accounting standard will have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements 
we are currently evaluating our stock based compensation programs to determine what our alternatives may be to reduce this potential charge if this exposure draft is enacted 
if we choose not to issue stock options at the levels we have in the past  we believe we will face a more difficult time in attracting and retaining employees 
we face risks from failures in our manufacturing processes and the processes of our foundries and vendors 
the fabrication of semiconductors  particularly eeprom  is a highly complex and precise process 
our products are currently manufactured by two outside foundries and a number of other vendors participate in testing  packaging and other processes 
during manufacturing  each wafer is processed to contain numerous eeprom  flash  analog or mixed signal products 
we may reject or be unable to sell a substantial percentage of wafers or the components on a given wafer because of minute impurities  difficulties in the fabrication process  such as failure of special equipment  operator error or power outages  defects in the masks used to print circuits on a wafer  nonconforming electrical and or optical performance  breakage in wafers  or other factors 
we refer to the proportion of final components that have been processed  assembled and tested relative to the gross number of components that could be constructed from the raw materials as our manufacturing yield 
we have in the past experienced lower than expected manufacturing yields  which have delayed product shipments and negatively impacted our results of operations 
we may experience difficulty maintaining acceptable manufacturing yields in the future 

table of contents in addition  the maintenance of our outsourced fabrication  manufacturing and assembly model is subject to risks  including the demands of managing and coordinating workflow between geographically separate production facilities  disruption of production in one facility as a result of a slowdown or shutdown in another facility  and higher operating costs from managing geographically separate manufacturing facilities 
we depend on certain vendors for foundry services  materials  test and assembly 
we maintain stringent policies regarding qualification of these vendors 
however  if these vendors processes vary in reliability or quality  they could negatively affect our products and our results of operations 
we rely on third party subcontractors to sort  assemble  test and ship our products to customers  which reduces our control over quality  delivery schedules and capacity 
we outsource all or a portion of our production planning  assembly  test and finish work for our products  as well as our inventory management function to subcontractors who are primarily located in thailand and the philippines 
we do not have long term contractual arrangements with these subcontractors 
our reliance on third parties subjects us to risks such as reduced control over delivery schedules and quality  a potential lack of adequate capacity during periods when demand is high and potential increases in product costs due to factors outside our control such as capacity shortages and pricing changes 
our outsourcing model could lead to delays in product deliveries  lost sales and increased costs which could harm our relationships with oem customers and indirect sales channels and result in lower operating results 
because we utilize the services of a group of assembly and test providers  this makes our operation highly complex  requiring a high degree of diligence in managing the costs of production and overall logistics of our manufacturing operations 
international sales comprise a significant portion of our product sales  which exposes us to foreign political and economic risks 
for fiscal  sales outside the united states comprised of our net revenues 
additionally  for fiscal and fiscal  sales outside of the united states accounted for approximately and  respectively  of our net revenues 
the increase in percentage of international revenues in fiscal was primarily attributable to our increased sales in all markets outside the united states while demand in the united states continued to be weak due to the trend towards outsourcing of electronic systems manufacturing  primarily to asia 
we expect that sales outside of the united states will continue to represent a significant portion of our net revenues in the future 
however  our international operations may be adversely affected by the following factors greater fluctuations in demand for our products due to the increased sensitivity to pricing changes in certain markets  particularly asia  fluctuations in exchange rates  longer payment cycles  imposition of government controls  political  socioeconomic and financial instability  such as the military actions in afghanistan and iraq  trade restrictions  the impact of communicable diseases  such as severe acute respiratory syndrome  changes in regulatory requirements  and difficulties in staffing international operations 
our business is also subject to other risks because of our design center in romania and our relationships with foreign subcontractors including  but not limited to  foreign government regulations and political and financial 
table of contents unrest which may cause disruptions or delays in shipments to our customers or access to our inventories 
we do not currently hedge against any foreign currency exchange rate risks 
we may face increased management costs and other risks due to the establishment of our design group in romania 
in january  we formed a wholly owned subsidiary in romania to perform engineering design services 
in november  we entered into a sale purchase promissory agreement to purchase a building in bucharest for use by our romanian design group at an estimated cost of million 
we have no prior experience in establishing or operating engineering services outside of our headquarters in sunnyvale  california 
our expansion of engineering design operations to remotely situated offices presents a number of substantial risks that could increase our operating expenses and adversely affect our operating results  financial condition and ability to deliver our products and grow our business  including difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  in particular attracting and retaining personnel qualified to provide high quality engineering design services  difficulties in coordinating our engineering operations in romania with those in california  diversion of management attention  difficulties in maintaining uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies with our romanian subsidiary relative to those of our other locations  including product development management and financial consolidation  difficulties in owning and operating real property in romania  political and economic instability  which may have an adverse impact on foreign exchange rates of the romanian leu relative to the us dollar and could impair our ability to conduct our business in romania  and inadequacy of the local infrastructure to support our needs 
our low density flash memory products may become obsolete 
a substantial portion of our net revenues have been and continue to be derived from sales of low density flash memory products 
flash memory products represented of our net revenues in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal in general  the market for flash memory products has been characterized by intense price competition  long production cycles  inconsistent yields  competing technologies  migration of demand to larger memory sizes and intense overall competition 
other flash memory vendors continue to design  develop and sell flash memory devices with larger memory in reaction to market demand 
this transition to larger flash memory sizes is resulting in a limited and shrinking market for the low density flash memory products that we currently offer 
we have decided not to develop any of the higher density flash memory devices due to the extreme competition in the medium and high density flash memory market 
due to these and other factors  we are likely to experience declining net revenues from our low density flash memory products  which could harm our operating results 
our ability to operate successfully depends upon the continued service of certain key employees and the continued ability to attract and retain additional highly qualified personnel 
our ability to operate successfully will depend  to a large extent  upon the continued service of certain key employees and the continued ability to attract and retain additional highly qualified personnel 
competition for these personnel  particularly for highly skilled design  process and test engineers  is intense and we may not be able to retain these personnel or attract other highly qualified personnel 
our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by the loss of or failure to attract and retain highly qualified personnel 

table of contents we may need to raise additional capital in the future and if we are unable to secure adequate funds on terms acceptable to us  we may be unable to support our business requirements or build our business 
we currently anticipate that the net proceeds of the offering described in need for additional resources above  if completed  together with our current cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities  will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating and capital requirements for at least the next year 
we have no current plans  nor are we currently negotiating  to obtain additional financing following the closing of this offering 
our long term plan is to finance our core business operations with cash we generate from operations 
we may raise additional capital through a variety of sources  including the public equity market  private financings and debt 
if we raise additional capital through the issuance of equity or securities convertible into equity  our stockholders may experience dilution 
those securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of the holders of the common stock 
additional financing may not be available to us on favorable terms  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain financing  or to obtain it on acceptable terms  we may be unable to successfully support our business requirements or build our business 
risks related to our industry and competition the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical in nature  which may cause our operating results to fluctuate 
we operate in a highly cyclical industry that has been subject to significant economic downturns often in connection with  or in anticipation of  maturing product cycles and declines in general economic conditions 
these types of downturns occurred in calendar   and in the future  during such downturns  we may experience reduced product demand  accelerated erosion of average selling prices and gross margins and production overcapacity 
these downturns may occur for extended periods 
accordingly  we may experience substantial period to period fluctuations in future operating results 
for example  we experienced accelerated erosion of average selling prices caused by adverse industry wide conditions during fiscal  fiscal and the first half of fiscal and incurred substantial losses in fiscal in addition  during the second half of fiscal and the first half of fiscal  the market for our products became more competitive as a result of increased availability of products when demand was decreasing 
during fiscal  fiscal and most of fiscal  we experienced lower oem customer and distributor orders and we had to lower our selling prices to remain competitive in the market 
our continued success depends in large part on the continued growth of various electronics industries that use semiconductors 
we attempt to identify changes in market conditions as soon as possible  however  market dynamics make our prediction of and timely reaction to such events difficult 
our business could be harmed in the future by additional cyclical downturns in the semiconductor industry or by slower growth by any of the markets served by our oem customers products 
if our products fail to keep pace with the rapid changes in the semiconductor industry  we could lose oem customers and revenues 
the markets for our products are characterized by rapidly changing customer demand  over or under utilization of manufacturing capacity and price fluctuations 
to compete successfully  we must introduce in a timely manner new products at competitive prices  quality and performance levels 
in particular  our future success will depend on our ability to develop and implement new design and process technologies which enable us to reduce product costs 
for example  most of our products are currently designed and manufactured using micron eeprom processes or a micron flash memory process 
we expect to transition a portion of our eeprom products to the micron and micron process geometries and may not do so successfully or cost effectively 
our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by delays in developing new products  achievement of volume production and market acceptance of new products  successful completion of technology transitions of our existing products to new process geometries or foundries with acceptable yields and reliability 

table of contents competition in our markets may lead to reduced average selling prices of our products  reduced sales of our products or gross margins 
the non volatile memory market is competitive and has been characterized by rapid price erosion  manufacturing capacity constraints and limited product availability 
average selling prices in the non volatile memory market generally  and for our products in particular  have fluctuated significantly over the life of each product and  over the long term  the average selling price of each product has tended to decline 
declines in average selling prices for our products  if not offset by reductions in the cost of producing those products or by sales of new products with higher gross margins  would decrease our overall gross margins  could cause a negative adjustment to the value of our inventories and could materially and adversely affect our operating results 
we compete with major domestic and international semiconductor companies  many of which have substantially greater financial  technical  marketing  distribution and other resources 
we may not be able to compete successfully in the future 
our more mature products  such as serial and parallel eeprom devices  compete on the basis of product performance  price  product availability and customer service 
principal competitors for our eeprom products currently include atmel  stmicroelectronics and microchip technology 
principal competitors for our low density flash products include silicon storage technology and integrated silicon solution 
principal competitors for our analog and mixed signal products include maxim integrated products  linear technology  intersil  fairchild semiconductor  national semiconductor and texas instruments 
risks related to our intellectual property our business may be harmed if we fail to protect our proprietary technology 
we rely on a combination of patents  trademarks  copyrights  trade secret laws  confidentiality procedures and licensing arrangements to protect our intellectual property rights 
we currently have patents granted and pending in the united states and intend to seek further united states and international patents on our technology 
we cannot be certain that patents will be issued from any of our pending applications  that patents will be issued in all countries where our products can be sold or that any issued patents will be of sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful protection or any commercial advantage 
our competitors may also be able to design around our patents 
the laws of some countries in which our products are or may be developed  manufactured or sold  may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states  increasing the possibility of piracy of our technology and products 
although we intend to vigorously defend our intellectual property rights  we may not be able to prevent misappropriation of our technology 
our competitors may also independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology 
our ability to produce our products may suffer if someone claims we infringe on their intellectual property 
the semiconductor industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights or positions  which have resulted in significant and often protracted and expensive litigation 
in addition  it is typical for companies in the industry to receive notices from time to time that allege infringement of patents or other intellectual property rights 
for example  in april  xicor  inc filed a complaint alleging that some of our dpps infringed on one of its patents  which complaint we settled in june we may receive other notices or become a party to other proceedings alleging our infringement of patents or intellectual property rights in the future 
if it is necessary or desirable  we may seek licenses under such patents or other intellectual property rights 
however  we cannot be certain that licenses will be offered or that we would find the terms of licenses that are offered acceptable or commercially reasonable 
our failure to obtain a license from a third party for technology used by us could cause us to incur substantial liabilities and to suspend the manufacture of products 
furthermore  we may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to establish the validity of our proprietary rights 
litigation by or against us could result in significant expense and divert the efforts of our technical personnel and management  
table of contents whether or not the litigation results in a favorable determination 
in the event of an adverse result in any litigation  we could be required to pay substantial damages  pay amounts to indemnify our customers  stop the manufacture  use and sale of the infringing products  expend significant resources to develop non infringing technology  discontinue the use of certain processes  or obtain licenses to the technology 
we may be unsuccessful in developing non infringing products or negotiating licenses upon reasonable terms  or at all 
these problems might not be resolved in time to avoid harming our results of operations 
if any third party makes a successful claim against our customers or us and a license is not made available to us on commercially reasonable terms  our business could be harmed 
we may be subject to damages resulting from claims that we have wrongfully used the alleged trade secrets of our employees former employers 
many of our employees were previously employed at other companies  including our competitors or potential competitors 
although we have no current or pending claims against us  we may be subject to claims that we have relied on information that these employees have inadvertently or otherwise disclosed that represent the trade secrets or other proprietary information of their former employers 
litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims 
if we fail in defending such claims  in addition to paying monetary damages  we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel 
a loss of key research personnel or their work product could hamper or prevent our ability to develop new products  which could severely harm our business 
even if we are successful  litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management 
we may not be able to expand our proprietary technology if we do not acquire rights to use key technologies  consummate potential acquisitions or investments or successfully integrate them with our business 
to expand our proprietary technologies  we may acquire or make investments in complementary businesses  technologies or products if appropriate opportunities arise 
we may be unable to identify suitable acquisition or investment candidates at reasonable prices or on reasonable terms or consummate transactions with such candidates  the failure of which could slow our growth 
we may also have difficulty in acquiring licenses to use proprietary technologies of third parties to expand our product lines 
we may have difficulty integrating the acquired products  personnel or technologies of any acquisition we might make 
these difficulties could disrupt our ongoing business  limit our future growth  distract our management and employees and increase our expenses 
risks related to our stock our stock is subject to substantial price and volume fluctuations due to a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control  and those fluctuations may prevent our stockholders from reselling our common stock at a profit 
the trading price of our common stock has in the past been and could in the future be subject to significant fluctuations in response to quarterly variations in our results of operations  international political  socioeconomic and financial instability  including instability associated with military action in afghanistan and iraq or other conflicts  
table of contents announcements of technological innovations or new products by us  our customers or competitors  our failure to achieve the operating results anticipated by analysts or investors  sales or the perception in the market of possible sales of a large number of shares of our common stock by our directors  officers  employees or principal stockholders  releases or reports by or changes in security analysts recommendations  and developments or disputes concerning patents or proprietary rights or other events 
for example  during fiscal and to date in fiscal  the trading price of our common stock on the nasdaq national market and the nasdaq smallcap market has ranged from a high of to a low of 
if our net revenues and results of operations are below the expectations of investors  significant fluctuations in the market price of our common stock could occur 
in addition  the securities markets have  from time to time  experienced significant price and volume fluctuations  which have particularly affected the market prices for high technology companies and often are unrelated and disproportionate to the operating performance of particular companies 
these broad market fluctuations  as well as general economic  political and market conditions  may negatively affect the market price of our common stock 
our charter documents  delaware law and our stockholder rights plan contain provisions that may inhibit potential acquisition bids  which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock  discourage merger offers or prevent changes in our management 
our board of directors has the authority to issue up to  shares of preferred stock and to determine the rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions  including voting rights  of the shares without any further vote or action by our stockholders 
if we issue any of these shares of preferred stock in the future  the rights of holders of our common stock may be negatively affected 
if we issue preferred stock  a change of control of our company could be delayed  deferred or prevented 
we have no current plans to issue shares of preferred stock 
section of the delaware general corporation law restricts certain business combinations with any interested stockholder as defined by that statute 
in addition  our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain certain other provisions that may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change of control 
these provisions include the classification of our board so that only a portion of our directors are elected each year and each director serves a three year term  the elimination of actions by written consent of stockholders  and the establishment of an advance notice procedure for stockholder proposals and director nominations to be acted upon at annual meetings of the stockholders 
in  our board of directors adopted a stockholder rights plan 
under this plan  we issued a dividend of one right for each share of our common stock 
each right initially entitles stockholders to purchase one one thousandth of a share of our preferred stock for 
however  the rights are not immediately exercisable 
if a person or group acquires  or announces a tender or exchange offer that would result in the acquisition of of our common stock  unless the rights are redeemed by us for per right  the rights will become exercisable by all rights holders  except the acquiring person or group  for shares of our common stock or the stock of the third party acquirer having a value of twice the right s then current exercise price 
however  with respect to the shares of our common stock held or acquired by elex nv  the rights will not become exercisable until such time as elex nv acquires more than  shares of our common stock less the number of shares sold by elex nv upon the closing of the proposed offering of our common stock described in need for additional resources above  we intend to amend the stockholder rights plan to remove this exception applicable to elex nv these provisions are designed to encourage potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors and give our board of directors an opportunity to consider various alternatives to increase stockholder value 

table of contents these provisions are also intended to discourage certain tactics that may be used in proxy contests 
however  the potential issuance of preferred stock  our charter and bylaw provisions  the restrictions in section of the delaware general corporation law and our stockholder rights plan could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control  which may adversely affect the market price of our stock 
these provisions and plans may also have the effect of preventing changes in our management 
we may be the subject of securities class action litigation due to future stock price volatility 
in the past  when the market price of a stock has been volatile  holders of that stock have often initiated securities class action litigation against the company that issued the stock 
if any of our stockholders brought a lawsuit against us  we could incur substantial costs defending the lawsuit 
the lawsuit could also divert the time and attention of our management 
item a 
quantitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
our investment portfolio is generally comprised of us government debt securities and cash deposits 
our policy is to place these investments in instruments that meet high credit quality standards and have maturities of less than two years with an overall average maturity of less than one year 
these securities are subject to interest rate risk and could decline in value if interest rates fluctuate 
due to the short duration of the securities in which we invest and the conservative nature of our investment portfolio  a move in interest rates would have an immaterial effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
foreign currency exchange rate risk 
the majority of our sales  manufacturing costs  and research and development and marketing expenses are transacted in us dollars 
accordingly  our net profitability is not currently subject to material foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
gains and losses from such fluctuations have not been material to us to date
