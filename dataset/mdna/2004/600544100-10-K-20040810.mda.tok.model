executive business overview the principal focus of our business is to provide workplace solutions to our customers worldwide through the research  design  manufacture  and sale of office furniture products 
these products include office furniture systems  seating  storage solutions  freestanding furniture  and casegoods 
we also offer our end user customers related services such as furniture asset management and office layout design 
our products and services are offered to most of our customers under standard trade credit terms of between and days and are sold through the following distribution channels 
independent contract furniture dealers and licensees most of our product sales are made to a network of independently owned and operated contract furniture dealerships doing business in more than countries 
these dealers purchase our products and distribute them to end customers 
we recognize revenue on product sales through this channel once our products are shipped and title passes to the dealer 
many of these dealers also offer furniture related services including product installation 
owned contract furniture dealers we own and operate contract furniture dealerships 
the financial results of these owned dealers are included in our consolidated financial statements 
product sales to these dealerships are eliminated as inter company transactions from our consolidated financial results 
product and service revenue is recognized only when the dealership completes delivery of product and related services to the end customer 
direct customer sales we sometimes sell products and services directly to end customers without an intermediary 
in most of these instances  we contract separately with a dealership or third party installation company to provide sales related services 
we recognize revenue on these sales once products are shipped and installation is substantially complete 
independent retailers some products are sold to end customers through independently owned retail operations 
revenue is recognized on these sales once products are shipped and title passes to the independent retailer 
we consider our owned and independent dealer network one of the most important competitive factors vital to the long term success of our business 
general economic and industry conditions in recent years have placed significant financial pressure on several of our dealers 
we have provided financial assistance to some dealers either through direct loans or loan guarantees 
we view the primary risks to our business resulting from the dealers economic pressures as the potential disruption of our distribution channels  the resulting adverse impact on our customers  and the credit risk associated with our dealer financing arrangements 
while we cannot avoid these risks with certainty  we believe that the overall condition of the network is stable and our reserves are adequate to cover the credit risk 
we are committed to developing aesthetically and functionally innovative new products and have a history of doing so 
we believe our skills and experience in matching problem solving furniture design with the workplace needs of our customers provide us with a competitive advantage in the marketplace 
an important component of our business strategy is to actively pursue a program of new product research  design  and development 
we accomplish this through the use of an internal research and design staff as well as external design resources that are generally compensated on a royalty basis 
we manufacture our products using a system of lean manufacturing techniques collectively referred to as the herman miller production system hmps 
one key element of our manufacturing strategy is to limit fixed production costs by sourcing component parts from strategic suppliers 
this strategy has allowed us to increase the variable nature of our cost structure while at the same time retaining proprietary control over those production processes that we believe provide us a competitive advantage 
as a result of this strategy  our manufacturing operations are largely assembly based 
additionally  during fiscal years and  we actively pursued a program of supplier rationalization and consolidation in an effort to reduce procurement costs and improve quality levels 
generally this effort  in connection with hmps  has resulted in improved efficiency  costs  and reliability 
despite these benefits  the strategy does increase the risks associated with supplier transitions and dependence upon fewer suppliers 
we continue to seek financially strong suppliers interested in long term business relationships to minimize the risk of interruption to our business 
we strive to maintain efficiencies and cost savings by minimizing the amount of inventory on hand under hmps 
accordingly  production is order driven with raw materials purchased as needed to meet demand 
the standard lead time for the majority of our products is to days 
as a result  the rate of our inventory turns is high 
these combined factors could cause our inventory levels to appear relatively low in relation to sales volume 
our primary domestic manufacturing operations are located in michigan and georgia 
we also have a significant manufacturing presence in the united kingdom  which represents our largest marketplace outside the united states 
in addition to sales in the united kingdom  our products are sold internationally through wholly owned subsidiaries or branches in canada  france  germany  italy  japan  mexico  and the netherlands 
our products are offered elsewhere in the world primarily through independent dealerships and licensees 
we believe that respecting the environment in the way we do business is simply the right thing to do  and we are committed to developing sustainable business practices 
a goal of sustainability demands that we pay attention to the entire life cycle of our products 
we develop strategies that enable us to move toward sustainability while enhancing the value offered to our customers 
we measure and monitor progress toward our environmental goals as a key metric of our business success 
while the office furniture industry is subject to a multitude of macro economic influences  we generally consider the following to be the leading economic indicators of our industry s performance corporate profitability white collar employment new office construction starts office space vacancy rates the business and institutional furniture manufacturers association bifma is the trade association for the us domestic office furniture industry 
we closely monitor the trade statistics reported by bifma and consider them among the key indicators of industry wide sales and order performance 
we also analyze bifma statistical information over several quarters as a benchmark comparison against the performance of our domestic business 
finally  bifma regularly provides its members with industry forecast information  which we use internally as one of many considerations in our short and long range planning process 
discussion of business conditions the completion of our fiscal year marks the first time in three years that we have been able to report year over year growth in annual sales and net earnings 
it represents for us  symbolically if not statistically  the official end of an economic recession that led to the elimination of thousands of jobs across our industry 
this was a difficult time in our history  however  we are pleased with the changes we made to our business model as a result of the challenge 
the net effect of these changes is that we now operate as a leaner and more financially agile enterprise than we did at the beginning of the downturn 
our financial results  particularly in the second half of this year  give us confidence that overall business conditions are gaining momentum and that we have the ability to grow profitably as a result 
throughout fiscal  we saw improvement in a majority of the major economic indicators for our industry 
corporate profits  which began to show sequential quarter growth last year  continued that trend during the current fiscal year 
the employment situation has also improved 
unemployment rates across most statistical categories  including general sales and office occupations  have fallen from the previous year 
finally  while new office construction rates have yet to increase  the level of office space vacancies appears to have stabilized

of commerce  us census bureau  seasonally adjusted construction statistics as of april grubb ellis white paper research  bubble re w rapped  retesting the theory of rational exuberance in the office market  march this economic data is encouraging for the industry as a whole 
however  we are even more energized by what the performance of our business suggests about the recovery outlook 
the fourth quarter ended may  represented only the second time in three years that we reported year over year growth in net sales 
it was also the third consecutive period of year over year growth in quarterly order levels 
in total  our fourth quarter order entry rate was the highest level experienced in the past quarters 
overall business activity  as measured by client visits to our west michigan headquarters  increased by more than between the third and fourth quarters of finally  showroom attendance at the june neocon trade show in chicago was up from the prior year 
we believe the changes made to our business model in recent years  the overall macro economic environment  and our own sales and earnings performance during fiscal suggest a positive outlook 
we are also confident that we have the resources available to fund our future capital needs 
during  we completed an in depth review of our capital structure 
as a result of this work  we announced a increase in our quarterly cash dividend 
we also received additional authorization from our board of directors to continue our share repurchase program 
our markets remain intensely competitive 
we have continued our product differentiation strategy to limit  to the extent possible  the impact of negative pricing pressure 
despite these efforts  price competition remains a business reality 
in fiscal it reduced both net sales and gross margin in relation to the prior year 
consistent with this differentiation strategy  we have continued to invest heavily in new product development 
our fiscal spending in the area of design and research  including royalty payments  totaled million 
this represents an increase both in terms of dollars and percent of sales from fiscal and levels 
two innovations that gained significant attention during the year were the mirra tm chair and the abak desk system 
in the first quarter  we began taking orders for mirra  the newest addition to our seating portfolio 
market acceptance of this award winning product has been much better than we expected  and we believe our recently announced upholstered version will further enhance its popularity 
the second innovation was unveiled at the june neocon trade show with the introduction of abak  a freestanding desking product 
this newly redesigned product  which has been successful in recent years in europe and asia  will be made available to our north american customers 
the introduction captured significant attention and earned abak a gold award in the best of neocon competition 
rising material costs  particularly for raw steel  continue to be an area of concern 
increasing steel costs began to affect our business in earnest during the second half of the year 
prior to this  we were partially insulated from rising market prices by favorable pricing contracts and additional safety stock inventory built in connection with our facility consolidation efforts 
these contracts are now expired and the inventory has been used 
as a result  we expect the impact of steel prices to be more significant in the near term 
in fact  we estimate the negative impact of rising steel costs to be between million and million per quarter during the upcoming fiscal year 
in response to these higher production costs  most competitors announced some form of price increase during fiscal we announced a general price increase during the fourth quarter 
this change  which varies by product line but averages approximately of list price  was effective august  due to the ongoing business reality of price competition  however  this increase alone may not fully offset the negative impact of rising material costs in the upcoming year due to increased discounting 
that said  we believe that we can cover a large portion of the increased costs through our ongoing hmps initiatives 
on june   we announced that brian walker  then our president and chief operating officer  would succeed mike volkema as chief executive officer  effective july  mike continues in his role as board chairman and in addition is devoting time to the herman miller creative office  assisting with commercialization of new innovations and related business development 
having served in a number of senior executive positions during his years with the company  brian brings to the ceo s role an in depth knowledge of our industry and a high energy leadership style well suited to a new era 
this evolution of roles maintains the continuity of a strong leadership team  enables greater focus in their respective responsibilities  and reflects a growing trend in corporate governance practice to separate the ceo and chairman s responsibilities 
restructuring activities during the fiscal year  we completed substantially all of our outstanding restructuring initiatives 
first  in the second quarter we completed the sale of the holland  michigan chair plant 
cash proceeds received from the sale totaled approximately million 
the sale resulted in the recognition of a million gain  which was treated as a reduction to our second quarter restructuring expenses 
we also completed the relocation of our canton  georgia manufacturing operation to our spring lake  michigan campus 
while the canton manufacturing facility remains listed for sale  the move itself proceeded as planned and on schedule 
the carrying values of the canton assets were written down to their estimated fair market values in fiscal and remain classified under the balance sheet caption  net property and equipment 
finally  we completed the consolidation of our holland  michigan formcoat operation into existing space at one of our facilities located in nearby zeeland  michigan 
the lease on the formcoat facility has been terminated 
pretax restructuring charges totaling million  million  and million were recognized during fiscal years   and  respectively 
the following is a breakdown by category of these charges 
in millions severance and outplacement asset impairments pension related lease and supplier contract terminations facility exit costs and other total restructuring expenses relating to the canton and formcoat moves totaled approximately million 
in addition  we recognized pension related expenses of approximately million associated with the workforce reduction announced late in fiscal as previously mentioned  our restructuring charges were reduced by approximately million with the gain on the sale of the holland chair plant facility 
the remaining net credit for the year primarily related to adjustments to the expected sub lease timing for facilities previously exited as part of our restructuring plan 
cash outflows related to our restructuring activities totaled approximately million in fiscal this compares to outflows of million and million in fiscal years and  respectively 
we expect future cash outflows  which will relate primarily to carrying costs and lease obligations on previously exited facilities  to total approximately million to million 
this amount  the majority of which will likely be incurred during fiscal  does not include cash proceeds from the potential future sale of our canton facility 
financial results the following is a comparison of our annual results of operations and year over year percentage changes for the periods indicated 
dollars in millions fiscal chg from fiscal chg from fiscal net sales    cost of sales  gross margin operating expenses restructuring expenses operating earnings net other expenses earnings before income taxes income tax expense benefit cumulative effect of accounting change na net earnings does not include expenses recognized in connection with our restructuring activities as these are reported on a separate line for the purposes of this analysis 
consolidated net sales  orders  and backlog net sales for fiscal of  million were up slightly from  million reported in fiscal this compares to net sales in fiscal of  million 
on a weekly basis  sales for the current fiscal year averaged million 
during the first half of fiscal  sales averaged approximately million per week 
in the latter half of the year  however  the average increased to approximately million 
this change contrasts with what has historically been a second half seasonal decline in weekly sales rates 
we attribute this increase in sales activity to the fact that our backlog at the beginning of the year included an unusually high component of longer lead time orders 
many of these orders shipped in the second half of the fiscal year 
in addition  we experienced an increase in second half sales and order activity due at least in part to the general improvement in overall economic conditions 
net trade orders totaled  million in fiscal compared to  million in and  million in on a weekly basis  our fiscal orders averaged approximately million 
the ending consolidated backlog at may  totaled million 
this represents an increase of from million at the end of fiscal the fiscal backlog includes approximately million related to the consolidation of dealer financial statements under fin as discussed in more detail later in this report 
domestic operations domestic net sales in the current year totaled  million 
this represents a decline from the fiscal level of  million 
this overall year over year decline was driven by a reduction in the first half of the fiscal year 
this reduction was largely offset  however  by year over year growth in net sales of in the second half of fiscal in fiscal year  our domestic net sales totaled  million 
during the first quarter of fiscal year  we purchased an additional interest in our philadelphia based dealership  op spectrum llp spectrum  for million 
this purchase increased our ownership stake in the entity to 
as a result of the transaction  we began consolidating the dealership s financial statements in august of this fiscal year 
prior to the transaction  we accounted for our investment on the equity method  with our ownership proportion of the resulting gains or losses reported as a component of other income expense 
the consolidation of spectrum increased our fiscal net sales by approximately million 
the competitive pricing environment has continued to pose a significant challenge to our efforts to increase the top line 
fiscal net sales were reduced from the prior year level by an incremental increase in domestic discounting of million 
the comparable impact of higher discounting in fiscal years and totaled approximately million and million  respectively 
new orders for our domestic operations totaled  million in fiscal this compares to orders of  million in the prior year and represents a year over year increase of approximately 
orders in fiscal totaled  million 
by comparison  bifma reported an estimated year over year increase in us office furniture shipments of approximately for the twelve month period ended may for the same period  bifma estimates industry orders grew approximately 
international operations and exports from the united states our international results were a highlight for the year 
net sales totaled million representing an increase of from our fiscal level of million 
in fiscal year  our international net sales totaled million 
we experienced year over year sales increases in almost all international regions 
the exceptions to this were our operations in mexico  which experienced unusually high sales in the prior year attributable to a few large project wins  and central europe  which continues to be depressed by a difficult economy 
our sales growth in the current year was particularly significant in the asia pacific region  especially japan and australia 
we also experienced strong growth in our export business to spain and the middle east 
in total  sales from our international operations represented approximately of our consolidated net sales in fiscal this compares to in fiscal and in fiscal our sales performance in international benefited from changes in foreign currency exchange rates during the year 
the relative weakening of the us dollar increased the us dollar value of our international sales by approximately million compared to what this value would have been at prior year exchange rates 
it is important to note that these changes in exchange rates generally have a similar effect on our international cost structure the us dollar value of our international expenses increased relative to prior year levels as a result of the weakening us dollar 
for the second consecutive year  our international operations posted positive net earnings 
net earnings for fiscal were million compared with million last year and a net loss of million in fiscal gross margin our fiscal gross margin  as a percent of net sales  totaled 
this compares to in fiscal and in fiscal the current year decline from the level is attributable to several factors 
first  as mentioned  increased price discounting from the prior year had a significant negative impact on our financial results 
this alone reduced our gross margin percentage by points 
other significant factors include increasing material costs  labor inefficiencies resulting from the relocation of the canton operation  and higher current year incentive bonuses 
these negative factors in the current year were offset to some extent by a reduction in manufacturing overhead expenses 
in comparison to the prior year  our fiscal direct material costs increased on both a dollar and percent of sales basis 
the biggest reason for this increase as a percentage of sales was price discounting 
while unit volume sales in were higher than the prior year  the revenue generated from those sales was depressed due to competitive price discounting 
the result of this is higher total expenses for direct materials on nearly the same sales dollars 
this was further compounded during the year as we began to experience significant increases in the cost of certain direct materials 
this was not only the case for raw steel  which in total negatively affected gross margin by approximately million for the year  but also resulted from the impact of higher oil prices on petroleum based components such as plastics 
direct labor expenses in fiscal increased slightly as a percent of sales when compared to the prior year 
as we had expected  the closure and relocation of our canton  georgia operation resulted in short term labor inefficiencies 
as this transition effort was ongoing for most of the fiscal year  we experienced the increased costs over that same time 
the canton move is now complete  and beginning in the fourth quarter of this year  we began to realize some of the expected labor and overhead benefits resulting from this move 
our manufacturing overhead expenses  both in dollar and percent of sales terms  were lower in fiscal compared to the prior year 
this reduction  which totaled approximately million  was achieved despite an increase in current year incentive bonus expenses of approximately million 
pretax variable compensation expense included in our fiscal cost of sales totaled million compared to million in in fiscal  we recognized credits of million related to the reduction of variable compensation accruals that had been established in a prior period 
operating expenses and operating earnings we continue to demonstrate year over year improvement in operating expenses 
in fiscal  total operating expenses were million compared to million in the prior year and million in these amounts include restructuring expenses as previously described as well as selling  general  and administrative sg a charges of million  million  and million  respectively 
design and research costs included in total operating expenses were million  million  and million for   and  respectively 
the decline in sg a expense from fiscal of million or was primarily the result of lower overall compensation  benefit  and depreciation expenses 
the majority of these savings are a direct result of our restructuring actions in recent years 
we also experienced a reduction in customer bad debt expenses in the current year as compared to fiscal this reduction resulted from an overall improvement in the aging of our accounts receivable  which reduced the level of required reserves in the current year 
partially offsetting these declines were increased current year expenses totaling million resulting from the consolidation of op spectrum 
our fiscal sg a expenses included a pretax charge totaling million related to a legal judgment from a lawsuit 
early in fiscal  we received a favorable court ruling on the matter 
accordingly  we reduced our sg a expenses by million from the reversal of the related legal and interest accruals 
pretax variable compensation expense credits included in our current year operating expenses totaled million 
this compares to million last year and million in fiscal the credits recognized in related to the reduction of incentive bonus accruals that were established in a prior period 
our fiscal operating expenses included million in charges from the accelerated depreciation of certain technology related assets 
also included in that year was approximately million in goodwill asset amortization expense 
under an accounting rule that became effective in fiscal  amortization expense of goodwill assets is no longer recognized 
expenses for design and research within total operating expenses include royalty payments paid to designers of our products as the products are sold 
these payments  which totaled million  million  and million  in fiscal years   and  respectively  are considered to be variable costs of the products being sold 
accordingly  we do not consider them research and development costs as discussed in note of the consolidated financial statements operating earnings in fiscal year of million improved by million over our fiscal level 
on a percent of sales basis  operating earnings totaled in fiscal compared to in in fiscal  we posted an operating loss of million or negative of net sales 
other expenses and income net other expenses totaled million in fiscal compared to million in and million in the year over year decline between and was caused primarily by an accounting charge related to our investment in spectrum as discussed below 
lower current year interest charges also contributed to the decline 
changes in foreign exchange rates and the resulting transaction gains between years partially offset the decline 
during  we recognized a million pretax charge related to the impairment of our equity investment in spectrum 
as previously discussed  we increased our ownership stake in this dealer during the first quarter of this year  and its financial statements are now being consolidated 
interest expense in the current year was million lower than in lower year over year debt levels and increased savings resulting from our interest rate swap arrangements were the reason for this decline 
finally  we recorded a foreign currency transaction gain in fiscal of million compared to million in the prior year 
income taxes in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a benefit from the release of tax reserves totaling million 
these reserves were released as a result of the closure of irs audits for the years   and as a result of this adjustment  we reported a effective tax rate for the full fiscal year 
excluding the impact of this reserve adjustment  our effective tax rate for the year totaled 
this adjusted rate was lower than our earlier estimates for the full year due to year end state tax true ups on the actual full year results 
we expect our long term effective tax rate to be approximately 
our effective tax rate was in fiscal and in cumulative effect of accounting change we adopted the revised provisions of financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin r at the end of fiscal this new accounting standard broadens the requirements for determining whether a company is required to consolidate the financial statements of another entity 
in adopting fin r  we determined the need to consolidate the financial statements of two independent contract furniture dealerships to which we have provided ongoing financial support through loans and or financial guarantees 
as a result of this consolidation  we recorded a non cash cumulative effect loss of million  or slightly less than per share  net of tax 
as this new accounting standard was adopted at the end of the current fiscal year  the consolidation had no material impact on our fiscal consolidated statement of operations beyond that of the cumulative effect 
in the future  the results of operations of these two dealers will be included in our consolidated statement of operations 
the effect of adoption on our consolidated balance sheet as of may   was an increase to assets of approximately million and liabilities of million 
refer to note of the consolidated financial statements for additional information on fin r 
change in accounting principle at the beginning of fiscal  we converted a portion of our remaining fifo based domestic inventories to lifo for inventory valuation purposes 
due to the facility rationalization and consolidation resulting from our restructuring activities in recent years  we determined it was more appropriate to account for these inventories using the lifo method 
there was no cumulative effect of this change in accounting principle  and the impact on our fiscal results was not material 
net earnings net earnings totaled million in fiscal or per share after the impact of the cumulative effect of accounting change 
this compares to net earnings of million or per share in in fiscal  we reported a net loss of million or per share 
the per share impact of restructuring charges recognized during fiscal years   and totaled approximately   and  net of taxes  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources the table below presents certain key cash flow and capital highlights 
in millions cash and cash equivalents short term investments cash generated from operating activities cash used for investing activities cash used for financing activities capital expenditures interest bearing debt available unsecured credit facility stock repurchased and retired pension plan contributions restructuring related cash outflows beginning in fiscal  outstanding letters of credit were applied against our unsecured credit facility 
accordingly  the amounts shown for and are net of these letters of credit 
interest bearing debt totaled million at the end of fiscal compared to million in and million in the current year amount includes million related to debt obligations of the entities consolidated under fin outstanding standby letters of credit at the end of fiscal years and totaled million and million  respectively 
these letters of credit represented the only usage against our unsecured revolving credit facility as of those dates 
we were in compliance with all provisions of our debt covenants throughout the past three fiscal years 
during the current year  we entered into two interest rate swap arrangements to convert a total of million of fixed rate debt to a variable rate basis 
these new arrangements are in addition to a previous swap transaction entered into at the end of fiscal as of the end of fiscal  the portion of our total interest bearing debt that was effectively converted to a variable rate basis through these arrangements totaled million 
interest expense savings resulting from the swap arrangements totaled approximately million in fiscal and million in fiscal average month days sales outstanding dso in accounts receivable and inventory totaled at the end of fiscal compared to in the prior year and in during fiscal  we experienced relatively strong collections and a general improvement in our accounts receivable aging categories 
our gross accounts receivable balance at may  increased approximately million or from the end of fiscal this was driven mainly by increased sales activity in the current year fourth quarter 
this is also the primary reason for the year over year increase in gross inventories 
the recorded allowance for non collectible accounts  as a percent of gross accounts receivable  totaled   and as of the end of fiscal   and  respectively 
the reduction in the current year percentage is attributable to the overall improvement in the quality of our accounts receivable aging 
cash flow operating activities cash flow generated from operating activities totaled million in the current year 
this compares to million in and million in the decline in cash flow of million between fiscal and relates primarily to tax refunds received in the prior year as well as a significant shift in working capital balances 
federal tax refunds received during fiscal increased cash flow by million 
these refunds related mainly to net operating losses generated in fiscal year by comparison  we received federal refunds of only million in the current year 
as a reminder  in fiscal we made cash payments totaling million for taxes and interest related to our settlement with the irs concerning our coli program 
these payments reduced operating cash flows  partially offsetting the favorable changes in working capital balances discussed below 
from a working capital perspective  we received a much larger cash flow benefit in fiscal as compared to the current year 
most of this benefit was driven by a significant increase in accrued income taxes and declines in accounts receivable and inventory balances between and by contrast  in fiscal these working capital balances moved in the opposite direction resulting in a year over year decrease in accrued income taxes and increases in both accounts receivable and inventories 
these negative factors were partially offset in by a production driven increase in accounts payable  higher relative compensation and benefit accruals  and favorable changes in deferred taxes 
we made cash contributions to our employee pension funds totaling million in fiscal in fiscal years and  such contributions totaled million and million  respectively 
these payments reduced operating cash flows in each of these years 
subsequent to the end of fiscal  in july  we made additional cash contributions totaling million to our domestic employee pension plans 
again in fiscal  we incurred operating cash outflows related to our restructuring activities 
cash payments in the year totaled million 
we made similar cash payments in and totaling million and million  respectively 
cash flow investing activities cash outflows for investing activities in fiscal totaled million and were driven primarily by capital expenditures offset by proceeds from the sale of fixed assets 
these same factors combined in fiscal to generate the majority of the million outflow in that year 
in fiscal year  cash outflows totaling million  which related mainly to capital expenditures  were offset by a million cash receipt from the net surrender value of our coli policies 
capital expenditures in the current year totaled million  down slightly from million in fiscal in fiscal  our spending was substantially higher in this area totaling million 
we have made significant progress in recent years adjusting our annual capital spending to be in line with business levels 
we will continue to carefully monitor and challenge our spending in this area while at the same time taking care not to eliminate investments that are important to the long term success of our operations and overall strategy 
as of the end of fiscal  we had outstanding commitments for future capital purchases of approximately million 
we expect fiscal capital expenditures to total between million and million 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we completed the sale of our holland  michigan chair plant 
this facility was exited in connection with our restructuring plan  and its sale generated net proceeds of approximately million 
in fiscal  we received proceeds totaling million from the sale of our rocklin  california and west michigan powder coat technology facilities 
both of these facilities were exited in connection with prior restructuring actions 
cash flow financing activities in millions  except share and per share data shares acquired    cost of shares acquired weighted average cost per share acquired shares issued    weighted average price per share issued cash dividends dividends paid per share 


cash outflows for financing activities totaled million in fiscal compared to million in and million in as was the case in  share repurchases in the current year accounted for a majority of the outflows in this category 
in  we repurchased fewer shares than in the prior year  however  they were acquired at a significantly higher weighted average cost 
this resulted in essentially the same total cash outflow for repurchases between years 
during the current year  our board of directors gave us approval to continue our share repurchase program with an additional million authorization limit 
as of the end of fiscal  we had approximately million available on our authorization to be used for future share repurchases 
we continue to believe this is an effective means of returning value to our shareholders 
during fiscal we received cash totaling million related to the issuance of our common stock 
this was driven mainly by the exercise of stock options  the volume of which increased significantly from last year presumably due to the current year increase in our stock price 
in fiscal  cash received from the issuance of stock totaled only million and related primarily to issuances in connection with employee benefit plans 
repayments of long term debt totaled million in fiscal the majority of this related to the current year scheduled payment on our private placement notes 
we also repaid approximately million in remaining debt related to a prior dealer acquisition 
in fiscal  repayments totaled million with the majority again related to the private placement 
also included in our repayments was approximately million related to short term bank debt associated with our former australian business 
debt repayments in fiscal were million 
our next scheduled debt repayment totals million and will be made in the fourth quarter of fiscal we paid cash dividends of million  million  and million during fiscal   and  respectively 
in april  we announced a increase in our quarterly dividend rate bringing it to per share 
we will begin paying at this new rate in the first quarter of fiscal we believe cash on hand  cash generated from operations  and our credit facilities will provide adequate liquidity to fund near term and future business operations and capital needs 
contingencies the company  for a number of years  has sold various products to the united states government under general services administration gsa multiple award schedule contracts 
under the terms of these contracts  the gsa is permitted to audit the company s compliance with the gsa contracts

on march   a settlement was reached in mediation concerning an audit of the company s compliance with its international gsa contract for the years   and the terms of the settlement required the company to pay million to the united states government 
this payment was made during the fourth quarter of fiscal the financial impact of this settlement was previously reserved for  and consequently  it had no impact on fiscal net earnings 
the company is also involved in legal proceedings and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business 
in the opinion of management  the outcome of such proceedings and litigation currently pending will not materially effect the company s consolidated financial statements

these arrangements are accounted for and disclosed in accordance with fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirement for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others as described in note of the consolidated financial statements 
variable interest entities on occasion  we provide financial support to certain dealers in the form of term loans  lines of credit  and or loan guarantees 
at may   we were considered the primary beneficiary of two such relationships due to the nature of our variable interests in these entities as further discussed in note of the consolidated financial statements 
in addition to these  we also hold variable interests in other dealerships where we are not the primary beneficiary 
the risks and rewards associated with our interests in these other dealerships are primarily limited to our outstanding loans and guarantee amounts 
at may   the company s maximum exposure to any potential losses related to financing provided to such entities in the form of term loans and or lines of credit totaled million 
information on our exposure related to outstanding loan guarantees provided to such entities is included in note of the consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies we strive to report our financial results clearly and understandably 
we follow accounting principles generally accepted in the us in preparing our consolidated financial statements  which require us to make certain estimates and apply judgments that affect our financial position and results of operations 
we continually review our accounting policies and financial information disclosures 
following is a summary of our more significant accounting policies that require the use of estimates and judgments in preparing the financial statements 
receivable allowances we base our allowances related to receivables on known customer exposures  historical credit experience  and the specific identification of other potential problems  including the economic climate 
these methods are applied to all major receivables  including trade  lease  and notes receivables 
in addition to known or judgmental components of our allowances  we follow a policy that consistently applies reserve rates based on the age of outstanding accounts receivable 
actual collections can differ from our historical experience  and if economic or business conditions deteriorate significantly  adjustments to these reserves could be required 
the accounts receivable allowance totaled million and million at may  and may   respectively 
this year over year reduction is attributable to the overall improvement in the quality of our accounts receivable aging 
the notes receivable allowance totaled million and million at may  and may   respectively 
this year over year reduction is primarily attributable to the elimination of intercompany balances with op spectrum llp consolidated upon the acquisition as further described in note and with certain dealerships consolidated upon the adoption of fin r as further described in note of the consolidated financial statements 
goodwill the net carrying value of our goodwill at may  totaled million 
beginning in fiscal year  we ceased recognizing amortization expense on these goodwill assets in accordance with the accounting guidance in statement of financial accounting standards no 
under this new rule  we are required to perform an annual test on our goodwill assets  by reporting unit  to determine whether the asset values are impaired 
if impairment is determined  we are required to recognize a charge sufficient to reduce the net carrying value of the assets to their estimated fair market value 
we performed this test in the fourth quarter of fiscal and determined that no impairment exists 
our estimate of reporting unit fair value was based on discounted cash flows 
accordingly  we were required to make certain assumptions regarding future profitability and cash flows 
it also required us to use an assumed discount rate  which we set at 
we believe this level is conservative in that it exceeds our estimated weighted average cost of capital 
changes to the discount rate used in this analysis have a significant impact on the results of the impairment test 
our analysis indicates that we could increase this discount rate by more than full percentage points before the results of the test indicated impairment 
warranty reserve we stand behind our products and keep our promises to customers 
from time to time  issues arise resulting in the need to incur costs to correct or replace problems with products or services 
we have established warranty reserves for the various costs associated with these guarantees 
general warranty reserves are based on historical claims experience and periodically adjusted for business levels 
specific reserves are established once an issue is identified 
the valuations of such reserves are based on the estimated costs to correct the problem 
actual costs may vary and result in an adjustment to our reserves 
inventory reserves inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
the inventories of certain subsidiaries are valued using the last in  first out lifo method 
the inventories of other subsidiaries are valued using first in  first out method 
we establish reserves for excess and obsolete inventory  based on material movement and a component of judgment for consideration of current events  such as economic conditions  that may affect inventory 
the amount of reserve required to record inventory at lower of cost or market may be adjusted as conditions change 
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities  and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to reverse 
we have net operating loss nol carryforwards available in certain jurisdictions to reduce future taxable income 
future tax benefits for nol carryforwards are recognized to the extent that realization of these benefits is considered more likely than not 
we base this determination on the expectation that related operations will be sufficiently profitable or various tax planning strategies available to us will enable us to utilize the nol carryforwards 
when information becomes available that raises doubts about the realization of a deferred income tax asset  a valuation allowance is established 
self insurance reserves with the assistance of independent actuaries  we establish reserves for workers compensation and general liability exposures 
the reserves are established based on actuarially determined expected future claims 
we also established reserves for health benefit exposures based on historical claims information along with certain assumptions about future trends 
the methods and assumptions used to determine the liabilities are applied consistently  although actual claim experience can vary 
we maintain certain insurance coverage for risk exposures through traditional premium based insurance policies 
pension and other post retirement benefits the determination of the obligation and expense for pension and other post retirement benefits depends on certain actuarial assumptions used in calculating such amounts 
among the most significant of these assumptions are the discount rate  expected long term rate of return on plan assets  and expected rate of increases in compensation and healthcare costs 
these assumptions are reviewed annually based on internal and external factors 
adjustments to the assumptions could result in changes to the future expense and liabilities 
refer to note of the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding costs and assumptions used for employee benefit plans 
long lived assets we evaluate long lived assets and acquired businesses for indicators of impairment when events or circumstances indicate that a risk may be present 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment are based on market conditions  operational performance  and estimated future cash flows 
if the carrying value of a long lived asset is considered impaired  an impairment charge is recorded to adjust the asset to its estimated fair value

 accounting and disclosure requirements related to the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of fsp in response to the act that was signed into law on december  the act introduced a prescription drug benefit under medicare medicare part d as well as a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree healthcare plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to medicare part d 
the provisions of fsp provide guidance on the accounting treatment and required disclosures relating to the effects of the act 
this guidance supersedes fasb staff position no 
 accounting and disclosure requirements related to the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of fsp 
currently  specific regulatory guidance does not exist regarding how to determine whether a plan is considered actuarially equivalent  a key criterion under fsp accordingly  the company is currently in the process of evaluating existing plan benefits to determine actuarial equivalency and the corresponding impact of the fsp on the financial statements 
the company expects to adopt the provisions of fsp in the second quarter of fiscal forward looking statements this discussion and other sections of our annual report contain forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act  as amended  that are based on management s beliefs  assumptions  current expectations  estimates  and projections about the office furniture industry  the economy  and the company itself 
words like anticipates  believes  confident  estimates  expects  forecasts  likely  plans  projects  should  variations of such words  and similar expressions identify such forward looking statements 
these statements do not guarantee future performance and involve certain risks  uncertainties  and assumptions that are difficult to predict with regard to timing  extent  likelihood  and degree of occurrence 
therefore  actual results and outcomes may materially differ from what we express or forecast 
furthermore  herman miller  inc  undertakes no obligation to update  amend  or clarify forward looking statements 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company manufactures  markets and sells its products throughout the world and  as a result  is subject to changing economic conditions  which could reduce the demand for its products 
favorable foreign currency fluctuations during fiscal resulted in increased earnings from continuing operations before income taxes of million 
additionally  the accumulated other comprehensive loss component of total shareholders equity was reduced during fiscal by million as a result of these changes 
by comparison  currency fluctuations in fiscal resulted in increased pretax earnings of million and reduced accumulated other comprehensive loss by million 
because the company conducts business internationally  it will continue to be subject to related currency exchange rate fluctuations 
the company maintains fixed rate debt 
for fixed rate debt  changes in interest rates generally affect fair market value but not earnings or cash flows 
the company does not have an incentive to prepay fixed rate debt prior to maturity  and as a result  interest rate risk and changes in fair market value should not have a significant impact on such debt until the company would be required to refinance it 
the company has three separate interest rate swap agreements that effectively convert million in total of fixed rate debt to a variable rate basis at the end of the fiscal year 
this debt is subject to changes in interest rates  which could have a material impact on the company s financial results 
the interest rate swap derivative instruments are held and used by the company as a tool for managing interest rate risk 
they are not used for trading or speculative purposes 
the counterparties to these swap instruments are large major financial institutions that the company believes are of high quality creditworthiness 
while the company may be exposed to potential losses due to the credit risk of non performance by these counterparties  such losses are not anticipated 
the swap arrangements resulted in the reduction of net interest expense by approximately million and million in fiscal years and  respectively 
in fiscal  the effect on net interest expense was not material 
as of may   the swap instruments had a combined negative fair value of approximately million 
all cash flows related to the company s interest rate swap agreements are denominated in us dollars 
for further information  refer to fair value of financial instruments and financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
expected cash flows notional amounts over the next five years and thereafter related to debt instruments are as follows
