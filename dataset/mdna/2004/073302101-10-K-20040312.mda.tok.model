item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations dollars in millions  except per share data overview based on our experience in the industry  we believe we are the world s largest manufacturer of cabin interior products for commercial aircraft and for business jets and a leading aftermarket aerospace distributor of fasteners 
we sell our manufactured products directly to virtually all of the world s major airlines and airframe manufacturers and a wide variety of business jet customers 
in addition  based on our experience  we believe that we have achieved leading global market positions in each of our major product categories  which include o commercial aircraft seats  including an extensive line of first class  business class  tourist class and regional aircraft seats  o a full line of aircraft food and beverage preparation and storage equipment  including coffeemakers  water boilers  beverage containers  refrigerators  freezers  chillers and microwave  high heat convection and steam ovens  o both chemical and gaseous aircraft oxygen delivery systems  o business jet and general aviation interior products  including an extensive line of executive aircraft seats  direct and indirect overhead lighting systems  oxygen delivery systems  air valve systems  high end furniture and cabinetry  and o a broad line of aftermarket fasteners  covering over  skus 
we also design  develop and manufacture a broad range of cabin interior structures and provide comprehensive aircraft cabin interior reconfiguration and passenger to freighter conversion engineering services and component kits 
we generally derive our revenues from two primary sources refurbishment or upgrade programs for the existing worldwide fleets of commercial and general aviation aircraft and new aircraft deliveries 
for fiscal  the ten month transition period ended december  and fiscal  approximately  and  respectively  of our revenues were derived from the aftermarket  with the remaining portions attributable to new aircraft deliveries 
we believe our large installed base of products  estimated to be over billion as of december  valued at replacement prices  gives us a significant advantage over our competitors in obtaining orders both for spare parts and for refurbishment programs  principally due to the tendency of the airlines to purchase equipment for such programs from the original supplier 
we conduct our operations through strategic business units that have been aggregated under three reportable segments commercial aircraft products  business jet products and fastener distribution 
net sales by line of business were as follows fiscal year ended ten month period ended fiscal year ended december  december  february  net of net of net of sales net sales sales net sales sales net sales commercial aircraft products seating products interior systems products engineering services and engineered structures and components business jet products fastener distribution net sales net sales by domestic and foreign operations were as follows fiscal ten month period fiscal year year ended ended ended december  december  february  united states europe total net sales by geographic segment based on destination were as follows fiscal year ended ten month period ended fiscal year ended december  december  february  net of net of net of sales net sales sales net sales sales net sales americas europe asia we have substantially expanded the size  scope and nature of our business through a number of acquisitions 
since  we have completed acquisitions  including one acquisition during fiscal  one acquisition during the transition period ended december  and three during fiscal  for an aggregate purchase price of approximately  in order to position ourselves as the preferred global supplier to our customers 
during the period from to  we integrated the acquired businesses  closing facilities  reducing our workforce by  positions and implementing common information technology platforms and lean manufacturing initiatives company wide 
this integration effort resulted in costs and charges totaling approximately the rapid decline in industry conditions brought about by the terrorist attacks on september  caused us to implement a facility consolidation and integration plan designed to re align our capacity and cost structure with changed conditions in the airline industry 
the facility consolidation and integration plan included closing five facilities and reducing workforce by approximately  employees 
we believe these initiatives will enable us to substantially expand profit margins when industry conditions improve and demand increases  strengthen the global business management focus on our core product categories and more effectively leverage our resources 
the total cost of this program was approximately  including approximately of cash charges 
new product development is a strategic initiative for our company 
our customers regularly request that we engage in new product development and enhancement activities 
we believe that these activities  if properly focused and managed  will protect and enhance our leadership position 
research  development and engineering spending have been approximately of sales for the past several years  and is expected to remain at that level for the foreseeable future 
we also believe in providing our businesses with the tools required to remain competitive 
in that regard  we have  and will continue to invest in property and equipment that enhances our productivity 
over the past three years  annual capital expenditures ranged from taking into consideration our recent capital expenditure investments  current industry conditions and the recent acquisitions  we expect that annual capital expenditures will be approximately for the next few years

fastener distribution sales in were up or compared to the prior year due to market share gains 
gross profit was  or of net sales for the year ended december   compared to  or of net sales last year 
the decrease in gross profit is primarily due to poor operating results at our business jet segment throughout the year  weaker margins at our commercial aircraft products group due to product mix during the first half of and an approximately adverse impact from the weakening us dollar versus the british pound

 net sales change commercial aircraft products business jet products fastener distribution total sales of commercial aircraft products were or lower than sales in the prior year  due to the recession in the airline industry and the further downturn in industry conditions following september  sales of business jet products and fastener distribution products also reflected restrained demand due to the aviation industry downturn 
because we acquired m m in september  the current period reflects the full ten month transition period of fastener distribution revenue compared with four months in the comparable period in the prior year 
gross profit was  or of net sales for the transition period ended december  as compared to  or of sales for the ten month period ended december  the period over period increase in gross margin as a percentage of net sales occurred despite the decrease in revenues and was due to a reduction in facility consolidation and integration costs and the positive impact of our facility consolidation efforts  lean manufacturing and continuous improvement programs 
included in facility consolidation costs for the ten months ended december  was an impairment charge of related to certain intangible assets  primarily comprised of technical plans and drawings and product approvals  in the commercial aircraft products segment which management determined had been permanently impaired as a result of the decline in industry conditions and the facility consolidation 
selling  general and administrative expenses  excluding the adverse result in the thales arbitration  were or of net sales for the transition period ended december  as compared to or of net sales for the comparable period in the prior year 
the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses was due to lower spending  primarily as a result of our facility consolidation and integration program and austerity measures  together with a decrease of related to the adoption of sfas no

research  development and engineering expenses were or of net sales for the transition period ended december  as compared with or of sales for the comparable period in the prior year 
the period over period decrease in research  development and engineering expenses is primarily attributable to austerity measures  which were implemented subsequent to the september  terrorist attacks 
in february  we received an adverse result in an arbitration proceeding  which had been ongoing since october the decision reduced the amounts we originally sought in connection with the dispute  resulting in a net amount of million due to us 
the dispute concerned the sale of our in flight entertainment business to thales 
under the terms of the purchase and sale agreement  we received million during  and were to receive two additional payments totaling million  and a third and final payment based on actual sales and bookings 
thales did not pay the million  or the third and final payment 
we initiated arbitration proceedings to compel payment in december thales counterclaimed against us  alleging various breaches of the purchase and sale agreement 
previously  we had recorded a receivable of million in connection with the sale of the business to thales 
as a result of the arbitration award  we reduced our note receivable by as of december   representing the difference between the arbitration panel s award and our previously recorded amounts 
despite a decrease in net sales  our operating loss for the transition period ended december  decreased by compared to the operating loss in the comparable period in the prior year due to a decrease in facility consolidation and integration costs  and a decrease in operating expenses  excluding the arbitration result  arising from austerity measures and the implementation of sfas no 
interest expense  net was for the transition period ended december   or greater than interest expense of for the comparable period in the prior year 
the increase in interest expense is due to an increase in debt following the acquisition of m m in september and higher interest rates on our bank borrowings 
the lower level of revenues  which was partially offset by lower facility consolidation and integration costs during the transition period ended december   resulted in a loss before income taxes of or less than the loss before income taxes in the comparable period in the prior year

liquidity and capital resources current financial condition our liquidity requirements consist of working capital needs  ongoing capital expenditures and payments of interest and principal on our indebtedness 
our primary requirements for working capital are directly related to the level of our operations  working capital primarily consists of accounts receivable and inventories  which fluctuate with the sales of our products 
our working capital was as of december   as compared to as of december  and as of february  the increase in working capital from december  to december  was primarily due to the repayment of our bank credit facility with the net proceeds from our october senior notes offering 
at december   our cash and cash equivalents were  as compared to at december  and at february  the decrease in cash and cash equivalents from december  to december  was primarily due to the paydown of our bank credit facility  our net loss and other changes in working capital  partially offset by the senior notes offering 
cash flows at december   our cash and bank credit available under our current bank credit facility was compared to at december  cash used in operating activities was for the year ended december  and during the transition period ended december  the primary use of cash during the year ended december  was a net loss of and of uses related to changes in our operating assets and liabilities  offset by non cash charges from amortization and depreciation of the primary sources of cash during the transition period ended december  were a non cash impairment charge of  charges for depreciation and amortization of  a non cash legal settlement charge of and a decrease in accounts receivable of the primary uses of cash during the transition period were a net loss of  an increase in inventories of and a decrease in payables and accruals of the primary use of cash from investing activities during the year ended december  was related to capital expenditures for the implementation of new information system enhancements and plant modernization 
the primary source of cash from investing activities during the transition period ended december  was of proceeds received from real estate sales and sales leaseback transactions 
the primary uses of cash from investing activities during such transition period were related to capital expenditures to implement new information system enhancements and plant modernization along with of cash used for acquisitions 
capital spending our capital expenditures were and during the year ended december  and the transition period ended december   respectively 
the decrease in capital expenditures during is primarily attributable to the timing of plant consolidation and modernization efforts 
we anticipate ongoing annual capital expenditures of approximately for the next several years 
we have no material commitments for capital expenditures 
we have  in the past  generally funded our capital expenditures from cash from operations and funds available to us under bank credit facilities 
we expect to fund future capital expenditures from cash on hand  from operations and from funds available to us under our current or any future bank credit facility 
in addition  since  we have completed acquisitions for an aggregate purchase price of approximately following these acquisitions  we rationalized the businesses  reduced headcount by approximately  employees and eliminated facilities 
we have financed these acquisitions primarily through issuances of debt and equity securities  including our outstanding  and senior subordinated notes and bank credit facilities 
outstanding debt and other financing arrangements during and in february we obtained several amendments to our credit facility with jpmorgan chase bank to provide us with additional financial flexibility 
the amendments reduced the size of the credit facility from to as part of the consideration to modify several financial covenants 
the amendments had the effect of eliminating maintenance financial covenants consisting of interest coverage ratio  leverage ratio and minimum net worth 
under the amended and restated credit facility there are no maintenance financial covenants as long as cash is above and there are no borrowings outstanding under this facility 
if borrowings under the bank credit facility are outstanding and if cash is less than  the interest coverage ratio as defined must be at least for the trailing month period 
the bank credit facility expires in february  is collateralized by substantially all of our assets and bears interest at rates ranging from to basis points over the eurodollar rate as defined in the agreement 
at december   indebtedness under the bank credit facility consisted of letters of credit aggregating approximately the amount available under the bank credit facility was as of december  the bank credit facility contains customary affirmative covenants  negative covenants and conditions of borrowings  all of which were met as of december  long term debt consists principally of our senior notes  senior subordinated notes  senior subordinated notes and senior subordinated notes 
the of notes mature on march   the of notes mature on november   the of senior notes mature on october  and the of notes mature on may  the senior subordinated notes are unsecured senior subordinated obligations and are subordinated to all of our senior indebtedness 
the senior notes are unsecured obligations and are senior to all of our subordinated indebtedness  but subordinate to our secured borrowings under our bank credit facility 
each of the notes   notes and notes contains restrictive covenants  including limitations on future indebtedness  restricted payments  transactions with affiliates  liens  dividends  mergers and transfers of assets  all of which we met as of december  a breach of these covenants  or the covenants under our current or any future bank credit facility  that continues beyond any grace period can constitute a default  which can limit the ability to borrow and can give rise to a right of the lenders to terminate the applicable facility and or require immediate repayment of any outstanding debt 
contractual obligations the following charts reflect our known contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december  commercial commitments include lines of credit  guarantees and other potential cash outflows resulting from a contingent event that requires performance by us or our subsidiaries pursuant to a funding commitment 
contractual obligations thereafter total bank credit facility other long term debt operating leases purchase obligations total  commercial commitments letters of credit occasionally we enter into purchase commitments for production materials and other items  which are reflected in the table above 
we also enter into unconditional purchase obligations with various vendors and suppliers of goods and services in the normal course of operations through purchase orders or other documentation or are undocumented except for an invoice 
such obligations are generally outstanding for periods less than a year and are settled by cash payments upon delivery of goods and services and are not reflected in the total unconditional purchase obligations presented in this line item 
we believe that our cash flows  together with cash on hand provide us with the ability to fund our operations  make planned capital expenditures and make scheduled debt service payments for the foreseeable future 
however  such cash flows are dependent upon our future operating performance  which  in turn  is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial  business and other factors  including the conditions of our markets  some of which are beyond our control 
if  in the future  we cannot generate sufficient cash from operations to meet our debt service obligations  we will need to refinance such debt obligations  obtain additional financing or sell assets 
we cannot assure you that our business will generate cash from operations  or that we will be able to obtain financing from other sources  sufficient to satisfy our debt service or other requirements 
sale leaseback in september  we entered into two sale leaseback transactions involving four of our facilities 
under the transactions  the facilities were sold for  net of transaction costs and have been leased back for periods ranging from to years 
the leasebacks have been accounted for as operating leases 
the future lease payments have been included in the above tables 
a gain of resulting from the sale has been deferred and is being amortized to rent expense over the initial term of the leases 
off balance sheet arrangements lease arrangements we finance our use of certain equipment under committed lease arrangements provided by various financial institutions 
since the terms of these arrangements meet the accounting definition of operating lease arrangements  the aggregate sum of future minimum lease payments is not reflected on our consolidated balance sheet 
at december   future minimum lease payments under these arrangements approximated indemnities  commitments and guarantees during the normal course of business  we made certain indemnities  commitments and guarantees under which we may be required to make payments in relation to certain transactions 
these indemnities include non infringement of patents and intellectual property indemnities to our customers in connection with the delivery  design  manufacture and sale of our products  indemnities to various lessors in connection with facility leases for certain claims arising from such facility or lease  and indemnities to other parties to certain acquisition agreements 
the duration of these indemnities  commitments and guarantees varies  and in certain cases  is indefinite 
we believe that substantially all of our indemnities  commitments and guarantees provide for limitations on the maximum potential future payments we could be obligated to make 
however  we are unable to estimate the maximum amount of liability related to our indemnities  commitments and guarantees because such liabilities are contingent upon the occurrence of events which are not reasonably determinable 
management believes that any liability for these indemnities  commitments and guarantees would not be material to our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements 
product warranty costs estimated costs related to product warranties are accrued at the time products are sold 
in estimating our future warranty obligations  we consider various relevant factors  including our stated warranty policies and practices  the historical frequency of claims and the cost to replace or repair our products under warranty 
the following table provides a reconciliation of the activity related to our accrued warranty expense fiscal transition fiscal year year ended period ended ended december  december  february  beginning accrual charges to expense costs incurred ending accrual deferred tax assets we established a valuation allowance  which was as of december   related to the utilization of our deferred tax assets because of uncertainties that preclude us from determining that it is more likely than not that we will be able to generate taxable income to realize such assets during the federal operating loss carryforward period  which begins to expire in such uncertainties include recent cumulative losses  the highly cyclical nature of the industry in which we operate  risks associated with our facility consolidation plan  our high degree of financial leverage  risks associated with new product introductions  recent increases in the cost of fuel and its impact on our airline customers  and risks associated with the integration of acquired businesses 
we monitor these uncertainties  as well as other positive and negative factors that may arise in the future  as we assess the necessity for a valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the securities and exchange commission released staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition  which supersedes sab  revenue recognition in financial statements 
sab clarifies existing guidance regarding revenues for contracts which contain multiple deliverables to make it consistent with emerging issues task force eitf no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
the adoption of sab did not have a material impact on our revenue recognition policies  nor our financial position or results of operations 
in november  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation fin no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  an interpretation of fasb statements no 
 and  and rescission of fin no 
 disclosure of indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
fin no 
elaborates on the disclosures to be made by the guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued 
it also requires that a guarantor recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
the initial recognition and measurement provisions of this interpretation are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  we adopted the disclosure provision of such interpretation on december   and the recognition provision on january   as required 
our adoption of such interpretation did not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
additional disclosures are presented in note to our consolidated financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation fin no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities and in december  issued interpretation no 
revised december consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of apb no 
in general  a variable interest entity is a corporation  partnership  trust  or any other legal structure used for business purposes that either a does not have equity investors with voting rights or b has equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities 
fin no 
requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
fin no

the consolidation requirements of fin no 
applies immediately to variable interest entities created after january  the consolidation requirements apply to older entities in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after june  certain of the disclosure requirements apply in all financial statements issued after january   regardless of when the variable interest entity was established 
fin no 
r applies immediately to variable interest entities created after december   and to variable interest entities in which an enterprise obtains an interest after that date 
it applies no later than the first reporting period ending after december  to variable interest entities in which an enterprise holds a variable interest other than special purpose that it acquired before january  fin no 
r applies to public enterprises as of the beginning of the applicable interim or annual period 
we believe that the adoption of fin no 
and fin no 
r will not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations because we have no variable interest entities 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity  sfas which establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope  which may have previously been reported as equity  as a liability or an asset in some circumstances 
this statement is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  for public companies 
in october  the fasb deferred implementation of paragraphs and of sfas regarding parent company treatment of minority interest for certain limited life entities 
this deferral is for an indefinite period 
the adoption of sfas did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that our critical accounting policies are limited to those described below 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition sales of products are recorded when the earnings process is complete 
this generally occurs when the products are shipped to the customer in accordance with the contract or purchase order  risk of loss and title has passed to the customer  collectibility is reasonably assured and pricing is fixed and determinable 
in instances where title does not pass to the customer upon shipment  we recognize revenue upon delivery or customer acceptance  depending on the terms of the sales contract 
service revenues primarily consist of engineering activities and are recorded when services are performed 
historically  revenues and costs under certain long term contracts are recognized using contract accounting under the percentage of completion method 
the percentage of completion method requires the use of estimates of costs to complete long term contracts 
the estimation of these costs requires judgment on the part of management due to the duration of these contracts as well as the technical nature of the products involved 
adjustments to these estimated costs are made on a consistent basis 
a provision for contract losses is recorded when such facts are determinable 
revenues recognized under contract accounting during fiscal  the transition period  and fiscal were not material 
we sell our products primarily to airlines and aircraft manufacturers worldwide  including occasional sales collateralized by letters of credit 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and maintain reserves for estimated credit losses 
actual losses have been within management s expectations 
we apply judgment to ensure that the criteria for recognizing sales are consistently applied and achieved for all recognized sales transactions 
accounts receivable we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current creditworthiness  as determined by our review of their current credit information 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain an allowance for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
if the actual uncollected amounts significantly exceed the estimated allowance  our operating results would be significantly adversely affected 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
inventories we value our inventories at the lower of cost to purchase or manufacture the inventory or the current estimated market value of the inventory 
cost is determined using the standard cost method for our manufacturing businesses and the weighed average cost method for our distribution businesses 
the inventory balance  which includes the cost of raw material  purchased parts  labor and production overhead costs  is recorded net of a reserve for excess  obsolete or unmarketable inventories 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a reserve for excess and obsolete inventories based primarily on historical usage and on our estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements 
as demonstrated since the events of september   demand for our products can fluctuate significantly 
our estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate  in which case we may have understated or overstated the provision required for excess and obsolete inventories 
in the future  if our inventories are determined to be overvalued  we would be required to recognize such costs in our cost of goods sold at the time of such determination 
likewise  if our inventories are determined to be undervalued  we may have over reported our costs of goods sold in previous periods and would be required to recognize such additional operating income at the time of sale 
long lived assets including tangible and intangible assets and goodwill to conduct our global business operations and execute our strategy  we acquire tangible and intangible assets  which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment expense that we may incur 
the determination of the value of such intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect our consolidated financial statements 
we assess potential impairment to goodwill of a reporting unit and other intangible assets on an annual basis or when there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recovered 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators and future cash flows related to intangible assets are based on operational performance of our acquired businesses  expected changes in the global economy  aerospace industry projections  discount rates and other factors 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill or other acquired tangible or intangible assets associated with our acquired businesses is impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves us estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheets 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the consolidated statements of operations 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we have recorded a full valuation allowance of as of december   due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize some of our deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of certain net operating income losses carried forward  before they expire 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income by jurisdictions in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods we may need to establish an additional valuation allowance which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations

risk factors risks relating to our business we are directly dependent upon the conditions in the airline and business jet industries and a severe and prolonged downturn could negatively impact our results of operations the september  terrorist attacks have severely impacted conditions in the airline industry 
according to industry sources  since such attacks most major us and a number of international carriers have substantially reduced their flight schedules  parked or retired portions of their fleets  reduced their workforce and implemented other cost reduction initiatives 
the airlines have further responded by decreasing domestic airfares 
as a result of the decline in both traffic and airfares following the september  terrorist attacks  and their aftermath  as well as other factors  such as the weakening economy and increases in fuel costs  the world airline industry lost a total of billion in calendar years  including billion in the airline industry crisis also caused airlines worldwide to declare bankruptcy or cease operations in the past three years 
the business jet industry has also been experiencing a severe downturn  driven by weak economic conditions and poor corporate profits 
during  three business jet manufacturers reduced or temporarily halted production of a number of aircraft types 
deliveries of new business jets were down during  as compared to  and are expected to remain depressed for the foreseeable future  according to industry forecasts 
as a result of the foregoing  the airlines have been seeking to conserve cash in part by deferring or eliminating cabin interior refurbishment programs and deferring or canceling aircraft purchases 
this  together with the reduction of new business jet production  has caused a substantial contraction in our business  the extent and duration of which cannot be determined at this time 
we expect these adverse industry conditions to have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition until such time as conditions in the commercial airline and business jet industries improve 
additional events similar to those above could delay any recovery in the industry 
while management has developed and implemented what it believes is an aggressive cost reduction plan to counter these difficult conditions  it cannot guarantee that the plans are adequate or will be successful 
our substantial indebtedness could limit our ability to obtain additional financing and adversely effect the holders of our securities as of december   we had approximately million of total indebtedness outstanding  representing approximately of total capitalization  and million of net indebtedness outstanding total indebtedness less cash and cash equivalents  representing approximately of total capitalization 
subject to the limits contained in our existing bank credit facility and the indentures governing our outstanding senior subordinated notes  we could also incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future 
the degree of our leverage could adversely affect the holders of our securities  by o limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund our growth strategy  working capital requirements  capital expenditures  acquisitions  debt service requirements or other general corporate requirements  and o increasing our exposure to interest rate increases because borrowings under our current bank credit facility are  and borrowings under any future bank credit facility could be  at variable interest rates 
our substantial indebtedness will require that a significant portion of our cash flow be used for debt service  which will limit our ability to use our cash flow for other areas of our business and could adversely affect the holders of our securities as a result of our substantial indebtedness  we have substantial debt service obligations that could have significant consequences to holders of our securities  including o limiting our ability to use operating cash flow in other areas of our business because we must dedicate a substantial portion of those funds to fund debt service obligations  and o increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions 
our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations will depend upon  among other things  our future operating performance and our ability to refinance indebtedness when necessary 
each of these factors is to a large extent dependent on economic  financial  competitive and other factors beyond our control 
if  in the future  we cannot generate sufficient cash from operations to meet our debt service obligations  we will need to refinance  obtain additional financing or sell assets 
we cannot assure you that our business will generate cash flow  or that we will be able to obtain funding  sufficient to satisfy our debt service requirements 
for the year ended december   our cash flows used in operations were million 
see also selected financial data 
in addition to the debt service requirements of our outstanding indebtedness  we have other demands on our cash resources  including  among others  capital expenditures and operating expenses 
we have significant financial and operating restrictions in our debt instruments that may have an adverse effect on our operations the indentures governing our outstanding senior and senior subordinated notes contain numerous financial and operating covenants that limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness  to create liens or other encumbrances  to make certain payments and investments  including dividend payments  to engage in transactions with affiliates  to engage in sale leaseback transactions  to guarantee indebtedness and to sell or otherwise dispose of assets and merge or consolidate with other entities 
agreements governing future indebtedness could also contain significant financial and operating restrictions 
our current amended and restated bank credit facility contains customary affirmative and negative covenants 
a failure to comply with the obligations contained in any current or future agreements governing our indebtedness  including our indentures  could result in an event of default under our current or any future bank credit facility  or such indentures  which could permit acceleration of the related debt and acceleration of debt under other instruments that may contain cross acceleration or cross default provisions 
we are not certain whether we would have  or be able to obtain  sufficient funds to make any such accelerated payments 
the airline industry is heavily regulated and failure to comply with applicable laws could reduce our sales  or require us to incur additional costs to achieve compliance  which could reduce our results of operations the federal aviation administration prescribes standards and licensing requirements for aircraft components  including virtually all commercial airline and general aviation cabin interior products  and licenses component repair stations within the united states 
comparable agencies  such as the uk civil aviation authority and the japanese civil aviation board  regulate these matters in other countries 
if we fail to obtain a required license for one of our products or services or lose a license previously granted  the sale of the subject product or service would be prohibited by law until such license is obtained or renewed 
in addition  designing new products to meet existing regulatory requirements and retrofitting installed products to comply with new regulatory requirements can be both expensive and time consuming 
from time to time the faa proposes new regulations 
these new regulations generally cause an increase in costs to comply with these regulations  when the faa first enacted technical standard order c  all seating companies were required to meet these new rules 
compliance with this rule required industry participants to spend millions of dollars on engineering  plant and equipment to comply with the regulation 
a number of smaller seating companies decided that they did not have the resources  financial or otherwise  to comply with these rules and they either sold their businesses or ceased operations 
to the extent the faa implements rule changes in the future  we may incur additional costs to achieve compliance 
there are risks associated with our facility consolidation and integration program  failure of our combined operations to perform as expected could lead to a loss of revenues and customers we have implemented a comprehensive facility consolidation and integration plan designed to reduce our capacity and fixed costs consistent with current demand and anticipated demand 
this plan involved shutting five principal facilities and transferring the operations to other facilities while maintaining an ongoing business for the transferred operations 
if the results of implementing this plan are not as we expected  our costs may be higher than we currently anticipate or we may incur delays in delivering products to our customers or the quality of such products may suffer 
this may adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition 
while the facility consolidation program is now complete  there can be no assurance that the results of the implementation of this plan will continue to be as we expected or that we will not incur liabilities as a result thereof 
the airline industry is subject to extensive health and environmental regulation  any violation of which could subject us to significant liabilities and penalties we are subject to extensive and changing federal  state and foreign laws and regulations establishing health and environmental quality standards  and may be subject to liability or penalties for violations of those standards 
we are also subject to laws and regulations governing remediation of contamination at facilities currently or formerly owned or operated by us or to which we have sent hazardous substances or wastes for treatment  recycling or disposal 
we may be subject to future liabilities or obligations as a result of new or more stringent interpretations of existing laws and regulations 
in addition  we may have liabilities or obligations in the future if we discover any environmental contamination or liability at any of our facilities  or at facilities we may acquire 
we compete with a number of established companies  some of which have significantly greater financial  technological and marketing resources than we do  and we may not be able to compete effectively with these companies we compete with numerous established companies 
some of these companies  particularly in the passenger to freighter conversion business  have significantly greater financial  technological and marketing resources than we do 
our ability to be an effective competitor will depend on our ability to remain the supplier of retrofit and refurbishment products and spare parts on the commercial fleets on which our products are currently in service 
it will also depend on our success in causing our products to be selected for installation in new aircraft  including next generation aircraft  and in avoiding product obsolescence 
our ability to maintain or expand our market position in the passenger to freighter conversion business will depend on our success in being selected to convert specific aircraft  our ability to maintain and enhance our engineering design  our certification and program management capabilities and our ability to manufacture a broader range of structural components  connectors and fasteners used in this business 
there are risks inherent in international operations that could have a material adverse effect on our business operations while the majority of our operations are based domestically  each of our facilities sells to airlines all over the world 
our customers are located primarily in north america  europe and the asia pacific rim region  including australia and new zealand  and we also have customers in most other geographic regions  including south america and the middle east 
as a result  or more of our consolidated sales for the past three fiscal years were to airlines located outside the united states 
in addition  we have a number of subsidiaries in foreign countries primarily in europe  which have sales outside the united states 
approximately and  respectively  of our sales during the fiscal year ended december  and transition period ended december  came from our foreign operations 
fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies affect the dollar value of our net investment in foreign subsidiaries  with these fluctuations being included in a separate component of stockholders equity 
operating results of foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars at average monthly exchange rates 
at december  we reported a cumulative foreign currency translation amount of in stockholders equity as a result of foreign currency adjustments  and we may incur additional adjustments in future periods 
in addition  the us dollar value of transactions based in foreign currency collections on foreign sales or payments for foreign purchases also fluctuates with exchange rates 
if in the future a substantial majority of our sales were not denominated in the currency of the country of product origin  we could face increased currency risk 
also  changes in the value of the us dollar or other currencies could result in fluctuations in foreign currency translation amounts or the us dollar value of transactions and  as a result  our net earnings could be adversely affected 
our exposure to currency fluctuations arises from labor  material and overhead costs for goods produced in our holland  england and ireland production facilities  which are incurred in british pounds or euros  for which the sales revenues are generally denominated in us dollars 
see also managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
historically we have not engaged in hedging transactions 
however  we may engage in hedging transactions in the future to manage or reduce our foreign exchange risk 
however  our attempts to manage our foreign currency exchange risk may not be successful and  as a result  our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 
our foreign operations could also be subject to unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs and other market barriers and political and economic instability in the countries where we operate 
due to our foreign operations we could be subject to such factors in the future and the impact of any such events that may occur in the future could subject us to additional costs or loss of sales  which could adversely affect our operating results 
our total assets include substantial intangible assets 
the write off of a significant portion of unamortized intangible assets would negatively affect our results of operations our total assets reflect substantial intangible assets 
at december   goodwill and identified intangibles  net  represented approximately of total assets 
intangible assets consist of goodwill and other identified intangible assets associated with our acquisitions  representing the excess of cost over the fair value of tangible assets we have acquired since we may not be able to realize the value of these assets 
goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized  but are reviewed at least annually for impairment 
acquired intangible assets with definite lives are amortized over their individual useful lives 
in addition to goodwill  our intangible assets with indefinite lives consist of the m m trademark 
in accordance with sfas no 
 the goodwill and trademark with indefinite lives that were being amortized over periods ranging from to years are no longer amortized beginning february  on at least an annual basis  we assess whether there has been an impairment in the value of goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives 
if the carrying value of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value of the related business  an impairment is deemed to have occurred 
in this event  the amount is written down accordingly 
under current accounting rules  this would result in a charge to operating earnings 
any determination requiring the write off of a significant portion of unamortized goodwill and identified intangible assets would negatively affect our results of operations and total capitalization  which could be material 
if we make acquisitions  they may be less successful than we expect  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition we may consider future acquisitions  some of which could be material to us 
we continually explore and conduct discussions with many third parties regarding possible acquisitions  although we have no current intentions of pursuing or making any material acquisitions in the near future 
our ability to continue to achieve our goals may depend upon our ability to effectively integrate such companies  to achieve cost efficiencies and to manage these businesses as part of our company 
we may not be successful in implementing appropriate operational  financial and management systems and controls to achieve the benefits expected to result from these acquisitions 
our efforts to integrate these businesses could be adversely affected by a number of factors beyond our control  such as regulatory developments  general economic conditions  increased competition and the loss of certain customers resulting from the acquisitions 
in addition  the process of integrating these businesses could cause difficulties for us  including an interruption of  or loss of momentum in  the activities of our existing business and the loss of key personnel and customers 
further  the benefits that we anticipate from these acquisitions may not develop 
depending upon the acquisition opportunities available  we also may need to raise additional funds or arrange for additional bank financing in order to consummate such acquisitions 
provisions in our charter documents may discourage potential acquisitions of our company  even those which the holders of a majority of our common stock may favor our restated certificate of incorporation and by laws contain provisions that may have the effect of discouraging a third party from making an acquisition of us by means of a tender offer  proxy contest or otherwise 
our restated certificate of incorporation and by laws o classify the board of directors into three classes  with directors of each class serving for a staggered three year period  o provide that directors may be removed only for cause and only upon the approval of the holders of at least two thirds of the voting power of our shares entitled to vote generally in the election of such directors  o require at least two thirds of the voting power of our shares entitled to vote generally in the election of directors to alter  amend or repeal the provisions relating to the classified board and removal of directors described above  o permit the board of directors to fill vacancies and newly created directorships on the board  o restrict the ability of stockholders to call special meetings  and o contain advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals 
our rights plan and provisions in our charter documents could make the removal of incumbent directors more difficult and time consuming and may have the effect of discouraging a tender offer or other takeover attempt not previously approved by the board of directors our board of directors has declared a dividend of one preferred share purchase right for each share of common stock outstanding 
a right will also be attached to each share of common stock subsequently issued 
the rights will have certain anti takeover effects 
if triggered  the rights would cause substantial dilution to a person or group of persons that acquires more than of our common stock on terms not approved by our board of directors 
the rights could discourage or make more difficult a merger  tender offer or other similar transaction 
under our restated certificate of incorporation  our board of directors also has the authority to issue preferred stock in one or more series and to fix the powers  preferences and rights of any such series without stockholder approval 
the board of directors could  therefore  issue  without stockholder approval  preferred stock with voting and other rights that could adversely affect the voting power of the holders of common stock and could make it more difficult for a third party to gain control of us 
in addition  under certain circumstances  section of the delaware general corporation law makes it more difficult for an interested stockholder  or generally a stockholder  to effect various business combinations with a corporation for a three year period 
you may not receive cash dividends on our shares of common stock we have never paid a cash dividend and do not plan to pay cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 
we intend to retain our earnings to finance the development and expansion of our business and to repay indebtedness 
also  our ability to declare and pay cash dividends on our common stock is restricted by covenants in our outstanding notes 
our current bank credit facility also contains customary covenants  which include covenants restricting our ability to declare and pay cash dividends 
if the price of our common stock continues to fluctuate significantly  you could lose all or part of any investment in our common stock the price of our common stock is subject to sudden and material increases and decreases  and decreases could adversely affect investments in our common stock 
for example  since the beginning of  the closing price of our common stock has ranged from a low of to a high of 
the price of our common stock could fluctuate widely in response to o our quarterly operating results  o changes in earnings estimates by securities analysts  o changes in our business  o changes in the market s perception of our business  o changes in the businesses  earnings estimates or market perceptions of our competitors or customers  o changes in airline industry or business jet industry conditions  o changes in general market or economic conditions  and o changes in the legislative or regulatory environment 
in addition  the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations in recent years that have significantly affected the quoted prices of the securities of many companies  including companies in our industry 
the changes often appear to occur without regard to specific operating performance 
the price of our common stock could fluctuate based upon factors that have little or nothing to do with our company and these fluctuations could materially reduce our stock price

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to a variety of risks  including foreign currency fluctuations and changes in interest rates affecting the cost of our variable rate debt 
foreign currency we have direct operations in europe that receive revenues from customers primarily in us dollars and purchase raw materials and component parts from foreign vendors primarily in british pounds or euros 
accordingly  we are exposed to transaction gains and losses that could result from changes in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar 
the largest foreign currency exposure results from activity in british pounds and euros 
from time to time  we and our foreign subsidiaries may enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to manage risk on transactions conducted in foreign currencies 
at december   we had no outstanding forward currency exchange contracts 
we did not enter into any other derivative financial instruments 
interest rates at december   we had no adjustable rate debt and fixed rate debt of the weighted average interest rate for the fixed rate debt was approximately at december  if interest rates were to increase by above current rates  the impact on our financial statements would be to reduce pretax income by a negligible amount 
we do not engage in transactions intended to hedge our exposure to changes in interest rates 
as of december   we maintained a portfolio of securities consisting mainly of taxable  interest bearing deposits with weighted average maturities of less than three months 
if short term interest rates were to increase or decrease by  we estimate interest income would increase or decrease by approximately
