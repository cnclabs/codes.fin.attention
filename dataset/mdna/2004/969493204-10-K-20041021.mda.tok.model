item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the subsidiaries of williams industries  inc provide specialized services and products for the construction industry 
they operate in the commercial  industrial  governmental and infrastructure construction markets  with the operating components divided into construction and manufacturing segments 
the services provided include steel  precast concrete and miscellaneous metals erection and installation  crane rental and rigging  fabrication of welded steel plate girders  rolled beams  stay in place bridge decking  and light structural and other metal products 
management continually reviews the company s allocation of assets to each subsidiary and makes adjustments as necessary to enhance the company s ability to take advantage of opportunities in the marketplace 
since fiscal  the company has increased its emphasis on its manufacturing segment 
manufacturing  which was of the company s business in fiscal  comprised of revenues in fiscal this increase is due in part to the expansion of the company into leased facilities in alabama and the purchase of the majority interest in its subsidiary  sip of delaware  inc  in fiscal during the year ended july   the company chose not to renew the lease for its bessemer  alabama facility for an additional three years and is currently negotiating a short term extension to allow for an orderly shutdown and liquidation 
the company is required by the lease to purchase the plant equipment  owned by the landlord  for  when the plant equipment is purchased  the company plans to relocate or sell the existing equipment 
management anticipates growth in the next four to five years in the company s manufacturing segment due to increased governmental demand for highway projects  and due to opportunities occurring in the industrial and institutional construction markets 
however  this growth may be tempered by the current delay in an extension of the transportation equity act for the st century as well as the uncertainty in the price and availability of raw steel products 
the amount of commercial  institutional  and governmental construction activity in the mid atlantic region  where the company traditionally has focused its efforts  continues to be higher than in many other regions in recent years  but budgetary problems continue to plague the states  including maryland and virginia 
although demand for the company s products and services related to government spending on infrastructure remained strong during the year ended july   inclement weather  steel price increases and surcharges  raw material delivery delays and a decline in new contracts by government agencies affected the company s ability to perform work 
there was a slowing in demand for the company s bridge girders and stay in place decking  due in part to uncertainty with the governmental spending related to the tea program extension 
however  the company s bridge girder company was successful in its bid on the contract for the i springfield interchange project in virginia to supply girders 
this contract totals approximately million and will extend over the next two years 
during the fiscal year ended july   the company took action to curtail continuing losses associated with the activities of the company s former sales and services segment 
essential activities previously performed by the sales and services segment were consolidated into the company s construction segment 
for many years  the company has rented cranes and related heavy construction equipment to third parties in the construction industry 
during the past months  revenues from such rentals declined 
the company intends to sell equipment that is not necessary for its own operations  and is attempting to renegotiate or cancel leases 
the company has financed the purchase of five cranes  which had been previously leased  at a cost of million 
the company s construction activities are focused in maryland  virginia  and the district of columbia 
the company continues to service areas on the east coast and southeastern united states from its manufacturing facilities 
the company intends to close one of the leased facilities in alabama but intends to continue to operate a second facility there 
the company s long range plan calls for the continued leverage of existing subsidiaries to produce the most cost effective and customer responsive combination of manufacturing and construction capabilities 
the company s ability to offer a turnkey approach for its customers  thereby increasing its competitiveness on some contracts  continues to be a strength 
effective january   the company changed its worker s compensation insurance carrier 
the new program offers significantly better cash flow and slightly lower fixed costs 
in the past  the company paid in advance for its entire worker s compensation costs for the year 
under the new program  there are no upfront payments required 
the carrier s base fee  which is a portion of the total program cost  is paid out over the policy year 
all other costs  paid by the carrier  are reimbursed by the company on a monthly basis  resulting in improved cash flow during the year 
financial condition between july  and july   the following changes occurred the company s cash and cash equivalents  restricted cash and certificates of deposit decreased  the company used cash to fund operations and pay down debt 
restricted cash increased  as the company purchased certificates of deposit for  and transferred  of existing certificates of deposit as security on letters of credit supporting its workers compensation insurance program 
accounts receivable increased approximately million 
contract receivables increased million  as the construction segment started contracts delayed from the prior fiscal year 
as maintenance and rehabilitation work remained strong  trade receivables related to this work declined by approximately  these receivables are related to short term contracts 
other receivables increased approximately  the company collected approximately  of the  claim receivable from fiscal the balance was written off 
additionally  the company set up a new contract claim receivable for  related to contract revenues in the construction segment 
the claim has been approved by our customer 
the company believes this claim will be collected during the year ending july  inventory increased approximately million 
the company purchased significant amounts of steel for its large contracts 
the cost of steel nearly doubled during fiscal the company has material on hand to meet immediate needs but may face shortages due to higher steel prices and delivery delays from the steel mills 
prepaid expenses decreased  as the company expensed workers compensation insurance premiums during the year 
property and equipment  at cost increased million as the company refinanced five cranes which it had previously leased at a cost of million  capitalized plant equipment costs at its manufacturing segment facilities  and purchased other miscellaneous equipment 
the company retired fully depreciated equipment with an original cost of  deferred income taxes increased  due to the income tax benefit on the company s loss for the year 
other assets decreased  as the company reclassified costs  which had previously been deferred  to property and equipment  at cost and reduced long term notes receivable by collections made during the period 
notes payable increased million 
the company borrowed approximately million  million of which was used to fund the purchase of five cranes the company had previously leased   was used to fund long term plant and equipment purchases and million was used to fund short term operations 
the company paid back million related to short term borrowing  mainly from operations 
accounts payable increased million 
in the manufacturing segment  payables increased million mainly on the purchase of steel for work on existing projects 
the additional million increase is due to work being performed in the construction segment 
billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts  and costs and estimated earning in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts  decreased a net amount of million as a result of timing of the revenue recognition on a mix of contracts in process 
other accrued expenses decreased  as the company reduced its workers compensation insurance liability by approximately  reduced its sales tax liability by approximately  and reduced other liabilities by approximately  stockholders equity decreased  primarily due to operating losses of  the company s officers and directors exercised options to buy  shares of stock for approximately  the company issued  shares of stock as director compensation for  finally  employees purchased  shares for approximately  bonding the company has traditionally relied on its reputation to acquire work and will continue to do so 
however  the company recognizes that  as it expands its geographic range for providing goods and services  it may be necessary to provide bonds to customers unfamiliar with the company 
the company does not have a comprehensive bonding program with a primary underwriter 
although the company s ability to bond work is somewhat limited  management believes it has not lost any work due to bonding limitations 
liquidity the company requires significant working capital to procure materials for contracts to be performed over relatively long periods  and for purchases and modifications of specialized equipment 
furthermore  in accordance with normal payment terms  the company s customers often retain a portion of amounts otherwise payable to the company as a guarantee of project completion 
to the extent the company is unable to receive progress payments in the early stages of a project  the company s cash flow could be adversely affected 
collecting progress payments is a common problem in the construction industry as are short term cash considerations 
the company generated million in cash from operations during the year ended july  the company used million to fund investing activities including the purchase of five cranes  which had previously been leased  for approximately million 
the company provided net cash from financing activities of million  which mainly related to financing the crane purchase for million 
cash and cash equivalents decreased approximately  from million at july  to million at july  the company paid  to former shareholders of sip inc of delaware under the terms of its purchase agreement for a interest in that company 
management believes that operations will generate sufficient cash to fund activities 
however  as revenues increase  it may become necessary to increase the company s credit facilities to handle short term cash requirements 
management  therefore  is focusing on the proper allocation of resources to ensure stable growth 
the company is not in compliance with one of the covenants contained in its agreements with united bank and with wachovia bank 
the agreements state that the company must maintain a debt service coverage ratio of or greater 
due to the company s loss for the year ended july   that ratio was 
the company has obtained a waiver  with no conditions from united bank  and a waiver from wachovia bank that requires the company to achieve earnings performance as follows produce a net profit of  for the quarter ending october   a net profit of  through the six months ending january   a net profit of  through the nine months ending april  and a net profit of  for the year ending july  the company has considered some of its liabilities under the previously mentioned loan agreements to be current liabilities in the accompanying balance sheet at july  the united bank line of credit is due by agreement on may  the letter of credit backing the wachovia notes expires march  should the company not meet the conditions in the wachovia bank waiver agreement  wachovia bank could accelerate the balance and demand the repayment of amounts due at any time 
operations the company s manufacturing subsidiaries have been negatively impacted by the rise in steel prices  the availability of raw steel products and the fact that state budgets are in distress and infrastructure funds are tied up in congress pending the reauthorization of the transportation equity act for the st century tea  which should have occurred in september demand for the manufacturing segment s products and services declined in the last six months 
the construction segment has performed work  which had been previously delayed  and continues to maintain a variety of work on commercial and governmental projects 
additional consolidation of resources  including both personnel and equipment  will occur as the company strives for the most efficient configuration for market conditions 
fiscal year compared to fiscal year the year ended july  was filled with much uncertainty 
in september   hurricane isabel hit the central atlantic area  closing the company s richmond plant for more than a week 
in december   the steel crisis began with steel prices doubling over the next eight months and deliveries being delayed as demand exceeded supply 
during the fiscal year  the transportation equity act for the st century tea expired 
this bill was the major source of spending on infrastructure throughout the united states  contributing to the bridge operation s success 
although modest infrastructure spending extensions have occurred on five occasions  until new  comprehensive legislation is passed by congress  work will continue to be slow in the bridge market 
the company was awarded a contract to fabricate  deliver and erect steel for the i springfield interchange project in virginia  valued at approximately million 
this contract was awarded at a time when steel prices began to rise  creating much uncertainty due to material price volatility 
most of the company s subsidiaries will perform work on this project 
the company recorded a loss of  or per share  on revenues of million for the year ended july   compared to a loss of  or per share  on revenues of million for the year ended july  revenues increased by million 
manufacturing revenues decreased by million while construction revenues increased million 
construction segment revenue increased as the segment was able to start work  which had been previously delayed  from fiscal manufacturing segment revenues declined due to steel delivery delays and equipment vandalism in the wilmington  delaware plant 
gross profit increased approximately  the construction segment s gross profit increased million on increased revenues and higher profit jobs as the gross profit percentage increased 
the net results of the segment s equipment rental operation improved mainly due to a decline in equipment rental expense of approximately  from fiscal the manufacturing segment s gross profit decreased approximately  due to increased material costs  inefficiencies due to material shortages  and an increase in the segment s workers compensation insurance cost 
competition continues to impact the segment s profit margins as it tries to build its backlog 
overhead increased over  mainly related to the construction segment s increasing work 
general and administrative expenses decreased  due mainly to decreases in expenses in the construction segment 
depreciation increased by approximately  due to property and plant additions in the manufacturing segment in fiscal and crane purchases in fiscal interest expense increased  due to higher interest rates on short term borrowing and increased debt on new equipment purchases 
the income tax benefit provision increased  due primarily to the company s losses 
fiscal year compared to fiscal year the year ended july  was a difficult year 
record snows and above average rain delayed material shipments and starting dates on jobs 
the former sales and services segment  due to declining revenues and increasing losses  was downsized and consolidated with the construction segment 
the company continued expansion of the manufacturing segment with the opening of the gadsden  alabama facility and the completion of an addition to the bedford  virginia plant 
finally  during the year  the company was awarded contracts aggregating approximately million for the woodrow wilson bridge project 
the work for this project will involve most of the company s subsidiaries 
the company recorded a loss of  or per share  on revenues of million for the year ended july   compared to a profit of million  or per share  on revenues of million for the year ended july  revenues decreased by million 
manufacturing revenues increased by 
million while construction revenues decreased million 
construction segment revenue was adversely impacted by project delays due to inclement weather and by the downsizing of crane rental operations 
gross profit declined million as gross profit percentages decreased 
the construction segment s gross margin decreased mainly due to increased competition 
the manufacturing segment s gross profit decreased approximately  due also to increased competition  and the fact that during the last ten months of fiscal  the bessemer  alabama plant was working on time and material contracts that were residual to the plant s former owner 
these contracts were produced at higher margins than those currently in the plant because the customer supplied the material 
while overhead increased slightly  overhead in the construction segment decreased by more than  due to the downsizing of the crane rental operation 
this decrease was offset by increases in the manufacturing segment related to increased revenues 
general and administrative expenses decreased by million due mainly to a decrease in incentive compensation of million 
depreciation increased  due to property and plant additions  mainly in the manufacturing segment 
interest expense decreased  due to lower interest rates on short term borrowing and reduced debt 
the income tax benefit provision decreased million for the year ended july  due primarily to the company s losses 
fiscal year compared to fiscal year expansion in the company s manufacturing segment dominated fiscal  with the segment showing a increase in revenues when compared to fiscal while a portion of this improvement was due to the addition of the leased facility in bessemer  alabama  the bulk of the increase was due to higher sales in existing markets 
this was particularly significant because williams bridge company s strongest traditional customers  the states of virginia and maryland  did not bid much work due to severe budgetary concerns 
williams bridge company not only produced more work  but also produced higher profit margins when the years are compared 
it is also significant to note that the addition of the bessemer plant was responsible for approximately  in increased g a costs for the subsidiary  overhead increasing accordingly 
the construction segment revenues remained constant when the years ended july  an are compared 
while the segment s erection operations revenue increased  the increases were offset by decreases in revenues in crane rental operations 
direct costs increased  due to workers compensation expenses due to a series of accidents  and because the segment had substantial fixed cost expenses  such as crane leases 
profit margins declined sharply on reduced revenues 
part of the equipment rental operation s difficulties stemmed from new competition in the marketplace  but concerns involved accidents  the segment s inability to sell underperforming assets and changes in the segment s sales staff
