this is followed by a discussion of the critical accounting policies that we believe are important to understanding the assumptions and judgments incorporated in our reported financial results 
in the next section  beginning on page  we discuss our results of operations for the past two fiscal years 
we then provide  beginning on page  an analysis of our liquidity and capital resources  including discussions of our cash flows  debt arrangements  sources of capital and financial commitments 
finally  on page  we discuss funds from operations  or ffo  which is a relative non gaap financial measure of performance and liquidity of an equity reit used by the reit industry 
the md a should be read in conjunction with the other sections of this annual report on form k  including the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing in item of this report and the subsection captioned forward looking statements below 
historical results set forth in selected financial information  the financial statements and supplemental data included in item and item and this section should not be taken as indicative of our future operations 
overview our primary business strategy is to purchase real estate land  buildings and other improvements  which we simultaneously lease to operators of franchised automobile dealerships and motor vehicle service  repair or parts businesses  used vehicle businesses and other related businesses under long term  triple net leases 
we use i the term dealerships to refer to these types of businesses that are operated on our properties and ii the term dealer group  tenant or operators of dealerships to refer to the persons and companies that lease our properties 
we focus on leasing properties to dealer groups that have a long history of operating multi site  multi franchised dealerships  generally targeting the largest dealer groups in terms of revenues in the largest major metropolitan areas in the us in terms of population 
in addition  we provide facility improvement and expansion funding  construction financing and takeout commitments in certain circumstances 
substantially all of our properties are leased pursuant to long term  triple net leases  under which the tenants typically pay all operating expenses of a property  including  but not limited to  all real estate taxes  assessments and other government charges  insurance  utilities  repairs and maintenance 
the initial lease terms generally range from to years with a weighted average initial lease term for leases entered into during the year ended december  of years  with our entire portfolio having a weighted average initial lease term of approximately years 
as of december   our portfolio had a weighted average remaining lease term of approximately years 
the leases typically have options to renew upon generally the same terms and conditions for one or more additional periods of five to years each  exercisable at the option of the tenants with renewal options typically ranging from a total of five to years 
substantially all of our revenues are derived from rents received or accrued under long term  triple net leases  interest earned on notes secured by real estate  interest earned from the temporary investment of funds in short term investments  and other fee income 
we are a self administered and self managed real estate company operating as a real estate investment trust  or a reit  for federal income tax purposes 
our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation expense for our executive officers and other employees  professional fees  office administration expenses including rent  business taxes and insurance and various other expenses incurred in managing our business 
our primary non cash expense is the depreciation of our properties 
we depreciate buildings and improvements on our properties over a nine year to year period for tax purposes and a year to year period for financial reporting purposes 
we do not own or lease any significant personal property  furniture or equipment at any property we currently own 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  commonly referred to as gaap  requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
these estimates and assumptions are affected by management s application of critical accounting policies 
a summary of our accounting policies and procedures is included in the summary of significant accounting policies footnote to our consolidated financial statements 
management believes the following are the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
real estate assets impairment assessment we periodically assess our real estate assets for possible permanent impairment when certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the real estate may not be recoverable 
management considers current market conditions and tenant credit analysis in determining whether the recoverability of the carrying amount of an asset should be assessed 
when an assessment is warranted  management determines if it is probable that the sum of the expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the property being assessed 
if the undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amount  then an impairment loss would be recognized equal to the amount of the difference between the fair value of the property and its carrying amount 
real estate assets estimated useful lives and allocation of purchase price we depreciate our real estate assets using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives 
our buildings and improvements are currently being depreciated over to years 
the useful lives of the properties are assigned based on the third party appraisals and or structural reviews that are prepared for each property we acquire 
the purchase price of real estate properties acquired is allocated to the various components  such as land  buildings and improvements  and in place leases as appropriate  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards  commonly referred to as sfas  no 
 business combinations 
the purchase price is allocated based on the fair value of each component at the time of acquisition 
the fair value of the buildings and improvements are recorded at the cost of our acquisition which we believe approximates their replacement costs 
we generally do not acquire real estate assets that have in place leases 
we typically execute our leases simultaneously with the purchase of the real estate  and because of this  no value has been ascribed to any in place leases because we do not believe any exist 
improvement fundings and construction financing we may fund improvements made by our tenants on our existing properties 
improvements include costs incurred on facilities during which the tenant s business continues to operate without interruption 
improvement fundings are recorded as buildings and improvements on our consolidated balance sheets and the amounts charged to the tenant during the project are recorded as rental revenue 
once the project is completed  the remaining useful life of the buildings and improvements is determined and depreciation expense is adjusted accordingly on a prospective basis 
we may provide construction financing to our tenants in certain circumstances in which we own the underlying land that is leased to the tenant 
construction financing includes fundings for the construction of new facilities for which operations have not commenced or fundings for major improvements to existing facilities that cause operations to cease during the construction period 
fundings are recorded as construction advances during the period of construction and the amounts charged to our tenant during that time are recorded as interest income 
after completion of the project  the construction advances are paid down simultaneously with our purchase of the buildings and improvements 
the buildings and improvements are acquired at fair market value and recorded as real estate on our consolidated financial statements 
derivatives we have used and may continue to use interest rate swap arrangements to manage interest rate risk 
we do not enter into interest rate swap arrangements for trading purposes 
swaps we have entered into with third parties were documented as cash flow hedges and were designated as highly effective at the inception of the swap agreements 
we continue to evaluate the highly effective nature of those hedges and believe our hedges continue to be highly effective 
therefore  in accordance with gaap  the unrealized gain or loss upon measuring the swaps at their fair value is recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss within shareholders equity on our consolidated balance sheets 
the fair value of the swaps is recorded as either a derivative instrument asset or a derivative instrument liability on our consolidated balance sheets 
we intend to meet the conditions for hedge accounting  however  if a particular interest rate swap does not qualify as highly effective  the change in the fair value of the derivatives used as hedges would be reflected in the consolidated statements of operations 
rental revenue recognition we lease our real estate pursuant to long term  triple net leases  under which the tenants typically pay all operating expenses of a property  including  but not limited to  all real estate taxes  assessments and other government charges  insurance  utilities  repairs and maintenance 
our leases are recorded as operating leases for financial reporting purposes 
as such  the leased assets remain on our balance sheet and we depreciate them based on their estimated useful lives 
under sfas no  accounting for leases  if a lease term is greater than of the economic life of the leased property or if the present value of future minimum lease payments of that lease exceed of the fair value of the leased property then our lease would not be considered an operating lease for accounting purposes but would instead be considered a direct financing lease and the related leased assets removed from our balance sheet 
determination of economic lives and fair values of leased property has some level of subjectivity 
we believe  however  that the assumptions we used to estimate both fair value and the economic life of the leased asset are based on reasonable market terms and are consistent with industry practice 
rental income attributable to the leases is recorded monthly when due from tenants and is recognized on a straight line basis over the initial terms of the related leases 
rental income attributable to the majority of our leases is fixed by the lease agreement 
however  under our variable rate lease program  monthly base rent is calculated based on a spread over an applicable index  typically libor 
the vast majority of our variable rate lease agreements contain minimum lease rates and fixed rate conversion features  and none of these leases contains a maximum rate 
our leases typically provide for upward periodic adjustments in base rent due from our tenants  usually based on a factor of the change in the consumer price index  commonly referred to as cpi 
in addition  our leases are generally subject to certain fixed minimum and or maximum rent escalators during the initial lease term and extension periods 
our leases typically reset to market during certain renewal periods 
the fixed minimum rent escalations are straight lined into rental income over the initial lease term 
any rent adjustments above the fixed minimum escalations are recorded as revenue in the period they are due from the tenants 
capitalized leasing costs certain direct costs initially incurred by us in negotiating and consummating a successful lease are capitalized and generally amortized over the initial base term of the lease 
capitalized leasing costs include employee compensation and payroll related fringe benefits directly related to time spent performing successful leasing related activities 
these activities include evaluating the financial condition of prospective clients  evaluating and recording guarantees  collateral and other security arrangements  negotiating lease terms  preparing lease documents and closing the transaction 
results of operations revenue for the year ended percentage change to to dollars in thousands revenue rental interest and other total rental 
the increase in rental revenue over the past two fiscal years was primarily attributable to the growth of our real estate portfolio from which we generate our rental income 
the following table demonstrates the growth of our real estate portfolio over the periods indicated 
real estate before accumulated total square depreciation in number of total land footage in as of december  thousands properties acreage millions three of the properties owned as of december  were sold during and one of the properties owned as of december  was sold during the results of operations related to the sold properties were reclassified from rental revenue to discontinued operations as discussed under discontinued operations below 
the increase in rental income was also attributable to an increase from rent adjustments above the fixed minimum escalators  which are recorded as revenue in the period they are due from the tenants 
the increase in rental revenue from to was also attributable to the conversion throughout of leases on approximately million of properties leased to several tenants from variable rate to fixed rate  resulting in an increase in rental revenue 
other terms of the leases  including lease escalators  remained unchanged 
this increase was partially offset by the conversion at the end of the third quarter of of leases relating to million of properties leased to a tenant from fixed rate to variable rate with a minimum lease rate  resulting in a decrease in rental revenue 
we also converted the interest rate on approximately million of debt that is secured primarily by the properties subject to these leases from fixed rate to variable rate 
other terms of the leases  including lease escalators  remained unchanged  and a decrease in lease rates on our variable rate leases as described in liquidity and capital resources variable rate lease program herein 
interest and other 
the increase in interest and other income from to was primarily due to interest of  earned on a note or advances secured by real estate funded during the note  totaling million  is secured by a dealership property 
we also entered into a separate acquisition agreement to acquire the dealership property securing such note during the construction advances totaling million are for newly constructed facilities for which operations have not commenced 
the projects currently under development are honda and lexus franchises  both scheduled for completion during the note and advances require monthly interest payments  which are included in interest and other income for the year ended december  additionally  differences in interest and other income are due to fluctuations in the cash collateral balances held by our lenders at any point in time and changes in the interest rates earned on these balances 
the purposes of the cash collateral accounts are to hold funds  generally in the amount of the swap valuations at any point in time  and to protect the lenders in case of an early termination by us 
the cash collateral accounts are controlled by the lenders  however  we earn interest on the funds held in such accounts 
the increase in interest and other income from to was primarily due to an increase in interest earned on temporary investments  fluctuations in the cash collateral accounts as noted above and other fee income  partially offset by a gain on the sale of properties  totaling  included in interest and other income for the year ended december  beginning in  gaap requires that the gains and losses from the dispositions of properties and all operating earnings from these properties be reported as discontinued operations 
this requires reclassification of certain amounts from income from continuing operations to discontinued operations  which is more fully described below 
expenses for the year ended percentage change to to dollars in thousands expenses depreciation and amortization general and administrative interest total depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization consisted primarily of depreciation on buildings and improvements owned during the years indicated above 
the increases are primarily attributable to the growth of our real estate portfolio described under revenue rental above  resulting in an increase in our depreciable assets 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased from to due primarily to an increase in payroll and related expenses primarily attributable to an increase in overall compensation and an increase in the number of employees  an increase in professional fees associated with the implementation of section of the sarbanes oxley act of  which requires companies to assess the effectiveness of their internal controls over financial reporting  effective for our fiscal year ended  an increase in directors and officers insurance due to an increase in market rates  an increase in business taxes and state registration fees due to the growth in our real estate portfolio during and as well as changes in state tax laws  and an increase in costs associated with servicing our growing portfolio 
this increase was partially offset by the write off totaling  during the fourth quarter of related to the remaining costs on our former office space 
in october  we took advantage of the soft office space market and locked up a long term lease for more efficient space and relocated our office 
in addition  we subleased our former space to a third party 
in accordance with gaap  the remaining costs related to a pre existing lease were charged to expense when the leased property has no substantive future use or benefit to the lessee  net of any rent received from subleasing to a third party 
general and administrative expenses  excluding this write off  increased from to general and administrative expense increased from to due primarily to the  write off relating to the remaining costs on our former office space  an increase in payroll and related expenses primarily attributable to an increase in overall compensation and an increase in the number of employees  an increase in office administration expenses as a result of an increase in staffing requirements and costs associated with the relocation of our office  an increase in information technology costs for several projects initiated and completed during related to the expansion of our hardware infrastructure to improve security  reliability and capacity  an increase in directors and officers insurance due to an increase in market rates  the purchase of errors and omissions insurance that our servicing entity is required to maintain as a condition to servicing the debt securitization that closed on june   an increase in business taxes and state registration fees due to the growth of our real estate portfolio during and this increase was more than offset by a  credit recorded during the third quarter of relating to the reimbursement of business and occupancy taxes by certain of our tenants  an increase in costs associated with our public reporting requirements due to an increase in the number of shareholders  an increase in legal fees associated with our compliance with certain provisions of the sarbanes oxley act of  proposed and final rules promulgated by the sec thereunder and proposed nasdaq corporate governance reforms  and an increase in fees associated with servicing our growing portfolio 
general and administrative expenses  excluding the  write off  increased from to interest 
the following table sets forth certain information regarding our debt as of the periods indicated 
principal balance as of december in thousands effective interest rate for the year ended december year fixed rate debt variable rate debt total includes deferred loan fees amortized over the life of the loans 
the increase in interest expense over the past two years is primarily due to an increase in our overall debt during the past months  which was primarily obtained to directly or indirectly finance our investment in real estate during that time period 
partially offsetting the increases in debt outstanding were decreases in the effective interest rate on our debt 
the change in the effective interest rates is primarily due to the decrease in interest rates during the past months 
the change in our effective interest rate over any given period is also affected by our mix of variable rate debt to total debt and the timing of any financings or refinancings 
from to  our interest expense increased disproportionately with the increase in our overall debt due to the mix of variable rate debt to total debt 
during  in order to lock in rates during this low interest rate environment  we increased long term fixed rate debt while reducing our borrowings on our short term credit facility and our short term variable rate mortgage debt 
this change in mix of debt was accomplished through the conversion of million of variable rate debt to fixed rate debt during the fourth quarter of we entered into an interest rate swap arrangement with a third party during the third quarter of to swap this variable rate debt to fixed rate 
the swap became effective in november of  and the issuance of approximately million of fixed rate debt during the first quarter of  which was used to pay down borrowings on our short term revolving credit facilities  totaling approximately million  and to pay off approximately million of short term variable rate mortgage debt 
from to  our interest expense was also impacted by the mix of our variable rate debt to our total debt as a result of the following transactions that occurred during those years the amendment of million of fixed rate debt due september  during the third quarter of to convert the debt to variable rate debt 
the debt was converted in conjunction with the conversion of leases relating to million of property from fixed rate to variable rate as discussed above 
the conversion of the interest rate on the debt from fixed to variable resulted in a significant modification of the debt 
in accordance with gaap  we wrote off the remaining deferred loan fees relating to the debt  totaling  and classified the write off as interest expense 
we did not have any significant modification of debt during the years ended december  or the conversion of million of variable rate debt to fixed rate debt during the first quarter of through the execution of interest rate swap arrangements with a third party 
the interest rate swap arrangements were executed in conjunction with our conversion of the leases on approximately million of properties leased to a tenant from variable rate to fixed rate  the conversion of million of variable rate debt to fixed rate debt during the fourth quarter of as described above  and the issuance of approximately million of fixed rate debt during the second quarter of  of which a portion was used to pay down borrowings on our short term credit facilities 
on june   we issued million in four classes of triple net lease mortgage notes  series  which we refer to as the notes  as further described in liquidity and capital resources mortgage debt and revolving credit facilities below 
the transaction reflects approximately million of new debt issued in classes under current market terms and a restructuring of a securitization completed in that had a remaining balance of approximately million  which we refer to as the modified debt 
the certificates representing the modified debt have economic terms equivalent to the prior transaction 
because the terms of the modified debt were virtually identical to the original debt  it did not result in a significant modification of debt for gaap purposes 
therefore  in accordance with gaap  third party costs totaling  incurred in connection with the modified debt were charged to interest expense during the second quarter of there were no such expenses incurred during the year ended december  discontinued operations beginning in  sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets requires that gains and losses from dispositions of properties and all operating earnings from these properties be reported as discontinued operations 
this also requires that all past earnings applicable to a property disposed of subsequent to january  be reported as discontinued operations 
as a result  previously reported income from continuing operations will be updated each time a property is sold 
this requirement is for presentation only and has no impact on net income 
revenue from properties sold during and for the years ended december   and was   and  respectively 
income from discontinued operations which includes the gain on sale of properties for the years ended december   and was   and  respectively 
preferred share dividends on december  we issued  series a cumulative redeemable preferred shares at per share 
the preferred shares pay quarterly dividends in arrears 
the initial preferred dividend was paid on february  and was equal to per share  which is the pro ration of the regular quarterly dividend of per share from the date of original issue december  through january  for  we accrued  which represents the amount due through december  impact of inflation our leases typically contain provisions to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation on our results of operations 
these provisions include upward periodic adjustments in base rent due from our tenants  usually based on a factor of the change in the cpi 
in addition  our leases are generally subject to certain fixed minimum and or maximum rent escalators during the initial lease term 
substantially all of our properties are leased to tenants under long term  triple net leases 
triple net leases tend to reduce our exposure to rising property expenses due to inflation 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents were million and million at december  and december   respectively 
the changes in cash and cash equivalents during the years ended december  and were attributable to operating  investing and financing activities  as described below 
year ended december  to dollars in thousands cash provided by operating activities cash used in investing activities cash provided by financing activities operating activities cash provided by operating activities represents cash received primarily from rents under long term  triple net leases  plus interest and other fee income  less normal recurring general and administrative expenses and interest payments on debt outstanding 
investing activities cash used in investing activities primarily reflects the investment in dealership properties  facility improvements and construction fundings  net of sales 
financing activities cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  primarily reflects million of proceeds received from mortgage debt incurred during the year  million of proceeds received from borrowings on our revolving credit facilities  million of proceeds received from our offering of series a cumulative redeemable preferred shares  net of costs  million of proceeds received from our follow on common share offering  net of costs  and million of proceeds received from the issuance of common shares through our dividend reinvestment and share purchase plan  which we refer to as the drip  and equity incentive plan  net of costs 
the cash provided by financing activities was partially offset by the repayment of borrowings on our revolving credit facilities totaling million  the repayment of mortgage debt totaling million  distributions made to shareholders and minority partners during the year totaling million  payments of principal on outstanding mortgage debt totaling million  payments for debt issuance costs totaling million  and the increase of restricted cash totaling million 
cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  primarily reflects million of proceeds received from borrowings on our revolving credit facilities  million of proceeds received from mortgage debt incurred during the year  and million of proceeds received from the issuance of common shares through our drip and equity incentive plan  net of costs 
the cash provided by financing activities was partially offset by the repayment of borrowings on our revolving credit facilities totaling million  distributions made to shareholders and minority partners during the year totaling million  payments of principal on outstanding mortgage debt totaling million  the increase of restricted cash totaling million  payments for debt issuance costs totaling million  payments made during the first quarter of totaling million and  to purchase outstanding warrants to purchase common shares during the fourth quarter of and first quarter of  respectively  and the redemption of units totaling  financing strategy our objective is to have multiple sources of debt and equity financing available to us 
we typically fund our short term liquidity requirements through available cash or one of our three revolving credit facilities 
these facilities provide short term borrowing capacity of million  of which million was available as of december  periodically  in order to more closely match the term of our debt with that of our leases  we replace our short term debt using the proceeds of long term mortgage debt or equity 
our long term liquidity requirements are financed with both long term debt and equity 
when accessing the equity markets  our objective is to provide accretion to our shareholders  as well as maintain certain debt ratios 
in order to maintain our investment spread over the lease term  we typically match the average term of our long term debt with the average remaining term of our leases as well as the type of debt with the type of leases fixed or variable rate 
we describe this process as match funding 
we currently intend to match fund at least of our total outstanding debt with leases 
we may change the guideline at any time without shareholder approval 
as of december   approximately of our debt outstanding was substantially match funded debt 
as of december   our long term debt had a weighted average remaining term of years and our leases had a weighted average remaining term of years 
we have adopted a policy to limit debt to approximately of our assets calculated as total assets plus accumulated depreciation 
this policy may be changed by our board of trustees at any time without shareholder approval 
as of december   our debt to assets ratio was approximately and our debt to total market capitalization was approximately 
in light of our current financial position  we believe that we will be able to obtain additional financing for our short term and long term liquidity requirements as discussed in liquidity requirements below 
we have used and may continue to use interest rate swap arrangements to manage interest rate risk and to match fund our long term debt with our long term leases 
however  there can be no assurance that additional financing or capital will be available  or that the terms will be acceptable or advantageous to us 
variable rate lease program we may offer our current and prospective tenants the option of utilizing our variable rate lease program 
under this program  base rent changes monthly based upon a spread over an applicable index  typically libor 
in addition  our leases typically provide for upward periodic adjustments in base rent  usually based on a factor of the change in the cpi 
the vast majority of our variable rate lease agreements contain minimum lease rates  generally between and  and fixed rate conversion features generally with minimum rates of to  and none of these leases contains a maximum rate 
upon conversion  the fixed base rent typically continues to be adjusted upward periodically based on a factor of the change in the cpi or other escalation provisions set forth in the lease 
the following table sets forth certain information regarding our variable rate leases and debt as of december st for the years indicated dollars in thousands percent of our total real estate portfolio variable rate average one subject to subject to total variable debt matched month variable variable rate rate debt with variable libor for year rate leases leases outstanding rate leases the year includes amounts outstanding on our revolving credit facilities totaling million  million and million as of december   and  respectively 
in order to maintain our investment spread over the lease term  we typically utilize variable rate debt in circumstances where we have variable rate leases 
the investment spreads on our variable rate lease portfolio will change under certain interest rate conditions 
our strategy of including minimum lease rates in our variable rate leases allows us to realize additional investment spread during the current low interest rate environment 
during the past three years  as libor has decreased  the interest expense on our variable rate debt has also decreased 
however  the revenue generated from the vast majority of our variable rate leases has remained constant during this same time period because the minimum lease rates were in effect at these libor levels 
because many of our leases are subject to minimum lease rates  as libor rises  our investment spreads will contract from current levels until the one month libor reaches to 
at that time  our variable lease rates and variable debt rates will rise equally with libor 
mortgage debt and revolving credit facilities as of december   we had total mortgage debt outstanding of approximately billion consisting of million of fixed rate and million of variable rate debt  which was secured by of our properties 
in addition  we had approximately million outstanding on our revolving credit facilities

during the first quarter of  we issued a mortgage note totaling million payable to a worldwide financial services company 
the loan is secured by an office building located in bloomfield hills  michigan  and it has a ten year term  year amortization period and requires monthly interest and principal payments that bear interest at a fixed rate of 
for the quarter and year ended december   our interest coverage and debt service coverage ratios were and  respectively 
we consider the interest coverage and debt service coverage ratios meaningful financial performance measures of liquidity as they provide our investors with information pertaining to our ability to satisfy our debt service requirements 
these measures are typically used by our lenders in assessing our compliance with certain debt covenants 
these ratios are considered non gaap financial measures because they are calculated using earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  commonly referred to as ebitda 
the ratios should not be considered an alternative measure of operating results or cash flow from operations as determined in accordance with gaap 
the following is a calculation of our interest coverage ratio and our debt service coverage ratio for the three months and year ended december  dollars in thousands 
the calculation includes a reconciliation of ebitda to its most directly comparable gaap measure  net income 
three months ended year ended december  december  interest coverage ratio net income before minority interest interest expense depreciation and amortization ebitda interest coverage ratio ebitda divided by interest expense and preferred dividends debt service coverage ratio dscr interest expense preferred dividends principal amortization for the period dscr ebitda divided by interest expense principal amortization for the period preferred dividends the more significant debt covenants related to our mortgage debt and credit facilities limit our debt to assets ratio and require us to comply with minimum debt service coverage and maximum debt to adjusted net worth ratios 
several of our loan agreements contain no financial covenants  however  there are negative covenants relating to customary items such as operation and maintenance of the properties securing the loans and limitations on issuing additional secured debt at those subsidiary levels 
as of december   we were in compliance with all of the debt covenants related to our mortgage debt and credit facilities 
interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk  during   and  we entered into four interest rate swap arrangements with third parties to fix the interest rate on the underlying variable rate debt  totaling approximately million 
these swaps were designed to mirror the underlying variable rate debt in terms of index  spread  reset  amortization  compounding and maturity 
due to the identical nature of the terms of the swap arrangements and the underlying terms of the debt  these swaps were documented as cash flow hedges and designated as highly effective at the inception of the swap arrangements 
therefore  in accordance with gaap  the unrealized gain or loss upon measuring the swaps at their fair value is recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss within shareholders equity on our consolidated balance sheets as long as the swaps remain highly effective 
we assess whether our swaps remain highly effective at each reporting period date 
to date our swaps remain highly effective 
the fair value of the swaps is recorded as either a derivative instrument asset or a derivative instrument liability on our consolidated balance sheets 
in addition  we are required to post collateral  generally in the amount of the swap valuations at any point in time  to protect the lenders in case of an early termination by us 
the collateral posted by us  totaling approximately million and million as of december  and  respectively  is included in other assets on our consolidated balance sheets 
total comprehensive income for the years ended december   and was million  million and million  respectively 
the unrealized loss as of december  and december  was as follows in thousands december  december  derivative instrument liability equity offerings on april   we sold  common shares in an underwritten public offering at an initial price to the public of per share under our shelf registration statement filed with the sec on march  in addition  on may    common shares subject to the underwriters over allotment option were issued at an initial price to the public of per share

the company contributed the net proceeds of the offering to the partnership in exchange for units in the partnership and used the net proceeds to fund acquisitions  repay borrowings under our short term credit facilities and for general corporate purposes 
on june   we filed our shelf registration statement with the sec  which we refer to as the shelf registration statement  relating to the future offering of up to an aggregate of million of common shares  preferred shares  depositary shares  debt securities and warrants exercisable for common or preferred shares 
we believe the shelf registration statement will provide us with more efficient and immediate access to capital markets when considered appropriate

the preferred shares were issued under our shelf registration statement 
the preferred shares pay quarterly dividends in arrears and are trading on the nasdaq national market under the symbol carsp

liquidity requirements short term liquidity requirements consist primarily of normal recurring operating expenses and capital expenditures  debt service requirements including debt service relating to additional and replacement debt  collateral calls on interest rate swaps  distributions to common and preferred shareholders  distributions to minority partners and amounts required for additional property acquisitions  facility improvement and expansion fundings and construction financings 
we expect to meet these requirements other than amounts required for additional property acquisitions  facility improvement and expansion fundings and construction financings through cash provided from operations and our existing revolving credit facilities 
we anticipate that any additional acquisitions of properties  facility improvement and expansion fundings and construction financings during the next months will be funded with amounts available under our existing commitments for long term financing  future long term secured and unsecured debt and the issuance of common or preferred equity or units  each of which may be initially funded with our existing revolving credit facilities 
acquisitions of properties  facility improvement and expansion fundings and construction financings will be made subject to our investment objectives and policies with the intention of maximizing both current and long term growth and income 
included in our short term liquidity requirements is the repayment of approximately million of borrowings outstanding on our revolving credit facilities as of december  properties are eligible within the borrowing base for days to twelve months  unless extended by the company and the lender  and therefore we are generally required to repay these borrowings within twelve months 
we paid down substantially all of the amounts outstanding as of december  with the net proceeds of our follow on common share offering on february   the issuance of long term debt and cash on hand 
as of december   long term liquidity requirements consisted primarily of obligations under our long term debt and dividends paid to our preferred shareholders 
we anticipate that long term liquidity requirements will also include amounts required for acquisitions of properties  facility improvement and expansion fundings and construction financings 
we expect to meet long term liquidity requirements through long term secured and unsecured borrowings and other debt and equity financing alternatives 
the availability and terms of any such financing will depend upon market and other conditions

the preferred shares are redeemable for cash  at per share plus any accrued and unpaid dividends  at our option on or after december  the preferred shares have no stated maturity 
we also currently have contractual commitments for future facility improvements and construction financings with several large tenants on properties we currently own 
improvements include costs incurred on facilities during which the tenant s business continues to operate without interruption 
construction financings include advances for the construction of new facilities for which operations have not commenced or fundings for major improvements to existing facilities that cause operations to cease during the construction period 
as of december   these commitments totaled approximately million 
subsequent to december   we have committed to fund additional construction and improvement financings 
these projects are expected to be completed during the next two years 
commitments for long term financing during the second quarter of  we signed a commitment for million of secured mortgage financing from a worldwide financial services company 
the commitment can be drawn down in multiple fundings under one or more debt instruments  and each funding is subject to customary conditions and the lender s satisfaction with the loan documentation 
the commitment provides financing for up to five years at a spread over libor 
as of december   we had issued million of secured mortgage financing under this commitment leaving million available for future borrowings 
dividend reinvestment and share purchase plan during april  we implemented a drip plan  which was subsequently amended in march under the drip  current shareholders and unitholders are permitted to elect to reinvest all  a portion or none of their cash dividends or distributions to purchase common shares 
the drip also allows both new investors and existing shareholders and unitholders to make optional cash payments to purchase common shares 
the drip permits current shareholders  unitholders and new investors to invest a minimum of up to a maximum of  in common shares per month 
the drip also allows us to raise additional capital by waiving the limitations on the  maximum per month  as more fully described in the prospectus relating to the drip 
shares purchased under the drip through reinvestment of dividends are purchased at a discount currently to the market price 
shares purchased under the drip through optional cash payments of  or less are purchased at market price 
common shares may be purchased directly from us or in open market or privately negotiated transactions  as we determine from time to time  to fulfill the requirements for the drip 
we issued approximately   and  common shares under the drip  totaling approximately million   and million  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
purchase of warrants outstanding to purchase common shares during the fourth quarter of  we completed the purchase of outstanding warrants to purchase approximately million common shares for per warrant 
the aggregate purchase price for the warrants was approximately million  of which million was paid in and the remaining million was paid in  and was funded with debt and cash on hand 
during the first quarter of  we completed the purchase of outstanding warrants to purchase  common shares for per warrant  which was funded with cash on hand 
the purchase price for all the warrants was based on the time remaining prior to exercise and the intrinsic value meaning the difference between the fair market value of the common shares and the exercise price of the warrants of the outstanding warrants at the time of the offer to purchase 
the exercise price per share for the common shares underlying the warrants was and substantially all warrants were to expire in february the purchase of the warrants was considered a retirement of an equity instrument for gaap purposes and therefore recorded as a charge to shareholders equity 
in addition  a total of   and  warrants to purchase common shares were exercised at per share during  and  respectively 
as of december   there were no warrants outstanding 
common share repurchase program during  we announced that our board of trustees had authorized the repurchase of up to million common shares 
purchases have been and will be made from time to time in open market transactions at prevailing prices or in negotiated private transactions at the discretion of management 
during and  there were no repurchases of common shares 
during  we repurchased  common shares at an average price of per common share 
from the inception of the common share repurchase program through december   a total of  common shares have been repurchased at an average price of per common share 
in conjunction with the common share repurchases  the partnership redeemed an equivalent number of units from the company for equivalent purchase prices 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
funds from operations ffo the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit developed ffo as a relative non gaap financial measure of performance and liquidity of an equity reit in order to recognize that income producing real estate historically has not depreciated on the basis determined under gaap 
ffo  as defined under the revised definition adopted in april by nareit and as presented by us  is net income  computed in accordance with gaap  plus depreciation and amortization of assets unique to the real estate industry  plus minority interest related to income from continuing operations and income from discontinued operations  and excluding gains from the sales of property  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
ffo does not represent cash flows from operating activities in accordance with gaap which  unlike ffo  generally reflects all cash effects of transactions and other events in the determination of net income and should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance or to cash flow as a measure of liquidity or ability to make distributions 
we consider ffo a meaningful  additional measure of operating performance because it primarily excludes the assumption that the value of the real estate assets diminishes predictably over time  which is contrary to what we believe occurs with our assets  and because industry analysts have accepted it as a performance measure 
comparison of our presentation of ffo  using the nareit definition  to similarly titled measures for other reits may not necessarily be meaningful due to possible differences in the application of the nareit definition used by such reits 
the following table reconciles ffo and ffo per share for each of the five years in the period ended december  to their most directly comparable gaap measure  net income available to common shareholders and net income per share in thousands  except per share data net income available to common shareholders real estate depreciation and amortization minority interest related to income from continuing operations and income from discontinued operations gain on sale of real estate assets ffo weighted average number of common shares used to compute basic net income per share weighted average number of common shares used to compute fully diluted net income per share weighted average number of common shares and units used to compute basic ffo per share weighted average number of common shares and units used to compute fully diluted ffo per share basic net income per share diluted net income per share basic ffo per share diluted ffo per share forward looking statements this annual report on form k  including our documents incorporated herein by reference  contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to certain financial market risks  the most predominant being fluctuations in interest rates 
interest rate fluctuations are monitored by our management as an integral part of our overall risk management program  which recognizes the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effect on our results of operations 
in general  our policy of substantially match funding at least of our total outstanding debt with leases reduces our exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
as of december   approximately of our debt outstanding was substantially match funded debt 
we have used and may continue to use interest rate swap arrangements to manage interest rate risk and to match fund our long term debt with our long term leases 
we do not enter into interest rate swap arrangements for trading purposes 
during the year ended december   our fixed rate debt increased from million as of december  to million as of december  interest rate fluctuations may affect the fair value of our fixed rate debt instruments 
if interest rates on our fixed rate debt instruments at december  had been one percentage point higher or lower  the fair value of those debt instruments on that date would have decreased or increased  respectively  by approximately million 
as of december   approximately million  or of our total real estate portfolio  was leased to tenants utilizing our variable rate lease program  as compared to million as of december  under these leases  base rent which is generally based upon a spread over libor  changes monthly 
the vast majority of our variable rate lease agreements contain minimum lease rates  generally between and  and fixed rate conversion features generally with minimum rates of to  and none of these leases contains a maximum rate 
the execution of these variable rate leases has enabled us to utilize variable rate debt totaling million as of december   as compared to million as of december  in order to maintain our investment spread 
the investment spreads on our variable rate lease portfolio will change under certain interest rate conditions 
our strategy of including minimum lease rates in our variable rate leases allows us to realize additional investment spread during the current low short term interest rate environment 
during the past year  as libor has decreased  the interest expense on our variable rate debt has also decreased 
however  the revenue generated from the vast majority of our variable rate leases has remained constant during this same time period because the minimum lease rates were in effect at these libor levels 
because many of our leases are subject to minimum lease rates  as libor rises  our investment spreads will contract from current levels until the one month libor reaches to 
at that time  our variable lease rates and variable debt rates will rise equally with libor 
if interest rates on our variable rate debt instruments outstanding at december  had been higher or lower  our annual interest expense relating to those debt instruments would have increased or decreased  respectively  by approximately million  based on balances at december  this impact on net income as a result of an increase or decrease in interest rates by is partially reduced by the structure of our variable rate leases as noted above 
because of the minimum lease rates built into the majority of our leases  if the underlying index on our variable rate lease agreements outstanding at december  had been higher or lower  our annual rental revenue relating to those lease agreements would have increased by approximately  or decreased by approximately  respectively 
assuming the underlying index increased to a level where none of our minimum lease rates were triggered  a increase or decrease in the underlying index would increase or decrease our rental revenue by approximately million to million because of certain investment spread variations at various libor levels
