year ended december  dollars in thousands operating revenues local service    network access    other    operating expenses plant operations    customer operations    corporate and other    depreciation and amortization    operating income    local service revenues 
local service revenues are derived from the provision of local exchange telephone services in the company s service areas 
of the million increase in local service revenues in  million was due to the properties acquired from verizon in the third quarter of of the remaining million increase  million was due to the provision of custom calling features to more customers and million was due to increased rates in certain jurisdictions 
of the million increase in local service revenues in  million was due to the acquisition of the verizon properties in the remaining million increase was primarily due to a million increase resulting from the provision of custom calling features to more customers and a million increase due to increased rates in certain jurisdictions 
access lines declined  during compared to a decline of  in exclusive of acquisitions 
the company believes the decline in the number of access lines during and is primarily due to general economic conditions in the company s markets and the displacement of traditional wireline telephone services by other competitive services  including the company s dsl product offering 
even as the economy recovers  the company believes that any rebound in access lines will be limited by continued access line losses caused primarily by the impact of other competitive services 
based on current conditions  the company expects access lines to decline between and for network access revenues 
network access revenues are primarily derived from charges to long distance companies and other customers for access to the company s local exchange carrier lec networks in connection with the completion of interstate or intrastate voice and data transmissions 
certain of the company s interstate network access revenues are based on tariffed access charges filed directly with the federal communications commission fcc  the remainder of such revenues are derived under revenue sharing arrangements with other lecs administered by the national exchange carrier association 
intrastate network access revenues are based on tariffed access charges filed with state regulatory agencies or are derived under revenue sharing arrangements with other lecs 
network access revenues increased million in and million in due to the following factors increase increase decrease decrease dollars in thousands acquisitions of verizon properties in third quarter   increased recovery from the federal universal service fund usf  one time refund of access charges to interexchange carriers   intrastate revenues due to decreased minutes of use and decreased access rates in certain states   partial recovery of increased operating costs through revenue sharing arrangements with other telephone companies  increased recovery from state support funds and return on rate base   rate changes in certain jurisdictions   revision of prior year revenue settlement agreements   other  net   as indicated in the chart above  in the company experienced a reduction in its intrastate revenues exclusive of the properties acquired from verizon in of approximately million primarily due to i a reduction in intrastate minutes partially due to the displacement of minutes by wireless and electronic mail services and ii decreased access rates in certain states 
the corresponding decrease in compared to was million 
the company believes intrastate minutes will continue to decline in  although the magnitude of such decrease cannot be precisely estimated 
the company anticipates that revenue derived from its revision of prior year revenue settlement agreements will be lower in compared to levels

such increases were partially offset by i a million decrease in the provision for uncollectible receivables as was adversely impacted by the establishment of a million reserve for uncollectible receivables primarily related to the bankruptcy of mci formerly worldcom  inc  whereas was positively impacted by a million reduction in the provision for uncollectible receivables due to the partial recovery of amounts previously written off related to the bankruptcy of mci and ii a million decrease in customer service expenses 
of the million increase in  million related to the verizon acquisitions in the remaining increase of million was due primarily to a million increase in salaries and benefits  a million increase in customer service expenses and a million increase in the provision for uncollectible receivables attributable to the above mentioned establishment of a million reserve for uncollectible receivables primarily related to the bankruptcy of mci which was partially offset by an million reduction in the provision for uncollectible receivables for non carrier customers 
such increases were partially offset by a million decrease in operating taxes and a million decrease in expenses related to the provision of cpe services 
depreciation and amortization increased million in and decreased million in of the million increase in  million was due to the properties acquired from verizon in the remaining increase is primarily due to an increase in depreciation expense due to higher levels of plant in service in incumbent markets

accounting pronouncements on january   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred and be capitalized as part of the book value of the long lived asset 
although the company generally has had no legal obligation to remove obsolete assets  depreciation rates of certain assets established by regulatory authorities for the company s telephone operations subject to statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation sfas  have historically included a component for removal costs in excess of the related estimated salvage value 
notwithstanding the adoption of sfas  sfas requires the company to continue to reflect this accumulated liability for removal costs in excess of salvage value even though there is no legal obligation to remove the assets 
for the company s telephone operations acquired from verizon in and its other operations neither of which are subject to sfas  the company has not accrued a liability for anticipated removal costs in the past 
for these reasons  the adoption of sfas did not have a material effect on the company s financial statements 
in may  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity sfas  which provides standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may  and for pre existing instruments as of the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  the adoption of sfas did not have a material impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
in december  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas 
sfas  effective for fiscal years ending after december   amends statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value method of accounting for stock based compensation 
in addition  sfas amends the disclosure requirements of sfas to require prominent disclosure in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
the company has elected to account for employee stock based compensation using the intrinsic value method in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  as allowed by sfas in november  the emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on eitf  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple element deliverables 
this release addresses how to account for arrangements that may involve the delivery or performance of multiple products  services or rights to use assets 
under this release  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables should be divided into separate units of accounting based on their relative fair value 
the final consensus was applicable to agreements entered into in periods beginning after june  the adoption of eitf did not have a material impact on the company s results of operations 
critical accounting policies the company s financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles that are generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
management continually evaluates its estimates and judgments including those related to i revenue recognition  ii allowance for doubtful accounts  iii purchase price allocation  iv pension and postretirement benefits and v long lived assets 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies involve a higher degree of judgment or complexity 
revenue recognition 
certain of the company s telephone subsidiaries participate in revenue sharing arrangements with other telephone companies for interstate revenue and for certain intrastate revenue 
under such sharing arrangements  which are typically administered by quasi governmental agencies  participating telephone companies contribute toll revenue or access charges within state jurisdictions and access charges in the interstate market 
these revenues are pooled by the administrative agencies and used to reimburse exchange carriers for their costs 
typically  participating companies have months to update or correct data previously submitted 
as a result  revenues earned through the various sharing arrangements are initially recorded based on the company s estimates 
historically  revisions of previous revenue estimates have not been material 
certain of the company s telephone subsidiaries file tariffs directly with the federal communications commission fcc for certain interstate revenues 
generally  the company records such revenue at the authorized rate of return prescribed by the fcc 
if amounts are billed in excess of the authorized rate of return  such excess is subject to refund upon request from other telecommunications carriers and customers 
amounts not requested for refund by carriers or customers are recognized as revenues at the end of the settlement period  which is generally months subsequent to the two year monitoring periods 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report for additional information 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
in evaluating the collectibility of its accounts receivable  the company assesses a number of factors  including a specific customer s or carrier s ability to meet its financial obligations to the company  the length of time the receivable has been past due and historical collection experience 
based on these assessments  the company records both specific and general reserves for uncollectible accounts receivable to reduce the related accounts receivable to the amount the company ultimately expects to collect from customers and carriers 
if circumstances change or economic conditions worsen such that the company s past collection experience is no longer relevant  the company s estimate of the recoverability of its accounts receivable could be further reduced from the levels reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
purchase price allocation 
for the properties acquired from verizon in  the company allocated the aggregate purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on fair value at the date of acquisition 
the fair value of property  plant and equipment and identifiable intangible assets was determined by an independent appraisal of such assets 
the fair value of the postretirement benefit obligation was determined through actuarial valuations 
the fair value of current assets and current liabilities was assumed to approximate the recorded value at acquisition due to their short maturity 
the remaining unallocated acquisition cost was considered goodwill 
pension and postretirement benefits 
the amounts recognized in the financial statements related to pension and postretirement benefits are determined on an actuarial basis  which utilizes many assumptions in the calculation of such amounts 
a significant assumption used in determining the company s pension and postretirement expense is the expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
for  the company lowered its expected long term rate of return on plan assets to  reflecting the expected moderation of long term rates of return in the financial markets 
for  such expected return was assumed to be 
another assumption used in the determination of the company s pension and postretirement benefit plan obligations is the appropriate discount rate  which is generally based on the yield on high quality corporate bonds 
the company lowered its assumed discount rate to at december  from at december  changes in the discount rate do not have a material impact on the company s results of operations 
see pension and medical costs for additional information 
intangible and long lived assets 
effective january   the company was subject to testing for impairment of long lived assets under two new accounting standards  statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 
sfas requires goodwill recorded in business combinations to be reviewed for impairment at least annually and requires write downs only in periods in which the recorded amount of goodwill exceeds the fair value 
under sfas  impairment of goodwill is tested by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value including goodwill 
estimates of the fair value of the reporting unit are based on valuation models using techniques such as multiples of earnings before interest  taxes and depreciation and amortization 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value  a second calculation is required in which the implied fair value of goodwill is compared to its carrying value 
if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than its carrying value  goodwill must be written down to its implied fair value 
the company completed the required annual test of goodwill impairment as of september  under sfas and determined its goodwill is not impaired as of such date 
prior to january   substantially all of the company s goodwill was amortized over years 
the company s amortization of goodwill for the year ended december  totaled approximately million 
under sfas  the carrying value of long lived assets other than goodwill is reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that such carrying amount cannot be recoverable by assessing the recoverability of the carrying value through estimated undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the assets 
if the undiscounted net cash flows are less than the carrying value  an impairment loss would be measured as the excess of the carrying value of a long lived asset over its fair value 
for additional information on the company s critical accounting policies  see accounting pronouncements and regulation and competition other matters  and the footnotes to the company s consolidated financial statements 
inflation the effects of increased costs historically have been mitigated by the company s ability to recover certain costs over time applicable to its regulated telephone operations through the rate making process 
possible future regulatory changes and the continued movement toward alternative forms of regulation for intrastate operations may alter the company s ability to recover increased costs in its regulated operations 
for the properties acquired from verizon in  which are regulated under price cap regulation for interstate purposes  price changes are limited to the rate of inflation  minus a productivity offset 
for additional information regarding the current regulatory environment  see regulation and competition 
as operating expenses in the company s nonregulated lines of business increase as a result of inflation  the company  to the extent permitted by competition  attempts to recover the costs by increasing prices for its services and equipment 
market risk the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on its long term debt obligations 
the company has estimated its market risk using sensitivity analysis 
market risk is defined as the potential change in the fair value of a fixed rate debt obligation due to a hypothetical adverse change in interest rates 
fair value of long term debt obligations is determined based on a discounted cash flow analysis  using the rates and maturities of these obligations compared to terms and rates currently available in the long term financing markets 
the results of the sensitivity analysis used to estimate market risk are presented below  although the actual results may differ from these estimates 
at december   the fair value of the company s long term debt was estimated to be billion based on the overall weighted average rate of the company s long term debt of and an overall weighted maturity of years compared to terms and rates currently available in long term financing markets 
market risk is estimated as the potential decrease in fair value of the company s long term debt resulting from a hypothetical increase of basis points in interest rates ten percent of the company s overall weighted average borrowing rate 
such an increase in interest rates would result in approximately a million decrease in the fair value of the company s long term debt 
as of december   after giving effect to interest rate swaps currently in place  approximately of the company s long term debt obligations were fixed rate 
the company seeks to maintain a favorable mix of fixed and variable rate debt in an effort to limit interest costs and cash flow volatility resulting from changes in rates 
from time to time  the company uses derivative instruments to i lock in or swap its exposure to changing or variable interest rates for fixed interest rates or ii to swap obligations to pay fixed interest rates for variable interest rates 
the company has established policies and procedures for risk assessment and the approval  reporting and monitoring of derivative instrument activities 
the company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
management periodically reviews the company s exposure to interest rate fluctuations and implements strategies to manage the exposure 
at december   the company had outstanding four fair value interest rate hedges associated with the full million aggregate principal amount of its series l senior notes  due  that pay interest at a fixed rate of 
these hedges are fixed to variable interest rate swaps that effectively convert the company s fixed rate interest payment obligations under these notes into obligations to pay variable rates that range from the six month london interbank offered rate libor plus to the six month libor plus  with settlement and rate reset dates occurring each six months through the expiration of the hedges in august at december   the company realized a rate under these hedges of 
interest expense was reduced by million during as a result of these hedges 
the aggregate fair market value of these hedges was million at december  and is reflected both as a liability and as a decrease in the company s underlying long term debt on the december  balance sheet 
with respect to these hedges  market risk is estimated as the potential change in the fair value of the hedge resulting from a hypothetical increase in the forward rates used to determine the fair value 
a hypothetical increase in the forward rates would result in a million decrease in the fair value of these hedges 
effective may   the company terminated a fair value interest rate hedge associated with million aggregate principal amount of its series h senior notes and received million cash upon settlement  which represented the fair value of the hedge at the termination date 
such amount will be amortized as a reduction of interest expense through  the maturity date of the series h notes 
development of billing system the company is in the process of developing an integrated billing and customer care system which will provide the company with  in addition to standard billing functionality currently being provided by its legacy system  custom built hardware and software technology for more efficient and effective customer care  billing and provisioning systems 
the costs to develop such system have been accounted for in accordance with statement of position  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use sop 
the capitalized costs of the system aggregated million before accumulated amortization at december  the company began amortizing its billing system costs in early over a year period based on the total number of customers that the company has migrated to the new system 
the system remains in the development stage and has required substantially more time and money to develop than originally anticipated

the following table reflects the company s debt to total capitalization percentage and ratio of earnings to fixed charges and preferred stock dividends as of and for the years ended december debt to total capitalization ratio of earnings from continuing operations to fixed charges and preferred stock dividends regulation and competition the communications industry continues to undergo various fundamental regulatory  legislative  competitive and technological changes 
these changes may have a significant impact on the future financial performance of all communications companies 
events affecting the communications industry 
in  the united states congress enacted the telecommunications act of the act  which obligates lecs to permit competitors to interconnect their facilities to the lec s network and to take various other steps that are designed to promote competition 
under the act s rural telephone company exemption  approximately of the company s telephone access lines are exempt from certain of these interconnection requirements unless and until the appropriate state regulatory commission overrides the exemption upon receipt from a competitor of a bona fide request meeting certain criteria 
during  the fcc released new rules which outline the obligations of incumbent lecs to lease elements of their circuit switched networks on an unbundled basis to competitors 
the new framework eliminates the prior obligation of incumbent lecs to lease their high speed data lines to competitors 
incumbent lecs will remain obligated to offer other telecommunications services to resellers at wholesale rates 
these wholesale rates are based on a forward looking cost model and other terms that substantially limit the profitability of these arrangements to incumbent lecs 
this new rule also provides for a significant role of state regulatory commissions in implementing these new guidelines and establishing wholesale service rates 
on march   a federal district court of appeals overturned the rules previously adopted by the fcc requiring lecs to provide competitors with discounted access to the lecs networks 
the court also ruled that the fcc should not have given states the authority previously granted 
it is expected that such decision will be appealed to the supreme court 
during  the fcc also sought public comments on whether it should make additional changes to its interconnection regulations  and instituted a comprehensive review of its methodologies for establishing wholesale rates 
prior to and since the enactment of the act  the fcc and a number of state legislative and regulatory bodies have also taken steps to foster local exchange competition 
coincident with this recent movement toward increased competition has been the gradual reduction of regulatory oversight of lecs 
these cumulative changes  coupled with various technological developments  have led to the continued growth of various companies providing services that compete with lecs services 
wireless services entities also increasingly constitute a significant source of competition with lecs 
as mandated by the act  in may the fcc modified its existing universal service support mechanism for rural telephone companies 
the fcc adopted an interim mechanism for a five year period  effective july   based on embedded  or historical  costs that will provide predictable levels of support to rural local exchange carriers  including substantially all of the company s local exchange carriers 
during and the company s telephone subsidiaries received million and million  respectively  from the federal universal service high cost loop fund  representing and  respectively  of the company s consolidated revenues from continuing operations for and the company anticipates its revenues from the federal universal service high cost loop fund will be lower than levels due to increases in the nationwide average cost per loop factor used by the fcc to allocate funds among all recipients 
wireless and other competitive service providers continue to seek eligible telecommunications carrier etc status in order to be eligible to receive universal service fund support  which is placing additional financial pressure on the amount of money needed to provide support to all eligible service providers  including support payments the company receives from the high cost loop fund 
as a result of the limited growth in the size of the high cost loop fund and changes in requests for support from the universal service fund  the company has no assurance it will continue to receive payments from the universal service fund commensurate with those received in the past 
in  the fcc modified its interstate access charge rules and universal service support system for rate of return lecs 
this order  among other things  i increased the caps on the subscriber line charges slc to the levels paid by most subscribers nationwide  ii allowed limited slc deaveraging  which enhanced the competitiveness of rate of return carriers by giving them pricing flexibility  iii lowered per minute rates collected for federal access charges  iv created a new explicit universal service support mechanism that replaced other implicit support mechanisms in a manner designed to ensure that rate structure changes do not affect the overall recovery of interstate access costs by rate of return carriers serving high cost areas  and v preserved the historic authorized interstate return rate for rate of return lecs 
the effect of this order on the company was revenue neutral for interstate purposes but did result in a reduction in intrastate revenues in arkansas and ohio where intrastate access rates must mirror the interstate access rates 
technological developments have led to the development of new services that compete with traditional lec services 
technological improvements have enabled cable television companies to provide traditional circuit switched telephone service over their cable networks  and several national cable companies have aggressively pursued this opportunity 
recent improvements in the quality of voice over internet protocol voip service have led several large cable television and telephone companies  as well as start up companies  to substantially increase their offerings of voip service to business and residential customers 
voip providers route calls over the internet  without use of ilec s circuit switches and  in certain cases  without use of ilec s networks to carry their communications traffic 
voip providers can offer services at prices substantially below those currently charged for traditional local and long distance telephone services for several reasons  including lower network cost structures and the current ability of voip providers to use ilecs networks without paying access charges 
in december  the fcc initiated rulemaking that is expected to address the effect of voip on intercarrier compensation  universal service and emergency services 
there can be no assurance that this rulemaking will be on terms favorable to ilecs  or that voip providers will not successfully compete for the company s customers 
in november  the fcc adopted rules requiring companies to allow their customers to keep their wireline or wireless phone number when switching to another service provider generally referred to as local number portability 
for several years  customers have been able to retain their numbers when switching their local service between wireline carriers 
the new rules now require local number portability between wireline and wireless carriers 
this requirement went into effect november  for wireline carriers in the top metropolitan statistical areas msas 
the new requirement will go into effect may  for wireline carriers operating in markets smaller than the top msas 
the majority of the company s wireline operations are conducted in markets below the top msas 
local number portability may increase the number of customers who chose to completely forego the use of traditional wireline phone service  although the company believes that it is too early to fully assess the rule s impact 
the costs to comply with the requirements of local number portability  net of the amount that is recoverable through the ratemaking process  are not expected to have a material impact on the company s results of operations 
the fcc is currently examining several issues that could have a substantial impact on the company s revenues  including a broad inquiry initiated in into all currently regulated forms of intercarrier compensation 
as discussed further below  certain providers of competitive communications services are not required to compensate ilecs for the use of their networks 
the company relies on access revenues as an important source of revenues 
depending on the final outcome of the fcc s intercarrier compensation issue  the company could suffer a material loss of access revenues 
recent events affecting the company 
during the last few years  several states in which the company has substantial operations took legislative or regulatory steps to further introduce competition into the lec business 
the number of companies which have requested authorization to provide local exchange service in the company s service areas has increased in recent years  especially in the markets acquired from verizon in and  and it is anticipated that similar action may be taken by others in the future 
state alternative regulation plans recently adopted by certain of the company s lecs have also affected revenue growth recently 
certain long distance carriers continue to request that the company reduce intrastate access tariffed rates for certain of its lecs 
in addition  the company has recently experienced reductions in intrastate traffic  partially due to the displacement of minutes by wireless and electronic mail services 
in the company incurred a reduction in its intrastate revenues exclusive of the properties acquired from verizon in of approximately million compared to primarily due to these factors 
the corresponding decrease in compared to was million 
the company believes such trend of decreased intrastate minutes will continue in  although the magnitude of such decrease cannot be precisely estimated 
in january  the louisiana public service commission directed its staff to review the feasibility of converting the million louisiana local optional service fund los fund into a state universal service fund 
currently  the los fund is funded primarily by bellsouth  which proposes to expand the base of contributors into the los fund 
a recommendation by the commission staff is not expected until late the company currently receives approximately million from the los fund each year 
there can be no assurance that this funding will remain at current levels 
competition to provide traditional telephone services has thus far affected large urban areas to a greater extent than rural  suburban and small urban areas such as those in which the company s telephone operations are located 
although the company does not believe that the increased competition it has thus far experienced is likely to materially affect it in the near term  the company anticipates that regulatory  technological and competitive changes will result in future revenue reductions 
the company expects its telephone revenues to decline in due to continued access line losses and reduced network access revenues  however  the company expects its consolidated revenues to increase in primarily due to increased revenues from its newly acquired lightcore operations and expected increased demand for its long distance  fiber transport  dsl and other nonregulated product offerings 
other matters 
the company s regulated telephone operations except for the properties acquired from verizon in are subject to the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation sfas 
actions by regulators can provide reasonable assurance of the recognition of an asset  reduce or eliminate the value of an asset and impose a liability on a regulated enterprise 
such regulatory assets are required to be recorded and  accordingly  reflected in the balance sheet of an entity subject to sfas the company is monitoring the ongoing applicability of sfas to its regulated telephone operations due to the changing regulatory  competitive and legislative environments  and it is possible that changes in regulation  legislation or competition or in the demand for regulated services or products could result in the company s telephone operations no longer being subject to sfas in the near future 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
 regulated enterprises accounting for the discontinuance of application of fasb statement no 
sfas  specifies the accounting required when an enterprise ceases to meet the criteria for application of sfas sfas requires the elimination of the effects of any actions of regulators that have been recognized as assets and liabilities in accordance with sfas but would not have been recognized as assets and liabilities by nonregulated enterprises 
sfas further provides that the carrying amounts of property  plant and equipment are to be adjusted only to the extent the assets are impaired and that impairment shall be judged in the same manner as for nonregulated enterprises 
the company s consolidated balance sheet as of december  included regulatory assets of approximately million primarily deferred costs related to financing costs  regulatory proceedings and income taxes and regulatory liabilities of approximately  related to income taxes 
net deferred income tax liabilities related to the regulatory assets and liabilities quantified above were million 
when and if the company s regulated operations no longer qualify for the application of sfas  the company does not expect to record any impairment charge related to the carrying value of the property  plant and equipment of its regulated telephone operations 
additionally  upon the discontinuance of sfas  the company would be required to revise the lives of its property  plant and equipment to reflect the estimated useful lives of the assets 
the company does not expect such revisions in asset lives to have a material impact on the company s results of operations 
for regulatory purposes  the accounting and reporting of the company s telephone subsidiaries will not be affected by the discontinued application of sfas the company has certain obligations based on federal  state and local laws relating to the protection of the environment 
costs of compliance through have not been material  and the company currently has no reason to believe that such costs will become material
