item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate risk 
the company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the company s cash and cash equivalents 
at december  the company had million in cash and cash equivalents 
based on the investment interest rate  a hypothetical decrease in interest rates would decrease interest income by approximately  on an annual basis  and likewise decrease our earnings and cash flows 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments in its investment portfolio 
the company places its investments with high credit quality issuers and  by policy  limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
the company is averse to principal loss and ensures the safety and preservation of its invested funds by limiting default risk  market risk  and reinvestment risk 
the company mitigates default risk by investing in only the safest and highest credit quality securities and by constantly positioning its portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor 
the company s interest expense associated with its term loan and revolving credit facility will vary with market rates 
although the company has provided quantitative disclosure in the past regarding interest rate risk associated with its term loan and revolving credit facility  such disclosure is no longer meaningful as the july credit facility was paid off and terminated in and no amounts have drawn against the january credit facility 
the company cannot predict market fluctuations in interest rates and their impact on its variable rate debt  nor can there be any assurance that fixed rate long term debt will be available to the company at favorable rates  if at all 
consequently  future results may differ materially from the estimated adverse changes discussed above 
foreign currency risk 
the company transacts business in various foreign currencies  primarily in certain european countries  canada and australia 
the company does not have any hedging or similar foreign currency contracts 
international revenues represented of the company s total revenues for the year ended december  and of revenues were denominated in foreign currencies 
significant currency fluctuations may adversely impact foreign revenues 
for the year ended december   the company realized transaction losses of  primarily due to intercompany receivables and payables between subsidiaries 
the most significant of this exposure involves intercompany balances between ireland and the united kingdom 
given a hypothetical decrease of in the euro against the great britain pound  the realized transaction loss would increase by approximately  at december  and likewise decrease the company s earnings and cash flows for the respective periods 
given a hypothetical increase of in the euro against the great britain pound  the realized transaction loss would decrease by approximately  at december   and likewise increase the company s earnings and cash flows
