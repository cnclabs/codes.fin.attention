in  the company recorded an additional provision of million  million  net of tax  primarily for inventory obsolescence  overstock  and shrink to write down inventory to net realizable value as the company aligned its inventory and cost structure to current sales levels amid continued economic slowdown and limited visibility 
the company reviews its inventory on a quarterly basis 
inventory is evaluated from several perspectives  including quantity on hand based on historical sales activity and potential obsolescence based on projected future sales volumes and technology changes 
the company has a distinct seasonal pattern  which is correlated with the timing of vacations of its customers in europe and holidays within the company s fiscal calendar 
the company s fiscal third quarter  comprised of december  january  and february  is a traditional holiday period and based on eight years of history  from fiscal to  experiences an average sequential decline in net sales 
conversely  its fiscal fourth quarter  comprised of march  april  and may  experiences an average sequential increase in net sales  based on the period from fiscal to in fiscal  the company experienced its first full year sales decline since and the results in the fourth quarter were particularly adverse  as the company s industry continued its slump longer than many expected 
during the company s quarterly reviews prior to the fourth quarter of  it did not feel that  based on its historical results and its expectations going forward  that company s inventory required a write down 
however  given results for the fourth quarter of  the company determined that a write down was appropriate 
in fiscal  a similar pattern held  in that the company s results for the first three quarters closely tracked historical patterns with the third quarter actually beating the historical pattern 
as in fiscal  the fourth quarter was disappointing  and  again  the company determined at that time that a write down was appropriate 
the company recently implemented new polices and procedures to strengthen its inventory management process while continuing to invest in system technology to further enhance its inventory management tools 
the company is committed to inventory management as an ongoing process as the business evolves and technology changes 
sales and gross margin trends are analyzed for each strategic business unit in the following sections

the sales growth was driven by strength in the network access and passive interconnect product lines partially offset by weakness in some specialty and broadcast products 
the network access and passive interconnect product line posted sales growth of and to and million  respectively in fiscal and the company believes this growth is associated with an increase in wireless demand 
rfwc canadian sales increased to million and its asia pacific sales increased to million  respectively in fiscal in fiscal  sales increased from to million due to stronger us wireless communications demand  gains in passive interconnect product lines  and several large contract wins in north america 
rfwc gross margin improved in fiscal gross margins were up basis points  led by the growth of higher margin network access and passive interconnect product lines 
network access and passive interconnect product lines gross margins were and in and and in gross margins in canada and asia pacific increased and in  respectively 
the basis points bps decline in fiscal compared to fiscal was due  in part  to industry wide competitive pricing pressure in recent years  lower markups on several large contracts in the us  and on an expanded customer base in asia pacific in fiscal industrial power group industrial power group ipg sales in fiscal increased to million  led by strong  broad based demand 
ipg tube sales increased to million and power components increased to million 
vacuum tube sales represented and of ipg total sales in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
industrial power group sales in fiscal increased  reflecting growth in the sale of power semiconductors  primarily in industrial rf and industrial power conversion applications  offset by a decline in the tube business  primarily as a result of project timing in the broadcast tube market 
gross margins were up basis points in fiscal primarily due to changes in product mix 
gross margins were relatively flat at   and in fiscal  and  respectively 
security systems division sales for the security systems division ssd exceeded million for the first time  up from fiscal to million with strong growth in canada and renewed growth in the united states  principally due to an increase in digital video recorder sales 
ssd sales increased in the us to million and in canada to million  respectively in fiscal security systems division sales were higher by in fiscal primarily due to heightened concerns over security and acceleration in the conversion from analog to digital technology 
in fiscal and  gross margins were up bps and bps as higher margin digital technology products represented a larger percentage of sales 
display systems group dsg sales increased in fiscal to million as medical monitor sales increased to million  reflecting the continued shift from a film based environment to digital systems

table of contents sales by geographic area the company has grown through a balanced emphasis on investment in both north america and other areas of the world and currently has facilities in north america  in europe  in asia pacific and in latin america 
on a geographic basis  the company primarily categorizes its sales by destination north america  europe  asia pacific  latin america  and corporate 
sales and gross margin  as a percent of sales  by geographic area are as follows in thousands fiscal year ended sales by geographic area may  may  change north america europe asia pacific latin america corporate total sales by geographic area may  june  change north america europe asia pacific latin america corporate total gross may  may  june  margin north america europe asia pacific latin america subtotal corporate total note the data has been reclassified to conform to the fiscal presentation 
the modification includes reclassifying direct export and a portion of corporate to the identified geographic areas based on ship to location 
europe includes sales and gross margins to middle east and africa 
corporate consists of freight and other non specific sales and gross margins 
north american sales increased to million in fiscal  primarily from canada s sales growth of to million  which was led by improved wireless demand and continued strength in the security systems market 
the united states had limited sales growth in fiscal due to a completion of a large wireless infrastructure project in the prior year and a trend of customers moving manufacturing to asia 
north american gross margins remained flat at in fiscal compared to fiscal north american sales increased in fiscal as the company benefited from improved demand in the us wireless communications market and continued gains in the canadian security market  in which the company s ssd division  burtek  is one of the leading suppliers 
european sales increased to million in fiscal as all countries posted increases in sales  partially due to the weakening us dollar 
italy and israel led the sales growth with strong wireless demand  specifically network access gains in italy and infrastructure growth in israel 
gross margins improved bps in fiscal from to 
european sales reached million in fiscal  up from fiscal  propelled by the strong euro and solid gains in ssd and dsg 
asia pacific marked its sixth consecutive year of double digit growth as sales advanced in fiscal following a increase in fiscal china continued its rapid sales growth  increasing to million in fiscal with rfwc sales more than doubling from the prior year to million  experiencing strong infrastructure  network access  and passive interconnect demand 
fiscal asia pacific gross margins have declined slightly from to 
in fiscal  taiwan  japan  and china posted the largest gains as the company opened a third sales office in china and had a strong rfwc performance in japan 
latin america sales declined to million as decreased broadcast demand in colombia and mexico was partially offset by increased industrial power demand in brazil and colombia 
latin american economies did not perform well during fiscal as they suffered from the effects of the global economic recession  weak investment inflows  political instability in several countries  and general uncertainty about the future economic policies of several countries 
this was the main reason sales decreased in fiscal effects of the sold medical glassware business and continued devaluation of local currencies also contributed to the sharp decline 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased million in fiscal to million 
salaries and incentives increased million due primarily to increased sales and additional headcount required to support the sales growth 
for fiscal  total selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to of sales compared to in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses increased million in fiscal to million 
included in the sg a expense is a restructuring charge of million as the company eliminated over positions or approximately of its workforce and terminated a property lease contract see note d to consolidated financial statements 
increases in salaries  primarily resulting from employee merit increases  contributed over million to the sg a increase 
incentives were up million in fiscal on higher sales while fringe benefits were up million driven by increasing healthcare costs and higher payroll 
other income and expense interest expense decreased slightly in fiscal to million  partially due to lower interest on revolving credit agreement and bank loans 
the company also benefited from historically low interest rates as the company s weighted average interest rate decreased to on may   compared to a year ago 
in fiscal  interest expense decreased to million  partially due to million lower charges related to the fair market value adjustments of the fixed rate swaps 
during the second quarter of fiscal  the company identified an accounting error that occurred in its swedish subsidiary which affected interest expense previously reported for the prior seven quarters in the aggregate amount of  the company has restated the financial statements for fiscal and  and the first quarter of fiscal  which increased interest expense reported in those periods see note b to consolidated financial statements

in fiscal  the company recorded a loss of million related to the sale of its medical glassware business 
income tax provision the company s effective tax rates were   and in fiscal  and differences between the effective tax rate as compared to the prior year and as compared to the us federal statutory rate of in fiscal   and principally result from the company s geographical distribution of taxable income and losses  certain non tax deductible charges  valuation allowances  and the company s foreign sales corporation benefit on export sales  net of state income taxes 
net income and per share data for fiscal  net income improved to million  or per share  primarily driven by the sales increase and improved operating leverage 
the selling  general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales decreased to of sales from in fiscal in fiscal  the company posted a net loss of million 
the loss includes  net of tax  million goodwill impairment charge see note c to consolidated financial statements  million charge related to inventory  million restructuring charge  and other charges of million see note d to consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources in recent years  the company has financed its growth and cash needs largely through income from operations and borrowings under its revolving credit facilities 
liquidity provided by the operating activities of the company is reduced by working capital requirements  debt service  capital expenditures  dividends  and business acquisitions 
liquidity is increased by proceeds from borrowings and business dispositions 
cash provided by operations was million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal working capital requirements decreased by million in fiscal as receivables rose due to increased sales but slightly offset by increased accounts payable and days payable 
working capital requirements decreased by million in fiscal as enhanced collection of receivables and improved inventory management did not fully offset a decrease in days payable 
working capital requirements decreased million in fiscal in line with the sales reduction 
cash and cash equivalents were million at may  during fiscal  the company generated million of cash from operating activities 
working capital increased million  largely due to an increase in accounts receivable of million partially offset by an increase of accounts payable of million 
inventory days were approximately days at the end of fiscal  compared with days at the end of fiscal inventory levels and the associated inventory turns reflect its ongoing inventory management efforts 
inventory management remains an area of focus as the company seeks to balance the need to maintain strategic inventory levels to ensure competitive lead times against the risk of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements 
the company provides engineered solutions  including prototype design and assembly  in niche markets 
additionally  the company specializes in certain products representing trailing edge technology that may not be available from other sources  and may not be currently manufactured 
in many cases  the company s products are components of production equipment for which immediate availability is critical to the customer 
accordingly  the company enjoys higher gross margins  but has larger investments in inventory than those of a commodity electronics distributor 
the increase in accounts receivable in fiscal was due to increased sales volume 
days sales outstanding was days at the end of fiscal as compared to the end of fiscal level of days 
days payable were approximately days at the end of fiscal  compared days at the end of fiscal the increase in days payable is primarily due to extended terms negotiated with vendors on large stocking orders 
the company spent approximately million on capital projects in fiscal the fiscal amount primarily related to capitalized peoplesoft development costs  system hardware and disaster recovery  storage area network  and software 
the company spent approximately million on capital projects during fiscal  primarily related to capitalize peoplesoft development costs  facility improvements at the corporate headquarters  as well as ongoing efficiencies in operating and information technology infrastructure 
annual dividend payments for fiscal amounted to million 
the company s policy regarding payment of dividends is reviewed periodically by the board of directors in light of the company s operating needs and capital structure 
over the last years  the company has been in a position to regularly pay a quarterly dividend of per common share and per class b common share 
management currently expects this trend to continue in fiscal as of the end of fiscal  the company maintained million in long term debt primarily in the form of two issues of convertible debentures and a multi currency credit agreement see note g to consolidated financial statements 
in fiscal  the interest payments on the debentures of  each were made in june and december of the debentures have sinking fund payments of  due december  and  due december  the company has a multi currency revolving credit agreement in the amount of million 
the agreement matures in september of and bears interest at applicable libor rates plus a margin  varying with certain financial performance criteria 
at may   the applicable margin was basis points and the unused line was million under the total agreement  however  this amount was reduced to million due to the borrowing base limitations 
the credit agreement and debenture indentures contain financial covenants with which the company was in full compliance at may  these covenants include benchmark levels for tangible net worth  borrowing base  senior funded debt to cash flow and annual debt service coverage 
in addition  the company would be in default of the credit agreement if mr 
edward richardson s stock were not sufficient for him to elect a majority of the company s board of directors and control any amendment to the company by laws as of july  mr 
richardson s ownership percentage was the company has interest rate exchange agreements to convert approximately million of its floating rate debt to an average fixed rate of through july additional interest expense recorded in the statement of operations related to these agreements was   and  in fiscal  and  respectively 
see section risk management and market sensitive financial instruments for information regarding the effect on net income of market changes in interest rates 
on june   the company entered into a contract to sell approximately acres of real estate adjoining its headquarters for  the contract is subject to a number of conditions  including governmental approvals  including rezoning to permit development of a residential subdivision  as well as environmental testing and other customary conditions 
accordingly  the company cannot give any assurance as to the timing or successful completion of the transaction 
the company has outstanding  aggregate principal amount of convertible senior subordinated debentures due june  the debentures and  aggregate principal amount of convertible subordinated debentures due december  the debentures the debentures and the debentures are sometimes referred to collectively as the debentures 
it is not likely that the company will generate sufficient cash to repay the debentures at maturity without depleting its cash balance to a level that would be insufficient to support the company s business 
consequently  the company has filed a registration statement with the securities and exchange commission file no 
to register new notes to be issued in connection with an offer to exchange the new notes for the outstanding debentures 
it is expected that the new notes will be unsecured obligations of the company  senior only to the debentures and future indebtedness made expressly subordinated to the new notes  convertible into shares of the company s common stock and mature in unless earlier converted  redeemed or repurchased 
on june   the company completed an offering of  shares of its common stock  which resulted in net proceeds to the company of  the net proceeds were used to repay borrowings under the company s credit agreement and will be reborrowed  if necessary  to redeem debentures not exchanged in the exchange offer 
as of july   the company had an unused line of million under the credit agreement  however  this amount was reduced to million due to borrowing base restrictions 
certain contractual obligations and other commercial commitments by expiration period are presented in the tables below contractual obligations and contingent commitments payments due by fiscal period  in thousands beyond total convertible debentures floating rate multi currency revolving credit agreement financial instruments facility lease obligations performance bonds contingent and earnout payments other total convertible debentures consist of the debentures  with principal of  due june  and the debentures  with principal of  due december with respect to the debentures  the company will be required to make sinking fund payments of  in fiscal and  in fiscal the floating rate multi currency revolving credit agreement matures in september of and bears interest at applicable libor rates plus a margin  varying with certain financial performance criteria 
at may   the applicable margin was basis points 
financial instruments represent remaining liability associated with the company s interest rate exchange agreements 
facility lease obligations are related to certain warehouse and office facilities under non cancelable operating leases 
certain african and latin american customers require performance bonds with expiration dates between july and december of  renewable annually 
the contingent and earnout payment represents additional consideration to be paid on a percentage of operating income for pixelink corporation  acquired by the company during fiscal year the  contingent and earnout payment will be payable in fiscal management of the company believes that the existing sources of liquidity  including current cash and equivalents as well as cash provided by operating activities  supplemented as necessary with funds available under the company s credit arrangements  will provide sufficient resources to meet the company s present and future working capital and other cash requirements for at least the next twelve months 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make significant estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to allowances for doubtful accounts  inventories  intangible assets  income taxes  and contingencies and litigation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the polices discussed below are considered by management to be critical to understanding the company s financial position and results of operations 
their application involves more significant judgments and estimates in preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements 
for all of these policies  management cautions that future events rarely develop exactly as forecast  and the best estimates routinely require adjustment 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
the estimates are influenced by the following considerations continuing credit evaluation of customers financial conditions  aging of receivables  individually and in the aggregate  large number of customers which are widely dispersed across geographic areas  collectability and delinquency history by geographic area  and the fact that no single customer accounts for or more of net sales 
material changes in one or more of these considerations may require adjustments to the allowance affecting net income and net carrying value of accounts receivable 
as of may   the balance in the account was  impairment of investments 
the company holds a portfolio of investment securities and periodically assesses its recoverability 
in the event of a decline in fair value of an investment  the judgment is made whether the decline is other than temporary 
management s assessment as to the nature of a decline is largely based on the duration of that market decline  financial health of and specific prospects for the issuer  and the company s cash requirements and intent to hold the investment 
if an investment is impaired and the decline in market value is considered to be other than temporary  an appropriate write down is recorded 
the company recognized  investment impairment in fiscal in fiscal  an investment impairment of  was recorded in operating results 
inventories 
in fiscal and  the company carried its inventories at the lower of cost or market using the last in  first out lifo method 
effective june   fiscal  the north american operations  which represent a majority of its operations and approximately of its inventories  changed from the lifo method to the first in  first out fifo method 
all other inventories were consistently stated at the lower of cost or market using the fifo method 
the fifo method is preferable in these circumstances because it provides a better matching of revenue and expenses in its business environment 
the accounting change was not material to the financial statements for any of the periods  and accordingly  no retroactive restatement of prior years financial statements was made 
provisions for obsolete or slow moving inventories are recorded based upon regular analysis of stock rotation  obsolescence  and assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if future demand  change in the industry  or market conditions differ from management s estimates  additional provisions may be necessary 
in fiscal and  the company recorded inventory obsolescence and overstock provisions of million and million  respectively  which were included in the cost of sales 
the provisions were principally for obsolete and slow moving parts 
the parts were written down to estimated realizable value 
the company recently implemented new policies and procedures to strengthen its inventory management process while continuing to invest in system technology to further enhance its inventory management tools 
these policy and procedure changes included increased approval authorization levels for inventory purchases  quarterly quantitative and qualitative inventory aging analysis and review  changes in the budgeting process to establish targets and metrics that relate to its return on assets rather than only a revenue and profit expectation  and realignment of incentive programs in accordance with these targets and metrics 
the company is committed to inventory management as an ongoing process as the business evolves and technology changes 
long lived and intangible assets 
the company periodically evaluates the recoverability of the carrying amounts of its long lived assets  including software  property  plant and equipment 
the company assesses in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  the possibility of long lived assets being impaired when events trigger the likelihood 
impairment is assessed when the undiscounted expected cash flows derived from an asset are less than its carrying amount 
if impairment exists  the carrying value of the impaired asset is written down and impairment loss is recorded in operating results 
in assessing the potential impairment of the company s goodwill and other intangible assets  management makes significant estimates and assumptions regarding the discounted future cash flows to determine the fair value of the respective assets on an annual basis 
these estimates and their related assumptions include  but are not limited to  projected future operating results  industry and economy trends  market discount rates  indirect expense allocations  and tax rates 
if these estimates or assumptions change in the future as a result of changes in strategy  company profitability  or market conditions  among other factors  this could adversely affect future goodwill and other intangible assets valuations and result in additional impairment charges 
effective june   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standard no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
this statement changed the accounting for goodwill and indefinite lived assets from an amortization approach to an impairment only approach 
as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
 the company recorded a transitional impairment charge during the first quarter of fiscal of million million net of tax  presented as a cumulative effect of accounting change 
the company performed its impairment test during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year 
the company did not find any indication that additional impairment existed and  therefore  no additional impairment loss was recorded

table of contents safe harbor statement under the private securities litigation reform act of except for the historical information contained herein  the matters discussed in this annual report on form k are forward looking statements relating to future events  which involve certain risks and uncertainties 
further  there can be no assurance that the trends reflected in historical information will continue in the future 
investors should consider carefully the following risk factors  in addition to the other information included and incorporated by reference in this annual report on form k 
all statements other than statements of historical facts included in this report are statements that constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act and section e of the securities exchange act of the words expect  estimate  anticipate  predict  believe and similar expressions and variations thereof are intended to identify forward looking statements 
such statements appear in a number of places in this report and include statements regarding the intent  belief or current expectations of the company  its directors or its officers with respect to  among other things i trends affecting the company s financial condition or results of operations  ii the company s financing plans  iii the company s business and growth strategies  including potential acquisitions  and iv other plans and objectives for future operations 
investors are cautioned that any such forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties and that actual results may differ materially from those predicted in the forward looking statements or which may be anticipated from historical results or trends 
in addition to the information contained in the company s other filings with the securities and exchange commission  factors that could affect future performance include  among others  the following the company has had significant operating and net losses in the past and may have future losses 
the company reported net losses of approximately million in fiscal and million in fiscal and cannot ensure that it will not experience operating losses and net losses in the future 
the company may continue to lose money if its sales do not continue to increase 
the company cannot predict the extent to which sales will continue to increase across its businesses or how quickly its customers will consume their inventories of the company s products 
the company maintains a significant investment in inventory and has recently incurred significant charges for inventory obsolescence and overstock  and may incur similar charges in the future 
the company maintains significant inventories in an effort to ensure that customers have a reliable source of supply 
the market for many of its products is characterized by rapid change as a result of the development of new technologies  particularly in the semiconductor markets served by the company s rf and wireless communications group  evolving industry standards  and frequent new product introductions by some of its customers 
the company does not have many long term supply contracts with its customers 
generally  the company s product sales are made on a purchase order basis  which permits its customers to reduce or discontinue their purchases 
if the company fails to anticipate the changing needs of its customers and accurately forecast their requirements  its customers may not continue to place orders with them and the company may accumulate significant inventories of products which it will be unable to sell or return to its vendors  or which may decline in value substantially 
in fiscal  the company recorded a pre tax provision for inventory obsolescence and overstock of million  or million net of tax  due to an industry wide decline in sales  a prolonged recovery period  and changes in its mix of business toward higher technology products  particularly in the telecommunications market 
in fiscal  the company recorded an additional pre tax provision of million  or million net of tax  primarily for inventory obsolescence  overstock  and shrinkage  to write down inventory to net realizable value as it sought to align its inventory and cost structure to then current sales levels amid continued economic slowdown and limited visibility 
the company cannot ensure that it will not incur similar charges in the future 
if the company does not maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting  it could be unable to provide timely and reliable financial information 
in connection with the audit of the company s financial statements for the fiscal year ended may   kpmg  the company s independent auditors  issued a letter to the company identifying four issues that they identified as material weaknesses in the company s internal control over financial reporting 
see item a controls and procedures 
although these issues were identified by kpmg as material weaknesses  it has informed the company that none of the identified material weaknesses has resulted in material inaccuracies in the company s financial results for the fiscal year ended may  however  such weaknesses could lead to difficulty in the company being able to provide timely and reliable financial information in the future  although the company has adopted internal control processes which it believes are sufficient to alert it to all material information that is required to be filed in its periodic reports with the sec  or to provide reasonable assurance that its financial statements are fairly presented in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  there is the inherent risk that such controls may not be effective 
additionally  ineffective internal controls would place the company at increased risk of fraud or misuse of corporate assets 
to the extent that material weaknesses are identified in internal controls  significant resources from the management team may be required to implement and maintain effective controls and procedures 
in addition  the company may need to hire additional employees and further train its existing employees and may experience higher than anticipated capital expenditures and operating expenses  during the implementation of these changes and thereafter 
if the company is unable to implement these changes effectively or efficiently  there could be a material adverse effect on its operations or financial results 
because the company derives a significant portion of its revenue by distributing products designed and manufactured by third parties  it may be unable to anticipate changes in the marketplace and  as a result  could lose market share 
the company s business is driven primarily by customers needs and demands for new products and or enhanced performance  and by the products developed and manufactured by third parties 
because the company distributes products developed and manufactured by third parties  its business would be adversely affected if its suppliers fail to anticipate which products or technologies will gain market acceptance or if it cannot sell these products at competitive prices 
the company cannot be certain that its suppliers will permit the company to distribute their newly developed products  or that such products will meet the company s customers needs and demands 
additionally  because some of the company s principal competitors design and manufacture new technology  those competitors may have a competitive advantage over the company 
to successfully compete  the company must maintain an efficient cost structure  an effective sales and marketing team and offer additional services that distinguish it from its competitors 
failure to execute these strategies successfully could harm its results of operations 
the company has exposure to economic downturns and operates in cyclical markets 
as a supplier of electronic components and services to a variety of industries  the company can be adversely affected by general economic downturns 
in particular  demand for the products and services of the company s rf and wireless communications group is dependent upon capital spending levels in the telecommunications industry and demand for products and services of its industrial power group is dependent upon capital spending levels in the manufacturing industry  including steel  automotive  textiles  plastics  and semiconductors  as well as the transportation industry 
many of its customers delay capital projects during economic downturns 
accordingly  the company s operating results for any particular period are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for any future period 
the markets served by its businesses have historically experienced downturns in demand that could harm its operating results 
future economic downturns could be triggered by a variety of causes  including outbreaks of hostilities  terrorist actions  or epidemics in the united states or abroad 
the company has significant debt  which could limit its financial resources and ability to compete and may make it more vulnerable to adverse economic events 
as of may   the company s total long term debt was approximately million  including its outstanding debentures 
the company has incurred and will likely continue to incur indebtedness to fund potential future acquisitions  for strategic initiatives and for general corporate purposes 
although the company believes that the cash flow generated by its continuing operations is sufficient to meet its repayment obligations over the next months  the company cannot ensure that this will be the case 
the company s incurrence of additional indebtedness could have important consequences 
for example  it could increase its vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  require it to dedicate a substantial portion of its cash flow from operations to payments on its indebtedness  thereby reducing the availability of its cash flow to fund working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  research and development efforts and other general corporate purposes  as well as to pay dividends  limit its flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in its business and the industry in which it operates  place it at a competitive disadvantage relative to its competitors who have less debt  or limit  along with the financial and other restrictive covenants in its indebtedness  its ability to borrow additional funds which could affect its ability to make future acquisitions  among other things 
the company s ability to service its debt and meet its other obligations depends on a number of factors beyond its control 
as of may   the company s total debt was approximately million  resulting in a debt to equity ratio of  and primarily consisted of  aggregate principal amount of its debentures  which bear interest at a rate of per year payable on june and december and mature on december    aggregate principal amount of its debentures  which bear interest at a rate of per year payable on june and december and mature on june   and  principal amount of indebtedness under its credit agreement  which matures on september   bears interest at london interbank offered rate  or libor  plus a margin varying with certain financial performance criteria 
the interest rate was at may  the debt to equity ratio has been calculated based on the company s balance sheet dated may  the company s ability to service its debt and meet its other obligations as they come due is dependent on its future financial and operating performance 
this performance is subject to various factors  including factors beyond its control such as changes in global and regional economic conditions  changes in its industry or the end markets for its products  changes in interest or currency exchange rates  inflation in raw materials  energy and other costs 
if the company s cash flow and capital resources are insufficient to enable it to service its debt and meet these obligations as they become due  the company could be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures  sell assets or businesses  limit or discontinue  temporarily or permanently  business plans or operations  obtain additional debt or equity financing  or restructure or refinance debt 
the company cannot ensure the timing of these actions or the amount of proceeds that could be realized from them 
accordingly  the company cannot ensure that it will be able to meet its debt service and other obligations as they become due or otherwise 
if mr 
richardson s voting power were insufficient for him to elect a majority of the company s board of directors  the company would be in default under its credit agreement 
the company would be in default under its credit agreement if the level of mr 
richardson s voting power is less than and therefore not sufficient for him to elect a majority of its board of directors and control any amendment to its by laws 
mr 
richardson s voting power could be reduced below under a number of scenarios  including the company s issuance of additional shares of voting stock or the death of mr 
richardson 
upon such a default  the lenders may declare amounts borrowed under the credit agreement to be immediately due and payable  which in turn would cause a default and acceleration of payment of the notes 
in addition  the lenders under the company s credit agreement could foreclose on their collateral  which includes equity interests in its subsidiaries  and exercise other rights of secured creditors 
the company s business and financial condition could be significantly harmed if such a default occurs 
the company s success depends on its executive officers and other key personnel 
the company s future success depends to a significant degree on the skills  experience and efforts of its executive officers and other key personnel 
the loss of the services of any of its executive officers  particularly mr 
richardson  its chairman of the board and chief executive officer  and bruce w 
johnson  its president and chief operating officer  could significantly harm its business and results of operations 
in addition  the company would be in default under its credit agreement if the level of mr 
richardson s voting power were less than and therefore is not sufficient for him to elect a majority of the company s board of directors and control any amendment to its by laws 
the company s future success will also depend on its ability to attract and retain qualified personnel  including technical and engineering personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense and the company cannot assure investors that it will be successful in retaining or attracting such persons 
the failure to attract and retain qualified personnel could significantly harm its operations 
the company s credit agreement and the indentures for its outstanding debentures impose restrictions with respect to various business matters 
the company s credit agreement contains numerous restrictive covenants that limit the discretion of management with respect to certain business matters 
these covenants place restrictions on  among other things  the company s ability to incur additional indebtedness  to create liens or other encumbrances  to pay dividends or make other payments in respect of its shares of common stock and class b common stock  to engage in transactions with affiliates  to make certain payments and investments  to merge or consolidate with another entity  and to repay indebtedness junior to indebtedness under the credit agreement 
the credit agreement also contains a number of financial covenants that require the company to meet certain financial ratios and tests relating to  among other things  tangible net worth  a borrowing base  senior funded debt to cash flow  and annual debt service coverage 
in addition  the indentures for its outstanding debentures contain covenants that limit  among other things  its ability to pay dividends or make other payments in respect of its shares of common stock and class b common stock and merge or consolidate with another entity 
if the company fails to comply with the obligations in the credit agreement and indentures  it could result in an event of default under those agreements 
if an event of default occurs and is not cured or waived  it could result in acceleration of the indebtedness under those agreements  any of which could significantly harm its business and financial condition 
potential changes in accounting standards regarding stock option plans could limit the desirability of granting stock options  which could harm the company s ability to attract and retain employees  and could also negatively impact its results of operations 
the financial accounting standards board is considering whether to require all companies to treat the fair value of stock options granted to employees as an expense 
the united states congress and other governmental and regulatory authorities have also considered requiring companies to expense stock options 
if this change were to become mandatory  companies could be required to record a compensation expense equal to the fair value of each stock option granted 
currently  the company is generally not required to record compensation expense in connection with stock option grants 
if the company were required to expense the fair value of stock option grants  it would reduce the attractiveness of granting stock options because of the additional expense associated with these grants  which would negatively impact its results of operations 
for example  had the company been required to expense stock option grants by applying the measurement provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  the company s recorded net income of million would have been decreased by million  to a net income of million for fiscal and its recorded net loss of million would have been increased by million  to a net loss of million for fiscal nevertheless  stock options are an important employee recruitment and retention tool  and the company may not be able to attract and retain key personnel if we reduce the scope of our employee stock option program 
accordingly  in the event the company would be required to expense stock option grants  its future results of operations would be negatively impacted  as would its ability to use stock options as an employee recruitment and retention tool 
the company faces intense competition in the markets it serves and  if it does not compete effectively  it could significantly harm its operating results 
the company faces substantial competition in its markets 
the company faces competition from hundreds of electronic component distributors of various sizes  locations  and market focuses as well as original equipment manufacturers  in each case for new products and replacement parts 
some of its competitors have significantly greater resources and broader name recognition than it 
as a result  these competitors may be better able to withstand changing conditions within its markets and throughout the economy as a whole 
in addition  new competitors could enter its markets 
engineering capability  vendor representation and product diversity create segmentation among distributors 
the company s ability to compete successfully will depend on its ability to provide engineered solutions  maintain inventory availability and quality  and provide reliable delivery at competitive prices 
to the extent the company does not keep pace with technological advances or fails to timely respond to changes in competitive factors in its industry  it could lose market share or experience a decline in its revenue and net income 
in addition  gross margins in the businesses in which it competes have declined in recent years due to competitive pressures and may continue to decline 
the company may not be able to continue to make the acquisitions necessary for it to realize its growth strategy or integrate acquisitions successfully 
one of the company s growth strategies is to increase its sales and expand its markets through acquisitions 
since  the company has acquired companies or significant product lines and expects to continue making acquisitions if appropriate opportunities arise in its industry 
the company may not be able to identify and successfully negotiate suitable acquisitions  obtain financing for future acquisitions on satisfactory terms or otherwise complete future acquisitions 
furthermore  the company may compete for acquisition and expansion opportunities with companies that have substantially greater resources than it 
following acquisitions  the company acquired companies may encounter unforeseen operating difficulties and may require significant financial and managerial resources that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development or expansion of its existing operations 
if the company is unable to successfully identify acquisition candidates  complete acquisitions  and integrate the acquired businesses with its existing businesses  its business  results of operations and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected and it may not be able to compete effectively within its industry 
if the company does not continue to reduce its costs  it may not be able to compete effectively in its markets 
the success of the company s business depends  in part  on its continuous reduction of costs 
the electronic component industries have historically experienced price erosion and will likely continue to experience such price erosion 
if the company is not able to reduce its costs sufficiently to offset future price erosion  its operating results will be adversely affected 
the company has recently engaged in various cost cutting and other initiatives intended to reduce costs and increase productivity 
in fiscal  the company recorded a million restructuring charge as it eliminated over positions or approximately of its workforce 
the company cannot ensure that it will be able to continue to reduce its costs 
the company s industrial power group is dependent on a limited number of vendors to supply it with essential products 
electron tubes and certain other products supplied by the company s industrial power group are currently produced by a relatively small number of manufacturers 
the company s future success will depend  in large part  on maintaining current vendor relationships and developing new relationships 
the company believes that vendors supplying products to some of the product lines of its industrial power group are consolidating their distribution relationships or exiting the business 
the five largest suppliers to the industrial power group by percentage of overall industrial power group purchases in fiscal were advanced power technology inc  communications power industries  inc  covimag sa  new japan radio co 
ltd  and powerex inc these suppliers accounted for approximately of the overall industrial power group purchases in fiscal the loss of one or more of the company s key vendors and the failure to find new vendors could significantly harm its business and results of operations 
the company has in the past and may in the future experience difficulties obtaining certain products in a timely manner 
the inability of suppliers to provide it with the required quantity or quality of products could significantly harm its business economic  political and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect the company s business 
in fiscal  of the company s sales and of the company s purchases of products were made internationally 
the company anticipates that it will continue to expand its international operations to the extent that suitable opportunities become available 
accordingly  the company s future results of operations could be harmed by a variety of factors which are not present for companies with operations and sales solely within the united states  including changes in a specific country s or region s political or economic conditions  particularly in emerging markets  including the possibility of military action or other hostilities and confiscation of property  increases in trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements  changes in tax laws and international tax treaties  restrictions on its ability to repatriate investments and earnings from foreign operations  difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations  differing labor regulations  differing levels of protection of intellectual property  changes in regulatory requirements  shipping costs and delays  or difficulties in accounts receivable collection 
if any of these risks materialize  the company could face substantial increases in costs  the reduction of profit  and the inability to do business 
the company s exposed to foreign currency risk 
the company expects that international sales will continue to represent a significant percentage of its total sales  which expose it to currency exchange rate fluctuations 
since the revenues and expenses of the company s foreign operations are generally denominated in local currencies  exchange rate fluctuations between local currencies and the us dollar subject the company to currency exchange risks with respect to the results of its foreign operations to the extent it were unable to denominate its purchases or sales in us dollars or otherwise shift to its customers or suppliers the risk of currency exchange rate fluctuations 
the company currently does not engage in any significant currency hedging transactions 
fluctuations in exchange rates may affect the results of its international operations reported in us dollars and the value of such operations net assets reported in us dollars 
additionally  its competitive position may be affected by the relative strength of the currencies in countries where its products are sold 
the company cannot predict whether foreign currency exchange risks inherent in doing business in foreign countries will have a material adverse effect on its operations and financial results in the future 
because the company generally does not have long term contracts with its vendors  it may experience shortages of products that could harm its business and customer relationships 
the company generally does not have long term contracts or arrangements with any of its vendors that guarantee product availability 
the company cannot ensure that its vendors will meet its future requirements for timely delivery of products of sufficient quality or quantity 
any difficulties in the delivery of products could harm its relationships with customers and cause it to lose orders that could result in a material decrease in its revenues 
further  the company competes against certain of its vendors and its relationship with those vendors could be harmed as a result of this competition 
the recent outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome  or sars  or any other disease epidemic  may adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the outbreak of highly infectious epidemics in asia pacific  including sars and avian influenza  commonly known as asian bird flu  and concerns over its spread in asia pacific and elsewhere could have a negative impact on commerce  travel  and general economic and industry conditions 
asia pacific represented of the company s revenue in fiscal and it believe a significant percentage of its product purchases comes directly or indirectly from asia pacific 
given the importance of the asia pacific market to the company s business  it may be more exposed to this risk than the global economy generally 
for example  the sars outbreak could result in quarantines or closures of the company or its customers or suppliers facilities in asia pacific 
the sars outbreak may also adversely impact the company s ability to purchase goods from suppliers in asia pacific 
as a result of the sars outbreak  or any other disease epidemic  its business  financial condition  and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk risk management and market sensitive financial instruments the company s foreign denominated assets and liabilities are cash  accounts receivable  inventory and accounts payable  primarily in canada and member countries of the european community and  to a lesser extent  in asia pacific and latin america 
the company monitors its foreign exchange exposures and has entered into forward contracts to hedge significant transactions  however  this activity is infrequent 
in fiscal  the company entered into only one forward contract with an approximate value of  in fiscal  the company entered into two such transactions with a total value of approximately  other tools that may be used to manage foreign exchange exposures include the use of currency clauses in sales contracts and the use of local debt to offset asset exposures 
as discussed above  the company s debt financing  in part  varies with market rates exposing the company to the market risk from changes in interest rates 
certain operations  assets and liabilities of the company are denominated in foreign currencies subjecting the company to foreign currency exchange risk 
in order to provide the user of these financial statements guidance regarding the magnitude of these risks  the securities and exchange commission requires the company to provide certain quantitative disclosures based upon hypothetical assumptions 
specifically  these disclosures require the calculation of the effect of a increase in market interest rates and a uniform strengthening of the us dollar against foreign currencies on the reported net earnings and financial position of the company 
under these assumptions  additional interest expense  tax effected  would have lowered income by  in fiscal and increased the net loss by  in fiscal  respectively 
these amounts were determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rate increase on the company s variable rate outstanding borrowings 
had the us dollar strengthened against various foreign currencies  sales would have been lower by an estimated million in fiscal and million in fiscal total assets would have declined by million and millions  respectively  while the total liabilities would have decreased by million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
these amounts were determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical decrease in average foreign exchange rates against the us dollar on the sales  assets and liabilities of the company s international operations 
the interpretation and analysis of these disclosures should not be considered in isolation since such variances in interest rates and exchange rates would likely influence other economic factors 
such factors  which are not readily quantifiable  would likely also affect the company s operations
