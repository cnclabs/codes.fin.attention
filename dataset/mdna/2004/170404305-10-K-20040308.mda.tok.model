service revenues as a percentage of total revenues were  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we expect that service revenues will continue to represent over of our total revenues 

table of contents we sell our products through our direct sales force  and we augment our sales efforts through relationships with systems integrators  application service providers and technology vendors 
for the years ended december   and  revenues were derived from customer accounts in north america  europe and the rest of the world 
for the years ended december   and  international revenues were million  million and million or approximately  and of our total revenues  respectively 
we believe international revenues will continue to represent a significant portion of our total revenues in future periods 
a small number of customers account for a significant portion of our total revenues 
as a result  the loss or delay of individual orders or delays in the product implementations for a customer can have a material impact on our revenues 
we expect that revenues from a small number of customers will continue to account for a majority of our total quarterly revenues in the future 
customer concentration has declined over the past two years  but we expect that certain customers could each account for more than of our total revenues in future periods 
pricing pressure during the past year has intensified particularly with application products 
several of our competitors continue to aggressively price their products with large discounts in comparison to our prices 
over the past year  we have continued to see competitive pricing pressure 
our strategy is to continue to offer products with functionality different and superior to our competitors 
our international revenue growth rate has continued to outpace our united states revenue growth rate 
we believe this has occurred because the us economy has been weak compared to areas where we have an international presence and our leadership and market presence have been very strong internationally  particularly in the united kingdom 
the following table summarizes the revenues from customers in excess of of total revenues years ended december  the royal bank of scotland usaa hutchinson g lloyds tsb eds since our inception  we have incurred substantial research and development costs and have invested heavily in the expansion of our product development  sales  marketing and professional services organizations to build an infrastructure to support our long term growth strategy 
the number of our full time employees decreased to at december  from at december   representing a decrease of approximately 
the decrease was due to reductions in force that occurred during fiscal year we anticipate that our operating expenses will increase modestly during fiscal year when compared to fiscal year we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results should not be relied upon as indicative of future performance 
our prospects must be considered given the risks  expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in early stages of development  particularly companies in new and rapidly evolving businesses 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in addressing these risks and difficulties 
in addition  we may not achieve or maintain profitability in the future 

table of contents critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to estimates of percentage of completion on our service contracts  uncollectible receivables  valuation allowances  intangible assets  income taxes  restructuring costs and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition  including estimating the total estimated days to complete sales arrangements involving significant implementation or customization essential to the functionality of our product  estimating valuation allowances and accrued liabilities  specifically the allowance for doubtful accounts  and assessment of the probability of the outcome of our current litigation  accounting for income taxes  valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill  restructuring costs  and determining functional currencies for the purposes of consolidating our international operations 
revenue recognition 
we derive revenues from licenses of our software and related services  which include assistance in implementation  customization and integration  post contract customer support  training and consulting 
the amount and timing of our revenue is difficult to predict and any shortfall in revenue or delay in recognizing revenue could cause our operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter and could result in operating losses 
at the time of entering into a transaction  we assess whether any services included within the arrangement require us to perform significant implementation or customization essential to the functionality of our products 
for contracts involving significant implementation or customization essential to the functionality of our products  we recognize the license and professional consulting services revenues using the percentage of completion method using labor hours incurred as the measure of progress towards completion as prescribed by statement of position sop no 
 accounting for performance of construction type and certain product type contracts 
the progress toward completion is measured based on the go live date 
we define the go live date as the date the essential product functionality has been delivered or the application enters into a production environment or the point at which no significant additional chordiant supplied professional services resources are required 
estimates are subject to revisions as the contract progresses to completion 
we account for the change in estimate in the period the change was identified 
provisions for estimated contract losses are recognized in the period in which the loss becomes probable and can be reasonably estimated 
when we sell additional licenses related to the original licensing agreement  revenue is recognized either upon delivery if the project has reached the go live date  or if the project has not reached the go live date  revenue is recognized under the percentage of completion method 
we classify revenues from these arrangements as license and service revenues based upon the estimated fair value of each element 
on contracts for products not involving significant implementation or customization essential to the product functionality  we recognize license revenues when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the fee is 
table of contents fixed or determinable  collection of the fee is probable and delivery has occurred as prescribed by sop no 
 software revenue recognition 
we assess collection based on a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and the credit worthiness of the customer 
we generally do not request collateral from our customers 
if we determine that collection of a fee is not probable  we defer the fee and recognize revenue at the time collection becomes probable  which is generally upon receipt of cash 
for arrangements with multiple elements  we recognize revenue for services and post contract customer support based upon vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value of the respective elements 
vsoe of fair value for the services element is based upon the standard hourly rates we charge for the services when such services are sold separately 
vsoe of fair value for annual post contract customer support is established with the optional substantive stated future renewal rates included in the contracts 
when contracts contain multiple elements  and vsoe of fair value exists for all undelivered elements  we account for the delivered elements  principally the license portion  based upon the residual method as prescribed by sop no 
 modification of sop no 
with respect to certain transactions 
in situations in which we are obligated to provide unspecified additional software products in the future  we recognize revenue as a subscription ratably over the term of the commitment period 
for all sales we use either a signed license agreement or a binding purchase order as evidence of an arrangement 
sales through our third party systems integrators are evidenced by a master agreement governing the relationship together with binding purchase orders on a transaction by transaction basis 
revenues from reseller arrangements are recognized on the sell through method  when the reseller reports to us the sale of our software products to end users 
our agreements with customers and resellers do not contain product return rights 
we recognize revenue for post contract customer support ratably over the support period which ranges from one to three years 
our training and consulting services revenues are recognized as such services are performed 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we must make estimates of the uncollectability of our accounts receivables 
we specifically analyze accounts receivable and analyze historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
generally  we require no collateral from our customers 
our accounts receivable balance was million  net of allowance for doubtful accounts of million as of december  our accounts receivable balance was million  net of allowance for doubtful accounts of million as of december  if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances would be required 
accounting for income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
we have recorded a valuation allowance of million as of december   due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of certain net operating losses carried forward and foreign tax credits 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods we may need to establish an additional valuation allowance which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 

table of contents valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill 
we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles and long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
furthermore  we assess the impairment of goodwill annually 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  market capitalization relative to net book value  and a current expectation that  more likely than not  a long lived asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life 
when one or more of the above indicators of impairment occurs we estimate the value of long lived assets and intangible assets to determine whether there is an impairment 
we measure any impairment based on the projected discounted cash flow method  which requires us to make several estimates including the estimated cash flows associated with the asset  the period over which these cash flows will be generated and a discount rate commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
these estimates are subjective and if we made different estimates  it could materially impact the estimated fair value of these assets and the conclusions we reached regarding an impairment 
to date  we have not identified any triggering events which would require us to perform this analysis 
we are required to perform an impairment review of our goodwill balance on at least an annual basis 
this impairment review involves a two step process as follows step we compare the fair value of our reporting units to the carrying value  including goodwill  of each of those units 
for each reporting unit where the carrying value  including goodwill  exceeds the unit s fair value  we proceed on to step if a unit s fair value exceeds the carrying value  no further work is performed and no impairment charge is necessary 
step we perform an allocation of the fair value of the reporting unit to our identifiable tangible and non goodwill intangible assets and liabilities 
this derives an implied fair value for the reporting unit s goodwill 
we then compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill is greater than the implied fair value of its goodwill  an impairment charge would be recognized for the excess 
we determined that we have one reporting unit 
we completed our annual goodwill impairment review during the fourth quarter of and performed step of the goodwill impairment analysis required by statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  and concluded that goodwill was not impaired as of december  using the methodology described above 
accordingly  step was not performed 
we will continue to test for impairment on an annual basis and on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our reporting units below their carrying amount 
restructuring costs 
during fiscal years and  we implemented cost reduction plans as part of our continued effort to streamline our operations to reduce ongoing operating expenses 
these plans resulted in restructuring charges related to  among others  the consolidation of excess facilities 
these charges relate to facilities and portions of facilities we no longer utilize and either seek to terminate early or sublease 
lease termination costs for the abandoned facilities were estimated for the remaining lease obligations and brokerage fees offset by estimated sublease income 
estimates related to sublease costs and income are based on 
table of contents assumptions regarding the period required to locate and contract with suitable sub lessees and sublease rates which can be achieved using market trend information analyses provided by a commercial real estate brokerage retained by us 
each reporting period we review these estimates and to the extent that these assumptions change due to continued negotiations with landlords or changes in the market  the ultimate restructuring expenses for these abandoned facilities could vary by material amounts 
determining functional currencies for the purpose of consolidation 
we have several foreign subsidiaries that together account for approximately of our revenues  of our assets and of our total liabilities as of december  in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to translate the financial statements of the foreign subsidiaries from the currency in which they keep their accounting records  generally the local currency  into united states dollars 
this process results in exchange gains and losses which  under the relevant accounting guidance are either included within the statement of operations or as a separate part of our net equity under the caption cumulative translation adjustment 
under the relevant accounting guidance the treatment of these translation gains or losses is dependent upon our management s determination of the functional currency of each subsidiary 
the functional currency is determined based on management s judgment and involves consideration of all relevant economic facts and circumstances affecting the subsidiary 
generally  the currency in which the subsidiary transacts a majority of its transactions  including billings  financing  payroll and other expenditures would be considered the functional currency but any dependency upon the parent and the nature of the subsidiary s operations must also be considered 
if any subsidiary s functional currency were deemed to be the local currency  then any gain or loss associated with the translation of that subsidiary s financial statements would be included in cumulative translation adjustments 
however  if the functional currency were deemed to be the united states dollar then any gain or loss associated with the translation of these financial statements would be included within our statement of operations 
if we dispose of any of our subsidiaries  any cumulative translation gains or losses would be realized into our statement of operations 
if we determine that there has been a change in the functional currency of a subsidiary to the united states dollar  any translation gains or losses arising after the date of change would be included within our statement of operations 
based on our assessment of the factors discussed above  we consider the relevant subsidiary s local currency to be the functional currency for each of our international subsidiaries 
accordingly  we had cumulative translation gains of approximately million and million  which were included as part of accumulated other comprehensive income within our balance sheet at december  and  respectively 
the magnitude of these gains or losses is dependent upon movements in the exchange rates of the foreign currencies in which we transact business against the united states dollar 
these currencies include the united kingdom pound sterling  the euro and australian and canadian dollars 
any future translation gains or losses could be significantly higher than those noted in each of these years 
in addition  if we determine that a change in the functional currency of one of our subsidiaries has occurred at any point in time we would be required to include any translation gains or losses from the date of change in our statement of operations 
related party transactions during the first quarter of  two of our executives exercised  stock options in exchange for notes receivable the notes of  the notes were full recourse collateralized by the underlying stock 
the notes were due in february and march and accrued interest between and per annum  which was deemed market rates for the individuals 
both notes were paid in full during the quarter ended march  during  we issued to one of our executives  shares of common stock subject to a right of repurchase in exchange for a note receivable the note of  the note was collateralized by the 
table of contents underlying stock and bore interest at a rate of 
in  we repurchased a total of  unvested shares at the original exercise price  cancelled the repurchased shares and forgave the remaining balance of the note 
a compensation expense of  was recorded as of december  in  two former executives exercised  stock options covering an aggregate of  shares of our common stock in exchange for notes receivables in the amount of  and  the notes were full recourse collateralized by the underlying stock 
the notes were assessed by us to be fully collectible  based on our understanding of the financial standing of the individuals 
we perform periodic reviews of the recoverability of our outstanding notes receivables 
in the fourth quarter of  we determined that collection of these two notes was no longer probable although we would still actively pursue collection of both notes 
as a result  we recorded an impairment charge of  as stock compensation expense 
in december  we were successful in obtaining a payment of  from one former executive for his outstanding note receivable plus interest 
the principal portion was  of the total payment and was recorded as a credit to compensation expense

total license revenues decreased to approximately million for the year ended december  from million  or approximately  for the year ended december  license revenues for enterprise solutions decreased to approximately million for the year ended december  from million  or approximately  for the year ended december  license revenues for application products decreased to approximately million for the year ended december  from million  or approximately  for the year ended december  the overall license revenues decrease was primarily due to the lack of growth in the number of product implementations and smaller aggregate dollar sales by new and existing customers as they reduced or delayed spending 

table of contents service 
total service revenues  which include reimbursement of out of pocket expenses  increased to approximately million for the year ended december  from million  or approximately  for the year ended december  service revenues for enterprise solutions increased to approximately million for the year ended december  from million  or approximately  for the year ended december  service revenues for application products decreased to approximately million for the year ended december  from million  or approximately  for the year ended december  the overall service revenues increase was primarily due to a continuation in large customer implementations as well as maintenance  support and consulting revenues associated with license agreements 
reimbursement of out of pocket expenses which is included in total service revenues increased to million for the year ended december  from million  or approximately  for the year ended december  cost of revenues license 
cost of license revenues decreased to million for the year ended december  from million  or approximately  for the year ended december  license gross margins were approximately for both years ended december  and  respectively 
the aggregate cost of license revenues is in line with the decrease in aggregate license revenues 
we expect cost of license revenues to remain in the range of four to six percent of license revenues 
service 
cost of service revenues decreased to million for the year ended december  from million  or approximately  for the year ended december  these costs resulted in service gross margins of and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
service gross margins improved mainly as the result of combined effects of restructuring actions implemented  increased efficiencies and reduced spending 
the decrease in these expenses was mainly attributable to a decrease of million in personnel related expenses due to a decrease in headcount  a decrease of million in third party consulting services and a decrease of million in office  facilities  depreciation and other related expenses due to restructuring actions implemented 
stock based compensation 
stock based compensation included in cost of revenues was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in stock based compensation is mainly due to the increase in the company s stock price during fiscal year which affects the variable accounting calculation to which restricted stock and some outstanding stock options are subject 
operating expenses sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses decreased to million for the year ended december  from million  or approximately  for the year ended december  the decrease in these expenses was mainly attributable to a decrease of million in personnel related expenses due to a decrease in headcount and commission expenses  a decrease of million in marketing programs  trade shows and professional services and a decrease of approximately million in office  facilities  depreciation and other allocated expenses due to lower headcount as a percentage of the company s overall headcount as a result of restructuring actions implemented 
research and development 
research and development expenses decreased to million for the year ended december  from million  or approximately  for the year ended december  the decrease in these expenses was mainly attributable to a decrease of million in personnel related expenses due to a decrease in headcount and bonus expenses and a decrease of approximately million in overhead allocations  office  facilities and depreciation related expenses due to lower headcount as a percentage of the company s overall headcount as a result of restructuring actions implemented 

table of contents general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses decreased to million for the year ended december  from million  or approximately  for the year ended december  the decrease in these expenses was mainly attributable to a decrease of million in personnel related expenses due to a decrease in headcount  a decrease of million in office  facilities and depreciation related expenses due to restructuring actions implemented and a decrease of million in professional services and other expenses 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase of million in allocated expenses due to lower headcounts in other operating functions of the company as a result of restructuring actions implemented 
stock based compensation expense 
we recorded amortization of stock based compensation expense of million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  in relation to options granted prior to our initial public offering with an exercise price lower than the deemed fair market value of the underlying common stock at the date of issuance 
at december   approximately million of unearned stock based compensation remained to be amortized 
on august   we implemented a stock option exchange program the program 
under the program  holders of outstanding options with an exercise price of or greater per share the eligible options were given the choice of retaining these options or canceling the options in exchange for i restricted shares of common stock restricted stock to be issued as soon as possible after the expiration of the program period and or ii replacement options issuable six months and one day following the cancellation of the program replacement options at the closing market price on that date 
the program  as amended  also provided our chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the company  if they participated in the program  with a separate restricted stock agreement the ceo and cfo agreement  which includes specific vesting provisions based on achieving certain financial performance goals 
there were  options subject to the program  which closed on october  employees tendered  stock options and received  shares of restricted stock pursuant to the program 
in addition  employees tendered  stock options  which were cancelled and to the extent an employee was still with the company were replaced six months and one day following the expiration of the program 
the tendered stock options represented approximately of our total outstanding stock options as of the expiration date of the program 
in addition  in october  we issued  shares of restricted stock to our employees residing in the united kingdom  including to our chief executive officer 
the restricted stock issued to our chief executive officer is subject to the ceo and cfo agreement 
in november  our then acting chief financial officer left our employ and  as a result  the company is no longer subject to stock based compensation expense related to the vesting of his restricted stock 
in connection with the termination  we accelerated the vesting of  shares of restricted stock resulting in a compensation expense of million 
the program has been accounted for under the guidance of emerging issues task force issue no 
 issues related to the accounting for stock compensation under apb opinion no 
 and interpretation no 
 accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation an interpretation of apb opinion no 
because we offered to cancel existing fixed stock options in exchange for a grant of restricted stock within six months of the cancellation date of the existing options  the eligible options became subject to variable accounting treatment at the commencement date of the program 
variable accounting ceased upon cancellation of the tendered options 
a total of  eligible options that were not tendered will remain subject to variable accounting 
the remaining unearned stock based compensation expense amounted to approximately million at december  for the year ended december   million was recorded as stock based compensation expense 
the compensation expense on variable options will be re measured at the end of each operating period until the options are exercised  forfeited or have expired 
depending upon movements in the market value of our common stock  this accounting treatment may result in significant additional stock based compensation charges in future periods 
as part of the program implemented in  we issued  replacement options at the current market value of per share on april  to employees 

table of contents the related functional breakdown of total stock based compensation is outlined below in thousands years ended december  cost of service revenues sales and marketing research and development general and administrative total in september  we issued warrants to accenture plc to purchase up to  shares of our common stock subject to performance based vesting 
no warrants have vested through december  on august   we entered into an agreement with ibm to market our products and services to customers 
we issued a fully vested and exercisable warrant to purchase up to  shares of common stock in connection with this agreement 
the exercise price is set at per share 
the warrants expire on august  the warrants were valued at million based on the black scholes model using the following assumptions volatility  risk free rate and fair market value of our common stock at the grant date 
the value of the warrants was recorded as a prepaid expense and was offset against revenue during upon the completion of an ibm revenue generating transaction 
amortization of intangibles 
amortization of intangible assets for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december  the amortization expense in fiscal year included million attributable to the acquisition of ondemand in april and million attributable to the acquisition of prime response in march the remaining balance of million is related to the acquisitions of certain assets from actionpoint and asp outfitter in may and technology from eds in december there was no amortization of goodwill in fiscal years or as a result of our adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  effective january  we expect amortization expense on purchased intangible assets to be million in fiscal year and million in fiscal year  at which time existing purchased intangible assets will be fully amortized 
restructuring costs 
during fiscal years and  several areas of the company were restructured to reduce expenses and improve efficiency to achieve cash flow and profitability breakeven in the near future 
this restructuring program included a worldwide workforce reduction and consolidation of excess facilities and certain business functions 
as part of the fiscal year restructuring  we entered into an agreement with an independent contracting company with global technical resources and an operations center in bangalore  india 
the agreement provides for the independent contractor  at our direction  to attract  train  assimilate and retain sufficient highly qualified personnel to perform technical support and certain sustaining engineering functions 
in fiscal year  we plan to significantly increase the size of this organization and expand its scope as employee reductions occur throughout the year 
severance costs associated with the fourth quarter of fiscal year employee reductions were accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for post employment benefits 
other one time benefit arrangements are accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
workforce reduction 
the restructuring program resulted in the reduction of regular employees and regular employees during the years ended december  and  respectively 
all areas of the company were affected by this restructuring 
we recorded a total workforce reduction expense relating to severance and benefits of approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 

table of contents consolidation of excess facilities 
we accrued for lease costs of million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively  pertaining to the estimated future obligations for non cancelable lease payments for the consolidation of excess facilities relating to lease terminations and non cancelable lease costs 
this expense included estimated sub lease income based on current comparable rates for leases in the respective markets 
if facilities rental rates continue to decrease in these markets or if it takes longer than expected to sublease these facilities  the maximum amount by which the actual loss could exceed the original estimate is approximately million 
a summary of the restructuring expense and other special charges is outlined as follows in thousands facilities severance and benefits total reserve balance at december  total charge provision adjustment non cash cash paid reserve balance at december  provision adjustment relates to a change in estimate 
amounts related to the net lease expenses due to the consolidation of facilities will be paid over the lease terms through fiscal year as of december   million related to the restructuring reserve remains outstanding and is included in the accrued expenses line item on the balance sheet 
the remaining accrual primarily relates to the termination and or sublease of our excess facilities and to severance and other benefits for impacted employees which we expect to pay out by december  purchased in process research and development 
in process research and development expense represents acquired technology that  on the date of acquisition  had not achieved technological feasibility and did not have an alternative future use  based on the state of development 
because the product under development may not achieve commercial viability  the amount of acquired in process research and development was immediately expensed 
the nature of the efforts required to develop the purchased in process research and development into a commercially viable product principally relate to the completion of all planning  designing  prototyping  verification and testing activities that are necessary to establish that the product can be produced to meet its designed specifications  including functions  features and technical performance requirements 
during  we expensed million related to acquired in process technology attributable to the acquisition of ondemand 
there was no purchased in process research and development expense in fiscal year the value of the purchased in process research and development was determined by estimating the projected net cash flows related to the product  determined based upon our estimates of costs to complete the development of the technology and the future revenue to be earned upon commercialization of the products

our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we have not used derivative financial instruments to hedge our investment portfolio

we protect and preserve invested funds by limiting default  market and reinvestment risk 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carries a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities  which have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
foreign currency risk 
international revenues from our foreign subsidiaries accounted for approximately of total revenues during international sales are made mostly from our foreign sales subsidiaries in their respective countries and are typically denominated in the local currency of each country 
these subsidiaries also incur most of their expenses in the local currency 
accordingly  all foreign subsidiaries use the local currency as their functional currency 
additionally  one of our foreign subsidiaries holds cash equivalent investments in currencies other than their respective local currency 
such holdings increase our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
as exchange rates vary  the holdings may magnify foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations or upon translation adversely impact overall expected profitability through foreign currency losses incurred upon the sale or maturity of the investments 
foreign currency losses  net for the year ended december  was less than million 
our international business is subject to risks  including  but not limited to changing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  other regulations and restrictions  and foreign exchange rate volatility when compared to the united states 
accordingly  our future results could be materially adversely impacted by changes in these or other factors
