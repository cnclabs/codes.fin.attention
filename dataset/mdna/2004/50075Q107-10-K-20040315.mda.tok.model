shopping center venture in july  the company formed a joint venture with tower fund tower  for the purpose of acquiring real estate assets 
tower is a commingled separate account available through annuity contracts of metropolitan life insurance company new york  new york and managed by ssr realty advisors 
the company will administer the day to day affairs of the joint venture which is owned by tower and by the company 
the joint venture owns four shopping centers comprising  square feet in vestal  new york 
the joint venture properties are all occupied and were purchased by the joint venture for million plus transaction costs 
the company s equity contribution to the joint venture is approximately million including transaction costs 
the company accounts for its investments in unconsolidated affiliates using the equity method 
industry factors ownership of shopping centers involves risks arising from changes in economic conditions  generally  and in the real estate market specifically  as well as risks which result from property specific factors such as the failure or inability to make needed capital improvements  competition  reductions in revenue arising from decreased occupancy or reductions in the level of rents obtainable  and factors which increase the cost of operating  financing and refinancing properties such as escalating interest rates and wage rates  increased taxes  fuel costs and other operating expenses and casualties 
all of these kinds of risks can result in reduced net operating revenues available for distribution 
the company s ability to manage the properties effectively notwithstanding such risks and economic conditions will affect the funds available for distribution 
the results of operations of the company also depend upon the availability of suitable opportunities for investment and reinvestment of the company s excess cash and on the yields available from time to time on real estate investments  which in turn depend to a large extent on the type of investment involved  prevailing interest rates  the nature and geographical location of the property  competition  and other factors  none of which can be predicted with certainty 
material tenants the company relies on major tenants to pay rent  and their inability to pay rent may substantially reduce the company s net income and cash available for distributions to shareholders 
the company s four largest tenants are wal mart stores  inc wal mart  ahold usa  inc 
ahold  tjx companies  inc 
tjx  and kmart corporation kmart 
as of december   wal mart represented approximately of the company s annualized minimum rents  ahold represented of the company s annualized minimum rents  tjx represented of the company s annualized minimum rents  and kmart represented of the company s annualized minimum rents 
as of december   no other tenant would have represented more than of the aggregate annualized minimum rents of the company s shopping centers 
kmart emerged from bankruptcy on may  as of december   kmart has not announced the closing of any of the company s six kmart stores 
however  there is no guarantee that kmart will not announce any future store closings 
bankrupt tenants the company s business  results of operations and financial condition would be materially adversely affected if a significant number of tenants at the shopping centers fail to meet their lease obligations  including the obligation  in certain cases to pay a portion of increases in the company s operating expenses 
in the event of a default by a tenant  the company may experience delays in enforcing its rights as landlord and may incur substantial costs in protecting its investment 
if a tenant seeks protection under the bankruptcy laws  the lease may be terminated or rejected in which case the amount of rent the company is able to collect will be substantially reduced and in some cases the company may not collect any rent 
in addition  it is likely the company would not be able to recover any unamortized deferred costs related to such tenant 
accordingly  the bankruptcy or insolvency of one or more major tenants or a number of other tenants may materially adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
competition the company s competitors for acceptable investments include private investors  insurance companies  pension funds  and other reit s which may have investment objectives similar to the company s and some of which have greater financial resources than the company s 
all of the shopping centers are located in areas which have shopping centers and other retail facilities 
generally  there are other retail properties within a five mile radius of a shopping center 
the amount of rentable retail space in the vicinity of the company s shopping centers could have a material adverse effect on the amount of rent charged by the company and on the company s ability to rent vacant space and or renew leases of such shopping centers 
there are numerous commercial developers  real estate companies  and major retailers that compete with the company in seeking land for development  properties for acquisition and tenants for properties  some of which may have greater financial resources than the company and more operating or development experience than that of the company 
there are numerous shopping facilities that compete with the company s shopping centers in attracting retailers to lease space 
in addition  retailers at the shopping centers may face increasing competition from the internet  outlet malls  discount shopping clubs  catalog companies  direct mail  telemarketing  and home shopping tv 
the company is not aware of statistics which would allow the company to determine its position relative to all of the company s competitors in the ownership and operation of shopping centers 
real estate and other considerations as an owner and developer of real estate  the company is subject to risks arising in connection with such activities and with the underlying real estate  including unknown deficiencies of and the ability to successfully develop or manage recently acquired shopping centers  poor economic conditions in those areas where shopping centers are located  defaults on tenant leases or non renewal of leases  tenant bankruptcies  competition  liquidity of real estate  inability to rent vacant space  failure to generate sufficient income to meet operating expenses  including debt service  capital expenditures and tenant improvements  balloon payments on debt  environmental matters  financing availability  financial and operating restrictions imposed by certain financing arrangements  defaults under and failure to repay borrowings  fluctuations in interest rates  changes in real estate and zoning laws  cost overruns  delays  and other risks of development activities 
the success of the company also depends upon certain key personnel  its ability to maintain its qualification as a reit and trends in the national and local economy  including income tax laws  governmental regulations and legislation  and population trends 
employees as of december   the company had full and part time employees 
none of the company s employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement and the company has experienced no labor related work stoppages 
the company considers its relations with its personnel to be good 
environmental regulations various federal  state  and local laws and regulations subject property owners or operators to liability for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances located on or in the property 
these laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator responsible for or even knew of the presence of such substances 
the presence of or failure to properly remediate hazardous or toxic substances such as toxic mold may adversely affect our ability to rent  sell  or borrow against contaminated property 
payment of such costs and expenses could adversely affect our ability to make distributions or payments to our investors 
tax status the company expects to continue to qualify as a reit 
a trust which qualifies as a reit is required to distribute at least of ordinary taxable income for a taxable year and can deduct distributions paid to shareholders of beneficial interest with respect to such taxable year from taxable income 
a reit is not required to distribute capital gain income but to the extent it does not  it must pay the applicable capital gain income tax unless it has ordinary losses to offset such capital gain income 
the company has historically distributed to the company s shareholders capital gain income arising from principal repayments on the company s mortgage notes receivable which are being reported on the installment method for tax purposes 
the taxation of the company and its shareholders could change if relevant federal  state or local income tax law provisions change
