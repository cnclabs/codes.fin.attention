relationship with meristar hospitality we manage all of the properties owned by meristar hospitality  a real estate investment trust  or reit 
as of december   meristar hospitality owned properties 
our relationship with meristar hospitality is governed in part by an intercompany agreement 
that agreement provides each of us the right to participate in certain transactions entered into by the other company 
the intercompany agreement provides meristar hospitality with the right of first refusal with respect to some of our hotel real estate opportunities and it also provides us with a right of first refusal with respect to some of meristar hospitality s hotel management opportunities  excluding hotels that meristar hospitality elects to have managed by a hotel brand 
historically  we have had close operating  management and governance relationships with meristar hospitality 
we manage all of meristar hospitality s hotel properties under long term management contracts and have  in the past  shared several key management personnel and board members with meristar hospitality 
due to the merger between meristar and interstate and our resulting increased scale  we and meristar hospitality have split the management teams of the two companies although paul w

insurance and risk management through our subsidiary  northridge insurance company  we offer some of our managed hotels reinsurance and risk management services 
we provide insurance coverage through northridge insurance to our managed hotels under the terms of each individual management agreement 
for more information about northridge insurance  please see business insurance and risk management 
we include northridge insurance in our hotel management segment 
all accounts of northridge insurance are classified with assets and liabilities of a similar nature in our consolidated balance sheets 
amounts restricted due to statutory requirements consist of cash and cash equivalents of  at december  and  at december  these amounts are reflected as restricted cash in our consolidated balance sheets 
our consolidated statements of operations include the insurance revenue earned and related insurance expenses incurred by northridge insurance 
the insurance revenue earned by northridge insurance is included in other revenues in our consolidated statements of operations  and amounted to  for the year ended december   and  for the year ended december   after intercompany eliminations 
insurance revenues are earned through reinsurance premiums  direct premiums written and reinsurance premiums ceded 
reinsurance premiums are recognized when individual policies are written and any unearned portions of the premium are recognized to account for the unexpired term of the policy  on an as reported basis 
direct premiums written are recognized in accordance with the underlying policy  and reinsurance premiums ceded are recognized on a pro rata basis over the life of the related policies 
unearned premiums represent the portion of premiums applicable to the unexpired term of policies in force 
we make a provision for reported claims and claims settlement expense at each balance sheet date 
those losses are based on management s estimate of the ultimate cost of settlement of claims and historical loss rates 
accrued claims liabilities are carried at present value without discounting since the contracts are of a short duration and discounting would not be significant 
actual liabilities may differ from estimated amounts 
any changes in estimated losses and settlements are reflected in current earnings 
recent events public equity offering on november   in a public equity offering  we offered  shares of our common stock  par value per share  at a price of per share 
an additional  shares of common stock were offered by our principal investor group 
on december   the underwriters exercised their over allotment option for an additional  shares 
our total proceeds from this equity offering  prior to deducting expenses  amounted to approximately  after the underwriting discount 
we did not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares by the principal investor group 
the total proceeds were used to repay indebtedness under our senior credit facility 
in connection with the repayment of  of our senior credit facility  we wrote off approximately of unamortized deferred financing costs associated with the senior credit facility 
this write off is included in interest expense on our statement of operations 
terminations of management agreements in conjunction with the merger of meristar and interstate in  we assigned estimated fair values to each of the management agreements considered purchased by interstate  the accounting acquiror in the merger 
these assigned fair values are included as intangible assets on our balance sheet 
we are amortizing these intangible assets over the terms of the management agreements 
if one of these management agreements is terminated prior to its full term  for example  due to the sale of a hotel or an owner choosing to exercise a termination clause  we will record a loss on the write off of the related unamortized intangible asset value 
the weaker hotel operating environment has caused some owners of our managed hotels to sell hotels to provide the owners with additional liquidity 
when a hotel is sold  we are usually replaced as the hotel s manager 
since january   meristar hospitality has sold hotels which were managed by us  of which we no longer manage for the subsequent owner 
meristar hospitality has announced plans to sell an additional of its properties  all of which we currently manage 
those hotels  together with the sold hotels we no longer manage  accounted for  or  of our revenues for the year ended december   and  or  of our revenues for the year ended december  other owners may also dispose of assets 
except with respect to three hotels currently owned by meristar hospitality  if we are terminated as manager upon the sale of one of meristar hospitality s hotels  we will generally receive a termination fee equal to the present value of remaining payments as defined in the management agreement 
any termination fee will be paid in thirty equal monthly installments  without interest  commencing the month following the termination 
meristar hospitality will be able to credit against any termination payments the present value of projected fees  as defined in the management agreements  including  without limitation  the present value of any projected fees of any management agreements executed during the thirty month period over which payments are made 
net of such offsets  as of december   we would be entitled to receive approximately  of total termination fees with respect to the termination of management agreements for the hotels sold by meristar hospitality that we no longer manage and the remaining hotels meristar hospitality intends to sell 
our management agreements with other owners generally have limited or no termination fees due to us if our management agreement is terminated upon the sale of the hotel 
we record termination fees as management fee revenue as they are earned 
during  meristar hospitality disposed of hotels  and we wrote off  of intangible assets associated with the management agreements for those properties 
assuming that all remaining hotels are sold during  we would expect to write off an additional approximate  in intangible assets during on july   cnl hospitality acquired rfs hotel investors  inc we managed of the former rfs hotel properties 
in october  we entered into an agreement with cnl to manage of those hotels 
cnl has terminated our management agreements for the remaining former rfs properties 
the majority of these agreements were terminated in the fourth quarter of  and the remainder were terminated by january  total management fees from the properties totaled approximately  or of our total management fees for the year ended december   and or of total management fees  for the year ended december   representing management fees starting from july   the date of the merger between meristar and interstate 
we did not receive any termination fees with respect to the management agreements being terminated by cnl also  our management agreements with meristar hospitality and many other owners contain performance standards 
those standards generally require the hotel to meet certain relative or absolute financial performance levels  often in comparison to budgeted amounts 
we generally have a period to cure any performance standards we do not meet 
in the event the hotel does not meet those performance standards and we do not cure within the period specified in the management contract  the hotel s owner may have a right to terminate our management contract 
the termination of management contracts as a result of hotel dispositions or our failure to meet performance standards would have an adverse effect on our revenues 
meristar hospitality may also terminate a management agreement if certain performance standards at the hotel are not met in consecutive calendar years on july   meristar assigned the leases of hotels to a subsidiary of winston hotels  inc under a provision of the reit modernization act that allows reits to recognize the revenues and expenses of their hotels through taxable subsidiaries or lease them to taxable subsidiaries 
as part of this agreement  we had continued to operate of winston s properties 
after one year  winston had the option to terminate the management contracts and during april notified us of its intention to do so and as of june  we ceased management 
these contracts accounted for approximately of revenue  or of our total revenues  for the year ended december   and  or of our total revenues  for the year ended december  in connection with the termination of the winston contracts  we wrote off of unamortized management contract costs during the second quarter of this amount is included in asset impairments and write offs in our statement of operations 
insurance matters as part of our management agreement services to a hotel owner  we generally obtain casualty workers compensation and liability insurance coverages for the hotel 
in december  one of the carriers we used to obtain casualty insurance coverages was downgraded significantly by rating agencies 
in january  we negotiated a transfer of that carrier s current policies to a new carrier 
we are working with the prior carrier to facilitate a timely and efficient close out of the claims outstanding under the prior carrier s casualty policies 
the prior carrier has primary responsibility for settling those claims from its assets 
if the prior carrier s assets are not sufficient to settle these outstanding claims  and the claims exceed amounts available under state guaranty funds  we may be required to settle those claims 
although we are indemnified under our management agreements for such amounts  we would be responsible contractually for claims in historical periods when we leased in addition to managed certain hotels 
based on the information currently available  we believe the ultimate resolution of this situation will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
critical accounting policies and estimates accounting estimates are an integral part of the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and our financial reporting process and are based on our current judgments 
certain accounting estimates are particularly sensitive because of their significance to our consolidated financial statements and because of the possibility that future events affecting them may differ markedly from our current judgments 
the most significant accounting policies affecting our consolidated financial statements relate to the evaluation of impairment of certain long lived assets and intangible assets with determinable lives  the evaluation of impairment of goodwill  estimation of valuation allowances  specifically those related to income taxes and allowance for doubtful accounts  and revenue recognition 
impairment of long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values of long lived assets which include our intangible assets with determinable useful lives may be impaired  we perform an analysis to determine the recoverability of the asset s carrying value 
we make estimates of the undiscounted cash flows from the expected future operations of the asset 
if the analysis indicates that the carrying value is not recoverable from future cash flows  the asset is written down to estimated fair value and an impairment loss is recognized 
any impairment losses are recorded as operating expenses 
we review long lived assets for impairment when one or more of the following events have occurred current or immediate short term future twelve months projected cash flows are significantly less than the most recent historical cash flows  a significant loss of management contracts without the realistic expectation of a replacement  the unplanned departure of an executive officer or other key personnel  which could adversely affect our ability to maintain our competitive position and manage future growth  a significant adverse change in legal factors or an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  which could affect the value of the goodwill or other long lived assets  or events that could cause significant adverse changes and uncertainty in business and leisure travel patterns 
during  we wrote off  of unamortized management contract costs relating to terminated contracts 
of this  related to the termination of contracts with respect to the winston hotels   related to the properties sold by meristar hospitality  and related to other terminated contracts during the year 
impairment of goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
 annually  or as circumstances warrant  we perform an analysis to determine whether the goodwill carrying value has been impaired 
to test goodwill for impairment  we perform an analysis to compare the fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill is assigned to the carrying value of the reporting unit 
we make estimates of the discounted cash flows from the expected future operations of the reporting unit 
if the analysis indicates that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value  we do an analysis to compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
the implied fair value of the goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all the assets and liabilities of that unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination 
the excess of the fair value of reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of the goodwill 
if the implied fair value of the goodwill is less than the carrying value  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
any impairment losses are recorded as operating expenses 
we did not recognize any impairment losses for goodwill in or valuation allowances we use our judgment in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities  and any valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets 
at december   we have recorded a million valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
this is an allowance against some  but not all  of our recorded deferred tax assets 
we have considered estimated future taxable income and prudent and feasible ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
our estimates of taxable income require us to make assumptions about various factors that affect our operating results  such as economic conditions  consumer demand  competition and other factors 
our actual results may differ from these estimates 
based on actual results or a revision in future estimates  we might determine that we would not be able to realize additional portions of our net deferred tax assets in the future  if that occurred  we would record a charge to the income tax provision in that period 
the utilization of our net operating loss carryforwards will be limited by the tax provisions of the internal revenue code 
the valuation allowance we recorded included the effect of the limitations on our deferred tax assets arising from net operating loss carryforwards 
we record an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable based on our judgment in determining the ability and willingness of hotel owners to make required payments 
our judgments in determining customer ability and willingness to pay are based on past experience with hotel owners and our assessment of the current and future operating environments for hotel owners 
if a customer s financial condition deteriorates or a management contract is terminated in the future  this could decrease a hotel owner s ability or obligation to make payments 
if that occurred  we might have to make additional allowances  which could reduce our earnings 
revenue recognition we earn revenue from hotel management contracts and related services  corporate housing operations and operations from our wholly owned hotel 
our management and other fees consist of base and incentive management fees received from third party owners of hotel properties and fees for other related services we provide 
through the second quarter of  we had recorded incentive management fees in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  and method no 
of eitf topic no 
d  accounting for management fees based on a formula in which incentive management fees are accrued as earned based on the profitability of the hotel  subject to the specific terms of each individual management agreement 
the application of method no 
resulted in the accrual of incentive management fees during interim reporting periods throughout the annual measurement period 
the accrual would be reduced or eliminated in subsequent interim reporting periods if the profitability of the hotel missed performance thresholds later in the annual measurement period 
in the third quarter of  with an effective date of january   we began recording the incentive management fees in the period that it is certain the incentive management fees are earned  which for annual incentive fee measurements is typically in the last month of the annual contract period 
this newly adopted accounting principle is preferable because the new method eliminates the potential that incentive management fee revenue will be recognized in one interim reporting period and reduced or eliminated in a future interim reporting period 
this methodology is designated as method no 
in eitf topic no 
d method no 
is the securities and exchange commission staff s preferred method of accounting for incentive management fees 
non gaap financial measures adjusted ebitda represents earnings losses before interest  income tax expense benefit  depreciation and amortization and equity in earnings losses of affiliates 
we use adjusted ebitda as a measure of operating performance 
adjusted ebitda should not be considered as an alternative to net income under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america for purposes of evaluating our results of operations  and does not represent cash flow from operations as defined by generally accepted accounting principles and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund all cash flow needs 
we believe adjusted ebitda is useful to an investor in evaluating our operating performance because a significant portion of our assets consists of intangible assets 
of those intangible assets  our management contracts are amortized over their remaining terms  and  in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  those assets are subject to straight line amortization 
because depreciation and amortization are non cash items  we believe that presentation of adjusted ebitda is a useful supplemental measure of our operating performance  adjusted ebitda is widely used in the hotel management industry to measure operating performance without regard to items such as depreciation and amortization  and we believe adjusted ebitda helps investors meaningfully evaluate and compare the results of our operations from period to period by removing the impact of our asset base primarily depreciation and amortization from our operating results 
our management uses adjusted ebitda as a measurement of operating performance because it assists us in comparing our operating performance on a consistent basis as it removes the impact of our asset base primarily depreciation and amortization from our operating results  in presentations to our board of directors to enable it to have the same measurement of operating performance used by management  for planning purposes  including the preparation of our annual operating budget  for compensation purposes  including the basis for bonuses and other incentives for certain employees  as a valuation measure for evaluating our operating performance and our capacity to incur and service debt  fund capital expenditures and expand our business  and as one measure in determining the value of other acquisitions and dispositions 
there are material limitations to using a measure such as adjusted ebitda  including the difficulty associated with comparing results among more than one company and the inability to analyze certain significant items  including depreciation and interest expense  that directly affect our net income or loss 
management compensates for these limitations by considering the economic effect of the excluded expense items independently as well as in connection with its analysis of net income 
we are organized into two operating divisions  hotel management and corporate housing 
both of these divisions are reportable operating segments 
each division is managed separately because of its distinctive products and services 
we evaluate the performance of each division based on adjusted ebitda 
prior to the merger between meristar and interstate on july   we operated in two reportable segments operations of luxury and upscale hotels and operations of mid scale  upper economy and budget hotels 
following the merger  we operate in the segments discussed above 
the other items in the tables below represent operating segment activity and assets for the non reportable segments 
adjusted ebitda from other activities includes merger costs  restructuring expenses  tender offer costs  asset impairments and write offs  conversion incentive payments for convertible notes  and gain on refinancing 
other assets include deferred tax assets and net deferred financing costs 
for periods prior to the merger  we have combined our two previously reportable segments into the hotel management operating segment for presentation in the table shown below 
the table shown below reconciles adjusted ebitda to net income loss for the periods presented 
adjusted ebitda should be considered in addition to  not as a substitute for or as being superior to  operating losses  cash flows  or other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america

because of the significant slowdown of the economy over the past three years  our managed hotels have generally experienced significant declines in occupancy and average rates charged 
weaker hotel performance has reduced our base and incentive management fees  and also has given rise to additional losses under minority investments we have made in connection with some of the hotels that we manage 
the overall weak economy  the conflict in iraq and traveler health concerns due to sars have continued to negatively impact the demand for corporate relocations and long term assignments  two primary drivers of our corporate housing operations 
geopolitical difficulties and traveler health concerns have significantly affected our european and canadian operations 
we expect those operations to continue to be impacted until business travel patterns are stabilized 
these events have had and are expected to continue to have an adverse impact on our financial performance 
in response to this current operating environment  our plan is the following earn base fees  incentive fees and fees from other services from our existing management contracts  as well as secure additional management contracts on quality properties 
we will continue to work with the owners of our managed hotel properties to implement cost reduction and control measures to improve those properties operating results 
increase the number of our investments in hotels  resorts and conference centers  through the creation of joint ventures and or real estate funds  where we will invest alongside other real estate investors and manage the acquired properties 
these investments will enable us to increase our equity in earnings from the profits of these investments  as well as provide revenues from management fees from the associated properties 
improve our inventory management and control costs within our existing markets in our corporate housing segment  increase our focus on high growth markets such as new york  washington  dc and chicago and increase our sales effort in our primary national segments 
we may also add additional markets in north america if the conditions are favorable 
we will continue to expand the licensed global partner program in which we license the bridgestreet name to various corporate housing providers throughout the us we may reduce our inventory in areas in which demand is weak or declining ie london and toronto where the long term leases have proved to be problematic in the past  our goal going forward will be to shorten our lease length commitments where possible and look for more opportunities to convert higher risk apartment blocks into management arrangements 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  at december   we managed properties with  guest rooms  compared to properties with  guest rooms at december  although the number of managed properties decreased  our total revenue for compared to has increased 
the primary reason for this increase in revenue is due to the merger of meristar and interstate in july of  therefore only months of revenue for the combined company is included in  whereas includes a full year 
hotels under management were reduced by a net of approximately since december  our adjusted ebitda has not been materially negatively impacted as most of the contracts which were not retained were significantly less advantageous to us economically than contracts which were retained or added 
the majority of these terminated contracts were due to the properties sold by meristar hospitality  the purchase of cnl by rfs  and the termination of the winston contracts  all discussed above in recent events terminated contracts 
the remainder is the net of management contracts gained and terminated throughout the year by various owners 
revenues the following table shows the operating statistics for our managed hotels on a same store basis for the year ended december  dollars not in thousands change revenue per available room average daily rate occupancy our total revenue increased  to  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december  major components of this increase were lodging revenues increased  or  to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  this increase is due to the increase in revenue per available room for this hotel  resulting primarily from a increase in occupancy over prior year 
revenue from management fees increased  or  from  for the year ended december  to  for year ended december  the primary reason for the increase is the increase in number of managed hotels during the year  resulting from the merger on july   and additional contracts acquired since the merger 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease in management fee revenues resulting from the loss of certain contracts  including those sold by meristar hospitality  rfs  and certain others 
there is also a decrease in revenues at the managed hotels due to the decline in revenue per available room as shown above  primarily due to the continued weakness in the us economy and the impact of the war on travel 
corporate housing revenue was  for the year ended december   compared with  for the year ended december  corporate housing revenue is included in our results of operations beginning august  as a result of the merger  therefore the period includes five months as compared with twelve months included in the period 
corporate housing revenue is fairly consistent when compared to the revenue for the twelve months of the prior year 
other revenues decreased  or  from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  the majority of this decrease is due to a decrease in insurance income of from our captive insurance company  and an overall decrease in the other fees mentioned above 
reimbursable costs  which we record as revenue under eitf  increased by  or  to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december  substantially all of this increase is due to the increase in the number of employees and managed properties resulting from the merger in july of operating expenses by department total operating expenses by department increased  to  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december  substantially all of this increase is due to expenses incurred in our corporate housing division  which is included in our operations beginning august  as a result of the merger 
therefore the period includes five months as compared with twelve months included in the period 
corporate housing expenses are fairly consistent when compared to the expenses for the twelve months of the prior year 
undistributed operating expenses undistributed operating expenses include the following items administrative and general  depreciation and amortization  merger and integration costs  restructuring expenses  tender offer costs  and asset impairment and write offs 
total undistributed operating expenses increased  or  to  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  factors primarily affecting the increase were administrative and general expenses increased by  or  from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  the primary reason for this increase is the increase in expenses resulting from the merger on july  depreciation and amortization expense decreased by  or  from  for the year ended december   to  for the year ended december  this decrease is primarily due to a large number of management contracts that were fully amortized during and the loss of certain management contracts during the year 
this decrease was partially offset by the increase in purchases of property  plant and equipment during  and the related increase in depreciation taken on those assets 
merger and integration costs decreased  from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  these costs include professional fees  travel  relocation costs and other transition costs 
the majority of these costs were incurred following the merger  in the second half of we do not expect to have any further significant merger and integration costs in related to the merger between meristar and interstate 
restructuring expenses decreased  from  for the year ended december   to  for the year ended december  in  restructuring expenses were incurred in connection with the merger of meristar and interstate  and primarily consist of severance costs for personnel changes and non cancelable lease costs associated with the merger 
in the restructuring expenses relate to severance costs for certain former corporate personnel 
tender offer costs were for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december  these costs related to the commencement of a partial tender offer to purchase  shares of interstate s class a common stock by shaner hotel group limited partnership and shaner s unsolicited proposals to combine the operations of interstate with shaner prior to the commencement of the tender offer 
these costs were incurred for legal and professional fees 
the tender offer expired may  asset impairment and write offs increased  from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  in the fourth quarter of we recorded an impairment charge of  to reduce the carrying value of our investment in fch ihc hotels  lp and fch ihc leasing  lp to its estimated fair value 
similarly  in the fourth quarter of we recorded an impairment charge of  on the same investment  representing the combined net book value of the investment and a note receivable  to reduce their total carrying value to zero 
in  write offs of management contracts were  compared to  in this increase is due to the increase in terminated management contracts  specifically related to the properties sold by meristar hospitality and the termination of contracts by winston  both in see recent events termination of management contracts above for more detail 
these accounted for write offs of  and  respectively 
we also wrote off an additional related to other terminated contracts during also in is a charge of  representing the write off of leasehold improvements relating to our former corporate office in washington  dc  before relocating in july of to arlington  virginia 
we periodically evaluate the carrying value of our investments and goodwill 
the future carrying value is  dependent upon operating results of our operating segments and or the underlying real estate investments 
should the current weak market conditions in the hospitality and lodging industry continue to cause poor operating results of the underlying investments  additional losses may occur in the future and result in our inability to recover the carrying value of these assets 
reimbursable costs  which we record as revenue under eitf  increased by  or  to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december  substantially all of this increase is due to the increase in the number of employees and managed properties resulting from the merger in july of net income loss available to common shareholders net income loss available to common shareholders increased  to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december  this increase is due to improvements in our operations as discussed above  as well as the following net interest expense increased  or  to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december  this increase is primarily due to the increase in outstanding debt following the merger  the increase in amortization of deferred financing fees associated with the merger and the debt refinancing in january in addition  during the fourth quarter of  in connection with the repayment of a portion of our term loan  we wrote off approximately of unamortized deferred financing costs associated with the term loan 
this amount and the amortization of deferred financing fees is included in interest expense on our statement of operations 
equity in losses of affiliates decreased  or  to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december  these losses consist of our proportionate share of the losses incurred through our non controlling equity investments in various hotels 
in  we recorded approximately  of equity losses associated with our felcor lodging trust joint venture  whereas in we recorded approximately in losses 
losses were incurred by the hotels owned by our equity investee s due to the weakness in the us economy during and the continued weakness into  followed by the impact of the war in future adverse changes in the hospitality industry market conditions or poor operating results of the underlying investments could result in future losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of these investments
