item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations as discussed in item  business  the company operates in three business segments performance chemicals  decorative products and building products 
please refer to pages through for a description of and background on the company s operating segments 
management discusses the company s operating performance by reportable business segment and provides segment operating profit performance excluding segment restructuring and severance items because this is the manner in which segment operating results are reported to management for purposes of assessing the performance of the company s business segments and in making decisions regarding the allocation of resources to the business segments 
management also believes that providing segment operating performance excluding segment restructuring and severance items provides a better basis for investors to understand the company s businesses and to be better able to compare operating results year over year

in fiscal  million was used for investing activities primarily for capital expenditures 

table of contents cash provided from financing activities was million in fiscal and was primarily related to the refinancing effort that the company completed on may  cash flow used in financing activities was million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
cash flow used in fiscal was primarily attributable to debt reduction 
cash flow used in fiscal was primarily for dividend payments 
capital expenditures were made and are planned principally for asset replacement  new product capability  cost reduction  safety and productivity improvements and environmental protection 
capital expenditures totaled million for fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal capital expenditures in fiscal and were primarily for equipment upgrades and additions 
capital expenditures in fiscal included million for the new extruder facility in muscle shoals  alabama and million of equipment upgrades and additions 
the company plans to fund substantially all of its capital expenditures from cash flow generated from operations 
if necessary  a portion of capital expenditures will be funded through borrowings under its credit facility 
as described in note l to the consolidated financial statements  the company issued million of senior secured notes notes due june  interest on the notes will be paid semi annually on june st and december st  commencing on december  the company used the proceeds from this offering to repay outstanding amounts under its then existing revolving credit facility  to terminate its receivables sale program and to pay related fees and expenses 
in addition  on may   the company entered into a million  three year senior secured revolving credit facility facility 
advances under the facility bear interest  at the company s option  at either an alternate base rate or a eurodollar rate  in each case plus an applicable margin 
the alternate base interest rate is a fluctuating rate equal to the higher of the prime rate or the sum of the federal funds effective rate plus basis points 
the applicable margin for the alternate base rate will vary from to depending on the company s fixed charge coverage ratio and was at november  the eurodollar rate is a fluctuating rate equal to libor 
the applicable margin for the eurodollar rate will vary from to depending on the company s fixed charge coverage ratio and was at november  the facility s average borrowing rate at november  was 
the facility requires a commitment fee based on the unused portion of the facility 
the commitment fee will vary from to based on the company s fixed charge coverage ratio and was at november  the company s total debt outstanding at november  was million and its average debt outstanding during fiscal was million 
at november   the amount borrowed and the unused and available balance under the facility were million and million  respectively 
on november   the company amended the aforementioned facility to exclude certain non cash charges  incurred during the fourth quarter of fiscal  and used in determining the fixed charge coverage ratio 
the amendment did not have an impact on the borrowing base or lending rates of the agreement 
at november  the company was in compliance with all debt covenants 
the company anticipates that the average borrowing rate under this facility will increase by approximately basis points based on higher applicable margins in fiscal based upon current and anticipated levels of operations  the company believes that its cash flow from operations  combined with borrowings that will be available under the facility  will be sufficient to enable the company to meet its current and anticipated cash operating requirements  including scheduled interest and principal payments  capital expenditures and working capital needs  for the next twelve months 
currently  a portion of the company s long term debt bears interest at variable rates  therefore  the company s liquidity and financial condition will continue to be affected by changes in prevailing interest rates 

table of contents contractual obligations payments due by period dollars in millions total less than year years years more than years long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases purchase obligations other long term liabilities recorded on balance sheet total significant accounting policies and management judgments the company s discussion and analysis of its results of operations  financial condition and liquidity are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements as of november   which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements 
on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to product returns  accounts receivable  inventories  warranty obligations  litigation and environmental reserves  pensions and income taxes 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the company reviews its estimates to ensure that the estimates appropriately reflect changes in its business or as new information becomes available 
actual results may materially differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements a revenue recognition sales are recognized when both title and risk of loss transfer to the customer  which is upon shipment 
sales are recorded net of an allowance for sales returns and rebate programs 
sales returns are estimated based upon historical returns 
the company also records estimated reductions to revenue for quantity rebates 
if the actual costs of sales returns and rebate programs significantly exceed the recorded estimated allowance  the company s sales would be adversely affected 
b allowance for doubtful accounts the company s policy is to identify all specific customers that would be considered doubtful based upon the customer s financial condition  payment history  credit rating and other relevant factors  or those that have been turned over for collection and to reserve for the portion of those outstanding balances that collection does not appear to be likely 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an inability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
the allowance for doubtful accounts was approximately million and million at november  and  respectively 
c allowance for inventory obsolescence the company s policy is to maintain an inventory obsolescence reserve based upon specifically identified  discontinued or obsolete items and a percentage of quantities on hand compared with usage and sales levels over the last year to two years 
the policy has been applied on a consistent basis for all years presented 
a sudden and unexpected change in design trends and or preferences for patterns  colors and or material could reduce the rate of inventory turnover and require the company to increase its reserve for obsolescence 
the reserve for inventory obsolescence was approximately million and million at november  and  respectively 

table of contents d allowance for warranty claims on an on going basis  the company updates its building systems warranty reserve for specifically identified or new matters and a detailed study of the reserve is updated on a semi annual basis to reserve for estimated future costs associated with any open warranty year 
the reserve is a highly sensitive estimate based on historical costs and failure rates 
a change in these factors could result in a significant change in the reserve balance 
the warranty reserve at november  and was approximately million and million  respectively 
e litigation and environmental reserves the company reserves for the probable costs associated with any legal claims and environmental remediation projects 
the company s legal department performs on going analyses of legal claims and remediation efforts 
reserves are based upon their analyses and established at the best estimate 
f pensions the company accounts for its defined benefit pension plans in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions which requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis 
sfas no 
and the policies used by the company  notably the use of a calculated value of plan assets which is further described below  generally reduce the volatility of pension income expense from changes in pension liability discount rates and the performance of the pension plan s assets 
the most significant element in determining the company s pension income expense in accordance with sfas no 
is the expected return on plan assets 
the assumed long term rate of return on assets is applied to a calculated value of plan assets  which recognizes changes in the fair value of plan assets in a systematic manner over five years 
this produces the expected return on plan assets that is included in pension income expense 
the difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred 
the net deferral of past asset gains losses affects the calculated value of plan assets and  ultimately  future pension income expense 
the combination of several factors may require the company to begin recording pension expense of approximately million in fiscal the lower investment performance by our pension plan assets  caused by the decline in the stock market  has significantly reduced the surplus position of the plan 
changes in long term expectations for inflation and the equity markets have led to the lowering of the assumed rate of return for asset performance 
the company used an assumed rate of return on assets of percent to determine the pension expense for fiscal the measurement date of august  was used to determine this rate 
a basis point change in the assumed rate of return for assets would increase or decrease the assets by approximately million 
the company determined the discount rate to be used to discount the plan liabilities at the plan s measurement date  which was august  the discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year 
in estimating this rate  the company considered rates of return on high quality  fixed income investments that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized investment ratings agency 
changes in discount rates over the past three years have not materially affected pension income expense  and the net effect of changes in the discount rate  as well as the net effect of other changes in actuarial assumptions and experience  have been deferred as allowed by sfas no 
with the low interest rate environment  the company decreased the discount rate used to measure the defined benefit pension plan obligations to a discount rate of percent from a discount rate of percent 
the measurement date of august  was used to determine this rate 
an increase of basis points in the discount rate would decrease expense on an annual basis by approximately million 
a decrease of basis points in the discount rate would increase expense on an annual basis by approximately million 
our pension expense is more sensitive to a drop in the discount rate rather than an increase because at a percent discount rate  the plan is approaching the percent gain loss amortization corridor 
the plan would remain inside the corridor and would not amortize any losses in the current year if the discount rate increases 
the plan would be outside the corridor if the discount rate were lower and would  therefore  be forced to amortize some of the outstanding losses 

table of contents the company does not anticipate making cash contributions to the pension fund until however  in order to manage the pension fund over the long term  the company may find it prudent to make contributions before in addition  the company cannot predict whether changing economic conditions or other factors will lead or require the company to make contributions in excess of its current expectations  which would divert funds that the company would otherwise apply to other uses 
additionally  the company may not have the funds necessary to meet any minimum pension funding requirements 
the annual cost of the consolidated pension plan is expected to grow to million by fiscal currently  the plan has a credit balance that will cover cash contribution requirements for the next two years 
factors that could alter the cash requirements and timing of any such cash equivalents are investment returns which differ materially from the company s percent return assumption 
failure of congress to replace the year treasury bond  the yield on which is used for the current liability measure artificially low interest rates force additional funding charges accelerating funding 
significant improvements to the pension plan eg  large early retirement window 
opportunities to reduce future cash requirements by accelerating contributions ahead of the minimum required schedule 
by following certain strategies  smaller contributions in the near term may prevent the need for larger contributions in the future 
some of those strategies might include  but are not limited to  contributions to avoid pension benefit guaranty corporation variable premiums  a charge to other comprehensive income  and maintain funded status to avoid additional funding requirements under section i of the internal revenue code 
these types of contributions would allow the company to manage the overall cash flow to the plan 
at november   the company s consolidated prepaid pension asset was million as compared to million for fiscal the company recognized consolidated pre tax pension income of million and million  for fiscal and  respectively 
g tax valuation allowance the company provided a valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty of recovery of such assets 
as of november   the company had approximately million of net deferred tax assets primarily related to domestic loss carryforwards that expire by  goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset impairment losses created as a result of the company s annual impairment test for fiscal and the cumulative effect of an accounting change effective december  and other temporary differences for which a valuation allowance of million has been provided 
the company provided a valuation allowance for its deferred tax assets after having considered its recent history of cumulative losses since its spin off from gencorp 
h stock based employee compensation the company has elected to follow accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations in accounting for the company s employee stock options 
under apb  because the exercise price of the stock option equals the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant intrinsic value method  no compensation expense is recognized 
environmental matters the company s policy is to conduct its businesses with due regard for the preservation and protection of the environment 
the company devotes significant resources and management attention to comply with environmental laws and regulations 
the company s consolidated balance sheet as of november  reflects reserves for environmental remediation efforts of million 

table of contents capital expenditures for projects related to the environment were million in  million in and million in the company currently forecasts that capital expenditures for environmental projects will be approximately million in fiscal during  noncapital expenditures for environmental compliance and protection totaled million  all of which were for recurring costs associated with managing hazardous substances and pollution abatement in ongoing operations 
similar noncapital expenditures were million and million in and  respectively 
the company anticipates that noncapital environmental expenditures for the next several years will be consistent with historical expenditure levels 
management believes  on the basis of presently available information  that resolution of known environmental matters will not materially affect liquidity  capital resources or the consolidated financial condition of the company 
the effect of resolution of these matters on results of operations cannot be predicted because any such effect depends on both future results of operations and the amount and timing of the resolution of such matters 
however  there can be no assurance that future costs and liabilities will not exceed the company s reserves or be material
