overview business description we are a leading healthcare staffing company and the largest provider of per diem nurse staffing services in the united states as measured by revenues 
more than two thirds of our clients are acute care hospitals  clinics and surgical and ambulatory care centers 
we serve both for profit and not for profit organizations that range in scope from one facility to national chains with over facilities 
our clients pay us directly 
we do not receive a material portion of our revenues from medicare or medicaid reimbursements or similar state reimbursement programs 
all of our revenues are derived from providing healthcare staffing services 
approximately of our revenues were derived from per diem nurse staffing  while allied healthcare professional staffing represented of our revenues  and travel nurse staffing assignments lasting more than four weeks represented of our revenues 
in the second quarter of  we discontinued our physician staffing and have reported the results separately as discontinued operations  net of taxes 
our growth in revenue for was primarily the result of growth from acquisitions of  partially offset by an organic decline of 
industry trends service revenues and gross profit margins have been under pressure as demand for temporary nurses is currently going through a period of contraction 
due to the current difficult economic times  the unemployment rate is near a nine year high  which we believe has resulted in nurses in many households becoming a primary breadwinner  and which is causing such nurses to seek more traditional full time employment 
additionally  hospitals are experiencing lower than projected census levels and are placing greater reliance on existing full time staff  resulting in increased overtime and nurse patient loads 
we cannot predict when conditions will reverse  but we are confident in the long term growth of the industry 
in a january  report  the us census bureau  population projections bureau  projected that the number of americans over years of age is expected to grow from million in to million in in a july report  the us department of health and human services stated that the national supply of full time equivalent registered nurses was approximately million while demand was approximately million 
this gap between supply and demand  for nurses  is expected to grow from million in to million by in conjunction with the two aforementioned factors  as the economy rebounds  the prospects for the healthcare staffing industry should improve as hospitals experience higher census levels and increasing shortages of healthcare workers 
acquisitions in  we purchased substantially all of the assets of one healthcare staffing company for an aggregate purchase price of million 
in  we purchased substantially all of the assets of seven healthcare staffing companies for an aggregate purchase price of million 
in  we purchased substantially all of the assets of one healthcare staffing company for an aggregate purchase price of million 
all such acquisitions were accounted for as purchases and  accordingly  the results of these acquired businesses are included in our consolidated financial statements from the acquisition dates or the dates when we assumed substantial control 
discontinued operations we discontinued our physician staffing services in the second quarter of pursuant to the provisions of the fasb statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas no 
 results of operations are to be classified as discontinued when the disposal of the component of an entity has occurred or it has met the held for sale criteria

for the year ended december   we had a loss from discontinued operations  net of taxes  of approximately million 
for the years ended december  and december   we had income from discontinued operations  net of taxes  of approximately million and million  respectively 
net assets of the discontinued operations were less than approximately  at december  and consisted solely of current assets 
net assets of the discontinued operations were approximately million at december  and were comprised of million of current assets and million of current liabilities 
no reclassification of current or prior year balance sheet presentation was made to reflect the net assets of the discontinued operations  due to immateriality 
restructuring charge on june   we completed our plan to restructure our operations by closing branches 
the restructuring was necessary to adjust the infrastructure we had put in place to support multiple growth initiatives and was in response to the current contraction in demand for our services 
as a result  in the second quarter of  we recorded a pre tax charge  of approximately million  relating to employee severance costs  branch closing costs and lease termination costs 
the restructuring charge is included in selling  general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statement of income for the year ended december  no amounts have been or are expected to be incurred or paid in subsequent quarters relating to this restructuring 
loss on early extinguishment of debt in december  we entered into a new credit facility 
the new million facility is comprised of a three year million revolving credit facility and a two year million term note 
approximately million of proceeds from the new credit facility were used to refinance all of our existing debt and to pay financing related fees 
the remaining borrowing availability will be used for working capital and general business purposes 
as a result of the prepayment of the facility  we recorded a charge of approximately million to write off debt issuance costs associated with the extinguished facility 
the charge appears in the line item loss on early extinguishment of debt on the consolidated statement of income for the year ended december  in october  we recapitalized our business 
in connection with the recapitalization  we incurred approximately million of indebtedness  approximately million of which was used to repay existing indebtedness 
as a result of the prepayment of this facility  we recorded a pre tax charge of approximately million to write off debt issuance costs associated with the facility 
the charge appears in the line item loss on early extinguishment of debt on the consolidated statement of income for the year ended december  initial public offering on april   we completed our initial public offering of million shares of common stock at per share 
additionally  the underwriters exercised the over allotment option of million shares  bringing the total number of shares issued to million 
total proceeds received by us  net of expenses related to the initial public offering were million 
the proceeds were used to repay million of our outstanding balance under the senior unsecured notes  and approximately million of our outstanding loans under the senior credit facility 
immediately prior to the completion of the initial public offering  the outstanding shares of series i preferred stock were converted into million shares of common stock 
recapitalization in october  an investment group led by warburg pincus acquired majority ownership of us in a transaction that recapitalized our business 
our recapitalization was accounted for as a leveraged recapitalization of our company and  accordingly  we have retained the historical cost basis of accounting 
in connection with the recapitalization  we incurred approximately million of indebtedness  approximately million of which was used to repay existing indebtedness

includes million provision for bad debt expense in selling  general and administrative expenses related to a client bankruptcy 
seasonality due to the regional and seasonal fluctuations in the hospital patient census of our hospital and healthcare facility clients and due to the seasonal preferences for destinations by our temporary healthcare professionals  the number of healthcare professionals on assignment  revenue and earnings are subject to moderate seasonal fluctuations 
many of our hospital and healthcare facility clients are located in areas  particularly florida  that experience seasonal fluctuations in population  during the winter and summer months 
these facilities adjust their staffing levels to accommodate the change in this seasonal demand and many of these facilities utilize temporary healthcare professionals to satisfy these seasonal staffing needs 
historically  the number of temporary healthcare professionals on assignment has increased from december through march followed by declines or minimal growth from april through november 
this trend may or may not continue in the future 
as a result of all of these factors  results of any one quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any other quarter or for any year 
liquidity and capital resources discussion on liquidity and capital resources we fund our cash needs through various equity and debt issuances and through cash flow from operations 
currently  we have no commitments to make any material capital expenditures 
at december   we had cash and cash equivalents totaling million  working capital totaling million and unused availability under our committed credit facility totaling million  of which million is immediately available for borrowing  compared to cash and cash equivalents totaling million  working capital totaling million and unused capacity under our committed credit facility totaling million at december  cash provided by operating activities was million during the year ended december  compared to cash used in operating activities of million and million during the years ended december  and december   respectively 
cash provided by continuing operations was million during the year ended december  compared to cash used in continuing operations of million and million during the years ended december  and december   respectively 
cash used by discontinued operations was million during the year ended december  as compared to cash provided by discontinued operations of million and million during the years ended december  and december   respectively 
cash flows from operating activities were positively impacted in  primarily the result of a lower accounts receivable balance due to improved collections and lower sales volume  the closure of cash using offices in the restructuring completed during the second quarter of  and the opening of fewer de novo branches in five as compared to in 
cash flows from operating activities were negatively impacted in  due to cash required to fund our de novo branches  partially offset by the positive impact of increased earnings 
because we rely on cash flow from operations as a source of liquidity  we are subject to the risk that a decrease in the demand for our staffing services could have an adverse impact on our liquidity 
decreased demand for our staffing services could result from an inability to attract qualified healthcare professionals  fluctuations in patient occupancy at our hospital and healthcare facility clients and changes in state and federal regulations relating to our business 
in october  an investment group led by warburg pincus acquired a majority interest in our company in a recapitalization that provided us with proceeds from new equity and senior debt issuances totaling approximately million and advances from a new senior credit facility totaling million 
together  these funds were used to provide us with working capital for operations  to retire then outstanding debt obligations and accrued interest totaling approximately million  as consideration for the acquisition of the former stockholders equity interests for approximately million  and to pay recapitalization costs of approximately million 
on april   we completed our initial public offering of million shares of common stock at per share 
additionally  the underwriters exercised the over allotment option of million shares  bringing the total number of shares issued to million 
total proceeds received by us  net of expenses related to the initial public offering were million 
the proceeds were used to repay million of our outstanding balance under the senior unsecured notes  and approximately million of our outstanding loans under the senior credit facility 
immediately prior to the completion of the initial public offering  the outstanding shares of series i preferred stock were converted into million shares of common stock 
we entered into a senior credit facility  in connection with our recapitalization  which consisted of a term loan arrangement and a revolving line of credit 
on july   we amended the terms of the senior credit facility and entered into a million note 
in accordance with the amendment  the remaining balance on the existing senior credit facility was paid off 
on october   we amended the terms of the senior credit facility and entered into a million note with terms and rights identical to the previous term a notes and reduced the borrowing capacity of the revolving loan from million to million 
on march   we amended the terms of our senior credit facility as follows i term a notes were increased to million tranche a with terms and rights identical to its previous term a notes  ii tranche a term loans tranche a provide for up to million of borrowings prior to december   with a minimum initial borrowing of million and in integral multiples of million thereafter 
tranche a loans cannot be reborrowed once repaid  are due in october and bear interest at a variable rate based on our leverage ratio with interest payable at least quarterly and principal payments payable quarterly commencing on march  the amendment did not affect the revolving loan s million borrowing capacity 
this senior credit facility was repaid in full with the proceeds from the december refinancing  as described below 
on december   we entered into a new credit facility 
the new million facility is comprised of a three year million revolving credit facility and a two year million term note 
approximately million of proceeds from the new credit facility were used to refinance all of our existing debt and to pay financing related fees 
unused capacity under the revolving credit facility bears interest at and is payable monthly 
the term note is due on december  and bears interest at a variable rate based on our leverage ratio as defined with interest payable monthly 
as of december   there was million outstanding under our credit facility with unused capacity of million  of which million is immediately available for borrowing  and million outstanding under our term loan 
for the twelve months ended december   the weighted average interest rate for the loans under our extinguished and new credit facilities was 
as of december  the blended rate for loans outstanding under our new credit facility was 
as the borrower under our senior credit facility  our subsidiary  medical staffing network  inc  may only pay dividends or make other distributions to us in the amount of  in any fiscal year to pay our operating expenses 
this limitation on our subsidiary s ability to distribute cash to us will limit our ability to obtain and service any additional debt at the holding company level 
in addition  our subsidiary is subject to restrictions under the senior credit facility against incurring additional indebtedness 
we believe that our current cash balances  together with our existing credit line  other available sources of liquidity and expected cash flows from our operating activities  will be sufficient for us to meet our current and future financial obligations  as well as to provide us with funds for working capital  anticipated capital expenditures and other needs for at least the next twelve months 
no assurance can be given  however  that this will be the case 
in the longer term  we may require additional equity and debt financing to meet our working capital needs  or to fund our acquisition activities  if any 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available when required or  if available  will be available on satisfactory terms 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to our investors 
contractual obligations the following table reflects our significant contractual obligations and other commitments as of december  in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years after years long term debt obligations   operating leases      capital lease obligations   total      critical accounting policies in response to the securities and exchange commission sec release number cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies and sec release number  commission statement about management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  we have identified the following critical accounting policies that affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we will evaluate our estimates  including those related to asset impairment  accruals for self insurance and compensation and related benefits  allowance for doubtful accounts  and contingencies and litigation 
these estimates are based on the information that is currently available to us and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could vary from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
for a summary of all our significant accounting policies  including the critical accounting policies discussed below  see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments  which results in a provision for bad debt expense 
the adequacy of this allowance is determined by continually evaluating customer receivables  considering the customers financial condition  credit history and current economic conditions 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
we have recorded goodwill and other intangibles resulting from our acquisitions through december  through december   goodwill and other intangibles were amortized on a straight line basis over their lives of to years 
pursuant to the provisions of sfas no 
 which we adopted in  goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have an indefinite life are no longer amortized 
we evaluate the recovery of the carrying amount of costs in excess of net tangible assets acquired by determining if an impairment has occurred 
this evaluation is done annually or more frequently if indicators of an impairment arise 
indicators of an impairment include duplication of resources resulting from acquisitions  instances in which the estimated undiscounted cash flows of the entity are less than the remaining unamortized balance of the underlying intangible assets and other factors 
at such time that impairment is determined  the intangible assets are written off during that period 
if we are required to record an impairment charge in the future  it would have an adverse impact on results of operations 
we maintain an accrual for our health  workers compensation and professional liability that are either self insured or partially self insured and are classified in accounts payable 
the adequacy of these accruals are determined by periodically evaluating our historical experience and trends related to health  workers compensation  and professional liability claims and payments  based on company specific actuarial computations and industry experience and trends 
if such information indicates that the accruals are overstated or understated  we will adjust the assumptions utilized in its methodologies and reduce or provide for additional accruals as appropriate 
we are subject to various claims and legal actions in the ordinary course of our business 
some of these matters include professional liability and employee related matters 
hospital and healthcare facility clients may also become subject to claims  governmental inquiries and investigations and legal actions to which we may become a party relating to services provided by our professionals 
from time to time  and depending upon the particular facts and circumstances  we may be subject to indemnification obligations under our contracts with hospital and healthcare facility clients relating to these matters 
although we are currently not aware of any such pending or threatened litigation that we believe is reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations  if we become aware of such claims against us  we will evaluate the probability of an adverse outcome and provide accruals for such contingencies as necessary

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to interest rate risk arises principally from the variable rates associated with our credit facility 
on december   we had borrowings of million under our credit facility that were subject to variable rates  with a blended rate of 
as of december   an adverse change of in the interest rate of all such borrowings outstanding would have caused us to incur an increase in interest expense of approximately million on an annual basis 
during the year ended december   we were a party to an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of million 
under the swap agreement  the net settlement was computed on a quarterly basis as the difference between the day libor and the fixed rate of 
this resulted in a fixed interest rate on million of borrowings under our credit facility at effective december   plus the applicable margin 
the swap agreement was terminated on may  for approximately million 
in addition  during the year ended december   there was exposure to market risk associated with our senior unsecured note which bore interest at a fixed rate 
the carrying amount of the senior unsecured notes approximated fair value as the terms of the debt were based on similar terms  maturities  and interest rates as other debt issues with similar risk factors that are not traded on quoted market prices 
our senior unsecured notes were redeemed in full with proceeds from our initial public offering 
foreign currency risk we have no foreign currency risk as we have no revenue outside the united states and all of our revenues are in us dollars 
inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our results of operations in recent years and periods 
there can be no assurance  however  that we will not be adversely affected by inflation in the future
