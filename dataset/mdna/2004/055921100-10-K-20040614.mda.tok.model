item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition introduction we begin management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition md a with an overview to give the reader management s perspective on bmc s results for fiscal and our general outlook for the current fiscal year 
this is followed by a discussion of the critical accounting policies that we believe are important to understanding the assumptions and judgments incorporated in our reported financial results 
this discussion is followed by a review of our recent  significant acquisitions 
in the next section  we discuss our results of operations for fiscal compared to fiscal and for fiscal compared to fiscal we then provide an analysis of our liquidity and capital resources 
this md a should be read in conjunction with the other sections of this annual report on form k  including item business  item selected financial data  and the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
the various sections of md a contain a number of forward looking statements  all of which are based on our current expectations and could be affected by the uncertainties and risk factors described throughout this filing and particularly in the certain risks and uncertainties section 
our actual results may differ materially from the results indicated by any forward looking statements 
overview in response to a challenging first quarter of fiscal  we implemented a restructuring plan to better align our cost structure with existing market conditions 
as a result of cost savings  additional license and contractual offerings and improved overall economic conditions  our business began to improve in the second half of fiscal in the middle of the year  we encouraged our sales force to make it clear to our customers that we offer multiple license models and will be flexible with our customers in how to structure their license arrangement 
as a result of this increased emphasis on meeting the customers needs and the resultant flexibility  we have seen a significant increase in the number of transactions  which require deferral of the license fees and recognition of such fees ratably over the term of the contract as compared to previous years 
given the record amount of deferred revenue that we experienced during our third quarter  we introduced a new metric called license bookings that reflects the amount of new license contracts signed during a given quarter 
license bookings can be calculated from our financial statements by simply summing current period license revenue plus net change to deferred license revenue  both calculated according to us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
in both the third and fourth fiscal quarters of  we saw significant year over year increases in license bookings 
we attribute this growth in license bookings  in part  to our bsm strategy 
throughout the year  bsm has helped us open new accounts  increase new license bookings and close multiple large transactions 
as we look ahead to fiscal  we are planning for growth in license bookings and significant improvement in overall operating profit margins 
another important metric for us is our cash flows from operations  which were million for fiscal while we continue to expect to generate significant cash flows from operations  we are not expecting the same levels of cash flows in fiscal for a variety of reasons  primarily that the amount of financed 
table of contents receivables sold to third parties is expected to be less in fiscal than in fiscal these issues are discussed in greater detail under liquidity and capital resources below 
in addition to internal development  we continue to look for strategic opportunities to extend our bsm strategy 
to this end  we remained acquisitive during fiscal purchasing the assets of magic from network associates 
finally  it is important for our investors to understand that a significant portion of our operating expenses is fixed in the short term and we plan our expense run rate based on our expectations of future revenue 
if we have a shortfall in revenue in any given quarter  there is an immediate  sometimes significant  effect on our overall earnings 
industry conditions we believe that buyers of systems management software are now more focused on linking their it operations and infrastructure with their overall business services 
although technology spending has been depressed over the past few years  there are multiple signs that enterprises around the world are making long term and strategic commitments to systems management software  particularly with large vendors similar to bmc 
while we remain optimistic about our business prospects and continue to believe that we are uniquely positioned to be the leading provider of bsm solutions  we recognize that the systems management software marketplace is highly competitive 
we compete with a variety of software vendors  including large vendors such as ibm  hp  computer associates and a number of smaller software vendors 
we compete for new customers and  from time to time  must compete to maintain our relationship with our current customers 
this competition can lead to pricing pressure and can affect our margins 
we discuss competition in greater detail in the certain risks and uncertainties section of md a 
critical accounting policies the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
our accounting and financial reporting policies are in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us on an on going basis  we make and evaluate estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  capitalized software development costs  valuation of investments and accounting for income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about amounts and timing of revenues and expenses  the carrying values of assets and the recorded amounts of liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates and such estimates may change if the underlying conditions or assumptions change 
we have discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting policies  communicated below  with the audit committee of our board of directors  and the audit committee has reviewed our related disclosures below 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position sop  software revenue recognition and sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions 
these statements provide guidance on applying generally accepted accounting principles in recognizing revenue on software transactions 
in applying these statements  we exercise judgment in connection with the determination of the amount of software license  maintenance  and professional services revenues to be recognized in each accounting period 
we recognize software license fees upon meeting all of the following four criteria execution of the signed contract  delivery of the underlying products to the customer and the acceptance of such products by the customer  determination that the software license fees are fixed or determinable  and determination that 
table of contents collection of the software license fees is probable 
if we determine any one of the four criteria is not met  we will defer recognition of the software license revenue until the criteria are met  as required by sops and maintenance  enhancement and support revenues are recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement on a straight line basis 
we have a history of offering installment contracts to customers and successfully enforcing original payment terms without making concessions 
because our agents  distributors and resellers collectively resellers act as the principals in the transactions with the end users of our software and the rewards of ownership are passed to the resellers upon the execution of our arrangement with the resellers  we recognize revenue from transactions with resellers on a net basis the amount actually received by us from the resellers 
in addition  we do not offer a right of return  rotation or price protection in our sales to resellers  and it is our policy to only accept orders from resellers that include evidence of an end user agreement 
on occasion  we have purchased goods or services for our operations from customers at or about the same time that we licensed our software to these customers 
license revenues from such transactions represent less than one percent of our total license revenues in any period 
our professional services revenues also include sales of third party software products  which typically support our product lines 
these revenues are recorded net of amounts payable to the third party software vendors 
revenues from professional services are recognized as the services are performed 
vendor specific evidence of the fair value of services is based on daily rates 
we enter into contracts for services alone and such contracts are based upon a time and materials basis 
such daily rates are used to assess the vendor specific objective evidence of fair value in multiple element arrangements 
when several elements  including software licenses  pcs post contract support and professional services  are sold to a customer through a single contract  the license revenues are recognized under the residual model  such that consideration is allocated to the multiple elements based upon the vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value of the multiple elements  with the residual being allocated to the license 
revenue allocated to the undelivered elements of a contract is deferred until such time as that element is delivered  or in the case of pcs  such revenue is recognized ratably over the pcs term 
we have established vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value of the pcs through the renewal rates established in contractual arrangements with our customers and through monitoring independent sales of our pcs at the stated renewal rates 
we have established a consistent relationship by pricing pcs as a percentage of the license amount 
accordingly  software license fees are recognized under the residual method for arrangements in which the software is licensed with maintenance  enhancement and support and or professional services  and where the maintenance  enhancement and support and or professional services are not essential to the functionality of the delivered software 
in the event a contract contains multiple elements for which we have not established vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value of the elements  all revenues from the contract are deferred until such evidence is established or are recognized on a ratable basis 
capitalized software development costs valuation we capitalize certain software development costs after a product becomes technologically feasible and before its general release to customers in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 

capitalized software costs are then amortized over the product s estimated life beginning with general availability of the product 
under sfas no 
 we evaluate our capitalized software costs at each balance sheet date to determine if the unamortized balance related to any given product exceeds the estimated net realizable value of that product 
any such excess is written off through accelerated amortization in the quarter it is identified 
determining net realizable value as defined by sfas no 
requires that we make estimates and use judgment in quantifying the appropriate amount to write off  if any 
actual amounts realized from the software products could differ from our estimates 
also  any future changes to our product portfolio could result in significant increases to research  development and support expenses related to software asset write offs 
valuation of investments we account for our investments in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities sfas no 

our investments consist of marketable securities and non 
table of contents marketable equity securities 
our non marketable equity securities  totaling million at march   are subject to periodic impairment review  which requires significant judgment as there are no open market valuations 
the primary factors used to determine if an other than temporary impairment of marketable securities exists include the fair value of the investment is significantly below our cost basis  the financial condition of the issuer of the security has deteriorated  whether it is probable that all amounts due are collectible according to the contractual terms of a debt security  the decline in fair value has existed for an extended period of time  if a debt security  such security has been downgraded by a rating agency  and  our intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 
we regularly analyze our portfolio of marketable securities for impairment based on the relevant factors 
we have investment policies  which are designed to ensure that our assets are invested in capital preserving securities 
however  from time to time  issuer specific and market specific events  as described above  could warrant an impairment write down 
we do not believe  unless future events warrant  that the impairment factors listed above will have a material adverse effect on our future results or financial position 
accounting for income taxes we provide for the effect of income taxes on our financial position and results of operations in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas 
under sfas  income tax expense is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and for deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
management is required to make significant assumptions  judgments and estimates to determine our current provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and whether a valuation allowance is needed to be recorded against our deferred tax assets 
our judgments  assumptions and estimates relative to the current provision for income tax take into account current tax laws  our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by domestic including state and foreign authorities 
changes in tax law or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of current and future audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our financial position and results of operations 
our judgments  assumptions and estimates relative to the value of our deferred tax assets take into account positive and negative evidence and predictions of the amount and category of future taxable income 
actual operating results and the underlying amount and category of income in future years could render our assumptions  judgments and estimates of recoverable net deferred tax assets inaccurate and  thus  materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
acquisitions in november  we acquired the assets of remedy from peregrine systems  inc peregrine for cash of million plus the assumption of certain liabilities of remedy 
in accordance with the purchase agreement  the cash purchase price was adjusted to million subsequent to march  integration of remedy s industry leading service desk  change management and asset management capabilities with our broad application and component management solutions enables us to deliver end to end  closed loop service management to customers 
together  these solutions build a solid foundation for the it service and applications management component of the bsm strategy by offering both the delivery and support components of service management designed to be proactive  effective and focused on customer business requirements 
the acquisition of it masters in march for million enables us to deliver the service impact management component of the bsm strategy and enhances our competitive position in the service management market 
in accordance with the purchase agreement  the cash purchase price was adjusted to million subsequent to march  it masters mastercell technology  renamed patrol for service impact management  combines powerful event automation and service modeling capabilities to transform availability and performance data into detailed knowledge about the status of business services and service level agreements 
in february  we acquired the assets of magic solutions magic from network associates for cash of million plus the assumption of certain liabilities of magic 
the acquisition strengthens our leadership 
table of contents position in the it service management market by increasing our reach to small and mid market sized organizations  as magic has more than  customers using its service desk solutions 
these transactions  along with various other immaterial technology acquisitions  were accounted for using the purchase accounting method  and accordingly  the financial results for these entities have been included in our consolidated financial results since the applicable acquisition dates 
in late april  we announced the signing of a definitive merger agreement with marimba 
the proposed acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions  including the approval of marimba s stockholders  and we anticipate closing this transaction during the second fiscal quarter of our expected purchase price is approximately million 
this acquisition will strengthen our bsm related offerings through the addition of discovery and asset  change and configuration management capabilities 
historical information historical performance should not be viewed as indicative of future performance  as there can be no assurance that operating income loss or net earnings loss as a percentage of revenues will be sustained at these levels 
for a discussion of factors affecting operating margins  see the discussions below under the heading certain risks and uncertainties

table of contents revenues we generate revenues from licensing software  providing maintenance  enhancement and support for previously licensed products and providing professional services 
we generally utilize written contracts as the means to establish the terms and conditions by which our products  support and services are sold to our customers 
percentage change years ended march  compared to compared to in millions license north america international total license revenues maintenance north america international total maintenance revenues professional services north america international total professional services revenues total revenues fiscal compared to fiscal the utilization of existing capacity previously licensed to our customers and difficult economic conditions in domestic and international markets experienced throughout fiscal continued to impact fiscal  which resulted in reduced information technology spending by many of our customers 
though the number of license transactions declined only during fiscal as compared to fiscal  tighter budgets and higher required approval levels caused many customers to enter into smaller transactions in terms of dollar value  and the it spending environment remained depressed 
we experienced a decline in the size of transactions with our largest customers  which historically have accounted for a significant portion of our revenues 
as discussed in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  we acquired remedy in november excluding the impact of remedy revenues subsequent to the acquisition date  total revenues declined in fiscal primarily as a result of the economic conditions described above and reduced revenues for our patrol solutions during the first half of fiscal  as discussed below under product line revenues 
license revenue deferrals for fiscal were consistent with fiscal and  therefore  did not have an impact on the revenue change from year to year 
including remedy revenues subsequent to the acquisition date  total revenues increased in fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal we acquired magic in february  as discussed in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
excluding the impact of remedy and magic revenues subsequent to the acquisition dates  total revenues declined in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily as a result of the significant increase in license revenue deferrals 
though license revenues during the first six months of fiscal were negatively impacted by reduced it spending by many of our customers  as discussed above  we believe that the global it spending environment is beginning to improve  as customers were more willing to consider new it projects and to commit to larger transactions during the second half of fiscal the number of license transactions over million during the second half of fiscal increased over the prior year  including nine license transactions over million  eight of which will be recognized over the life of the contract 
see further detail of the impact of the change in license revenue deferrals below 
table of contents under product license revenues 
including remedy and magic revenues subsequent to the acquisition dates  total revenues increased in fiscal product revenue growth was not materially impacted by inflation in fiscal and product license revenues the majority of our product license revenues consist of fees related to products licensed to customers on a perpetual basis 
product license fees can be associated with a customer s licensing of a given software product for the first time or with a customer s purchase of the right to run a previously licensed product on additional computing capacity or by additional users 
in addition to perpetual based product license fees  our product license revenues also include term license fees which are generated when customers are granted license rights to a given software product for a defined period of time less than months 
for the years ended march   and  our recognized revenues were impacted by the changes in our deferred license revenue balance as follows year ended march  in millions deferrals of license revenue recognition from deferred license revenue net impact on recognized license revenue deferred license revenue balance at end of year based on licensing trends  increased customer requests for contractual terms that result in deferral of revenue and our recent initiative to ensure we clearly articulate to customers the flexibility that we offer in these areas  we expect that our base of deferred license revenue will continue to grow in fiscal also  because of differing maintenance pricing methodologies for legacy bmc products and remedy products  license revenues in transactions that include both types of products typically must be deferred under the residual method of accounting for multiple element arrangements 
we expect the volume of such joint transactions to increase and accordingly  expect the deferred license revenue related to them to increase 
the contract terms and conditions that result in deferral of revenue recognition for a given transaction result from arm s length negotiations between us and our customers 
during these negotiations  the contract terms and conditions that result in deferral may be requested by a customer  while in some cases we may suggest inclusion of these terms and conditions where it makes business sense to do so 
we may suggest short term time based licenses in response to customers product mix  pricing and licensing needs 
in either case  the resulting contract must be acceptable to both parties 
examples of transactions resulting in the deferral of license revenue would include short term time based licenses generally one to four years  transactions that include both bmc and remedy products  as noted above  for which vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value of the pcs does not exist  and transactions that include complex terms and conditions for which we do not have vendor specific objective evidence of fair value of the pcs 
once it is determined that license revenue for a particular contract must be deferred  based on the contractual terms and application of revenue recognition policies to those terms  we recognize such license revenue either ratably over the term of the contract or when the revenue recognition criteria are met 
because of this  we generally know the timing of the subsequent recognition of license revenue at the time of deferral 
therefore  the amount of license revenue to be recognized out of the deferred revenue balance in each future quarter is predictable  and our total license revenues to be recognized each quarter become more predictable as a larger percentage of those revenues come from the deferred balance 
as of march  and  the average remaining life of the deferred license revenue balance was approximately three and one half years 
of the total deferred license revenue balance at march   we will recognize license revenues of million  million  million and million for the fiscal years   and thereafter  respectively

north american license revenues decreased from fiscal to fiscal 
table of contents and from fiscal to fiscal excluding the impact of remedy revenues subsequent to the acquisition date  north american license revenues declined in fiscal while license revenues were down across most product groups in fiscal and  the largest contributor to the revenue decline in both years was decreased license revenues for our mainframe data management products 
decreased patrol license revenues also had a significant impact in both fiscal years 
excluding the impact of remedy and magic revenues subsequent to their acquisition dates  north american license revenues decreased in fiscal however  the decline for fiscal is primarily due to the impact of deferred license revenue as discussed above  as well as an overall decrease in license bookings  which was comprised of recognized revenues and the net change in deferred license revenue  in this region 
while overall economic conditions are improving  the it spending environment in north america remains challenging 
international license revenues represented  and of total license revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
international license revenues increased from fiscal to fiscal and increased from fiscal to fiscal excluding the impact of remedy revenues subsequent to the acquisition date  international license revenues declined in fiscal increases in license revenue for our mainframe data management and mainview products were more than offset by declines for our patrol  distributed systems data management and scheduling and output management products 
excluding the impact of remedy and magic revenues subsequent to their acquisition dates  international license revenues decreased in fiscal increased license revenues for our patrol and scheduling and output management products were more than offset by decreases in our mainframe data management and mainview products 
these decreases were primarily due to the impact of increased deferred license revenue  as discussed above 
the international license revenue decline in fiscal was net of an increase of and the decrease in fiscal was net of an increase of due to foreign currency exchange rate changes during the periods  after giving effect to our foreign currency hedging program 
maintenance  enhancement and support revenues maintenance  enhancement and support revenues represent the ratable recognition of fees to enroll licensed products in our software maintenance  enhancement and support program 
maintenance  enhancement and support enrollment generally entitles customers to product enhancements  technical support services and ongoing compatibility with third party operating systems  database management systems  networks  storage systems and applications 
excluding remedy  these fees are generally charged annually and such fees have equaled to of the discounted price of the product prior to the program change in the fourth quarter of fiscal discussed below  and have equaled subsequent to the program change 
remedy s maintenance fees are generally charged annually and equal to of the list price of the product 
maintenance revenues also include the ratable recognition of the bundled fees for any initial maintenance services covered by the related perpetual license agreement 
in addition  customers may be entitled to reduced maintenance percentages on remedy products for entering into long term maintenance contracts that include prepayment of the maintenance fees 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we revised our maintenance program to a single maintenance offering of x support at a standard rate of of the discounted price of the associated product 
in connection with this revision  we have extended our standard warranty and initial support period to one year for all our products  whereas prior to this revision such periods were days for distributed systems products and one year for mainframe products 
because our maintenance revenues include the ratable recognition of the bundled fees for any initial maintenance services covered by the related perpetual license agreement  in certain new license transactions the extension of the initial support period for distributed systems products will cause us to recognize more maintenance revenues over time and less license revenues when the transactions occur 
while this change in our maintenance program will not have a material effect on our total revenues over time  there has been a negative short term license revenue impact coupled with an increase in deferred maintenance revenue 
as discussed above  this maintenance program does not apply to remedy products 
maintenance revenues increased in fiscal and in fiscal primarily as a result of the continuing growth in the base of installed products and the processing capacity on which they run and the additional maintenance revenue associated with remedy and magic 
excluding the impact of remedy 
table of contents revenues subsequent to the acquisition date  maintenance revenues increased in fiscal excluding the impact of remedy and magic revenues subsequent to their acquisition dates  maintenance revenues increased in fiscal maintenance fees increase in proportion to the aggregate processing capacity on which the products are installed  consequently  we receive higher absolute maintenance fees as customers install our products on additional processing capacity 
due to the increased discounting for higher levels of additional processing capacity  the maintenance fees on a per unit of capacity basis are typically reduced in enterprise license agreements 
these discounts  combined with the reduced maintenance percentages for long term contracts discussed above and the recent decline in our license revenues  have led to lower growth rates for our maintenance revenue excluding remedy and magic 
further declines in our license revenue and or increased discounting could lead to declines in our maintenance revenues 
historically  our maintenance renewal rates have been high  but economic and competitive pressures could cause customers to reduce their licensed capacity and  therefore  the capacity upon which our maintenance  enhancement and support fees are charged 
of the total deferred maintenance revenue balance at march   we will recognize maintenance revenues of million  million  million and million in the fiscal years   and thereafter  respectively

our solutions are broadly divided into four core business units 
the enterprise data management group includes products designed for managing database management systems on mainframe and distributed computing platforms 
the enterprise systems management group includes our systems management and monitoring  scheduling and output management solutions 
the remedy group includes our service  change and asset management solutions  including our recent acquisition of magic

our enterprise data management solutions combined represented  and of total software revenues for fiscal  and  respectively 
total software revenues for this group declined from 
table of contents fiscal to fiscal and from fiscal to fiscal in fiscal  the economic conditions discussed above caused both license and maintenance revenues for our mainframe data management products to decline  more than offsetting an increase in maintenance revenue for our distributed systems data management products 
the maintenance revenue decline was primarily a result of lower discounted prices and slowing capacity growth  which was not sufficient to offset these reduced prices 
the decline in fiscal is primarily due to a decrease in license revenues for both the mainframe and distributed systems products 
maintenance revenues for the mainframe products also declined from the prior year  while distributed systems maintenance revenues remained flat 
the decline in license revenues was primarily due to the large increase in the net change in deferred license revenue along with decreased license bookings due to increased competition and slower capacity growth 
our enterprise systems management solutions combined contributed  and of total software revenues for fiscal  and  respectively 
total software revenues for this group declined from fiscal to fiscal and from fiscal to fiscal license revenues decreased in fiscal primarily due to the continued weakness in it spending and a reduction in unix shipments from hardware manufacturers 
these external factors  coupled with delays in customer purchase decisions resulting from delays in our release of significant enhancements to components of the patrol product line during the first half of fiscal  had a direct negative impact on patrol license revenues  more than offsetting license revenue increases for the mainview and scheduling output management product lines and maintenance revenue increases for the patrol and scheduling output management solutions 
the remaining key patrol enhancements were delivered at the end of the third quarter of fiscal though patrol license revenues were down for the second half of fiscal compared to the same period in fiscal  such revenues for the third and fourth quarters increased sequentially over the immediately preceding quarters 
these increases were due  in part  to sales from the newly introduced agentless monitoring product  patrol express 
for fiscal  a significant decrease in license and maintenance revenues for the mainview product line due to increased discounts  more than offset the increase in maintenance revenues for the patrol and scheduling output management product lines 
also contributing to the decline in revenues for this group was the large increase in the net change in deferred license revenues for the patrol and scheduling output management product lines  which offset the increases in license bookings for these products 
the growth in license bookings is primarily the result of increased acceptance of the new version of patrol and transactions generated as a result of our bsm strategy discussed above 
our security solutions contributed of total software revenues for fiscal and fiscal and of total software revenues for fiscal year total software revenues for this group increased from fiscal to fiscal and decreased from fiscal to fiscal this decrease in fiscal was a result of increased competitive pressures

table of contents the declines in both years are the result of our decreased license revenues  which depresses demand for our implementation and integration services 
operating expenses beginning in fiscal  we increased our focus on expense control to better align our cost structure with the realities of a more difficult revenue environment 
this initiative included headcount reductions across all divisions and geographies  office consolidations  elimination of certain product lines and reductions in discretionary spending on items such as travel  consulting fees and equipment

the increase in commission expense in fiscal occurred late in the fiscal year when the actual mix of the license and maintenance components in our largest sales transactions differed from the historical norm  upon which the commission plan was established 
because of this shift in the license and maintenance mix  the commission rate effectively increased during this time period

research  development and support research  development and support expenses mainly comprise personnel costs related to software developers and development support personnel  including software programmers  testing and quality assurance personnel and writers of technical documentation such as product manuals and installation guides 
these expenses also include costs associated with the maintenance  enhancement and support of our products  computer hardware software costs  telecommunications and personnel expenses necessary to maintain our data processing center  royalties and the effect of software development cost capitalization and amortization 
research  development and support costs were reduced in all three fiscal years by amounts capitalized in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed 
the following table summarizes the amounts capitalized and amortized during fiscal  and amortization for these periods includes amounts accelerated for certain software products that were not expected to generate sufficient future revenues to realize the carrying value of the assets 
years ended march  in millions software development and purchased software costs capitalized total amortization net increase decrease in research  development and support expenses accelerated amortization included in total amortization above as a result of the changes in market conditions and research and development headcount reductions during fiscal and fiscal  we focused more on our core businesses 
as part of this effort  we reviewed our product portfolio during fiscal and fiscal and discontinued certain products 
to the extent that there were any capitalized software development costs remaining on the balance sheet related to these products  we accelerated the amortization to write off these balances 
the continued need to accelerate amortization to maintain our capitalized software costs at net realizable value  the results of the valuation performed for the remedy acquisition that indicated a three year life was appropriate for that acquired technology and changes in the average life cycles for certain of our software products caused us to evaluate the estimated economic lives for our internally developed software products 
as a result of this evaluation  we revised the estimated economic lives of certain products as of january   such that most products will be amortized over an estimated life of three years 
these changes in estimated economic lives resulted in an additional million and million of amortization expense in fiscal and fiscal  respectively  and reduced basic and diluted earnings per share for the years ended march  and by per share and per share  respectively 
research  development and support expenses decreased from fiscal to fiscal and increased from fiscal to fiscal excluding the impact of remedy expenses subsequent to the acquisition date and costs related to exit activities  research and development expenses decreased from fiscal to fiscal primarily as a result of reductions in personnel  professional fees and royalty costs which more than offset the net effect of software cost capitalization and amortization detailed above 
excluding the impact of remedy and magic expenses subsequent to their acquisition dates  research  development and support expenses increased in fiscal excluding the impact of remedy and magic expenses and costs related to exit activities  research and development expenses remained flat from fiscal to fiscal  as the net effect of the software cost capitalization and amortization shown above increased overall research  development and support expense  which was offset by decreased personnel costs 
the 
table of contents decrease in software development and purchased software cost capitalization is due to the overall reduction in research and development headcount as compared to the prior year  expansion of our operations into different locations and two significant products becoming generally available ga during the third fiscal quarter of during fiscal  we also wrote off software assets totaling million associated with certain business information integration products that were discontinued during the year as a result of the dissolution of that business unit as part of our restructuring plan

cost of professional services decreased from fiscal to and from fiscal to fiscal excluding the impact of remedy expenses subsequent to the acquisition date and costs related to exit activities  cost of professional services declined from fiscal to fiscal resulting primarily from headcount reductions during the period as a result of the decline in professional services revenues 
excluding the impact of remedy and magic expenses subsequent to their acquisition dates  cost of professional services declined from fiscal to fiscal excluding the impact of remedy and magic expenses and costs related to exit activities  cost of professional services declined from fiscal to fiscal the decrease resulted primarily from lower headcount throughout fiscal and decreased travel and lodging and bad debt expense 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses are comprised primarily of compensation and personnel costs within executive management  finance and accounting  it  facilities management  legal and human resources 
other costs included in general and administrative expenses are fees paid for outside legal and accounting services  consulting projects  insurance and bad debt expense related to maintenance billings 
general and administrative expenses decreased and increased in fiscal years and  respectively 
excluding the impact of remedy expenses subsequent to the acquisition date and costs related to exit activities  general and administrative expenses declined from fiscal to fiscal primarily as a result of reduced bad debt expense  legal fees and shipping costs  which more than offset increases in personnel  insurance and travel costs 
excluding the impact of remedy and magic expenses subsequent to their acquisition dates  general and administrative expenses increased 
excluding the impact of remedy and magic expenses and costs related to exit activities  general and administrative expenses increased from fiscal to fiscal the increase included higher consulting fees  primarily related to sarbanes oxley compliance and an ongoing infrastructure software implementation  higher legal and professional fees and an increase in bad debt expense 
acquired research and development during the years ended march  and  we wrote off acquired in process research and development ipr d totaling million in connection with the acquisition of the assets of remedy and million in connection with the acquisition of the assets of magic  respectively 
we did not record a charge related to acquired in process research and development as a result of our various immaterial acquisitions during the year ended march  or the acquisition of it masters during the year ended march  the amount allocated to ipr d represents the estimated fair value  based on risk adjusted cash flows and historical costs expended  related to incomplete research and development projects 
at the date of acquisitions  the development of these projects had not yet reached technological feasibility  and the research and development in progress had no alternative future uses 
accordingly  these costs were expensed as of the acquisition dates  during the fiscal years and in making the purchase price allocations to ipr d  we considered present value calculations of income  analyses of project accomplishments and remaining outstanding items  assessments of overall contributions  as 
table of contents well as project risks 
the values assigned to purchased in process technology were determined by estimating the costs to develop the acquired technology into commercially viable products  estimating the resulting net cash flows from the projects  and discounting the net cash flows to their present value 
the revenue projections used to value the in process research and development were based on estimates of relevant market sizes and growth factors  expected trends in technology  and the nature and expected timing of new product introductions by us and our competitors 
the resulting net cash flows from such projects are based on our estimates of cost of sales  operating expenses and income taxes from such projects 
in the present value calculations  aggregate revenues for the remedy and magic developed  in process and future products were estimated to grow at compounded annual growth rates of approximately and  respectively  for the five years following acquisition  assuming the successful completion and market acceptance of the major current and future research and development programs 
the estimated revenues for the in process projects were expected to peak within three years of acquisition and then decline sharply as other new products and technologies are expected to enter the market 
a risk adjusted discount rate was applied to the cash flows of each of the products projected income stream for the five years following the acquisition 
these discount rates assume that the risk of revenue streams for new technology is higher than that of existing revenue streams 
the discount rates used in the present value calculations were generally derived from a weighted average cost of capital  adjusted upward to reflect the additional risks inherent in the development life cycle  including the useful life of the technology  profitability levels of the technology and the uncertainty of technology advances that are known at the transaction date 
product specific risk includes the stages of completion of each product  the complexity of the development work completed to date  the likelihood of achieving technological feasibility and market acceptance 
the assumptions used in valuing ipr d were based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate  and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur 
accordingly  actual results may differ from the projected results used to determine fair value 
amortization and impairment of acquired technology  goodwill and intangibles under the purchase accounting method for certain of our acquisitions  portions of the purchase prices were allocated to goodwill  acquired technology and other intangible assets 
prior to april   we were amortizing all of these intangibles over three to five year periods  which reflected the estimated useful lives of the respective assets 
as of april   we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
in accordance with this statement  goodwill and those intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized  but rather are tested for impairment annually and when events or circumstances indicate that their fair value has been reduced below carrying value 
acquired technology continues to be amortized under sfas no 
see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation of our reported net earnings loss and earnings loss per share to those amounts that would have resulted had there been no amortization of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for all periods presented 
we assigned our goodwill to the applicable reporting units and tested it for impairment  upon adoption of sfas no 
as of april   and as of january  and for the required annual testing 
the fair value of each of our reporting units with goodwill assigned exceeded the respective carrying value of the reporting unit s allocated net assets  including goodwill  and therefore  no goodwill was considered impaired as of any date 
during fiscal  we performed an assessment of the carrying values of our acquired technology  goodwill and intangibles recorded in connection with various acquisitions 
the assessment was performed because sustained negative economic conditions impacted our operations and expected future revenues 
economic indicators at that time suggested that such conditions could continue for the foreseeable future 
as a result  we recorded impairment charges of million related to acquired technology to reflect these assets at their then current estimated net realizable values and million related to goodwill to reflect these assets at their then current estimated fair values 
these charges are reflected together with amortization expense in 
table of contents the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss for fiscal  as amortization and impairment of acquired technology  goodwill and intangibles 
we evaluated our acquired technology under the provisions of sfas no 
 our other intangibles under the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and of long lived assets to be disposed of  and our enterprise level goodwill under the provisions of accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 intangible assets 
the impairment charges for acquired technology reflect the amounts by which the carrying values exceeded the estimated net realizable values of the products 
the net realizable values for acquired technology were estimated as the future gross revenues from the products reduced by the estimated future costs of completing and disposing of the products  including the costs of performing maintenance and customer support required to satisfy our responsibilities set forth at the time of sale 
the impairment charges for goodwill reflect the amounts by which the carrying values exceeded the estimated fair values of these assets 
fair value was determined by estimated future net cash flows related to these assets 
no impairment was identified for our other intangible assets 
impairment charges recorded in fiscal by asset category were as follows total acquired impairment technology goodwill charge in millions acquisition new dimension evity optisystems perform sa total we review the realizability of acquired technology  goodwill and intangibles on an ongoing basis  and when there is an indication of impairment  we perform the procedures under the applicable accounting pronouncements to quantify any impairment that exists 
determining the amount of impairment of these assets  if any  requires that we estimate future cash flows and make judgments regarding discount rates and other variables that impact the net realizable value or fair value of those assets  as applicable 
actual future cash flows and other assumed variables could differ from our estimates 
future impairment charges could be material 
exit activities and related costs during fiscal  we implemented a restructuring plan to better align our cost structure with existing market conditions 
this plan included the involuntary termination of  employees during the year 
these actions were across all divisions and geographies and the affected employees received cash severance packages 
during fiscal  we also discontinued certain business information integration products as a result of the dissolution of that business unit  and announced the closure of certain locations throughout the world 
a charge of million was recorded during fiscal for employee severance  the write off of software assets related to discontinued products  net of proceeds from the sale of a portion of the related technology  and office closures 
as of march   all disbursements related to this restructuring plan had been paid 
during fiscal  we sold our enterprise data propagation edp technology for a minority equity investment in the purchaser and future cash payments to be made based on the purchaser s quarterly sales to our former edp customers over the following four years 
as these products were part of the discontinued business information integration products  the proceeds will be recorded as a reduction of restructuring costs  as a recovery of the amount previously written off for these products 
for fiscal  proceeds of million were recorded  reflecting the estimated fair value of the equity investment received 
as the future cash payments  if any  cannot be estimated  they will be recorded in the periods received as a reduction of 
table of contents restructuring costs up to the amount previously written off 
any receipts in excess of the related asset write off will be reflected as other income 
the expenses related to the exit activities are reflected in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss as follows year ended march  write off of severance software related incremental development costs facilities depreciation costs total selling and marketing expenses research  development and support expenses cost of professional services general and administrative expenses total included in operating expenses during fiscal  we implemented a plan to better align our cost structure with existing market conditions 
this plan included the involuntary termination of approximately employees during the year ended march  the workforce reduction was across all functions and geographies and affected employees were provided cash separation packages 
as a global enterprise  we have been expanding our operations for a number of years in attractive labor markets  including in our offices in india and israel 
our plan to better align our cost structure with existing market conditions has  to an extent  accelerated our existing global expansion plans by exiting leases in certain locations around the world  reducing the square footage required to operate those locations and relocating those operations to lower cost facilities 
these relocation efforts were completed as of december  charges for exit costs of million were recorded for the year ended march   for employee severance and related costs and exited leases 
additionally  million of incremental depreciation expense was recorded during the year ended march   related to the changes in estimated depreciable lives for leasehold improvements in locations to be exited and for certain information technology assets that will be eliminated as a result of the plan 
these changes in estimated lives reduced basic and diluted earnings per share by for the year ended march  the expenses related to the exit activities are reflected in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss as follows year ended march  severance related incremental costs facilities depreciation total in millions selling and marketing expenses research  development and support expenses cost of professional services general and administrative expenses total included in operating expenses

we expect annual operating expense savings of approximately million to million relative to our projected personnel and facilities expenses before our restructuring actions 
we began to realize savings in our third fiscal quarter related to personnel and facilities costs 
merger related costs and compensation charges during fiscal and  we recorded merger related compensation charges of million and million  respectively 
these compensation charges are primarily related to the vesting of common stock issued as part of the evity acquisition in fiscal to certain evity employee shareholders who we employed after the acquisition 
vesting was complete during the first quarter of fiscal also during fiscal million of previously accrued merger costs related to the boole merger were reversed  as certain lease and severance obligations were satisfied at amounts below the amounts originally estimated 
these reversals are reflected as a reduction of merger related costs and compensation charges in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss for fiscal other income  net other income  net  consists primarily of interest earned on cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities and finance receivables  gains and losses on marketable securities and other investments and interest expense on capital leases and short term borrowings 
other income  net  decreased from fiscal to fiscal and increased from fiscal to fiscal in fiscal  the decrease in other income  net  primarily relates to increased write downs of marketable securities as a result of fair value declines determined to be other than temporary totaling million 
fiscal other income  net  also included million of impairment charges related to other equity investments 
the increase in fiscal other income  net  is due to the gain on the licensing of our patrol storage manager product to emc corporation  increased investment income  including the realized recovery of previously written down marketable securities  and an increase in rental income over the prior year  which was slightly offset by million of impairment charges related to other equity investments 
provision for income taxes we recorded an income tax benefit of million in fiscal  an income tax expense of million in fiscal and an income tax benefit of million in fiscal our effective tax rates were   and for fiscal  and  respectively 
the effective tax rate is impacted primarily by the tax effect of lower income taxes on foreign earnings  tax exempt interest income  state income taxes and other 
table of contents non deductible items 
in fiscal  we recorded a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets of million  of which million impacted our effective tax rate 
for a detailed analysis of the differences between the statutory and effective income tax rates  see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
in evaluating our ability to realize our net deferred tax asset we consider all available evidence  both positive and negative  including our past operating results  the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent fiscal years  tax planning strategies  and our forecast of future taxable income 
in considering these sources of taxable income  we are responsible for making certain assumptions and judgments that are based on the plans and estimates we use to manage the underlying business of the company 
changes in our assumptions and estimates may materially impact the company s income tax expense for the period 
we will continue to evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis 
during fiscal  we determined that this positive and negative evidence did not support recording the entire net deferred tax asset available 
in accordance with this judgment  we have recorded a valuation allowance of million against the net deferred tax asset 
see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for more information regarding our deferred tax assets 
we provide for united states income taxes on the earnings of foreign subsidiaries unless they are considered permanently invested outside of the united states or these foreign earnings would be remitted to the united states without incremental united states tax cost because of foreign tax credits 
at march   the cumulative earnings upon which united states taxes have not been provided were approximately million 
if these earnings were repatriated to the united states  or they were no longer permanently re invested under apb  the potential deferred tax liability for these earnings would be approximately million  assuming full utilization of the foreign tax credits associated with these earnings 
we have federal net operating loss carryforwards of million that will expire between and  foreign tax credit carryforwards of million that will expire between and and research and development tax credit carryforwards of million that will expire in of the million net operating loss carryforwards  million will expire in if we were not able to utilize the million net operating loss  the expiration of this deferred tax asset would be partially offset by a million valuation allowance that is recorded against this asset 
of the million foreign tax credit carryforwards  million will expire in we do not have a valuation allowance recorded against this million deferred tax asset and if it expires unutilized we would record additional deferred tax expense of million in fiscal as disclosed in previous filings  our corporate income tax returns for the fiscal years ended march  and were audited by the internal revenue service irs 
the irs proposed certain adjustments to our tax returns  and we filed a protest to the irs appeals appeals division 
we continue to work with appeals to finalize these audits 
the irs also issued a revenue agent s report rar to us on march   for the fiscal years ended march  and the changes proposed by the rar are primarily related to our inter company pricing with our foreign affiliate vis vis the us internal revenue code section rules and the regulations therein 
we have filed a formal protest and requested a conference with the office of appeals

table of contents liquidity and capital resources one of our key strategies is to maintain and improve our capital structure 
the key metrics we focus on in analyzing the strength of our balance sheet are summarized in the table below years ended march  in millions cash provided by operating activities cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities accounts receivable  net includes current finance receivables days sales outstanding q treasury stock acquired cash paid for technology acquisitions and other investments  net of cash acquired includes both short and long term marketable securities 
operating activities the table below aggregates certain line items from the cash flow statement to present the key items affecting cash from operating activities in millions years ended march  net income loss after non cash adjustments decrease in accounts receivable and finance receivables increase in current and long term deferred revenue all other  net net cash provided by operating activities the full consolidated statements of cash flows is included in the consolidated financial statements 
in fiscal  the company received a significant tax refund 
in fiscal  the decrease in net income loss after non cash adjustments is primarily due to a net loss for the period and a build up of deferred income tax benefits 
we continue to finance our operations primarily through funds generated from operations 
our primary source of cash is the sale of our software licenses  software maintenance and professional services 
we believe that our existing cash balances and funds generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future 
however  we have a history of acquiring companies 
if we were to make a significant acquisition in the future  we might find it advantageous to utilize third party financing sources based on factors such as our then available cash  its source domestic vs 
international  the cost of financing and our internal cost of capital 
the net decrease in receivables was the result of strong management focus on collections as evidenced in our days sales outstanding  days for the fourth quarter in fiscal to days for the fourth quarter in fiscal the success of the recently introduced flexible license offerings was a key driver in the growth in bookings  which resulted in incremental cash flows 
our working capital as of march   was million  reflecting an increase from the march  balance of million due primarily to positive operating cash flow from operations and an increase in current marketable securities due to the timing of the securities respective maturities 

table of contents investing activities the table below aggregates certain line items from the cash flow statement to present the key items affecting investing activities in millions years ended march  cash paid for technology acquisitions and other investments  net of cash acquired purchases of property and equipment all other  net net cash used in investing activities the full consolidated statements of cash flows is included in the consolidated financial statements 
during fiscal  we acquired it masters and the assets of remedy  and in fiscal  we acquired the assets of magic 
purchases of property and equipment are primarily for computer hardware and software  as well as leasehold improvements 
the main components of other cash used in investing activities were the net purchases of marketable securities and capitalization of software development costs 
financing activities the table below aggregates certain line items from the cash flow statement to present the key items affecting our financing activities in millions years ended march  payments on borrowings treasury stock acquired all other  net net cash used in financing activities the full consolidated statements of cash flows is included in the consolidated financial statements 
there were no borrowings during fiscal and the main use of cash in financing activities was the acquisition of treasury stock 
during the year  approximately million shares of treasury stock were purchased 
we plan to be consistent with our historical treasury stock purchase practices  subject to market conditions  other possible uses of our cash and our domestic liquidity position 
see item market for registrant s common equity and related stockholder matters issuer purchases of equity securities 
the exercise of stock options was the primary source of cash in financing activities 
cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities at march   our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities were  million  an increase of million from the march  balance 
as discussed in more detail below  this increase is primarily due to positive operating cash flow  which was offset by the cash funding for the magic acquisition and other investing activities and treasury stock purchases 
approximately three quarters of the  million of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities at march  is held in international locations 
table of contents and was largely generated from our international operations 
our international operations have generated approximately million of earnings for which us income taxes have not been recorded 
these earnings would be subject to us income tax if repatriated to the united states 
the potential deferred tax liability for these earnings is approximately million  however  we have not provided a deferred tax liability on any portion of the million as we plan to utilize our cash in international locations for foreign investment purposes 
during fiscal and  we utilized cash held in international locations to fund a portion of the remedy purchase price  based upon the valuation of the foreign assets of remedy acquired  the it masters purchase price and the assets of magic 
our marketable securities are primarily investment grade and highly liquid 
because of current economic trends  we have begun investing in securities with shorter original maturities 
on december   we reclassified our held to maturity portfolio to the available for sale portfolio 
the amortized cost recorded on the balance sheet for the transferred securities was million at the date of reclassification 
when the securities were transferred to the available for sale portfolio  a net unrealized gain of million was recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
the transfer of securities from the held to maturity portfolio was made to increase our flexibility to react to the unprecedented volatility in the debt securities markets that developed over the quarters preceding the date of transfer 
finance receivables we provide financing on a portion of our sales transactions to customers that meet our specified standards of creditworthiness 
our practice of providing financing at reasonable interest rates enhances our competitive position 
we participate in established programs with third party financial institutions to securitize or sell a significant portion of our finance receivables  enabling us to collect cash sooner and remove credit risk 
when we sell receivables in securitizations  we retain a beneficial interest in the securitized receivables  which is subordinate to the interests of the investors in the securitization conduit entities 
at march  and  the fair value of our retained subordinate interests was million and million  respectively  and is included in long term finance receivables in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
our maximum exposure to loss at march   as a result of our involvement with the conduit entities is limited to the carrying value of the retained subordinate interest 
other finance receivables are sold to third party financial institutions on a non recourse basis 
we record such transfers of beneficial interests in finance receivables to third party financial institutions as sales of such finance receivables when we have surrendered control of such receivables  including determining that such assets have been isolated beyond our reach and the reach of our creditors 
we have not guaranteed the transferred receivables and have no obligation upon default 
during the years ended march   and  we transferred million  million and million  respectively  of such receivables through these programs 
the high credit quality of our finance receivables and the existence of these third party facilities extend our ability to offer financing to qualifying customers on an ongoing basis 
however  to meet the needs of our customers we have been providing more licensing options  and this increased focus on flexibility may lead to more customer transactions where cash payments will be received over time 
this flexibility will reduce our ability to transfer finance receivables in the future and will reduce our cash flow from operations in the near term 
see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
beginning in the quarter ended december   the change in long term finance receivables has been reported as a component of cash flows from operating activities  whereas this was previously reported as a component of cash flows from investing activities 
all periods presented have been reclassified for consistency 
the change in long term finance receivables increased net cash provided by operating activities by million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million for fiscal  respectively 
treasury stock purchased on april   our board of directors authorized the purchase of up to million in common stock  and on july   they authorized the purchase of an additional million 
during the year ended march   we purchased million shares for million 
from the inception of the repurchase plan through march   we have purchased million shares for million 
the 
table of contents repurchase program is funded solely with domestic cash and investments  and  therefore  affects the overall domestic versus foreign liquidity balances 
contractual obligations following is a summary of our contractual obligations as of march  payments due by period years years after years total capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations total contractual obligations represents obligations under agreements with non cancelable terms to purchases goods or services 
the agreements are enforceable and legally binding  and specify specific terms  including quantities to be purchased and the timing of the purchase 
total does not include contractual obligations recorded on the balance sheet as current liabilities  other than capital lease obligations 
off balance sheet arrangements we use off balance sheet arrangements where the economics and sound business principles warrant their use 
our principal use of off balance sheet arrangements occurs in connection with the securitization and sale of financial assets generated in the ordinary course of business by us and our subsidiaries 
the assets securitized and sold transferred by us consist principally of trade finance receivables 
we utilize a financial subsidiary and various wholly owned special purpose entities in these transfers 
these entities are fully consolidated in our financial statements 
we record the transfers as sales of the related accounts receivable when we are considered to have surrendered control of such receivables in accordance with sfas  accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  in fiscal and we sold securitized finance receivables from customers with investment grade credit ratings through two special purpose entities sponsored by third party financial institutions 
these entities are multi seller conduits with access to commercial paper markets the conduit entities that purchase interests in receivables from numerous other unrelated companies  as well as bmc 
in a securitization transaction  we sell a senior interest in the receivables at a discount to a conduit entity in exchange for cash 
though wholly owned and consolidated by bmc  the special purpose entity s assets are legally isolated from our general creditors  and the conduit entities investors have no recourse to our other assets for the failure of our customers to pay when due 
we have no ownership in either of the conduit entities and have no voting influence over the conduit entities operating and financial decisions 
we retain a beneficial interest in securitized receivables which is subordinate to the interests of the investors in the conduit entities 
the value of our retained subordinate interests is subject to credit and interest rate risk on the transferred financial assets 
we expect the use of off balance sheet arrangements by us to decrease as we continue to offer more flexible license terms to our customers 
acquisitions in late april  we announced the signing of a definitive merger agreement with marimba 
the proposed acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions  including the approval of marimba s stockholders  and we anticipate closing this transaction during the second fiscal quarter 
our expected purchase price is approximately million 
this acquisition will strengthen our bsm related offerings through the addition of discovery and asset  change and configuration management capabilities 
we plan to fund the net cash purchase price from existing cash balances 

table of contents certain risks and uncertainties we operate in a dynamic and rapidly changing environment that involves numerous risks and uncertainties 
the following section describes some  but not all  of the risks and uncertainties that we believe may adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we may experience a shortfall in revenue  license bookings or earnings in any given quarter or may announce lower than forecasted revenue  license bookings or earnings  which could cause our stock price to decline 
our revenue  license bookings and earnings are difficult to forecast and are likely to fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to many factors 
in addition  a significant amount of our license transactions are completed during the final weeks and days of the quarter  and therefore we generally do not know whether revenue  earnings  license bookings and or cash flows will have met expectations until shortly after the end of the quarter 
any significant revenue  license bookings or earnings shortfall or lowered forecasts could cause our stock price to decline substantially 
factors that could affect our financial results include  but are not limited to the unpredictability of the timing and magnitude of our sales through direct sales channels  value added resellers and distributors  which tend to occur late in each quarter  the possibility that our customers may choose to license our software under terms and conditions that require revenues to be deferred or recognized ratably over time rather than upfront and that we may not accurately forecast the resulting mix of license transactions between upfront and deferred revenues  the possibility that our customers may defer or limit purchases as a result of reduced information technology budgets or reduced data processing capacity demand  the possibility that our customers may elect not to license our products for additional processing capacity until their actual processing capacity or expected future processing capacity exceeds the capacity they have already licensed from us  the possibility that our customers may defer purchases of our products in anticipation of new products or product updates from us or our competitors  the timing of new product introductions by us and the market s acceptance of new products  higher than expected operating expenses changes in our pricing and distribution terms or those of our competitors  and the possibility that our business will be adversely affected as a result of the threat of significant external events that increase global economic uncertainty 
investors should not rely on the results of prior periods as an indication of our future performance 
our operating expense levels are based  in significant part  on our expectations of future revenue 
if we have a shortfall in revenue in any given quarter  we will not be able to reduce our operating expenses for that quarter proportionally in response 
therefore  any significant shortfall in revenue will likely have an immediate adverse effect on our operating results for that quarter 
the markets for some or all of our key product lines may not grow 
some or all of our key product lines may not grow  may decline in growth  or customers may decline or forgo use of products in some or all of these product areas 
a decline in these product areas could result in decreased demand for our products  which would adversely impact our business  financial condition  operating results  and cash flow 
currently  a significant portion of our planned revenue growth is attributable to the remedy product line 
although we believe that businesses will continue to demand the products in this area  there can be no assurance as to whether such future demand will continue to grow or not 
slower growth in this line will adversely affect our revenues 

table of contents we may have difficulty achieving our cash flow from operations goal 
our quarterly cash flow is and has been volatile 
if our cash generated from operations proved in some future period to be materially less than the market expects  the market price of our common stock could decline 
to meet the needs of our customers  we have been providing more licensing options  and this increased focus on flexibility may lead to more contracts that will be recognized ratably versus upfront and where cash payments may be received over time versus upfront 
factors that could adversely affect our cash flow from operations in the future include reduced net earnings  increased time required for the collection of accounts receivable  an increase in uncollectible accounts receivable  a significant shift from multi year committed contracts to short term contracts  a reduced ability to transfer finance receivables to third parties and thus increased financing provided by us  an increase in contracts where expenses such as sales commissions are paid upfront but payments from customers are collected over time  reduced renewal rates for maintenance  and a reduced yield from marketable securities and cash and cash equivalents balances 
maintenance revenue could decline 
maintenance revenues have increased in each of the last three fiscal years as a result of the continuing growth in the base of installed products and the processing capacity on which they run 
maintenance fees increase as the processing capacity on which the products are installed increases  consequently  we receive higher absolute maintenance fees as customers install our products on additional processing capacity 
due to increased discounting for higher levels of additional processing capacity  the maintenance fees on a per unit of capacity basis are typically reduced in enterprise license agreements 
in addition  customers may be entitled to reduced maintenance percentages for entering into long term maintenance contracts that include prepayment of the maintenance fees or that are supported by a formal financing arrangement 
these discounts  combined with reduced maintenance percentages for long term contracts and the recent decline in our license revenues  have led to lower growth rates for our maintenance revenue  excluding the impact of remedy revenues subsequent to the acquisition date 
further declines in our license revenue and or increased discounting would lead to declines in our maintenance revenues 
although renewal rates remain high  should customers migrate from their mainframe applications or find alternatives to our products  increased cancellations could lead to declines in our maintenance revenue 
our stock price is volatile 
our stock price has been and is highly volatile 
our stock price is highly influenced by current expectations of our future revenues  earnings and cash flows from operations 
any failure to meet anticipated revenue  earnings and cash flow from operations levels in a period or any negative change in our perceived long term growth prospects would likely have a significant adverse effect on our stock price 
intense competition and pricing pressures could adversely affect our earnings 
the market for systems management software is highly competitive 
we compete with a variety of software vendors including ibm  hewlett packard hp  computer associates ca and a number of smaller software vendors 
we derived a significant portion of our total revenues in fiscal from software products for ibm and ibm compatible mainframe computers 
ibm continues  directly and through third parties  to enhance and market its utilities for ims and db as lower cost alternatives to the solutions provided by us and other independent software vendors 
although such utilities are currently less functional than our solutions  ibm continues to invest in the ims and db utility market 
if ibm is successful with its efforts to achieve performance and functional equivalence with our ims  db and other products at a lower cost  our business would be materially adversely affected 
in addition  ibm has announced its intention to acquire candle corporation whose products compete primarily with our mainview mainframe monitoring product line 
as a large hardware vendor and outsourcer of it services  ibm has the ability to bundle its other goods and services with its software and offer packaged solutions to customers  which could result in increased pricing pressure 
to date  our solutions have competed well against ibm s because we have developed advanced automation and artificial intelligence features and our utilities have maintained a speed advantage 
in addition  we believe that because we provide enterprise management solutions across multiple 
table of contents platforms we are better positioned to provide customers with comprehensive management solutions for their complex multi vendor it environments than integrated hardware and software companies like ibm 
ca is also competing with us in these markets 
competition has led to increased pricing pressures within the mainframe software markets 
we continue to reduce the cost to our customers of our mainframe tools and utilities in response to such competitive pressures 
although to date we have not experienced significant competition from microsoft  their dominant position in the operating system market makes them capable of exerting competitive pressure in the systems management market as well 
we also face competition from several niche software vendors  particularly for our distributed systems product lines 
in addition  the software industry is experiencing continued consolidation 
there is a risk that some of our competitors may combine and consolidate market positions or combine technology  making them stronger competitors 
our products must remain compatible with ever changing operating and database environments 
ibm  hp  microsoft and oracle are by far the largest suppliers of systems and database software and  in many cases  are the manufacturers of the computer hardware systems used by most of our customers 
historically  operating and database system developers have modified or introduced new operating systems  database systems  systems software and computer hardware 
such new products could incorporate features which perform functions currently performed by our products or could require substantial modification of our products to maintain compatibility with these companies hardware or software 
although we have to date been able to adapt our products and our business to changes introduced by hardware manufacturers and operating and database system software developers  there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so in the future 
failure to adapt our products in a timely manner to such changes or customer decisions to forego the use of our products in favor of those with comparable functionality contained either in the hardware or operating system could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
future product development is dependent upon access to third party source code 
in the past  licensees using proprietary operating systems were furnished with source code  which makes the operating system generally understandable to programmers  and object code  which directly controls the hardware and other technical documentation 
since the availability of source code facilitated the development of systems and applications software  which must interface with the operating systems  independent software vendors such as bmc software were able to develop and market compatible software 
ibm and other hardware vendors have a policy of restricting the use or availability of the source code for some of their operating systems 
to date  this policy has not had a material effect on us 
some companies  however  may adopt more restrictive policies in the future or impose unfavorable terms and conditions for such access 
these restrictions may  in the future  result in higher research and development costs for us in connection with the enhancement and modification of our existing products and the development of new products 
although we do not expect that such restrictions will have this adverse effect  there can be no assurances that such restrictions or other restrictions will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
future product development is dependent upon early access to third party operating and database systems 
operating and database system software developers have in the past provided us with early access to pre generally available ga versions of their software in order to have input into the functionality and to ensure that we can adapt our software to exploit new functionality in these systems 
some companies  however  may adopt more restrictive policies in the future or impose unfavorable terms and conditions for such access 
these restrictions may result in higher research and development costs for us in connection with the enhancement and modification of our existing products and the development of new products 
although we do not expect that such restrictions will have this adverse effect  there can be no assurances that such restrictions or other restrictions will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 

table of contents future product development and sales are dependent on access to and reliability of third party software products 
certain of our software products contain components developed and maintained by third party software vendors 
we expect that we may have to incorporate software from third party vendors in our future products or product offerings 
we may not be able to replace the functionality provided by the third party software currently offered with our products if that software becomes obsolete  defective or incompatible with future versions of our products or is not adequately maintained or updated or if our relationship with the third party vendor terminates 
although we believe there are adequate alternate sources for the technology licensed to us  any significant interruption in the availability of these third party software products on commercially acceptable terms or defects in these products could delay development of future products or enhancement of future products and harm our sales 
this could adversely affect our business  financial condition  operating results and cash flows 
failure to adapt to technological change could adversely affect our earnings 
if we fail to keep pace with technological change in our industry  such failure would have an adverse effect on our revenues and earnings 
we operate in a highly competitive industry characterized by rapid technological change  evolving industry standards  changes in customer requirements and frequent new product introductions and enhancements 
during the past several years  many new technological advancements and competing products entered the marketplace 
the distributed systems and application management markets in which we operate are far more crowded and competitive than our traditional mainframe systems management markets 
our ability to compete effectively and our growth prospects depend upon many factors  including the success of our existing distributed systems products  the timely introduction and success of future software products  and the ability of our products to interoperate and perform well with existing and future leading databases and other platforms supported by our products 
we have experienced long development cycles and product delays in the past  particularly with some of our distributed systems products  and expect to have delays in the future 
delays in new product introductions or less than anticipated market acceptance of these new products are possible and would have an adverse effect on our revenues and earnings 
discovery of errors in our software could adversely affect our earnings 
the software products we offer are inherently complex 
despite testing and quality control  we cannot be certain that errors will not be found in current versions  new versions or enhancements of our products after commencement of commercial shipments 
if new or existing customers have difficulty deploying our products or require significant amounts of customer support  our operating margins could be harmed 
moreover  we could face possible claims and higher development costs if our software contains undetected errors or if we fail to meet our customers expectations 
these risks are increased as we implement our bsm strategy because as part of this strategy  we are combining already complex products to create solutions that are even more complicated than the aggregation of their product components 
significant technical challenges also arise with our products because our customers purchase and deploy our products across a variety of computer platforms and integrate them with a number of third party software applications and databases 
these combinations increase our risk further because in the event of a system wide failure  it may be difficult to determine which product is at fault  thus  we may be harmed by the failure of another supplier s products 
as a result of the foregoing  we could experience loss of or delay in revenues and loss of market share  loss of customers  damage to our reputation  failure to achieve market acceptance  diversion of development resources  increased service and warranty costs  
table of contents legal actions by customers against us which could  whether or not successful  increase costs and distract our management  and increased insurance costs 
in addition  a product liability claim  whether or not successful  could be time consuming and costly and thus could have a materially adverse affect on our business  results of operations or financial positions 
failure to maintain our existing distribution channels and develop additional channels in the future could adversely affect revenues and earnings 
with the acquisition of remedy  the percentage of our revenue from sales of our products and services through distribution channels such as systems integrators and value added resellers is increasing 
conducting business through indirect distribution channels presents a number of risks  including each of our systems integrators and value added resellers can cease marketing our products and services with limited or no notice and with little or no penalty  we may not be able to replace existing or recruit additional systems integrator or value added resellers if we lose any of our existing ones  our existing systems integrators and value added resellers may not be able to effectively sell new products and services that we may introduce  we do not have direct control over the business practices adopted by our systems integrators and value added resellers  our systems integrators and value added resellers may also offer competitive products and services and as such  may not give priority to the marketing of our products and services as compared to our competitors products  and we may face conflicts between the activities of our indirect channels and our direct sales and marketing activities 
changes in pricing practices could adversely affect revenues and earnings 
we may choose to make changes to our product packaging  pricing or licensing programs in response to competition or customer demands or as a means to differentiate our product offerings 
if made  such changes may have a material adverse impact on revenues or earnings 
our customers may not accept our product strategies 
historically  we have focused on selling software products to address specific customer problems associated with their applications 
our bsm strategy requires us to integrate multiple software products so that they work together to provide comprehensive systems management solutions 
there can be no assurance that customers will perceive a need for such solutions 
in addition  there may be technical difficulties in integrating individual products into a combined solution that may delay the introduction of such solutions to the market or adversely affect the demand for such solutions 
we may also adopt different sales strategies for marketing our products  and there can be no assurance that our strategies for selling solutions will be successful 
changes to compensation of our sales organization may have unintended effects 
we update our compensation plan for the sales organization periodically 
these plans are intended to align with our business objectives of providing customer flexibility and satisfaction 
the compensation plan may encourage behavior not anticipated or intended as it is implemented  which could adversely affect our business  financial condition  operating results  and cash flow 

table of contents risks related to business combinations 
as part of our overall strategy  we have acquired or invested in  and plan to continue to acquire or invest in  complementary companies  products  and technologies and to enter into joint ventures and strategic alliances with other companies 
risks commonly encountered in such transactions include the difficulty of assimilating the operations and personnel of the combined companies  the risk that we may not be able to integrate the acquired technologies or products with our current products and technologies  the potential disruption of our ongoing business  the inability to retain key technical  sales and managerial personnel  the inability of management to maximize our financial and strategic position through the successful integration of acquired businesses  the risk that revenues from acquired companies  products and technologies do not meet our expectations  and decreases in reported earnings as a result of charges for in process research and development and amortization of acquired intangible assets 
for us to maximize the return on our investments in acquired companies  the products of these entities must be integrated with our existing products 
these integrations can be difficult and unpredictable  especially given the complexity of software and that acquired technology is typically developed independently and designed with no regard to integration 
the difficulties are compounded when the products involved are well established because compatibility with the existing base of installed products must be preserved 
successful integration also requires coordination of different development and engineering teams 
this too can be difficult and unpredictable because of possible cultural conflicts and different opinions on technical decisions and product roadmaps 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our product integration efforts or that we will realize the expected benefits 
with each of our acquisitions  we have initiated efforts to integrate the disparate cultures  employees  systems and products of these companies 
retention of key employees is critical to ensure the continued advancement  development  support  sales and marketing efforts pertaining to the acquired products 
we have implemented retention programs to keep many of the key technical  sales and marketing employees of acquired companies  nonetheless  we have lost some key employees and may lose others in the future 
unanticipated changes in our effective tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect our profitability 
we carry out our business operations through legal entities in the us and multiple foreign jurisdictions 
these operations require that we file corporate income tax returns that are subject to us  state and foreign tax laws 
the us  state and foreign tax liabilities are determined  in part  by the amount of operating profit generated in these different taxing jurisdictions 
our effective tax rate and net earnings could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of operating profits generated in countries with higher statutory tax rates 
we are also required to evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets 
this evaluation requires that our management assess the positive and negative evidence regarding sources of future taxable income 
if management s assessment regarding the realizability of our deferred tax asset changes or we are presented with additional negative evidence regarding future sources of taxable income  we will be required to increase our valuation allowance  which will negatively impact our effective tax rate and net earnings 
we are also subject to routine corporate income tax audits in multiple jurisdictions 
our provision for income taxes includes amounts intended to satisfy income tax assessments that may result from the examination of our corporate tax returns that have been filed in these jurisdictions 
the amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of these examinations could be materially different from the amounts included in the provision for income taxes and result in additional tax expense 
enforcement of our intellectual property rights 
we rely on a combination of copyright  patent  trademark  trade secrets  confidentiality procedures and contractual procedures to protect our intellectual property rights 
despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights  it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy certain portions of our products or to reverse engineer or obtain and use technology or other information that we regard as proprietary 
there can also be no assurance that our intellectual property rights would survive a legal challenge to their validity or 
table of contents provide significant protection for us 
in addition  the laws of certain countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that we will be able to protect our proprietary technology against unauthorized third party copying or use  which could adversely affect our competitive position 
possibility of infringement claims 
from time to time  we receive notices from third parties claiming infringement by our products of patent and other intellectual property rights 
we expect that software products will increasingly be subject to such claims as the number of products and competitors in our industry segments grows and the functionality of products overlaps 
in addition  we may receive more patent infringement claims as companies increasingly seek to patent their software and business methods and enforce such patents  especially given the increase in software and business method patents issued during the past several years 
regardless of its merit  responding to any such claim could be time consuming  result in costly litigation and require us to enter into royalty and licensing agreements  which may not be offered or available on terms acceptable to us 
if a successful claim is made against us and we fail to develop or license a substitute technology  our business  results of operations or financial position could be materially adversely affected 
risks related to global operations 
we maintain research and development operations in israel  france and india  as well as the us  and continue to expand our international sales activities as part of our business strategy 
as a result  we face increasing risks from our international operations  including  among others difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  risk of actions that are inconsistent with acceptable business practices  longer payment cycles  seasonal reductions in business activity in europe  increased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities  potentially adverse tax consequences  changes in currency exchange rates  potential loss of proprietary information due to piracy  misappropriation or weaker laws regarding intellectual property protection  the need to localize our products  political unrest or terrorism  particularly in areas in which we have facilities  compliance with a wide variety of complex foreign laws and treaties  and licenses  tariffs and other trade barriers 
we maintain a software development and information technology operations office in india  which operates as an extension of our primary development and information technology operations  and we contract with third party developers in india 
as other software companies have done and are continuing to do  we plan to continue to allocate more development and it resources to india with the expectation of achieving significant efficiencies  including reducing operational costs and permitting an around the clock development cycle 
to date  the dispute between india and pakistan involving the kashmir region has not adversely affected our operations in india 
should we be unable to conduct operations in india in the future  we believe that our business could be temporarily adversely affected 
we conduct substantial development and marketing operations in multiple locations in israel and  accordingly  we are directly affected by economic  political and military conditions in israel 
any major hostilities involving israel or the interruption or curtailment of trade between israel and its present trading 
table of contents partners could materially adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
we maintain comprehensive contingency and business continuity plans  and to date  the current conflict in the region and hostilities within israel have not caused disruption of our operations located in israel 
generally  our foreign sales are denominated in our foreign subsidiaries local currencies 
if these currency exchange rates change unexpectedly  we could have significant gains or losses 
the foreign currency to which we currently have the most significant exposure is the euro 
additionally  fluctuations of the exchange rate of foreign currencies against the us dollar can affect our revenue within those markets  all of which may adversely impact our business  financial condition  operating results  and cash flow 
currently  we use derivative financial instruments to hedge our exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
such hedging requires us to estimate when transactions will occur and cash will be collected  and we may not be successful in making these estimates 
if these estimates are inaccurate  particularly during periods of currency volatility  it could have a materially adverse affect on our on our business  results of operations or financial positions 
accounting pronouncements under consideration related to stock based compensation would reduce our reported earnings and could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain key personnel by reducing the stock based compensation we are able to provide 
we have used stock options and other long term equity incentives as a fundamental component of our employee compensation packages 
we believe that stock options and other long term equity incentives directly motivate our employees to maximize long term stockholder value and  through the use of vesting  encourage employees to remain with bmc software 
in accounting for our stock option grants using the intrinsic value method under the provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
 we recognize no compensation cost because the exercise price of options granted is equal to the market value of our common stock on the date of grant 
the financial accounting standards board fasb has proposed changes to us generally accepted accounting principles that  if implemented  would require us to record charges to earnings for employee stock option grants  which would negatively impact our earnings 
for example  as disclosed in note k to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  recording charges for employee stock options using the fair value method under sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation would have reduced net earnings by million  million and million for fiscal years  and  respectively 
in addition  new regulations adopted by the new york stock exchange requiring stockholder approval for all stock option plans as well as new regulations prohibiting nyse member organizations from giving a proxy to vote on equity compensation plans unless the beneficial owner of the shares has given voting instructions could make it more difficult for us to grant options to employees in the future 
to the extent that new regulations make it more difficult or costly to grant options and or other stock based compensation to employees  we may incur increased cash compensation costs or find it difficult to attract  retain and motivate employees  either of which could materially adversely affect our business 
possible adverse impact of interpretations of existing accounting pronouncements 
on april  and we adopted aicpa sop  software revenue recognition  and sop modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions  respectively 
the adoption of these standards did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
based on our reading and interpretation of these sops  we believe that our current sales contract terms and business arrangements have been properly reported 
future interpretations of existing accounting standards or changes in our business practices could result in future changes in our revenue accounting policies that could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to a variety of risks  including foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and changes in the market value of our investments 
in the normal course of business  we employ established policies and procedures to manage these risks including the use of derivative instruments 

table of contents foreign currency exchange rate risk we operate globally and the functional currency for most of our non us enterprises is the local currency 
for fiscal  and  approximately  and of our total revenues were derived from customers outside of north america  substantially all of which were billed and collected in foreign currencies 
similarly  substantially all of the expenses of operating our foreign subsidiaries are incurred in foreign currencies 
as a result  our us dollar earnings and net cash flows from international operations may be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
to minimize our risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates  we utilize certain derivative financial instruments 
we primarily utilize two types of derivative financial instruments in managing our foreign currency exchange risk forward exchange contracts and purchased option contracts 
forward exchange contracts are used to reduce currency exposure associated with our rights and obligations denominated in foreign currencies that subject us to transaction risk 
the terms of these forward exchange contracts are generally one month or less and are entered into at the prevailing market rate at the end of each month 
forward exchange contracts and purchased option contracts  with terms generally less than one year  are used to hedge anticipated  but not firmly committed  sales transactions 
principal currencies hedged are the euro and british pound in europe  the japanese yen and australian dollar in the asia pacific region and the israeli shekel 
while we actively manage our foreign currency risks on an ongoing basis  there can be no assurance our foreign currency hedging activities will offset the full impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates on our results of operations  cash flows and financial position 
foreign currency fluctuations did not have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position during fiscal  or based on our foreign currency exchange instruments outstanding at march   we estimate a one day maximum potential loss on our foreign currency exchange instruments of million based on a value at risk var model utilizing monte carlo simulation 
the comparable estimate based on our foreign currency exchange instruments outstanding at march  was million utilizing the same model 
the var model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a confidence level 
the average var for the period was million for fiscal and million for fiscal the var model is a risk estimation tool  and as such  is not intended to represent actual losses in fair value that could be incurred 
interest rate risk investments we adhere to a conservative investment policy  whereby our principle concern is the preservation of liquid funds while maximizing our yield on such assets 
cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities approximated billion at march   and were primarily invested in different types of investment grade debt securities 
although our portfolio is subject to fluctuations in interest rates and market conditions  no gain or loss on any security would actually be recognized in earnings unless the instrument was sold or the loss in value was deemed to be other than temporary 
based on our consolidated financial position  results of operations and net cash flows for the year ended march   we estimate that a near term change in interest rates would not have a material effect on our future consolidated results of operations or cash flows or the fair values of the investments 
we used a var variance covariance model to measure potential market risk on our marketable securities due to interest rate fluctuations 
the var model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a confidence level 
the var model is a risk estimation tool  and as such  is not intended to represent actual losses in fair value that could be incurred
