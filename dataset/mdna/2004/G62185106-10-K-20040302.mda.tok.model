item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the following is a discussion and analysis of our results of operations for the years ended december  and and financial condition as at december  this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included in this filing 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that are not historical facts  including statements about the company s beliefs and expectations 
these statements are based upon current plans  estimates and projections 
our actual results may differ materially from those projected in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors 
see note on forward looking statements and risk factors contained in item business of this filing 
we derive our revenues primarily from premiums from our reinsurance and insurance contracts and  to a lesser extent  income from our investment portfolio 
premiums are a function of the number and type of contracts we write  as well as prevailing market prices 
renewal dates for reinsurance business tends to be concentrated at the beginning of quarters  and the timing of premium written varies by line of business 
most property catastrophe business is written in the january  april  june and july renewal periods  while the property specialty and other specialty lines are written throughout the year 
written premiums are generally lower during the fourth quarter of the year as compared to prior quarters 
gross premiums written for pro rata contracts  including qqs programs  are initially booked as estimated and are adjusted as actual results are reported by the cedents during the period 
earned premiums do not necessarily follow the written premium pattern as certain written premiums are earned ratably over the contract term  which ordinarily is twelve months  although many pro rata contracts are written on a risks attaching basis and are generally earned over a month period 
earned premiums are affected by our growing book of business  as written premium levels increase  earned premium levels will correspondingly increase over the earning period 
premiums are generally due in installments 
the following are the main categories of gross premium written property specialty contracts in this category include risk excess of loss  property pro rata and direct insurance and facultative reinsurance business 
risk excess of loss reinsurance protects insurance companies on their primary insurance risks and facultative reinsurance transactions on a single risk basis 
coverage is usually triggered by a large loss sustained by an individual risk rather than by smaller losses which fall below the specified retention of the reinsurance contract 
we also write direct insurance and facultative reinsurance coverage on commercial property risks where we assume all or part of a risk under a single insurance contract 
we generally write such coverage on an excess of loss basis 

table of contents we also write property pro rata reinsurance contracts which are reinsurances of individual property risks written on a proportional basis rather than on an excess of loss basis 
property catastrophe these contracts are typically all risk in nature  providing protection against losses from earthquakes and hurricanes  as well as other natural and man made catastrophes such as floods  tornadoes  fires and storms 
the predominant exposures covered are losses stemming from property damage and business interruption coverage resulting from a covered peril 
certain risks  such as war  nuclear contamination and terrorism  are almost always excluded  partially or wholly  from our contracts 
property catastrophe reinsurance is written on an excess of loss basis  which provides coverage to primary insurance companies when aggregate claims and claims expenses from a single occurrence from a covered peril exceed a certain amount specified in a particular contract 
to a lesser extent  we also write retrocessional coverage contracts  which provide reinsurance protection to other reinsurers  also called retrocedents 
coverage generally provides catastrophe protection for the property portfolios of other reinsurers 
retrocessional contracts typically carry a higher degree of volatility than reinsurance contracts as they protect against concentrations of exposures written by retrocedents  which in turn may experience an aggregation of losses from a single catastrophic event 
other specialty reinsurance contracts of aviation liability  aviation war  marine  personal accident catastrophe  workers compensation  terrorism  other casualty and other reinsurance business are included in this category 
marine and aviation contracts are primarily written on a retrocessional excess of loss basis 
qualifying quota share qqs this category represents whole account quota share reinsurance to three lloyd s syndicates 
under qqs contracts  we assume a specified portion of the risk on a specified coverage in exchange for an equal proportion of the premiums 
gross premiums written related to qqs arrangements have been recorded gross of original commissions to the syndicates 
this accounting treatment  when compared to recording such premiums net of original commissions  has the effect of increasing net premiums earned and increasing acquisition costs by an equal amount 
since the classes of business we underwrite have large aggregate exposures to natural and man made disasters  we expect that our claims experience will predominantly be the result of relatively few events of significant severity 
the occurrence of claims from catastrophic events is likely to result in substantial volatility in  and could have a material adverse effect on  our financial condition and results of operations and our ability to write new business 
this volatility will affect our results in the period that the loss occurs because us gaap does not permit reinsurers to reserve for such catastrophic events until they occur 
catastrophic events of significant magnitude have historically been relatively infrequent  although we believe the property catastrophe reinsurance market has experienced a high level of worldwide catastrophic losses in terms of both frequency and severity from to the present as compared to prior years 
we also expect that increases in the values and concentrations of insured property will increase the severity of such occurrences in the future 
we seek to reflect these trends as we price our reinsurance 
income from our investment portfolio is primarily comprised of interest on fixed maturity investments net of investment expenses  dividends received on our equity investments  and to a lesser extent from realized gains and losses on the sale of investments 
our expenses consist primarily of three types loss and loss adjustment expenses  policy acquisition costs and general and administrative expenses 
loss and loss adjustment expenses are a function of the amount and type of insurance and reinsurance contracts we write and of the loss experience of the underlying risks 
we estimate loss and loss adjustment expenses based on an actuarial analysis of the estimated losses we expect to be reported on contracts written 
under us gaap  we reserve for catastrophic losses as soon as a loss event is known to have occurred 
the ultimate loss and loss adjustment expenses will depend on the actual costs to settle claims 
we will increase or 
table of contents decrease our initial loss estimates as actual claims are reported and settled 
our ability to estimate loss and loss adjustment expenses accurately at the time of pricing our contracts will be a critical factor in determining our profitability 
acquisition costs consist principally of brokerage expenses and commissions that represent a percentage of the premiums on reinsurance contracts written  and vary depending upon the amount and types of contracts written  and to a lesser extent ceding commissions paid to ceding insurers and excise taxes 
under certain contracts we may also pay profit commission to cedents which will vary depending on the loss experience on the contract 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries  benefits  professional fees and related costs  including costs associated with awards under our bonus plan  performance unit plan and our share option plan 
other than bonuses and performance units  expenses are primarily fixed in nature and do not vary with the amount of premiums written or losses incurred 
at the discretion of the compensation and nominating committee of the board of directors  the company has awarded  and may in the future award  performance units to executive officers and certain other key employees 
for additional information concerning the company s performance unit plan  see the summary of critical accounting policies below 
as part of our formation  we granted  share options to our president and chief executive officer  anthony taylor 
in september   additional options for common shares were granted to other senior executives 
from inception  we have adopted fas accounting for stock based compensation  which recommends the recognition of compensation expense for the fair value of stock compensation awards on the date of grant 
the compensation expense is recognized over the vesting period of each grant  with a corresponding recognition of the equity expected to be issued in additional paid in capital 
our fixed maturity investments are classified as available for sale under us gaap and are carried at fair value based on quoted market prices 
unrealized gains and losses on these investments are included in accumulated other comprehensive income as a separate component of shareholders equity 
if management has determined that an investment has sustained an impairment in value that is determined to be other than temporary  the unrealized loss will be charged to income in the period it is determined 
we hold a modest portfolio of equity investments which are classified as available for sale under us gaap and are carried at fair value based on quoted market prices 
we classify our investment in aspen as an other investment 
aspen completed an initial public offering in december however  as an original shareholder in aspen  significant restrictions exist on the sale of our shares  which contribute to the illiquidity of our investment 
as a result of this illiquidity  a portion of the total investment is considered restricted and is discounted 
unrealized gains and losses on all investments are included in accumulated other comprehensive income 
summary of critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us gaap 
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported and disclosed amounts of assets and liabilities  as well as disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as at the balance sheet date and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we believe the following accounting policies are critical to our operations as their application requires management to make the most significant judgments 
other significant accounting policies that we use to prepare our consolidated financial statements are included in note to the december  consolidated financial statements included in this filing 

table of contents loss and loss adjustment expense reserves 
for most insurance and reinsurance companies  the most significant judgment made by management is the estimation of the loss and loss adjustment expense reserves 
due to the short tail nature of our property business  generally we expect that the majority of these losses will be paid relatively quickly 
however  this can be affected by such factors as the event causing the loss  the location of the loss  and whether our losses are from policies with insurers or reinsurers 
additionally  for our casualty business  there is the potential for long claim reporting lags and for the emergence of new classes or types or losses 
accordingly  it is necessary to estimate  as part of the loss and loss adjustment expense reserve  an amount for ibnr 
a significant portion of our business is property catastrophe and other classes with high attachment points of coverage 
reserving for losses in such programs is inherently complicated in that losses in excess of the attachment level of our policies are characterized by high severity and low frequency 
this limits the volume of industry claims experience available from which to reliably predict ultimate loss levels following a loss event 
in addition  there always exists a reporting lag between a loss event taking place and the reporting of the loss  which can sometimes be several years  particularly on longer tail classes of business such as casualty 
during this period  additional facts and trends will be revealed and as these factors become apparent  reserves will be adjusted 
these incurred but not reported losses are inherently difficult to predict 
changes to our prior year loss reserves can impact our current underwriting results by improving our results if the prior year reserves prove to be redundant or reducing our results if the prior year reserves prove to be insufficient 
because of the variability and uncertainty associated with loss estimation  it is possible that our individual case reserves for each catastrophic event and other case reserves are incorrect  possibly materially 
this volatility will affect our results in the period that the loss occurs because us gaap does not permit reinsurers to reserve for such catastrophic events until they occur and may give rise to a claim 
as a result  no allowance for the provision of a contingency reserve to account for expected future losses can be recorded 
claims arising from future catastrophic events can be expected to require the establishment of substantial reserves from time to time 
we expect that increases in the values and concentrations of insured property will increase the severity of worldwide catastrophic losses in the future 
these factors require us to make significant assumptions when establishing loss reserves 
for losses which have been reported us  we estimate our ultimate loss using the following claims reports from insureds  our underwriters and management experience in setting claims reserves  and the use of computer models where applicable 
since we have insufficient past loss experience  management supplements this information with industry data 
this industry data may not match our risk profile  which introduces a further degree of uncertainty into the process 
for losses which have been incurred but not reported  the reserving process is further complicated 
we estimate ibnr using actuarial methods 
we also utilize historical insurance industry loss development patterns  as well as estimates of future trends in claims severity  frequency and other factors  to aid us in establishing ibnr 
on pro rata contracts  including qqs arrangements  we estimate ultimate losses based on loss ratio forecasts as reported quarterly by cedents  which is normally on a quarterly or six month lag 
we also review historical loss ratios from prior years as provided by each cedent  as well as public reports 
we base our estimate of the ultimate losses on both of these factors 
estimated losses can change  based on revised projections supplied by the underlying cedents and actuarial support of the underwriting year forecasts 
the resulting changes in incurred losses are recorded in the period in which they are determined 
these complications  together with the potential for unforeseen developments  may result in loss and loss adjustment expenses significantly greater or less than the reserve provided 
reserving can prove especially difficult should a significant loss event take place near the end of an accounting period  particularly if it involves a catastrophic event 

table of contents management has determined that the best estimate for gross loss and loss adjustment expense reserves at december  was million 
management s best estimate of a range of likely outcomes around this estimate is between million and million 
loss and loss adjustment reserve estimates are regularly reviewed and updated  as new information becomes known to us 
any resulting adjustments are included in income in the period in which they become known 
premiums 
premium income is primarily earned ratably over the term of the insurance policy 
premiums derived from pro rata reinsurance policies and policies written on a risks attaching basis are generally earned over a month period 
the portion of the premium related to the unexpired portion of the policy at the end of any reporting period is reflected in unearned premium 
we write both excess of loss and pro rata contracts 
for excess of loss contracts  the deposit premium is defined in the contract wording and this is the amount we record as written premium in the period the underlying risks incept  therefore no management judgment is necessary 
subsequent adjustments  based on reports of actual premium by the ceding companies  or revisions in estimates  are recorded in the period they are determined 
on pro rata contracts  including qqs arrangements  premiums assumed are estimated to ultimate levels based on information provided by the ceding companies 
an estimate of premium is recorded in the period in which the underlying risks incept 
when the actual premium is reported by the ceding company  which may be reported on a quarterly or six month lag  it may be significantly higher or lower than the estimate 
adjustments arising from the reporting of actual premium by the ceding companies are recorded in the period in which they are determined 
estimates of premium are based on information available  including previously reported premium and underlying economic conditions 
premiums on pro rata contracts are earned over the risk periods of the related reinsurance contracts 
where contract terms require the reinstatement of coverage after a ceding company s loss  the mandatory reinstatement premiums are recorded as written premiums when the loss event occurs  and are recognized as earned premium ratably over the remaining contract period 
accrual of reinstatement premiums is based on our estimate of loss and loss adjustment expense reserves  which involves management judgment as described below 
reinstatement premiums are not accrued on reserves for losses incurred but not reported 
performance unit plan the pup 
the pup is the company s primary executive long term incentive scheme 
pursuant to the terms of the pup  at the discretion of the compensation committee of the board of the directors the committee  performance units may be granted to executive officers and certain other key employees 
performance units entitle the recipient to receive  without payment to the company  all  double  or a part of the value of the units granted  depending on the achievement of specific financial or operating goals 
performance units vest at the end of a three year performance cycle  and are payable in cash  common shares or a combination thereof at the discretion of the committee 
a total of  performance units are authorized under the pup at december  and or up to  common shares should the maximum harvest of of units apply 
on january   the committee approved the grant of up to  performance units for the three year performance period covering financial years  and and granted  performance units related to this performance period 
on february   the committee approved the grant of up  performance units for the three year performance period covering financial years  and  granted  performance units  and granted the remaining  performance units from the prior performance period 
on november   the committee approved the grant of the remaining  performance units authorized under the pup for the three year performance period covering financial years  and for the cycle  the performance target for a harvest of value of the units granted is an average combined ratio of for the financial years   and the target for a maximum harvest of of the value of the units granted is a combined ratio of or less 
a combined ratio of or more 
table of contents will result in a harvest of nil 
straight line interpolation is used between these points 
to date we have experienced a better than combined ratio for this three year performance period 
during  taking into account our results to date as well as the estimated combined ratio for the period  we adjusted the harvest ratio for the performance period from to 
this resulted in an increase in the pup liability and expense in depending on our results in  the harvest ratio may either be increased or decreased which will affect the pup liability and expense in for this performance period 
final determination of actual performance and amount of payment is at the sole discretion of the committee 
for the and cycles  the performance target for a harvest of value of the units granted is a combination of the achievement of an average combined ratio of as measured over the period and the achievement of an annual increase in total return to shareholders of as measured over the period 
linear scale collars around the targets provide for payment on performance units to rise to if performance materially exceeds target or to reduce to nil if performance is materially below target 
we will reassess the harvest rate used in the calculation of the pup liability at june  for the cycle and at june  for the cycle and each quarter thereafter 
depending on our future results  the harvest ratio may either be increased or decreased which would affect the pup liability and expense in future years 
final determination of actual performance and amount of payment is at the sole discretion of the committee 
we accrue the projected value of these units and expense the value in the income statement over the course of each three year performance period 
the accrual is based on the number of units granted  the share price at the end of the respective fiscal period end  and an assumption of a harvest ratio  unless otherwise adjusted as discussed above 
at the end of the sixth quarter  and every subsequent quarter  we reassess the projected results for each three year performance period and adjust the accrued pup liability as necessary 
we recalculate the liability under the pup as our financial results evolve and the share price changes  and reflect such adjustments in the income statement in the period in which they are determined 
this may result in an adjustment to the harvest rate used in the liability calculation which may increase or decrease the amount of liability and expense recorded during the period 
assuming the share price at december  remained constant  if the harvest ratio for the performance period had been or at december   respectively  the pup expense would have decreased or increased by approximately million or million  respectively 
assuming the share price at december  remained constant  if the harvest ratio for the performance period had been or at december   respectively  the pup expense would have decreased or increased by approximately million or million  respectively 

table of contents unrealized depreciation in the value of individual investments  considered by management to be other than temporary  is charged to income in the period it is determined 
outlook and trends in general  in we experienced premium rate levels which were less volatile than in  but at comparable overall levels with  for the short tail reinsurance and insurance products that we write 
we expect both of these trends to continue into although we still believe that certain areas are starting to see some competitive forces  overall rates remain healthy and we do not expect as much pressure on rates in as originally anticipated at the beginning of even though there have not been as many large catastrophes during the year as in prior years  we believe that rate levels will continue to remain stable for the short tail insurance and reinsurance products we write due to increasing modeling risk scenarios which is creating additional demand for catastrophe reinsurance coverage in target zones  the continued significant reserve strengthening in other insurance and reinsurance companies mainly related to asbestos and environmental legacy issues but also now on the casualty underwriting conducted between and  and rating agency downgrades of competitors 
in market loss terms  was an active year for catastrophes  especially in north america where there was a significant frequency of tornado  hurricane  and brushfire events in the market loss range of billion to billion 
however  since our portfolio of business generally attaches in the middle and higher layers of programmes  our largest loss from such events in the year was million and we have benefited from a low level of large catastrophe activity during we anticipate that we may be impacted in future periods on average by a higher frequency of large natural catastrophic events than those experienced in such events could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  while we believe that overall price levels are currently favorable for reinsurers and better than they have been in many years  capital provided by newly formed reinsurers or additional capital raised by existing reinsurers may increase the supply of reinsurance which could impact negatively the prices that we receive for the products we write 
despite no qqs business being renewed in  we anticipate that our volume of business will increase in over that of based on our experience during the january renewal period 
we anticipate our premium increases in will be as a result of the following factors an increase in penetration of existing accounts as we replace capacity of exiting reinsurers  an increase in written lines on existing business  and less sign downs on many classes  planned growth in our casualty account mainly in the areas of medical malpractice and errors and omissions coverage as terms and conditions continue to tighten 
casualty business is expected to represent approximately of gross premiums written in  increasing modeling scenarios leading to cedants purchasing larger limits on programs  and a continued increase in general new business and unit growth as a result of the decrease in the supply of market capacity caused by the continued significant reserve strengthening which has taken place in the insurance and reinsurance industries 
as expected  our mix of business has changed in with less qqs premiums written and an increase in direct insurance and facultative and specialty reinsurance business  as a result of expected improved market conditions 
as always envisaged  we have not written any qqs contracts for the development of ultimate loss ratios for the and underwriting years on contracts we did write however  continue to improve 
for the three syndicates we did reinsure in and  we have negotiated substantial other reinsurance contracts for to partly replace the non renewed qqs premium income 

table of contents results of operations for the years ended december  and our results for the year were primarily driven by the following factors high premium rate levels coupled with the relatively low levels of catastrophe large loss frequency affecting our porfolio  rapid constructive responses by our expanded underwriting team  superior service capabilities driven by our advanced modeling capabilities  the existence of a substantial capital base and a very strong capital to premium ratio  the favorable development of net losses related to  and our enhanced ratings by rating agencies 
as we only commenced writing business on december   it is not meaningful to compare and results with results 
we only wrote one reinsurance policy during the period and did not incur any related losses 
in addition  we incurred significant start up expenses which included the results of expensing the fair value of warrants issued to the founding shareholders 
therefore  both the loss ratio and the expense ratio for the period ended december  are not useful for comparative purposes and are not indicative of future results 
the following table summarizes our book values per common share as at the periods indicated as at december  book value per share fully converted book value per share based on total shareholders equity divided by basic shares outstanding 
fully converted book value per share is a non gaap measure  based on total shareholder s equity plus the assumed proceeds from the exercise of outstanding options and warrants of million  divided by the sum of shares  options and warrants outstanding assuming their exercise of  shares at december  and the company believes that fully converted book value per share more accurately reflects the value attributable to a common share 
we ended the year with a fully converted book value per share as defined above of  an increase of from december  this increase of resulted from premium rate levels being relatively high across the major classes that we specialize in  together with a relatively low level of catastrophes affecting our portfolio during the year 
on january  we also paid a dividend to shareholders of record at december   which results in a total return to shareholders  as defined below of or 
we also benefited from a positive total return of approximately on our investment portfolio for the year ended december  total return to shareholders is a non gaap measure 
it is the percentage increase in fully converted book value per share described above excluding the impact of dividends accrued 
it is calculated as the december  fully converted book value per share of plus the accrued dividend of  less the fully converted book value per share at december  of  with the result then being divided by 
the company believes that this measure most accurately reflects the return made by its shareholders as it takes into account the effect of all dilutive securities and the effect of dividends 
management believes that fully converted book value per share and total return to shareholders are measurements which are important to investors and other interested parties  and that these persons benefit from having a consistent basis for comparison with other companies within the industry 
however  these measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by companies outside of the insurance industry

there was no effect on total gross premiums written 
the increase in all classes of business  except qqs as discussed below  as compared to principally results from the factors described above which have resulted in an increase in our market penetration and have allowed us to capitalize on market opportunities in virtually all lines of business 
during we have continued to experience stable premium rate levels across the major classes of business in which we specialize 
in addition  we continued to experience increases in our written line sizes and in our average signing percentages 
the property catastrophe and property specialty categories have seen a substantial increase in gross premiums written in as compared to due to improved signings on renewals as well as increased access to more original programs than in our reputation  combined with our strong capital base and additional ratings has also contributed to the increase in gross premiums written 
we expect that there will be growth in these areas in but expect it to be less than the growth from to included in the other specialty category is a small but growing level of casualty business which accounts for some of the increase as compared to we expect to write a larger amount of casualty reinsurance in versus due to improving terms and conditions 
we estimate that casualty gross premiums written will 
table of contents account for approximately of our gross premiums written in in  casualty is expected to include professional indemnity casualty reinsurance  predominantly medical malpractice  specialized errors and omissions business  uk employer s liability and catastrophe and or clash layers for general liability and retrocessional accounts  on an excess of loss basis 
the other specialty category is expected to experience the most percentage growth during  primarily from an increase in casualty writings  although this growth is expected to be less than the growth seen from to as expected  qqs gross premiums written accounted for less gross premiums written than in part of the reduction relates to reduced premiums for the and underwriting years as during the year the receipt of new information indicated that the expected premiums for the qqs business for both these underwriting years was going to be lower than previous forecasts 
the qqs results for both the and underwriting years are estimated on the basis of projections for the respective years supplied by the underlying syndicates  adjusted for actual reported results from the underlying syndicates 
estimated annual premiums can change  based on revised projections supplied by the underlying syndicates 
the resulting changes in accrued premium are recorded in the period in which they are determined 
due to the leveraged effect of these contracts  modest reductions of the syndicate s ultimate premium estimates resulted in significant reductions in estimated premium for us 
this has resulted in a substantial decrease in qqs premiums written as compared to during the year ended december  we recorded gross premiums written for the qqs business related to the underwriting year of approximately million  which was comprised of a reduction in estimated ultimate premium of million  offset by gross premiums written of million 
during the year we recorded gross premiums written for the qqs business related to the underwriting year of approximately million 
ultimate premiums written for the qqs business will depend on the volume of premiums actually written by the syndicates 
we have not written any qqs contracts in for the years ended december  and  million and nil  respectively was recorded in gross premiums written under our reinsurance arrangements with aspen re  in which we have approximately a interest on an undiluted basis 
these arrangements cover mainly property and casualty risks 
we recorded an insignificant amount of reinstatement premiums during the years ended december  and the lack of reinstatement premiums continues to be due to the minimal amount of reported losses during these years 
in  we would expect to record greater levels of reinstatement premiums as additional losses are notified  consistent with our loss estimates discussed below 
reinsurance premiums ceded reinsurance premiums ceded for the years ended december  and were million and million  respectively 
reinsurance purchased by the qqs syndicates with respect to the contracts in which we participate accounted for million and million  respectively  of the reinsurance premiums ceded during the years ended december  and the lower level of qqs inuring reinsurance premiums ceded in as compared to is directly related to the level of qqs gross premiums written as discussed above 
as part of our reinsurance arrangements with aspen re which became effective in  we recorded million of inuring reinsurance premiums ceded during in addition  in we purchased retrocessional protection on our own account for our direct insurance and facultative reinsurance programs and our property reinsurance programs  excluding most other specialty lines in the amount of million 
the remainder of the reinsurance premiums ceded during the year ended december  of million related to inuring reinsurance on some smaller programs 
we will continue our limited reinsurance purchase policy protecting ourselves against large risk losses on our direct and facultative book and small to medium size catastrophes on our overall property writings 
for we expect that reinsurance premiums ceded may rise modestly but is expected to be less than of gross premiums written 

table of contents net premiums earned net premiums earned for the years ended december  and were million and million  respectively 
approximately of net premiums earned during the year relates to the underwriting year and the remainder to business written in gross premiums written are earning as expected based on the timing of the gross premiums written which has resulted in an earned premium to written premium ratio of for the year ended december   compared to for in addition  we continue to write a minority of our business  including some underlying business contained in the qqs contracts  on a risks attaching basis  for which premiums are earned over a longer period  generally months 
we would expect the earned premium to written premium ratio in to rise modestly from as the growth rate of gross premiums written slows 
loss and loss adjustment expenses the underwriting results of an insurance or reinsurance company are often measured by reference to its loss ratio and expense ratio 
the loss ratio is calculated by dividing loss and loss adjustment expenses incurred including estimates for incurred but not reported losses by net premiums earned 
the expense ratio is calculated by dividing acquisition costs combined with general and administrative expenses by net premiums earned 
the combined ratio is the sum of the loss ratio and the expense ratio 
for comparative purposes  our combined ratio and components thereof are set out below for the periods indicated years ended december  loss ratio expense ratio combined ratio loss and loss adjustment expenses were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
reinsurance recoveries of million and million were netted against loss and loss adjustment expenses for the years ended december  and  respectively 
reinsurance recoveries for the years ended december  and related to qqs only 
based on additional information received from the syndicates  we reduced our estimated recovery ratio on reinsurance purchased by the qqs syndicates which has resulted in the negative reinsurance recovery amount for the year 
we paid net losses of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the following are our net loss ratios by line of business for the periods indicated net loss ratios year ended december  net loss ratios year ended december  property specialty property catastrophe other specialty qualifying quota share overall ratio the overall gross loss ratio for the year ended december  was the overall gross loss ratio for the year ended december  was the variation in loss ratios between the year ended december  compared to the prior year results from the fact that in we did not have the benefit of prior years loss history on which to base our loss 
table of contents reserve analysis and  accordingly  we relied more heavily on industry experience and professional judgment to estimate our loss and loss adjustment expense reserves 
as our business has developed in  we have supplemented industry information with our own specific experience in our actuarial analysis 
this has led to reduced projections of ultimate losses  particularly in the property specialty classes of business 
in market loss terms  was an active year for catastrophes  especially in north america where there was a significant frequency of tornado  hurricane  and brushfire events in the market loss range of billion to billion 
however  since our portfolio of business generally attaches in the middle and higher layers of programmes  our largest event in the year was million and we have benefited from a very low level of catastrophe activity during the other specialty loss ratio for is higher than for the year ended december   partially due to the mix of business  as there is a higher percentage of proportional business in  which has a longer reporting pattern and is usually reserved using a loss ratio approach at this early stage 
in addition  we have written some additional casualty business which traditionally experiences high loss ratios due to the longer tail nature of the casualty business 
all of these factors combined have resulted in the overall net loss ratio of for the year ended december   compared to the overall net loss ratio for the year ended december  of 
the following tables set forth a reconciliation of our gross and net loss and loss adjustment expense reserves by line of business for the year ended december  in millions gross loss and loss adjustment expense reserves gross reserves at december  change in prior year estimate during the year ended december  paid losses on prior year reserves for the year ended december  addition of reserves for the year ended december  gross reserves at december  property specialty property catastrophe other specialty qualifying quota share total net loss and loss adjustment expense reserves net reserves at december  change in prior year estimate during the year ended december  paid losses on prior year reserves for the year ended december  addition of reserves for the year ended december  net reserves at december  property specialty property catastrophe other specialty qualifying quota share total the year includes approximately million of favorable development on net losses from the prior year 
this positive prior year development benefited the net loss ratio in the year by approximately 

table of contents the favorable development during the year ended december  on losses incurred during primarily resulted from the following in the property specialty category  reported losses on occurrences during the year ended december  decreased by million 
both the frequency and severity of reported losses have been lower than the assumed reporting pattern of losses established for this class of business at december  many of the proportional contracts have continued to have little or no reported loss activity 
we have received additional information from many of the proportional cedents  enabling us to do more projections on an individual contract basis rather than for the class as a whole 
the reduction in reported losses during  combined with the increasing weight placed on our actual experience  has led to the reduction in ultimate losses of million or of the total reserve balance at december  property catastrophe net loss and loss adjustment expense reserves as at december   included approximately million in respect of the european floods which occurred in august  and hurricane lili which occurred in october the remainder of the property catastrophe loss reserve balance at december  related to smaller loss events and several proportional contracts 
during the year ended december   the development of european flood losses  hurricane lili losses and losses from our proportional catastrophe contracts has been significantly lower than our initial assumptions 
these factors led to a reduction in net ultimate losses of million during the lack of development in the year ended december   combined with the increasing weight placed on our actual experience in selecting a loss ratio  led to a decrease in our expected loss ratio attributable to the other specialty business during the lower selected loss ratio resulted in a reduction of million in net loss and loss adjustment expense reserves for our other specialty business 
due to the potential variability in ultimate premiums and the limited availability of underlying loss information with the qqs business  our actuaries selected an expected loss ratio based on a review of the information supplied by cedents and applied it to projected premiums 
during the year ended december   we reduced our expected gross loss ratio based on information provided by ceding companies  which resulted in a reduction of million in gross loss and loss adjustment expense reserves 
some of this was due to reductions in the loss ratio projections provided by the syndicates 
much of the decrease in projected ultimate losses was also due to revised ultimate premium estimates that were considerably lower than those at december after taking into account the effect of reinsurance purchased by the qqs syndicates with respect to the contracts in which we participate  net loss and loss adjustment expense reserves decreased by million for the year ended december  other than the matters described above  we did not make any significant changes in the assumptions or methodology used in our reserving process during the year ended december  because of our short operating history  our loss experience is limited and reliable evidence of changes in trends of numbers of claims incurred  average settlement amounts  numbers of claims outstanding and average losses per claim will necessarily take years to develop 
at december   we estimated our gross and net reserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses using the methodology as outlined in our critical accounting policy earlier in this section 
management has determined that the best estimate for gross loss and loss adjustment expense reserves at december  and was million and million  respectively 
management has determined that the best estimate for net loss and loss adjustment expense reserves at december  and was million and million  respectively 

table of contents the following are management s best estimate of a range of likely outcomes around their best estimate of gross and net loss and loss adjustment expense reserves by line of business in millions gross loss and loss adjustment expense reserves at december  low end of the range selected high end of the range property specialty property catastrophe other specialty qualifying quota share total net loss and loss adjustment expense reserves at december  low end of the range selected high end of the range property specialty property catastrophe other specialty qualifying quota share total a significant portion of our business is property catastrophe and other classes with high attachment points of coverage 
reserving for losses in such programs is inherently complicated in that losses in excess of the attachment level of our policies are characterized by high severity and low frequency 
in addition  as a broker market reinsurer  we must rely on loss information reported to such brokers by primary insurers who must estimate their own losses at the policy level  often based on incomplete and changing information 
it is conceivable that in view of the high attachment points of most of our business that there could be no increase in the reserve for losses already incurred at december   and in addition that there may be no further losses reported 
therefore  the ibnr element of the above reserve ranges could turn out to be minimal 
by contrast  a minimal amount of new loss advices could cause our ultimate incurred losses to significantly exceed the high end of the reserve ranges 
additionally  the reporting lag associated with our proportional business  including the qqs contracts  further increases the uncertainty of our ultimate loss estimates 
net foreign exchange gains losses net foreign exchange gains losses result from the effect of the fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates on the translation of foreign currency assets and liabilities combined with realized gains losses resulting from the receipt of premium installments in foreign currencies 
the foreign exchange gain in is primarily due to the weakening of the us dollar resulting in gains on translation arising out of receipts of non us dollar premium installments 
our premiums receivable and liabilities for losses incurred in currencies other than the us dollar are exposed to the risk of changes in value resulting from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and may affect our financial results in the future 
underwriting expenses underwriting expenses consist of acquisition costs including profit commission and general and administrative expenses 
acquisition costs and general and administrative expenses were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  representing expense ratios of for both years 
general and administrative expenses are comprised of fixed expenses which include salaries and benefits  stock options and office and risk management expenses  and variable expenses which 
table of contents include costs related to our performance unit plan and bonuses 
acquisition costs are generally driven by contract terms and are normally a set percentage of premiums 
profit commission expensed was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the accrual for profit commission increased as a result of favorable loss experience 
the expense ratio for the year ended december  and would have been and  respectively excluding the effect of profit commission 
for the year ended december  and  acquisition costs incurred were million and million  respectively  which were principally due to brokerage commissions on our insurance and reinsurance contracts of million and million respectively  as well as commissions paid to ceding insurers and other costs of million and million  respectively 
acquisition costs  excluding reinsurance and profit commission as a percentage of premiums earned  were and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the ratio is slightly lower as a result of the lower proportion of qqs business written which traditionally has higher acquisition costs 
we anticipate that the acquisition cost ratio  excluding profit commissions  will modestly reduce in as the proportion of qqs premiums earned decreases further 
general and administrative expenses for the years indicated consisted of the following in millions years ended december  fixed expenses  excluding stock options bonus accrual performance unit plan accrual fair value of stock options expense total general and administrative expenses the increase in fixed expenses  excluding stock options between and principally relates to an increase in fixed expenses consisting of increased employment costs  premises and office expenses  consistent with the increase in staff numbers 
as our business continues to grow we anticipate employing some additional staff during which will account for a modest increase in fixed expenses 
in addition  we also incurred costs related to our debt offering in the amount of million and costs related to obtaining additional financial strength and debt ratings from rating agencies during the year 
concurrent with the repayment of our term loan facility during  deferred financing costs of million were expensed during the year 
the performance unit plan expense for the year ended december  was higher than the same period in as the period includes an accrual for both the performance period and the performance period 
the share price at december  was used in estimating the year expense at december  and was significantly less than the share price used at december  to calculate the expense for both performance periods 
in addition  during we increased the harvest ratio used in calculating the expense for the performance period which also contributed to the increase in expense for the year 
in we expect the performance unit plan expense to increase over as there will be an additional accrual for the performance period 
in addition  as our results evolve  we may need to increase or decrease our harvest ratio used in the expense calculation which could either reduce or increase the pup expense 
the fluctuation of our share price also affects the calculation of the expense 
other factors could also affect the expense ratio  including the mix of business written and the amount of acquisition costs incurred 

table of contents net investment income net investment income for the years ended december  and was million and million  respectively 
net investment income was primarily composed of interest on coupon paying bonds and bank interest  partially offset by accretion of premium on bonds of million and million  respectively  and investment management and custodian fees of million and million  respectively  for the years ended december  and the investment management fees were paid to white mountains advisors llc  a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of white mountains insurance group  one of our major shareholders 
management believes that the fees charged were consistent with those that would have been charged by a non related party 
because we provide short tail insurance and reinsurance coverage for losses resulting mainly from natural and man made catastrophes  it is possible that we could become liable to pay substantial claims on short notice 
accordingly  we have structured our investment portfolio to preserve capital and provide us with a high level of liquidity  which means that the large majority of our investment portfolio contains shorter term fixed maturity investments  such as us government bonds  corporate bonds and mortgage backed and asset backed securities 
based on the weighted average monthly investments held  and including net unrealized gains of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  the total investment return was and  respectively 
net unrealized gains at december  included million related to our investment in aspen 
in as expected  our total investment income increased as a result of our larger capital base but percentage returns have fallen as a result of lower interest rates 
if interest rates remain stable  we expect investment income to increase in as average investment assets increase 
the performance results of our fixed maturity portfolio  with a comparison to the lehman brothers government credit year index combined with the month treasury bill rate  for the year ended december  was as follows performance montpelier re holdings ltd 
lehman brothers gov t credit year index month t bill total return total return is calculated by dividing total net investment income on fixed maturity investments by the monthly average of the sum of such investments at amortized cost in the combination of the lehman brothers government credit year index and the month treasury bill rate is used for comparative purposes as it closely reflects our asset mix

the term loan facility and revolving credit facility were repaid and terminated during net realized gains losses on investment net realized gains losses on investments for the years ended december  and were million and million  respectively  which were due to net gains losses realized from the sale of fixed maturity and equity investments and a realized loss of million during which resulted from the termination of the interest rate swap contract  cancelled simultaneously with the repayment of the term loan facility on august  comprehensive income comprehensive income for the years ended december  and was million and million respectively  which includes the million and million of net income described above  million and million  respectively  of net change in unrealized gains on investments and currency translation adjustments 
financial condition and liquidity we are a holding company that conducts no operations of its own 
we rely primarily on cash dividends and management fees from montpelier re to pay our operating expenses  interest on our debt and dividends 
there are restrictions on the payment of dividends from montpelier re to the company  which are described in more detail below 
we have initiated a regular dividend program of per share per quarter and declared our first dividend to shareholders of record at december  we expect to continue the payment of dividends in the future but we cannot assure you that such payments will continue 
any determination to pay any future cash dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will be dependent upon our results of operations and cash flows  our financial position and capital requirements  general business conditions  legal  tax  regulatory and any contractual restrictions on the payment of dividends  and any other factors our board of directors deems relevant 
capital resources the company s shareholders equity at december  was  million  of which million was retained earnings 
the company s capital base has grown since december  primarily as a result of 
table of contents an increase in net premiums earned  the low level of losses incurred and the increase in capital resulting from the net proceeds from the issuance of million in senior notes as described below 
contractual obligations and commitments in thousands total due in less than year due in years due in years due in more than years debt senior notes due operating leases commitment for new premises loan total we previously maintained two senior credit facilities with a syndicate of commercial banks 
the credit facilities consisted of a day revolving credit facility with a million borrowing limit and a three year term loan facility with a million aggregate borrowing limit 
the million revolving credit facility was set to renew in december  on august   using the proceeds from the issuance of million in senior notes see below  we repaid the million outstanding under this facility and cancelled the revolving credit facility 
these credit facilities contained various restrictions and covenants  which were all met during the time that the facilities were in place 
in order to hedge the interest rate risk of the loan  we had entered into an interest rate swap contract  which became effective april  and was scheduled to expire on december   the maturity date of the term loan facility 
the swap contract was cancelled simultaneously with the repayment of the term loan facility  resulting in a realized loss on termination of million which is included in realized gains losses on investments 
on august   we issued million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured debt the senior notes at an issue price of 
the net proceeds were used to repay the term loan facility with the remainder used for general corporate purposes 
the senior notes bear interest at a rate of  payable semi annually in arrears on february and august of each year  beginning on february  unless previously redeemed  the senior notes will mature on august  we incurred million in expenses related to the issuance of the senior notes  which have been expensed during the year ended december  we may redeem the senior notes at any time and from time to time  in whole or in part  at a make whole redemption price 
the senior notes do not contain any covenants regarding financial ratios or specified levels of net worth or liquidity to which we must adhere 
we may issue additional debt or equity as circumstances warrant 
in this regard  on february  we filed a universal shelf registration statement on form s with the us securities and exchange commission for the potential future sale of up to million of debt  trust preferred and or equity securities 
the registration statement has been declared effective and should provide us with significant flexibility with respect to our access to the public capital markets 
also included in the registration statement are  common shares which may be offered for sale by our shareholders  and from the sale of which we will receive no proceeds 
we cannot assure you that additional financing under the universal shelf registration statement or elsewhere will be available at terms acceptable to us 
we entered into a memorandum of intent and understanding miu on december  to develop a construction project the project to build a commercial building with a mixture of office  residential and retail use 
we expect to finalize the construction loan agreement and agreement for lease during and obtain consent to hold of the shares of the company which will undertake the project and own the building 
under the miu  the terms of the construction loan will provide that we loan million to the landlord for the costs of the project upon commencement of construction  which is estimated to commence during the first quarter of 
table of contents subsequent to the project s completion  which is estimated to be thirty months from the commencement of construction  we expect to enter into a year long term lease for the major portion of the project 
we will be required to pay rent in the amount of  per annum during the construction period 
upon finalization of the project and occupation of the building  we will be required to pay rent in the amount of  per annum 
the company and its subsidiaries lease office space in the countries in which they operate under operating leases  which expire at various dates 
the company has also entered into operating leases for office equipment and furniture 
future minimum annual commitments under existing leases are expected to be as follows     and  the company s loss and loss adjustment reserves represent a best estimate of amounts which may fall due to pay policyholders and are not fixed amounts payable pursuant to contractual commitments

such security takes the form of a letter of credit 
letters of credit are issued by a bank at the request of the company 
in order for montpelier re to write lloyd s qualifying quota share business  it must provide a letter of credit in favor of the society and council of lloyd s lloyd s in accordance with lloyd s rules 
previously montpelier re had arrangements with fleet national bank for the provision of a standby letter of credit in a form acceptable to lloyd s in an amount of up to million which was superseded by the letter of credit reimbursement and pledge agreement discussed below 
letters of credit outstanding under this fleet facility at december  were approximately million and were secured by investments of approximately million 
effective june   montpelier re entered into a new letter of credit reimbursement and pledge agreement with fleet national bank and a syndicate of lending institutions for the provision of a letter of credit facility in favor of lloyd s in an amount of up to million  and in favor of certain us ceding companies in an amount of up to million 
simultaneously  the previously existing pledge agreement was superseded by the letter of credit reimbursement and pledge agreement  and the letters of credit issued under the previous facility are now issued under the new facility agreement 
letters of credit issued under this facility at december  were million and are secured by cash and investments of approximately million 
we expect to renewal this facility at expiration 
we consider this letter of credit facility sufficient to support montpelier re s estimated obligations for the next months 
the company made arrangements with barclay s bank plc for the provision of an additional letter of credit facility in favor of certain us ceding companies in an amount of up to million

accordingly  we have structured our investment portfolio to preserve capital and provide us with a high level of liquidity  which means that the large majority of our investment portfolio contains shorter term fixed maturity investments  such as us government and agency bonds  corporate debt securities and mortgage backed and asset backed securities 
the market value of our portfolio of fixed maturity investments comprises us government and agency bonds  investment grade corporate debt securities and mortgage backed and asset backed securities 
all of the fixed maturity investments currently held by us were publicly traded at december  based on the weighted average monthly investments held  and including unrealized gains  our total return for the year ended december  was

loss and loss adjustment expense reserves as described in the summary of critical accounting policies  for most insurance and reinsurance companies  the most significant judgment made by management is the estimation of the loss and loss adjustment expense reserves 
due to the short tail nature of our business  generally we expect that the majority of our losses will be paid relatively quickly 
however  this can be affected by such factors as the event causing the loss  the location of the loss  and whether our losses are from policies with insurers or reinsurers 
accordingly  it is necessary to estimate  as part of the loss and loss adjustment expense reserve  an amount for ibnr 
net loss and loss adjustment expense reserves at december  was million 
significant assumptions are required to be made when establishing loss reserves 
for additional information concerning loss and loss adjustment expenses see the summary of critical accounting policies section earlier in item 
table of contents cash flows in the year ended december   we generated an operating net cash inflow of million  primarily relating to premiums net of acquisition costs received by montpelier re 
we paid losses of million during the year ended december  we invested a net amount of million during the year ended december   and had a cash balance of million at december  the increase in liquidity has resulted from premiums received and a low level of paid claims as this has been a year with a relatively low level of catastrophes that affected our portfolio combined with the net cash received of million from the issuance of the senior notes and the repayment of our term loan facility 
our liquidity depends on operating  investing and financing cash flows as described below 
our sources of funds primarily consist of the receipt of premiums written  investment income and proceeds from sales and redemptions of investments 
cash is used primarily to pay loss and loss adjustment expenses  brokerage commissions  excise taxes  general and administrative expenses  to purchase new investments  to pay dividends  to pay for any premiums retroceded and future authorized share repurchases 
in we purchased specific retrocessional protection for our direct facultative insurance and reinsurance programs and the property programs  excluding most other specialty lines 
in we expect to purchase reinsurance protecting ourselves against large risk losses on our direct and facultative and small to medium size catastrophes on our overall property business written 
for we expect that our purchase of reinsurance may rise modestly but is expected to be less than of gross premiums written 
our cash flows from operations represent the difference between premiums collected and investment earnings realized  and the loss and loss adjustment expenses paid  underwriting and other expenses paid and investment losses realized 
cash flows from operations may differ substantially  however  from net income 
to date  we have invested substantially all cash flows not required for operating purposes 
we have written certain business that has loss experience generally characterized as having low frequency and high severity 
this may result in volatility in both the company s results and operational cash flows 
the potential for a large claim under one of our insurance or reinsurance contracts means that substantial and unpredictable payments may need to be made within relatively short periods of time 
as a result  cash flows from operating activities may fluctuate  perhaps significantly  between individual quarters and years 
we intend to manage these risks by structuring our investments in an effort to anticipate the payout patterns of our liabilities under insurance or reinsurance policies 
no assurance can be given  however  that we will successfully match the structure of montpelier re s investments with its liabilities under insurance or reinsurance contracts 
if our calculations with respect to these reinsurance liabilities are incorrect  or if we improperly structure our investments to match such liabilities  we could be forced to liquidate investments prior to maturity  potentially at a significant loss 
the estimated fair value of fixed maturity  equity  other investments and our cash and cash equivalents balance was  million as of december   compared to  million at december  the primary cause of this increase was the receipt of million in premiums net of acquisition costs  the receipt of net cash of million from the issuance of the senior notes and the repayment of our term loan facility  net investment income of million and the increase in net unrealized gains on investments of million during the year 
in the third quarter of  we leased additional office space in bermuda 
approximately million in related costs were incurred for the year ended december   the majority of which were capitalized 
for the period from inception until december   we have had sufficient cash flow from operations to meet our liquidity requirements 
we have generated cash flows from operations in and significantly in 
table of contents excess of our operating commitments 
to the extent that capital is not utilized in our reinsurance we will consider using such capital to invest in new opportunities 
recent accounting pronouncement the financial accounting standards board issued fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin an interpretation of arb no 
consolidated financial statements  in january fin clarifies the accounting and reporting for certain entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest 
the december  consolidated financial statements were previously prepared on a combined basis as a result of the fact that montpelier re s and the company s bye laws include certain restrictions relating to the election of directors of montpelier re 
fin became effective in the first quarter of and the impact of adoption of fin was that the company s financial statements are now presented on a consolidated basis instead of on a combined basis 
there is no impact on the company s net income or shareholders equity as presented in the consolidated financial statements as a result of the adoption of fin item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we believe that we are principally exposed to three types of market risk interest rate risk  foreign currency risk and credit risk 
the use of derivative instruments is expressly prohibited by our investment guidelines  other than the use of forward currency exchange contracts to minimize the impact of exchange rate fluctuations 
interest rate risk 
our primary market risk exposure is to changes in interest rates 
our fixed maturity portfolio is exposed to interest rate risk 
fluctuations in interest rates have a direct impact on the market valuation of these investments 
as interest rates rise  the market value of our fixed maturity portfolio falls  and the converse is also true 
we manage interest rate risk by selecting investments with characteristics such as duration  yield  currency and liquidity tailored to the anticipated cash outflow characteristics of montpelier re s reinsurance liabilities 
as of december   the impact on our portfolio from an immediate basis point increase in market interest rates would have resulted in an estimated decrease in market value of or approximately million and the impact on our portfolio from an immediate basis point decrease in market interest rates would have resulted in an estimated increase in market value of or approximately million 
as of december   we held million  or of our total invested assets in mortgage related securities 
these assets are exposed to prepayment risk  which occurs when holders of individual mortgages increase the frequency with which they prepay the outstanding principal before the maturity date and refinance at a lower interest rate cost 
given the proportion that these securities comprise of the overall portfolio  and the current low interest rate environment  prepayment risk is not considered significant at this time 
foreign currency risk 
a significant portion of our business is insuring or reinsuring risks in currencies other than the us dollar 
accordingly  we are exposed to fluctuations in the rates of these currencies 
in the event of a significant loss event which requires settlement in a currency other than the united states dollar  we may use forward foreign currency exchange contracts in an effort to hedge against movements in the value of foreign currencies relative to the united states dollar 
a forward foreign currency exchange contract involves an obligation to purchase or sell a specified currency at a future date at a price set at the time of the contract 
foreign currency exchange contracts will not eliminate fluctuations in the value of our assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies but rather allow us to establish a rate of exchange for a future point in time 
we do not expect to enter into such contracts with respect to a material amount of our assets 
at december  we do not have any outstanding forward foreign currency exchange contracts 

table of contents our functional currency is the us dollar 
the british pound is the functional currency of our wholly owned subsidiary  montpelier marketing services uk limited mmsl 
accordingly  mmsl s assets and liabilities are translated at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date 
revenue and expenses of mmsl are translated at average exchange rates during the period 
the effect of translation adjustments at the end of the period is not included in our consolidated results of operations but is included in accumulated other comprehensive income  a separate component of shareholders equity 
on a consolidated basis  mmsl does not generate material revenue and expenses and  therefore  the effects of changes in exchange rates during the period are not material 
our premiums receivable and liabilities for losses incurred in currencies other than the us dollar are exposed to the risk of changes in value resulting from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and may affect our financial results in the future 
credit risk 
we have exposure to credit risk primarily as a holder of fixed maturity investments 
in accordance with our investment guidelines as approved by our board of directors  our risk management strategy and investment policy is to invest in debt instruments of high credit quality issuers and to limit the amount of credit exposure with respect to particular ratings categories and any one issuer 
at december   all fixed maturity investments that we held were investment grade 
currency we write a portion of our business and receive premiums in currencies other than us dollars and may maintain a small portion of our investment portfolio in investments denominated in currencies other than us dollars 
we may experience exchange losses to the extent our foreign currency exposure is not properly managed or otherwise hedged  which in turn would adversely affect our statement of operations and financial condition 
effects of inflation the potential exists  after a catastrophe loss  for the development of inflationary pressures in a local economy 
the anticipated effects on us are considered in our catastrophe loss models 
the effects of inflation are also considered in pricing and in estimating reserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses 
the actual effects of inflation on our results cannot be accurately known until claims are ultimately settled 
we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our consolidated results of operations  except insofar as inflation may affect interest rates
