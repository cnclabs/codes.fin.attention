during  we put new zebra representatives in poland  dubai  russia  australia  brazil and argentina 
we also added representatives in mexico and china during these additions are an important reason for the increase in the asia pacific and the latin american regions during the fourth quarter and the full year of increasing our european representation in mobile and business development manager resources in germany  italy  france  and spain during building infrastructure to deliver business improvement applications to high growth vertical markets 
during  we also added marketing resources to support emerging radio frequency identification rfid opportunities 
new printer products defined as printers released within months prior to the end of the applicable fiscal period accounted for of printer sales in the fourth quarter of and for the full year  new printer products accounted for of printer sales in  compared with in our international sales are denominated in multiple currencies  primarily the dollar  pound and euro  which causes our reported sales to be subject to fluctuations based on changes in currency rates 
when significant currency rate fluctuations occur  we review our pricing and make appropriate changes in order to maintain our competitive position 
since the third quarter of  the dollar has weakened significantly against both the euro and pound 
as a result  our fourth quarter sales translated into dollars increased by  or percentage points compared to translating the same sales using the exchange rates that prevailed a year ago 
competitive pricing adjustments caused by the currency situation reduced sales by  or percentage points 
in total  the net increase related to exchange rate fluctuations was  during the quarter 
for the full year of  sales translated into dollars increased by  or percentage points compared to translating the same sales using the exchange rates that prevailed in we adjusted our pricing to remain competitive in markets experiencing currency strength against the dollar 
these competitive pricing adjustments reduced sales by  or percentage points 
in total  the net increase related to exchange rate fluctuations was  during although management cannot forecast the future direction of foreign exchange rate movements  if rates remain near the levels experienced during  zebra may continue to benefit from exchange rate gains during however  it is possible that a continued weak dollar versus the pound and euro may cause our current pricing to be uncompetitive and require price reductions 
these reductions would decrease the benefits of the current favorable exchange rates 
during  we began a program to hedge a portion of our forecasted euro denominated sales  so that if exchange rate trends reverse  we will still achieve some benefit from the current favorable rates 
see note to the financial statements for a more detailed discussion of this hedging program 
printer unit volumes and average selling price information is summarized below three months ended december  percent change year ended december  percent change total printers shipped average selling price of printers shipped for the fourth quarter of  mobile printers accounted for percentage points of the total volume increase 
this increase is a result of more companies adopting technology for wireless networks 
the increase in the average unit selling prices was a result of higher average prices for mid range tabletop printers and print engines  offset by the higher mobile printer volumes 
for the full year of  the increase in printer volume was due to higher sales volume of desktop and mobile printers similar to the increases for the fourth quarter 
average unit selling price increases were related to increases in the average unit selling prices of mid range desktop printers  portable printers and print engines 
average unit selling prices were also being reduced by the increased volume of the lower priced mobile printers 
gross profit gross profit information is summarized below in thousands  except percentages december  percent change percent of total sales percent of total sales three months ended year ended the major contributors to the margin improvement were higher capacity utilization related to the higher sales volume  representing  of the total gross profit increase for the fourth quarter of and  for the full year 
foreign exchange rate movements and related pricing adjustments  which we estimate increased gross profit by  for the fourth quarter of for the full year  gross profit is estimated to have been  higher due to foreign exchange rate movements  net of related pricing adjustments 
component cost reductions contributed  to the margin improvement during the fourth quarter and  for the full year 
selling and marketing expenses selling and marketing expenses are summarized below in thousands  except percentages december  percent change percent of total sales percent of total sales three months ended year ended we continue to make significant investments in demand generating activities 
during the fourth quarter of  increased selling and marketing expenses were primarily in payroll and benefits 
other costs that increased during the fourth quarter were advertising  publications and market research  travel and entertainment  and demonstration units 
year to date  in addition to increases in the items mentioned above  we increased market development fund expenses 
these increases are largely the result of our focus on vertical market development and international expansion 
research and development costs zebra is committed to a long term strategy of significant investment in product development 
to maintain and build our product pipeline  we made expenditures in research and development  summarized below in thousands  except percentages december  percent change percent of total sales percent of total sales three months ended year ended quarterly product development expenses fluctuate widely depending on the status of ongoing projects 
for the fourth quarter of  research and development expenses increased because of an increase in payroll and benefits with related increases in headcounts and increases in project expenses 
higher project expenses are related to the reduction of expenses in the fourth quarter of of  for third party funded engineering costs  which did not reoccur in this amount represents of the total increase in research and development expenses for the fourth quarter 
for the full year  project expenses were up  with the majority of that increase related to  in reductions related to third party funded engineering costs that had occurred in but did not reoccur in in addition  payroll and benefits were up  over  but consulting expenses were down  we believe that there will be long term growth in the use of radio frequency identification rfid in supply chain and other applications  and that zebra is well positioned to participate in that growth 
we introduced new products that extend rfid technologies into our bar code label printers  and we anticipate investing a larger portion of our future r d expenditures on the development of rfid printer encoders 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses are summarized in the table below in thousands  except percentages december  percent change percent of total sales percent of total sales three months ended year ended for the fourth quarter of  general and administrative expenses increased  and include  of increased legal expenses  which was primarily related to litigation with paxar described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
other increases were related to personnel costs 
for the full year of  general and administrative expenses include  of increased legal expenses related to litigation with paxar increased intellectual property work international activity general contract review 
in addition to legal expenses in  we saw an increase in director and officer liability insurance and administrative personnel costs 
a portion of these costs resulted from new compliance requirements of the sarbanes oxley act of and related regulations 
offsetting these increases was a decline in consulting expenses 
as a percentage of net sales  general and administrative expenses declined  because we took actions to control costs  including the compliance activities discussed above 
as a result  our general and administrative costs have grown slower than the rate of sales growth 
we expect that trend to continue 
costs related to terminated acquisitions and merger costs during the first quarter of  we terminated the acquisition agreement and tender offer in which zebra would acquire all outstanding shares of common stock including associated rights to purchase preferred stock of fargo electronics  inc for per share in cash 
during the time that the tender offer was active  we incurred legal  accounting and other expenses related to the proposed acquisition that would have been treated as part of the purchase price had the tender offer been completed 
we expensed  of these costs at the cancellation of the tender offer 
exit costs during the fourth quarter of  we announced a plan to close our engineering site in varades  france 
this plan will be accounted for under sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
included in operating expenses for the fourth quarter of and the full year are exit costs  consisting of primarily severance  in the amount of  during january  we announced plans to consolidate our warwick  rhode island  printer manufacturing and repair service business into our camarillo  california and vernon hills  illinois locations 
although no costs have been accrued in the fourth quarter of  we anticipate that during we will incur additional expenses of  of which approximately  will be incurred during the first quarter 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
operating income operating income is summarized in the following table in thousands  except percentages december  percent change percent of total sales percent of total sales three months ended year ended the increase in operating income is attributable to the following factors accelerated sales growth compared to  improved gross margins resulting from increased overhead utilization  favorable changes in foreign exchange rates for zebra s non dollar denominated business  and cost controls that held operating expense growth slightly below the rate of sales growth 
as a result of these actions  operating income increased by percentage points more than the rate of sales growth during the fourth quarter  and percentage points more than the rate of sales growth for the full year 
non operating income and expenses zebra s non operating income and expense items are summarized in the following table in thousands three months ended december  year ended december  investment income interest expense foreign exchange gains losses other  net total other income expense higher investment balances resulted in an increase in investment income for the fourth quarter 
while investment balances were higher in  year to date investment income decreased from last year  because results included a  realized gain on the sale of  shares of fargo electronics during the first quarter of for the fourth quarter of  we had the following two unusual items that increased investment income in relation to the fourth quarter of interest income of  was received  which was related to refunds of taxes from the internal revenue service research and experimentation credit and the state of illinois tax settlement 
investment income includes a  increase in realized gains from partnership interests during the fourth quarter 
income taxes the effective income tax rate for the fourth quarter was  compared with for the same quarter last year 
this rate is lower than the effective tax rate that zebra has recorded since early  because of the net effect of a nonrecurring tax item during the quarter 
during the fourth quarter  zebra settled its long standing dispute with the illinois department of revenue 
we recorded a decrease to income tax expense of  because our reserves for this tax dispute exceeded the amount of the settlement 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more details 
without the effect of this settlement  our effective income tax rate would have been for the quarter 
during the third quarter of  we eliminated a reserve related to research and experimentation tax credits that were claimed and recorded a reduction to income tax expense of  during the first two quarters of  we filed refund applications totaling  with the internal revenue service and departments of revenue for illinois and california related to research and experimentation tax credits for to because of the uncertainty of receiving the credits  which require significant subjective analysis  we established a reserve against the contingent receivable for the refunds during each of the first two quarters of in september the irs approved our refund applications 
because california and illinois law mirror the federal tax code  we now expect to have those refunds approved as well

we believe international regions  particularly asia pacific  latin america and eastern europe  hold significant growth potential 
new sales and marketing programs we organized sales and marketing efforts to support a sales strategy that demonstrates the business benefits associated with implementing bar code labeling and specialty printing solutions 
in north america  we recorded positive sales growth in the second  third and fourth quarters of  compared with the corresponding periods of overall  however  the slow us economy continued to limit sales growth of bar code label and receipt printers to rates below our historical average 
year ended december  percent change total printers shipped average selling price of printers shipped all three of our international regions europe  asia pacific  and latin america had record sales and contributed to the significant growth in international sales in increased numbers of zebra representatives in these regions  including the formation of a sales team in europe for mobile printing solutions in  was an important factor in the growth of international sales 
on a dollar volume basis  the largest increase occurred in the european region

we consider our ability to develop and introduce new products to be a significant competitive factor 
accordingly  we expect to continue high levels of expenditures on the development of a broad range of printers and related items 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses are summarized below in thousands  except percentages for the year ended percent of total sales december  december  percent change the increase in general and administrative expenses was due to higher bonus payments related to the growth in net sales and profits  consulting expenses for the development and implementation of growth strategies  information systems  and increased insurance costs 
amortization of intangible assets during  zebra recorded  in amortization of intangible assets  compared with  for during the first quarter of  zebra implemented sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which replaces the requirements to amortize intangible assets with indefinite lives and goodwill with a requirement for an annual impairment test 
sfas no 
also establishes requirements for identifiable intangible assets 
as a result  during the first quarter of zebra reclassified  of intangible assets into goodwill  as such assets  which included assembled workforce and customer lists  did not meet the criteria for recognition as an asset apart from goodwill under sfas no 
operating income for includes  of amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets that are not included in the results due to the implementation of sfas no 
costs related to terminated acquisitions and merger costs during  we terminated the acquisition agreement and tender offer in which zebra would acquire all outstanding shares of common stock including associated rights to purchase preferred stock of fargo electronics  inc for per share in cash 
during the time that the tender offer was active  we incurred legal  accounting and other expenses related to the proposed acquisition that would have been treated as part of the purchase price had the tender offer been completed

these principles require the use of estimates  judgments and assumptions 
we believe that the estimates  judgments and assumptions we used are reasonable  based upon the information available 
our estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts in our financial statements 
the following accounting policies comprise those that we believe are the most critical in understanding and evaluating zebra s reported financial results 
revenue recognition zebra recognizes sales from product sales at the time of shipment and passage of title  which are generally the same 
other items that affect our revenue recognition include customer returns customers have the right to return products that do not function properly within a limited time after delivery 
we monitor and track product returns and record a provision for the estimated future returns based on historical experience and any notification received of pending returns 
returns have historically been within expectations and the provisions established  but zebra cannot guarantee that it will continue to experience return rates consistent with historical patterns 
a significant increase in product failure rates and the resulting credit returns could have a material effect on our operating results 
a increase decrease in returns above historical levels would have decreased increased operating income for the fourth quarter of by  or of operating income 
volume rebates some of our customers are offered incentive rebates based on the volume of product they purchase from us over a quarter or year 
these rebates are recorded as a reduction to revenue 
each quarter  we estimate the amount of outstanding volume rebates and establish a reserve for them based on shipment history 
historically  actual volume rebates have been in line with our estimates 
price protection some of our customers are offered price protection by zebra as an incentive to carry inventory of our product 
these price protection plans provide that if we lower prices  we will credit them for the price decrease on inventory they hold 
we estimate future payments under price protection programs quarterly and establish a reserve  which is charged against revenue 
our customers typically carry limited amounts of inventory  and zebra infrequently lowers prices on current products 
as a result  the amounts paid under theses plans have been minimal 
we cannot guarantee that this minimal level will continue 
software revenue we sell three types of software and record revenue as follows our printers contain embedded firmware  which is part of the hardware purchase 
we consider the sale of this firmware to be incidental to the sale of the printer and do not attribute any revenue to it 
we sell a limited amount of prepackaged  or off the shelf  software for the creation of bar code labels using our printers 
there is no customization required to use this software  and we have no post shipment obligations on the software 
revenue is recognized as this prepackaged software is shipped 
we sometimes provide custom software as part of a printer installation project 
we bill custom software development services separate from the related hardware 
revenue related to custom software is recognized once the custom software development services have been completed and accepted by the customer 
shipping and handling we charge our customers for shipping and handling services based upon our internal price list for these items 
the amounts billed to customers are recorded as revenue when the product ships 
any costs incurred related to these services are included in cost of sales 
investments and marketable securities investments and marketable securities at december   consisted of us government securities  state and municipal bonds  corporate bonds  partnership interests and equity securities 
we classify our debt and marketable equity securities in one of three categories trading  available for sale or held to maturity 
trading securities are bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term 
held to maturity securities are those securities that zebra has the ability and intent to hold until maturity 
all securities not included in trading or held to maturity are classified as available for sale 
trading and available for sale securities are recorded at fair value 
held to maturity securities are recorded at amortized cost  adjusted for the amortization or accretion of discounts or premiums 
unrealized holding gains and losses on trading securities are included in earnings 
unrealized holding gains and losses  net of the related tax effect  on available for sale securities are excluded from earnings and are reported as a separate component of stockholders equity until realized 
during the first quarter of  we changed the classification of certain of our investments and marketable securities from the trading category to the available for sale category  because we are no longer buying securities with the intent of selling them in the near term 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  the market value as of the date of the change is now the new cost basis  and all future unrealized gains and losses will be reflected in the accumulated other comprehensive income section of stockholders equity in the balance sheet 
this change was made because of changes in our investment strategies and is consistent with the classification of our investments and marketable securities as defined in sfas no 
approximately  of our  of investments was transferred from the trading category to the available for sale category 
accounts receivable we have standardized credit granting and review policies and procedures for all customer accounts  including credit reviews of all new customer accounts  ongoing credit evaluations of current customers  credit limits and payment terms based on available credit information  adjustments to credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness  and an active collection effort by regional credit functions  reporting directly to the corporate financial officers 
we reserve for estimated credit losses based upon historical experience and specific customer collection issues 
over the last three years  accounts receivable reserves varied from to of total accounts receivable 
accounts receivable reserves as of december   were  or of the balance due 
we feel this reserve level is appropriate considering the improved quality of the portfolio as of december  while credit losses have historically been within expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that our credit loss experience will continue to be consistent with historical experience 
inventories we value our inventories at the lower of the actual cost to purchase or manufacture using the first in  first out fifo method  or the current estimated market value 
we review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based on forecasts of product demand and production requirements for the subsequent twelve months 
a significant increase in the demand for zebra s products could result in a short term increase in the cost of inventory purchases  however  this would be offset by improved overhead utilization resulting from the additional demand 
a significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in excess inventory quantities on hand 
our forecasted product demand may prove to be inaccurate  in which case the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory may be understated or overstated 
if inventories were determined to be overvalued  we would recognize such costs in cost of goods sold at the time of such determination 
we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of product demand  however  any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of inventories and reported operating results 
over the last three years  our reserves for excess and obsolete inventories have ranged from to of gross inventory 
as of december   reserves for excess and obsolete inventories were  or of gross inventory 
reserves increased during due to products which are in the process of being discontinued 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill we test the impairment of identifiable intangibles and goodwill each year or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
we completed our last assessment during june we evaluate the impairment of other long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors considered that may trigger an impairment review consist of significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the overall business significant negative industry or economic trends significant decline in zebra s stock price for a sustained period significant decline in market capitalization relative to net book value if we believe that one or more of the above indicators of impairment have occurred  we measure impairment based on projected discounted cash flows using a discount rate that incorporates the risk inherent in the cash flows 
net intangible assets  long lived assets and goodwill amounted to  as of december  contingencies we recorded an estimated liability related to contingencies based on our estimates of the probable outcomes 
quarterly  we assess the potential liability related to pending litigation  tax audits and other contingencies and confirm or revise estimates and reserves as appropriate 
on april   paxar americas  inc paxar americas filed a patent infringement lawsuit in the united states district court for the southern district of ohio against zebra and certain of its subsidiaries 
paxar americas complaint alleges that certain of zebra s printer products infringe one or more of eight identified paxar americas patents  although not each product is accused of infringing each patent 
zebra has filed an answer to paxar americas complaint  denying paxar americas allegations of infringement and asserting several affirmative defenses  including the invalidity of paxar americas asserted patent claims 
on november   zih corp 
zih filed a complaint in the united states district court for the district of massachusetts against paxar corporation  alleging that paxar corporation printers infringe zih s us patent nos 
 and  paxar corporation answered zih s complaint  denying infringement and seeking a declaratory judgment that zih s patents in suit are not infringed and are invalid and or unenforceable 
paxar corporation filed a motion to transfer zih s massachusetts suit to ohio federal court 
zih opposed paxar corporation s motion to transfer  and the parties are awaiting the court s ruling on the transfer motion 
on november   paxar americas filed a complaint against zih in the united states district court for the southern district of ohio  seeking a declaratory judgment that the patents asserted by zih in its massachusetts complaint are not infringed and are invalid and unenforceable 
on december   paxar americas amended its complaint to add zebra technologies corporation as a defendant 
the parties have filed a motion to stay this action pending the massachusetts district court s ruling on paxar corporation s motion to transfer 
the parties have agreed to file a motion to transfer this action to the massachusetts district court if the massachusetts district court denies paxar corporation s pending motion to transfer 
we are unable at this time to estimate the range of the potential liability that would result from an unsuccessful defense  and consistent with the requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  no liability has been recorded in zebra s consolidated financial statements as of december stock based compensation as of december   zebra had three stock based compensation plans available for future grants 
we account for those plans under the recognition and measurement principles of apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
no stock based compensation cost is reflected in net income  as all options granted under those plans had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
the following table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share if we had applied the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no

liquidity and capital resources zebra continued to generate cash well in excess of its operating requirements 
as a result  zebra s cash and investment balances have grown over time 
as of december   zebra had  in cash  cash equivalents  investments and marketable securities  compared with  at december  factors affecting cash and investment balances during include operations provided a net cash increase of  primarily from net income 
accounts receivable increased  net of the effect of foreign currency translation adjustment because of higher sales 
inventories increased  net of foreign currency translation adjustment 
this is due to higher sales offset by improvements in inventory utilization 
compared to the same period a year ago  inventory turns increased slightly to from other assets decreased primarily due to the receipt of tax protest deposits returned from the state of illinois and a decrease in the value of the foreign exchange forward contracts  but these decreases are offset by increases in long term investments 
with the effect of foreign currency translation adjustment being the predominant cause  accounts payable decreased by accrued expenses  net of the effect of foreign currency translation adjustment  increased due to higher payroll accruals and unearned revenue 
taxes payable decreased  because of the timing of tax payments and the settlement of the illinois tax matter offset by increased profits 
in addition  our effective income tax rate decreased to in from in purchases of property and equipment totaled  stock option exercises contributed  zebra s contractual obligations as of december  were payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt obligations n a capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term liabilities n a total purchase obligations are for purchases made in the normal course of business to meet operational requirements  primarily raw materials 
management believes that existing capital resources and funds generated from operations are sufficient to finance anticipated capital requirements 
it is our intention to actively pursue opportunities to acquire other businesses 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in january  the fasb issued fin  consolidation of variable interest entities 
fin requires us to consolidate a variable interest entity vie if we have a majority of the risks  rewards or both of that entity 
fin will be effective for most vies beginning in the fourth quarter of zebra has no investments in variable interest entities  therefore  fin has no effect on our financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  amending sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative transition methods for an entity that voluntarily changes to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
zebra does not currently intend to make this change 
in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
clarifies when a contract with an initial net investment meets the characteristics of a derivative and when a derivative contains a financing component that warrants special reporting in the statements of cash flows 
sfas no 
is generally effective for contracts entered into or modified after june   and had no impact on zebra s financial position or results of operations 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas no 
sets standards for classification and measurement by an issuer of financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
it requires treating these instruments as a liability or an asset in some circumstances because the financial instrument is an obligation of the issuer 
zebra has issued no financial instruments with these characteristics  and sfas no 
had no effect on our financial statements 
risk factors investors should carefully consider the risks  uncertainties and other factors described below  as well as other disclosures in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  because they could have a material adverse effect on zebra s business  financial condition  operating results  and growth prospects 
zebra could encounter difficulties in any acquisition it undertakes  including unanticipated integration problems and business disruption 
acquisitions could also dilute stockholder value and adversely affect operating results 
proposed acquisitions that are not consummated may result in the write off of certain acquisition costs 
zebra may acquire or make investments in other businesses  technologies  services or products 
the process of integrating any acquired business  technology  service or product into operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures 
integration of an acquired company also may consume considerable management time and attention  which could otherwise be available for ongoing development of the business 
the expected benefits of any acquisition may not be realized 
moreover  zebra may be unable to identify  negotiate or finance future acquisitions successfully 
future acquisitions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt  contingent liabilities or amortization expenses 
to the extent that a proposed acquisition is not consummated  zebra may be required to write off certain costs associated with the acquisition  which could be significant 
zebra may not be able to continue to develop products to address user needs effectively in an industry characterized by rapid technological change 
to be successful  zebra must adapt to rapidly changing technological and application needs by continually improving its products as well as introducing new products and services to address user demands 
zebra s industry is characterized by rapidly changing technology evolving industry standards frequent new product and service introductions evolving distribution channels changing customer demands future success will depend on zebra s ability to adapt in this rapidly evolving environment 
zebra could incur substantial costs if it has to modify its business to adapt to these changes  and may even be unable to adapt to these changes 
zebra competes in a highly competitive market  which is likely to become more competitive 
competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technology and changes in customer requirements 
zebra faces significant competition in developing and selling its systems 
principal competitors have substantial marketing  financial  development and personnel resources 
to remain competitive  zebra believes it must continue to provide technologically advanced systems that satisfy the user demands  superior customer service  high levels of quality and reliability  and dependable and efficient distribution networks 
zebra cannot assure it will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors 
increased competition in printers or supplies may result in price reductions  lower gross profit margins and loss of market share  and could require increased spending on research and development  sales and marketing and customer support 
some competitors may make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships with suppliers or companies that produce complementary products 
any of these factors could reduce zebra s earnings 
the inability to protect intellectual property could harm zebra s reputation  and its competitive position may be materially damaged 
zebra s intellectual property is valuable and provides zebra with certain competitive advantages 
copyrights  patents  trade secrets and contracts are used to protect these proprietary rights 
despite these precautions  it may be possible for third parties to copy aspects of zebra s products or  without authorization  to obtain and use information which zebra regards as trade secrets 
zebra sells a significant portion of its products internationally and purchases important components from foreign suppliers 
these circumstances create a number of risks 
zebra sells a significant amount of its products to customers outside the united states 
shipments to international customers are expected to continue to account for a material portion of net sales 
risks associated with sales and purchases outside the united states include fluctuating foreign currency rates could restrict sales  or increase costs of purchasing  in foreign countries 
foreign governments may impose burdensome tariffs  quotas  taxes  trade barriers or capital flow restrictions 
political and economic instability may reduce demand for our products  or put our foreign assets at risk 
restrictions on the export or import of technology may reduce or eliminate the ability to sell in or purchase from certain markets 
potentially limited intellectual property protection in certain countries  such as china  may limit recourse against infringing products or cause zebra to refrain from selling in certain geographic territories 
staffing and managing international operations may be unusually difficult 
zebra may not be able to control international distributors working on its behalf 
economic factors  which are outside zebra s control  could lead to deterioration in the quality of zebra s accounts receivables 
zebra sells its products to customers in the united states and several other countries around the world 
sales are typically made on unsecured credit terms  which are generally consistent with the prevailing business practices in a given country 
a deterioration of economic or political conditions in a country could impair zebra s ability to collect on receivables in the affected country 
infringement on the proprietary rights of others could put zebra at a competitive disadvantage  and any related litigation could be time consuming and costly 
third parties may claim that zebra violated their intellectual property rights 
to the extent of a violation of a third party s patent or other intellectual property right  zebra may be prevented from operating its business as planned  and may be required to pay damages  to obtain a license  if available  or to use a non infringing method  if possible  to accomplish its objectives 
any of these claims  with or without merit  could result in costly litigation and divert the attention of key personnel 
zebra depends on the ongoing service of its senior management and ability to attract and retain other key personnel 
future success of zebra is substantially dependent on the continued service and continuing contributions of senior management and other key personnel 
the loss of the service of any executive officer or other key employees could adversely affect business 
zebra has no long term employment agreements with key personnel and maintains minimal key man life insurance policies on its key employees 
the ability to attract  retain and motivate highly skilled employees is important to zebra s long term success 
competition for personnel in zebra s industry is intense  and zebra may be unable to retain key employees or attract  assimilate or retain other highly qualified employees in the future 
terrorist attacks or war could lead to further economic instability and adversely affect zebra s stock price  operations  and profitability 
the terrorist attacks that occurred in the united states on september  caused major instability in the us and other financial markets 
possible further acts of terrorism and current and future war risks could have a similar impact 
the united states continues to take military action against terrorism and is currently engaged in a costly occupation of iraq 
these events may lead to additional armed hostilities or to further acts of terrorism and civil disturbance in the united states or elsewhere  which may further contribute to economic instability 
any such attacks could  among other things  cause further instability in financial markets and could directly  or indirectly through reduced demand  negatively affect zebra s facilities and operations or those of its customers or suppliers 
taxing authority challenges may lead to tax payments exceeding current reserves 
zebra operates in multiple tax jurisdictions in the united states and worldwide  and uses strategies to minimize its tax expense 
local tax authorities may challenge these tax positions from time to time 
adverse outcomes in these situations may exceed zebra s reserves for tax payments and may increase zebra s effective tax rate

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate risk zebra is exposed to the impact of changes in interest rates because of our large investment portfolio 
as stated in our written investment policy  the investment portfolio is viewed as a strategic resource that will be managed to achieve above market rates of return in exchange for accepting a prudent amount of incremental risk  which includes the risk of interest rate movements 
risk tolerance is constrained by an overriding objective to preserve capital across each quarterly reporting cycle 
zebra mitigates interest rate risk with an investment policy that requires the use of outside professional investment managers  investment liquidity and broad diversification across investment strategies  and which limits the types of investments that may be made 
moreover  the policy requires due diligence of each investment manager both before employment and on an ongoing basis

these investment funds use a variety of investment strategies  some of which involve the use of equity securities 
each investment manager s portfolio is designed to be market neutral  although an individual fund within a portfolio may be exposed to market risk
