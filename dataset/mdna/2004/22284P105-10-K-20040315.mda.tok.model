executive overview we are one of the ten largest truckload carriers in the united states measured by revenue 
we focus on longer lengths of haul in targeted markets where we believe our service standards can provide a competitive advantage 
we are a major carrier for traditional truckload customers such as manufacturers and retailers  as well as for transportation companies such as freight forwarders  less than truckload carriers  and third party logistics providers that require a high level of service to support their businesses 
between and  we grew our revenue before fuel and other surcharges from million to million through internal growth and acquisitions 
over the same period  we grew net income from  or 
per diluted share  to million  or per diluted share 
we believe this rapid growth was strategically important  as we gained the size and equipment capacity to cover additional traffic lanes and geographic areas for customers  participate in competitive bids to transport freight for major shippers and develop a substantial dedicated service business 
beginning in  the combination of softening freight demand and our rapid expansion affected our profitability  as we were unable to obtain the freight rates and levels of asset utilization we expected 
at the same time  rising insurance premiums and depressed used truck prices increased our operating costs 
as a result  our freight revenue declined slightly and our net income declined to million in we experienced a net loss of million in  including a million pre tax impairment charge relating to the reduced market value of our used tractors 
following the setbacks in and early  we adopted several business practices in that were designed to improve our profitability and particularly  our average revenue per tractor  our chief measure of asset utilization 
the most significant of these practices were constraining the size of our tractor and trailer fleets until profit margins justify expansion  increasing freight volumes within our existing traffic lanes  replacing lower yielding freight  implementing selective rate increases  and reinforcing our cost control efforts 
we believe that a combination of these business practices and an improved freight environment contributed to substantial improvement in our operating performance between and for  our freight revenue increased to million and our net income improved to million 
for  the key factors that we expect to affect our profitability are our revenue per mile  our miles per tractor  our compensation of drivers  our capital cost of revenue equipment  and our costs of maintenance and insurance and claims 
we expect our costs for driver compensation and the ownership and financing of our equipment to increase significantly 
on march  we are implementing a three cent per mile increase in the compensation of our employee and independent contractor drivers  and we also added compensation for detention time effective january  we also expect our revenue equipment capital cost whether in the form of interest and depreciation or payments under operating leases to increase by approximately two cents per mile 
to overcome these cost increases and improve our margins we will need to achieve significant increases in revenue per tractor  particularly in revenue per mile 
other areas we expect to have a significant impact include maintenance costs  which we expect to decrease because of a newer tractor fleet  insurance and claims  which can be volatile due to our large self insured retention  and miles per tractor  which will be affected by our ability to attract and retain drivers in an increasingly tight driver market  our success with improving the utilization of our solo driver fleet  and our success in addressing utilization challenges imposed by the new hours of service regulations 
in evaluating these factors  it may be useful to note that each one cent per mile difference in revenue or cost per mile has an impact of approximately 
per share on our earnings per share and each one percent increase or decrease in miles per tractor has an impact of approximately 
per share on earnings per share 
revenue we generate substantially all of our revenue by transporting freight for our customers 
generally  we are paid by the mile or by the load for our services 
the main factors that affect our revenue are the revenue per mile we receive from our customers  the percentage of miles for which we are compensated  and the number of miles we generate with our equipment 
these factors relate  among other things  to the us economy  inventory levels  the level of truck capacity in our markets  specific customer demand  the percentage of team driven tractors in our fleet  and our average length of haul 
we also derive revenue from fuel surcharges  loading and unloading activities  equipment detention  and other accessorial services 
freight revenue  which is our revenue before fuel and accessorial surcharges  has accounted for approximately to of our total revenue over the past three years 
we expect accessorial revenue  primarily for equipment detention and stop offs  to increase with the new hours of service regulations that became effective january  since we have held our fleet size relatively constant 
an overcapacity of trucks in our fleet and the industry generally as the economy slowed has contributed to lower equipment utilization and pricing pressure 
the main constraints on our internal growth are the ability to recruit and retain a sufficient number of qualified drivers and in times of slower growth  to add profitable freight 
in addition to constraining fleet size  we reduced our number of two person driver teams during and have since held the percentage relatively constant to better match the demand for expedited long haul service 
our single driver fleets generally operate in shorter lengths of haul  generate fewer miles per tractor  and experience more non revenue miles  but the additional expenses and lower productive miles are expected to be offset by generally higher revenue per loaded mile and the reduced employee expense of compensating only one driver 
we expect operating statistics and expenses to shift with the mix of single and team operations 
during we conducted an intense evaluation of the freight in what we call in between movements 
in between movements generally have lengths of haul between and miles 
they are longer than one day regional moves but not long enough for expedited team service or two full days with a single driver 
in many instances  the revenue we have generated from in between movements has been insufficient to generate the profitability we desire based on the amount of time the tractor and driver are committed to the load 
accordingly  we examined each in between movement and negotiated with our customers to raise rates  obtain more favorable loads  or cease hauling the in between loads 
during the period of our evaluation in  these in between movements represented approximately one quarter of our total loads  and we believe they have been significantly less profitable than our longer or shorter lengths of haul 
based on the initial results of these efforts  we believe that we have significant opportunities to improve our profitability over time as we continue to focus on our in between loads 
expenses and profitability over the past four years the trucking industry has experienced a significant increase in operating costs 
the main factors for the industry as well as for us have been an increased annual cost of tractors due to higher initial prices and lower used truck values  higher maintenance expense due to operating an older fleet  a higher overall cost of insurance and claims  and elevated fuel prices 
other than those categories  our total expenses have declined as a percentage of revenue 
going forward  however  we expect driver and independent contractor compensation to increase as a result of the three cent increase in compensation to our drivers 
looking forward  our profitability goal is to return to an operating ratio of approximately 
we expect this to require additional improvements in revenue per tractor per week  particularly in revenue per mile  to overcome expected additional cost increases to expand our margins 
because a large percentage of our costs are variable  changes in revenue per mile affect our profitability to a greater extent than changes in miles per tractor 
revenue equipment we operate approximately  tractors and  trailers 
of our tractors  at december   approximately  were owned   were financed under operating leases  and were provided by independent contractors  who own and drive their own tractors 
of our trailers  at december   approximately  were owned and approximately  were financed under operating leases 
we recognized pre tax impairment charges of million in the fourth quarter of and million in the first quarter of in relation to the reduced value of our model year through tractors 
in addition  we increased the depreciation rate and decreased salvage values on our remaining tractors to reflect our expectations concerning market value at disposition 
in june we entered into a trade in agreement with an equipment manufacturer with trade in values which approximate the expected disposition value of the model year tractors 
our assumptions represent our best estimate  and actual values could differ by the time those tractors are scheduled for trade 
because of the increases in historical purchase prices and residual values  the annual expense per tractor on model year and tractors is expected to be higher than the annual expense on the units being replaced 
by the time the entire fleet is converted  anticipated in  we expect the total increase in expense to be approximately one and one half cent pre tax per mile  excluding the cost of financing 
the timing of these expenses could be affected in future periods  because we are in the process of changing our tractor trade cycle from a period of approximately four years to three years 
if the tractors are leased instead of purchased  the references to increased depreciation would be reflected as additional lease expense 
we finance a portion of our tractor and trailer fleet with off balance sheet operating leases 
these leases generally run for a period of three years for tractors and seven years for trailers 
with our tractor trade cycle currently transitioning from approximately four years back to three years  we have been purchasing the leased tractors at the expiration of the lease term  although there is no commitment to purchase the tractors 
the first trailer leases expire in  and we have not determined whether to purchase trailers at the end of these leases 
in april  we entered into a sale leaseback arrangement covering approximately  of our trailers 
this arrangement is more fully described below in the revenue equipment rentals and purchased transportation discussion 
independent contractors owner operators provide a tractor and a driver and are responsible for all operating expenses in exchange for a fixed payment per mile 
we do not have the capital outlay of purchasing the tractor 
the payments to independent contractors and the financing of equipment under operating leases are recorded in revenue equipment rentals and purchased transportation 
expenses associated with owned equipment  such as interest and depreciation  are not incurred  and for independent contractor tractors  driver compensation  fuel  and other expenses are not incurred 
because obtaining equipment from independent contractors and under operating leases effectively shifts financing expenses from interest to above the line operating expenses  we evaluate our efficiency using net margin rather than operating ratio 
results of operations for comparison purposes in the table below  we use freight revenue in addition to total revenue when discussing changes as a percentage of revenue 
we believe excluding these sometimes volatile sources of revenue affords a more consistent basis for comparing the results of operations from period to period 
freight revenue total revenue less fuel surcharge and accessorial revenue excludes million  million and million of fuel and accessorial surcharge revenue in the three years ended december    and  respectively 
with the new hours of service regulations that became effective january   we expect accessorial revenue  primarily for equipment detention and stop offs  to increase significantly 
under the new regulatory requirements  we may reclassify accessorial revenue into freight revenue in future periods 
the following table sets forth the percentage relationship of certain items to total revenue and freight revenue total revenue freight revenue operating expenses operating expenses salaries  wages  and related salaries  wages  and expenses related expenses fuel expense fuel expense operations and maintenance operations and maintenance revenue equipment rentals revenue equipment rentals and purchased and purchased transportation transportation operating taxes and licenses operating taxes and licenses insurance and claims insurance and claims communications and utilities communications and utilities general supplies and general supplies and expenses expenses depreciation and depreciation and amortization  including amortization  including gains losses on gains losses on disposition of equipment disposition of equipment and impairment of assets and impairment of assets total operating expenses total operating expenses operating income operating income other income expense  net other income expense  net income loss before income loss before income taxes income taxes income tax expense benefit income tax expense benefit net income loss net income loss freight revenue is total revenue less fuel surcharge and accessorial revenue 
in this table  fuel surcharge and accessorial revenue are shown netted against the appropriate expense category 
salaries  wages  and related expenses  million  million  and million  fuel expense  million  million  and million  operations and maintenance  million  million  and million in  and  respectively 
includes a million and a million pre tax impairment charge or and of freight revenue in and  respectively 
comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  total revenue increased million  or  to million in  from million in freight revenue excludes million of fuel and accessorial surcharge revenue in and million in for comparison purposes in the discussion below  we use freight revenue when discussing changes as a percentage of revenue 
we believe removing this sometimes volatile source of revenue affords a more consistent basis for comparing the results of operations from period to period 
freight revenue total revenue less fuel surcharge and accessorial revenue increased million  to million in  from million in revenue per tractor per week increased to  in from  in the revenue per tractor per week increase was primarily generated by a higher rate per loaded mile which was partially offset by an increase in non revenue miles 
weighted average tractors decreased to  in from  in we have elected to constrain the size of our tractor fleet until fleet production and profitability improve 
salaries  wages  and related expenses  net of accessorial revenue of million in and  decreased million  to million in  from million in as a percentage of freight revenue  salaries  wages  and related expenses decreased to in  from in the decrease was largely attributable to our utilizing a larger percentage of single driver tractors  with only one driver per tractor to be compensated and implementing changes in our pay structure 
driver wages are expected to increase as a percentage of revenue in future periods  due to a pay increase that will go into effect march  management expects wages to increase approximately three cents per mile or approximately million pre tax on an annualized basis 
our payroll expense for employees other than over the road drivers remained relatively constant at of freight revenue in and of freight revenue in health insurance  employer paid taxes  workers compensation  and other employee benefits decreased to of freight revenue in from of freight revenue in  mainly due to improving claims experience in the company s workers compensation plan 
as a percentage of freight revenue  salaries  wages  and related expenses was impacted during the year in part by an approximately  claim relating to a natural gas explosion in our indianapolis terminal that injured four employees  which was partially offset by favorable workers compensation experience otherwise 
fuel expense  net of fuel surcharge revenue of million in and million in  remained constant at million in and as a percentage of freight revenue  net fuel expense remained relatively constant at in and in fuel prices increased sharply during due to unrest in venezuela and the middle east and low inventories 
however  fuel surcharges amounted to 
per loaded mile in compared to 
per loaded mile in  which partially offset the increased fuel expense 
higher fuel prices will increase our operating expenses 
fuel costs may be affected in the future by volume purchase commitments  the collectibility of fuel surcharges  and lower fuel mileage due to government mandated emissions standards that were effective october   and have resulted in less fuel efficient engines 
operations and maintenance consist primarily of vehicle maintenance  repairs and driver recruitment expenses 
net of accessorial revenue of million in and  operations and maintenance increased million to million in from million in as a percentage of freight revenue  net operations and maintenance expense remained relatively constant at in and we extended the trade cycle on our tractor fleet from three years to four years in  which resulted in an increase in the number of required repairs during the first half of we are in the process of changing our tractor trade cycle back to a period of approximately three years  and we expect maintenance costs to decrease as the reduced maintenance cost of the new tractors is no longer offset by the high cost of preparing used tractors for disposition 
the average age of our tractor and trailer fleets decreased to and months at december  from and months as of december  respectively 
driver recruiting expense is expected to increase because of greater demand for trucking services and a tighter supply of drivers 
revenue equipment rentals and purchased transportation increased million  to million in  from million in as a percentage of freight revenue  revenue equipment rentals and purchased transportation increased to in from in the increase is due principally to two factors 
first  the revenue equipment rental expense increased million  or  to million in  from million in as of december  we had financed approximately  tractors and  trailers under operating leases as compared to tractors and  trailers under operating leases as of december on april   we entered into a sale leaseback transaction involving approximately  dry van trailers 
we sold the trailers to a finance company for approximately million in cash and leased the trailers back under three year walk away leases 
the approximately million gain on the sale leaseback transaction will be amortized over the life of the lease 
also in april  we entered into an agreement with a finance company to sell approximately  dry van trailers for approximately million in cash and to lease  model year dry van trailers over the next twelve months 
the leases on the new trailers are seven year walk away leases 
the approximately million loss on the dry van transaction will be recognized with additional depreciation expense from the date of the transaction until the units are sold 
our revenue equipment rental expense is expected to increase in the future to reflect these transactions  which will be partially offset by no longer recognizing depreciation and interest expense with respect to these trailers or tractors 
in addition  in september  we entered into an agreement with volvo for the lease with an option to purchase of up to new tractors  with these units being leased under month walk away leases 
the increase in revenue equipment rentals and purchased transportation is also due to the payments to independent contractors increasing million to million in from million in  mainly due to an increase in the independent contractor fleet to an average of in versus an average of in payments due to independent contractors are expected to increase as a percentage of revenue in future periods  due to the approximately three cents per mile increase in compensation to independent contractors that will go into effect march  the financial impact will be approximately million pretax on an annualized basis 
operating taxes and licenses increased million  to million in  from million in as a percentage of freight revenue  operating taxes and licenses remained essentially constant at in and insurance and claims  consisting primarily of premiums and deductible amounts for liability  physical damage  and cargo damage insurance and claims  increased million  to million in from million in as a percentage of freight revenue  insurance and claims expense increased to in from in insurance and claims expense has increased greatly since the increase is a result of an industry wide increase in insurance rates  which we addressed by adopting an insurance program with significantly higher deductible exposure  and our unfavorable accident experience over the past three years 
insurance and claims expense will vary based on the frequency and severity of claims  the premium expense  and the level of self insured retention 
because of another increase in self insured retentions  effective march   our future expenses of insurance and claims may be higher or more volatile than in historical periods 
communications and utilities increased million  to million in  from million in as a percentage of freight revenue  communications and utilities remained essentially constant at in and general supplies and expenses  consisting primarily of headquarters and other terminal facilities expenses  decreased million  to million in  from million in as a percentage of freight revenue  general supplies and expenses remained essentially constant at in and depreciation  amortization and impairment charge  consisting primarily of depreciation of revenue equipment  decreased million  to million in from million in as a percentage of freight revenue  depreciation and amortization decreased to in from in the decrease in part resulted because we did not have an impairment charge in the period  as we recorded a million impairment charge in the period 
depreciation and amortization expense is net of any gain or loss on the disposal of tractors and trailers 
gains on the disposal of tractors and trailers were approximately million in compared to a loss of million in in addition  we executed the april sale leaseback transaction  discussed under the revenue equipment rentals and purchased transportation discussion above 
these factors were partially offset by increased depreciation expense on our tractors and on our new tractors 
we expect our annual cost of tractor and trailer ownership and or leasing to increase in future periods 
the increase is expected to result from a combination of higher initial prices of new equipment  lower resale values for used equipment  and increased depreciation expense on some of our existing equipment over their remaining lives in order to better match expected book values or lease residual values with market values at the equipment disposal date 
to the extent equipment is leased under operating leases  the amounts will be reflected in revenue equipment rentals and purchased transportation 
to the extent equipment is owned or obtained under capitalized leases  the amounts will be reflected as depreciation expense and interest expense 
those expense items will fluctuate with changes in the percentage of our equipment obtained under operating leases versus owned and under capitalized leases 
amortization expense relates to deferred debt costs incurred and covenants not to compete from five acquisitions 
goodwill amortization ceased beginning january   in accordance with sfas no 
 and we evaluate goodwill and certain intangibles for impairment  annually 
during the second quarter of and  we tested our goodwill for impairment and found no impairment 
other expense  net  decreased million  to million in  from million in as a percentage of freight revenue  other expense decreased to in from in the decrease was the result of lower debt balances and more favorable interest rates 
included in the other expense category are interest expense  interest income  and pre tax non cash adjustments related to the accounting for interest rate derivatives under sfas no 
 which amounted to a million gain in and a million loss in during the first quarter of  we prepaid the remaining million in previously outstanding ten year  private placement notes with borrowings from the credit agreement 
in conjunction with the prepayment of the borrowings  we recognized an approximate million pre tax charge to reflect the early extinguishment of debt 
the losses related to the write off of debt issuance and other deferred financing costs and a premium paid on the retirement of the notes 
upon adoption of sfas in  we reclassified the loss and it is no longer classified as an extraordinary item 
income tax expense increased million to million in from million in the effective tax rate is different from the expected combined tax rate due to permanent differences related to a per diem pay structure implemented in due to the nondeductible effect of per diem  our tax rate will fluctuate in future periods as income fluctuates 
as a result of the factors described above  net income increased million  or  to million in from million in as a result of the foregoing  our net margin increased to in from in comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  freight revenue total revenue less fuel surcharge and accessorial revenue decreased million  to million in  from million in our revenue was affected by a decrease in weighted average number of tractors partially offset by a increase in revenue per tractor per week to  in from  in the revenue per tractor per week increase was primarily generated by a higher utilization of equipment and a higher rate per total mile 
weighted average tractors decreased to  in from  in we have elected to constrain the size of our tractor fleet until fleet production and profitability improve 
salaries  wages  and related expenses  net of accessorial revenue of million in and million in  decreased million  to million in  from million in as a percentage of freight revenue  salaries  wages  and related expenses decreased to in  from in wages for over the road drivers as a percentage of freight revenue decreased to in from in the decrease was largely attributable to us utilizing a larger percentage of single driver tractors  with only one driver per tractor to be compensated  implementing changes in our pay structure and implementing a per diem pay program for our drivers during august as a percentage of freight revenue  our payroll expense for employees other than over the road drivers increased to in from in due to growth in headcount and local drivers in the dedicated fleet 
health insurance  employer paid taxes  workers compensation  and other employee benefits decreased to in from in the decrease was primarily due to lower employer paid taxes related to lower wage levels and was partially offset by increases in workers compensation and health insurance costs related to rising medical expenses  which are expected to continue to increase in future periods 
fuel expense  net of fuel surcharge revenue of million in and million in  decreased million  to million in  from million in as a percentage of freight revenue  net fuel expense remained relatively constant at in and in fuel surcharges amounted to 
per loaded mile in compared to 
per loaded mile in fuel prices have increased sharply during the first two months of because of reasons such as unrest in venezuela and the middle east and low inventories 
higher fuel prices will increase our operating expenses 
fuel costs may be affected in the future by volume purchase commitments  the collectibility of fuel surcharges  and lower fuel mileage due to government mandated emissions standards that were effective october   and will result in less fuel efficient engines 
we did not have any fuel hedging contracts at december  operations and maintenance consist primarily of vehicle maintenance  repairs and driver recruitment expenses 
net of accessorial revenue of million in and million in  operations and maintenance decreased million to million in from million in as a percentage of freight revenue  operations and maintenance remained essentially constant at in and we extended the trade cycle on our tractor fleet from three years to four years  which resulted in an increase in the number of required repairs 
however  the increased repair costs were offset by reduced driver recruitment expenses 
we expect maintenance costs to decrease as we take delivery of new tractors 
driver recruiting expense may increase if shipping volumes increase and create greater demand for trucking services 
revenue equipment rentals and purchased transportation decreased million  to million in  from million in as a percentage of freight revenue  revenue equipment rentals and purchased transportation decreased to in from in the decrease was the result of lower lease payments of freight revenue in compared to of freight revenue in and a smaller fleet of owner operators during an average of in compared to an average of in 
the smaller fleet of owner operators resulted in lower payments to owner operators of freight revenue in compared to of freight revenue in 
we expect our annual cost of tractor and trailer ownership and or leasing to increase in future periods 
the increase is expected to result from a combination of higher initial prices of new equipment  lower resale values for used equipment  and increased depreciation lease payments on some of our existing equipment over their remaining lives in order to better match expected book values or lease residual values with market values at the equipment disposal date 
to the extent equipment is leased under operating leases  the amounts will be reflected in revenue equipment rentals and purchased transportation

those expense items will fluctuate with changes in the percentage of our equipment obtained under operating leases versus owned and under capitalized leases 
operating taxes and licenses decreased million  to million in  from million in as a percentage of freight revenue  operating taxes and licenses remained essentially constant at in and insurance and claims  consisting primarily of premiums and deductible amounts for liability  physical damage  and cargo damage insurance and claims  increased million  to million in from million in as a percentage of freight revenue  insurance and claims expense increased to in from in the increase is a result of an industry wide increase in insurance rates  which we addressed by adopting an insurance program with significantly higher self insured retention exposure that is partially offset by lower premium rates 
the retention level for our primary insurance layer increased from  in to  in to  in march of  to million in november of  and to million on march  from july  to november   our excess insurance coverage over the million primary layer we had in effect million from november to november  was determined to be invalid 
although we are not aware of any claim that is expected to exceed our primary coverage  any such claim would be uninsured unless the agent s errors and omissions policy provides coverage 
in the event of an uninsured claim our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
we accrue the estimated cost of the uninsured portion of pending claims 
these accruals are based on our evaluation of the nature and severity of the claim and estimates of future claims development based on historical trends 
insurance and claims expense will vary based on the frequency and severity of claims  the premium expense  and the level of self insured retention 
because of higher self insured retentions  our future expenses of insurance and claims may be higher or more volatile than in historical periods 
communications and utilities decreased million  to million in  from million in as a percentage of freight revenue  communications and utilities remained essentially constant at in and general supplies and expenses  consisting primarily of headquarters and other terminal facilities expenses  increased million  to million in  from million in as a percentage of freight revenue  general supplies and expenses remained essentially constant at in and in depreciation  amortization and impairment charge  consisting primarily of depreciation of revenue equipment  decreased million  to million in from million in as a percentage of freight revenue  depreciation and amortization decreased to in from in the decrease is the result of impairment charges  partially offset by increased depreciation expense and losses on the sale of equipment 
we recognized pre tax charges of approximately million and million  in and  respectively  to reflect an impairment in tractor values 
depreciation and amortization expense is net of any gain or loss on the sale of tractors and trailers 
loss on the sale of tractors and trailers was approximately million in and  in we expect our annual cost of tractor and trailer ownership and or leasing to increase in future periods 
the increase is expected to result from a combination of higher initial prices of new equipment  lower resale values for used equipment  and increased depreciation lease payments on some of our existing equipment over their remaining lives in order to better match expected book values or lease residual values with market values at the equipment disposal date

as a result of the foregoing  our net margin increased to in from in liquidity and capital resources our business requires significant capital investments 
we historically have financed our capital requirements with borrowings under a line of credit  cash flows from operations and long term operating leases 
our primary sources of liquidity at december   were funds provided by operations  proceeds under the securitization facility as defined below  borrowings under our primary credit agreement  which had maximum available borrowing of million at december  the credit agreement  the april trailer transactions  and operating leases of revenue equipment 
we believe our sources of liquidity are adequate to meet our current and projected needs for at least the next twelve months 
on a longer term basis  based on anticipated future cash flows  current availability under our credit facility  and sources of equipment lease financing that we expect will be available to us  management does not expect that the company will experience significant liquidity constraints in the foreseeable future 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in  million in and million in our primary sources of cash flow from operations in were net income and depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization in and included a million and a million pre tax impairment charge  respectively 
the period also included an unusually large collection of receivables that had resulted from billing problems during our number of days sales in accounts receivable decreased to days in from days in net cash used in investing activities was million in  million in  and million in in  the net cash was used primarily for the purchase of revenue equipment 
in  net cash used in investing activities related to the purchase of tractors  which were previously financed through operating leases  and the acquisition of new revenue equipment net of trade ins using proceeds from the credit agreement 
during  capital expenditures were lower than in previous years due to our planned slower fleet growth as well as our decision to lengthen our tractor trade cycle 
in  approximately million was related to the financing of our headquarters facility  which was previously financed through an operating lease that expired in march we financed the facility using proceeds from the credit agreement 
we expect capital expenditures  primarily for revenue equipment net of trade ins  to be approximately million in  exclusive of acquisitions  as we transition back to a three year trade cycle for tractors and a seven year trade cycle on dry van trailers 
net cash used in financing activities was million in  million in and million in during  we reduced outstanding balance sheet debt by million 
approximately million of this reduction was from proceeds of the april sale leaseback transaction 
at december   we had outstanding debt of million  primarily consisting of million in the securitization facility  million drawn under the credit agreement  and a million interest bearing note to the former primary stockholder of srt 
interest rates on this debt range from to 
during the first quarter of  we prepaid the remaining million in previously outstanding ten year private placement notes with borrowings from the credit agreement 
in conjunction with the prepayment of the borrowings  we incurred a million after tax extraordinary item million pre tax to reflect the early extinguishment of debt 
upon adoption of sfas in  we reclassified the charge and it is no longer classified as an extraordinary item 
in december  we entered into the credit agreement with a group of banks 
the facility matures in december borrowings under the credit agreement are based on the banks base rate  which floats daily  or libor  which accrues interest based on one  two  three  or six month libor rates plus an applicable margin that is adjusted quarterly between and based on cash flow coverage 
at december  and  the margin was and  respectively 
at december   we had million outstanding on which the interest rate was 
the credit agreement is guaranteed by us and all of our subsidiaries except cvti receivables corp 
and volunteer insurance limited 
the credit agreement has a maximum borrowing limit of million with an accordion feature which permits an increase up to a maximum borrowing limit of million 
borrowings related to revenue equipment are limited to the lesser of of net book value of revenue equipment or the maximum borrowing limit 
letters of credit are limited to an aggregate commitment of million 
the credit agreement includes a security agreement such that the credit agreement may be collateralized by virtually all of our assets if a covenant violation occurs 
a commitment fee  that is adjusted quarterly between and per annum based on cash flow coverage  is due on the daily unused portion of the credit agreement 
at december  and  we had undrawn letters of credit outstanding of approximately million and million  respectively 
in december  we entered into a million revolving accounts receivable securitization facility the securitization facility 
on a revolving basis  we sell our interests in our accounts receivable to crc  a wholly owned bankruptcy remote special purpose subsidiary incorporated in nevada 
crc sells a percentage ownership in such receivables to an unrelated financial entity 
we can receive up to million of proceeds  subject to eligible receivables and will pay a service fee recorded as interest expense  based on commercial paper interest rates plus an applicable margin of per annum and a commitment fee of per annum on the daily unused portion of the facility 
as discussed in the financial statement footnotes  the net proceeds under the securitization facility are required to be shown as a current liability because the term  subject to annual renewals  is days 
as of december and  there were million and million in proceeds received 
crc does not meet the requirements for off balance sheet accounting  therefore  it is reflected in our consolidated financial statements 
the credit agreement and securitization facility contain certain restrictions and covenants relating to  among other things  dividends  tangible net worth  cash flow  acquisitions and dispositions  and total indebtedness and are cross defaulted 
we are in compliance with the credit agreement and securitization facility as of december  contractual obligations and commitments we had commitments outstanding related to equipment  debt obligations  and diesel fuel purchases as of december  the following table sets forth our contractual cash obligations and commitments as of december  payments due by period there in thousands total after long term debt   short term debt   operating leases        lease residual value guarantees      purchase obligations diesel fuel   equipment   total contractual cash obligations        in  approximately million of this amount represents proceeds drawn under our securitization facility 
the net proceeds under the securitization facility are required to be shown as a current liability because the term  subject to annual renewals  is days 
we expect the securitization facility to be renewed in december this amount represents volume purchase commitments for the period through our truck stop network 
we estimate that this amount represents approximately of our fuel needs for the period 
amount reflects the total purchase price or lease commitment of tractors and trailers scheduled for delivery throughout net of estimated trade in values and other dispositions  the estimated amount due under these commitments is approximately million 
these purchases are expected to be financed by debt  proceeds from sales of existing equipment  and cash flows from operations 
we have the option to cancel commitments relating to equipment with days notice 
historically  we have financed a significant portion of our revenue equipment through operating leases 
off balance sheet arrangements operating leases have been an important source of financing for our revenue equipment 
we lease a significant portion of our tractor and trailer fleet using operating leases 
substantially all of the leases have residual value guarantees under which we must insure that the lessor receives a negotiated amount for the equipment at the expiration of the lease 
at december   we had financed approximately  tractors and  trailers under operating leases 
vehicles held under operating leases are not carried on our balance sheet  and lease payments in respect of such vehicles are reflected in our income statements in the line item revenue equipment rentals and purchased transportation 
our revenue equipment rental expense was million in  compared to million in the total amount of remaining payments under operating leases as of december   was million 
in connection with various operating leases  we issued residual value guarantees  which provide that if we do not purchase the leased equipment from the lessor at the end of the lease term  then we are liable to the lessor for an amount equal to the shortage if any between the proceeds from the sale of the equipment and an agreed value 
as of december   the maximum amount of the residual value guarantees was approximately million 
to the extent the expected value at the lease termination date is lower than the residual value guarantee  we would accrue for the difference over the remaining lease term 
we believe that proceeds from the sale of equipment under operating leases would exceed the payment obligation on all operating leases except those operating leases relating to model year equipment 
the amount accrued on the model year equipment is approximately million pre tax 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make decisions based upon estimates  assumptions  and factors we consider as relevant to the circumstances 
such decisions include the selection of applicable accounting principles and the use of judgment in their application  the results of which impact reported amounts and disclosures 
changes in future economic conditions or other business circumstances may affect the outcomes of our estimates and assumptions 
accordingly  actual results could differ from those anticipated 
a summary of the significant accounting policies followed in preparation of the financial statements is contained in note of the financial statements attached hereto 
the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies  which are those that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require significant judgment or use of complex estimates 
property and equipment depreciation is calculated using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
the annual depreciation on tractors and trailers is approximately million 
we have previously recorded impairment charges for the through model year tractors related to the reduced market value of those units 
we also adjusted our depreciation rate and estimates of salvage values for the model year tractors for the estimated reduced disposition values 
we depreciate revenue equipment excluding day cabs over five to ten years with salvage values ranging from to 
we evaluate the salvage value  useful life  and annual depreciation of tractors and trailers annually based on the current market environment and our recent experience with disposition values 
we also evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets for impairment by analyzing the operating performance and future cash flows for those assets  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of such assets may not be recoverable 
we evaluate the need to adjust the carrying value of the underlying assets if the sum of the expected cash flows is less than the carrying value 
impairment can be impacted by our projection of future cash flows  the level of actual cash flows and salvage values  the methods of estimation used for determining fair values and the impact of guaranteed residuals 
any changes in management s judgments could result in greater or lesser annual depreciation expense or additional impairment charges in the future 
insurance and other claims our insurance program for liability  property damage  and cargo loss and damage  involves self insurance with high risk retention levels 
we accrue the estimated cost of the uninsured portion of pending claims 
these accruals are based on our evaluation of the nature and severity of the claim and estimates of future claims development based on historical trends  as well as the legal and other costs to settle or defend the claims 
because of our significant self insured retention amounts  we have significant exposure to fluctuations in the number and severity of claims 
if there is an increase in the frequency and severity of claims  or we are required to accrue or pay additional amounts if the claims prove to be more severe than originally assessed  our profitability would be adversely affected 
the rapid and substantial increase in our self insured retention makes these estimates an important accounting judgment 
in addition to estimates within our self insured retention layers  we also must make judgments concerning our aggregate coverage limits 
from to present  we carried excess coverage in amounts that have ranged from million to million in addition to our primary insurance coverage  although for the period from july through november  our aggregate coverage limit was million because of a fraudulently issued binder for our excess coverage 
if any claim occurrence were to exceed our aggregate coverage limits  we would have to accrue for the excess amount  and our critical estimates include evaluating whether a claim may exceed such limits and  if so  by how much 
currently  we are not aware of any such claims 
if one or more claims from this period were to exceed the then effective coverage limits  our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
lease accounting and off balance sheet transactions operating leases have been an important source of financing for our revenue equipment 
we lease a significant portion of our tractor and trailer fleet using operating leases 
substantially all of the leases have residual value guarantees under which we must insure that the lessor receives a negotiated amount for the equipment at the expiration of the lease 
at december   we had financed approximately  tractors and  trailers under operating leases 
vehicles held under operating leases are not carried on our balance sheet  and lease payments in respect of such vehicles are reflected in our income statements in the line item revenue equipment rentals and purchased transportation 
our revenue equipment rental expense was million in  compared to million in the total amount of remaining payments under operating leases as of december   was million 
in connection with various operating leases  we issued residual value guarantees  which provide that if we do not purchase the leased equipment from the lessor at the end of the lease term  then we are liable to the lessor for an amount equal to the shortage if any between the proceeds from the sale of the equipment and an agreed value 
as of december   the maximum amount of the residual value guarantees was approximately million 
to the extent the expected value at the lease termination date is lower than the residual value guarantee  we would accrue for the difference over the remaining lease term 
we believe that proceeds from the sale of equipment under operating leases would exceed the payment obligation on all operating leases except those operating leases relating to model year equipment 
the amount accrued on the model year equipment is approximately million pre tax 
the estimated values at lease termination involve management judgments 
as leases are entered into  determination as to the classification as an operating or capital lease involves management judgments on residual values and useful lives 
accounting for income taxes in this area  we make important judgments concerning a variety of factors  including  the appropriateness of tax strategies  expected future tax consequences based on future company performance  and to the extent tax strategies are challenged by taxing authorities  our likelihood of success 
the company utilizes certain income tax planning strategies to reduce its overall cost of income taxes 
upon audit  it is possible that certain strategies might be disallowed resulting in an increased liability for income taxes 
to date  we have received notices of disallowance asserting that three of our tax planning strategies have been disallowed 
we are contesting the disallowance and have provided for our estimated exposure attributable to income tax planning strategies 
we believe that the provision for liabilities resulting from the implementation of income tax planning strategies is appropriate 
deferred income taxes represent a substantial liability on our consolidated balance sheet 
deferred income taxes are determined in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases  and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
we evaluate our tax assets and liabilities on a periodic basis and adjust these balances as appropriate 
we believe that we have adequately provided for our future tax consequences based upon current facts and circumstances and current tax law 
for the year ended december   we made no material changes in our assumptions regarding the determination of deferred income taxes 
however  should these tax positions be challenged and not prevail  different outcomes could result and have a significant impact on the amounts reported through our consolidated statement of operations 
the carrying value of our deferred tax assets tax benefits expected to be realized in the future assumes that we will be able to generate  based on certain estimates and assumptions  sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions to utilize these deferred tax benefits 
if these estimates and related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to reduce the value of the deferred tax assets resulting in additional income tax expense 
we believe that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets  net of valuation allowance  will be realized  based on forecasted income 
however  there can be no assurance that we will meet our forecasts of future income 
we evaluate the deferred tax assets on a periodic basis and assess the need for additional valuation allowances 
inflation  new emissions control regulations and fuel costs most of our operating expenses are inflation sensitive  with inflation generally producing increased costs of operations 
during the past three years  the most significant effects of inflation have been on revenue equipment prices and the compensation paid to the drivers 
also  new emissions control regulations have resulted in higher tractor prices  and there has been an industry wide increase in wages paid to attract and retain qualified drivers 
we historically have limited the effects of inflation through increases in freight rates and certain cost control efforts 
the engines used in our newer tractors are subject to new emissions control regulations  which may substantially increase our operating expense 
the federal environmental protection agency epa recently adopted new emissions control regulations  which require progressive reductions in exhaust emissions from diesel engines through  for engines manufactured in october  and thereafter 
the new regulations decrease the amount of emissions that can be released by truck engines and affect tractors produced after the effective date of the regulations 
compliance with such regulations has increased the cost of our new tractors and could substantially impair equipment productivity  lower fuel mileage  and increase our operating expenses 
some manufacturers have significantly increased new equipment prices  in part to meet new engine design requirements  and have eliminated or sharply reduced the price of repurchase commitments 
these adverse effects combined with the uncertainty as to the reliability of the vehicles equipped with the newly designed diesel engines and the residual values that will be realized from the disposition of these vehicles could increase our costs or otherwise adversely affect our business or operations 
fluctuations in the price or availability of fuel  as well as hedging activities  surcharge collection  and the volume and terms of diesel fuel purchase commitments  may increase our cost of operation  which could materially and adversely affect our profitability 
fuel is one of our largest operating expenses 
fuel prices tend to fluctuate  and from time to time we have used fuel surcharges  hedging contracts  and volume purchase arrangements to attempt to limit the effect of price fluctuations 
we impose fuel surcharges on substantially all accounts 
these arrangements may not fully protect us from fuel price increases and also may result in us not receiving the full benefit of any fuel price decreases 
we currently do not have any fuel hedging contracts in place 
if we do hedge  we may be forced to make cash payments under the hedging arrangements 
a small portion of our fuel requirements for are covered by volume purchase commitments 
based on current market conditions  we have decided to limit our hedging and purchase commitments  but we continue to evaluate such measures 
the absence of meaningful fuel price protection through these measures could adversely affect our profitability 
seasonality in the trucking industry  revenue generally decreases as customers reduce shipments during the winter holiday season and as inclement weather impedes operations 
at the same time  operating expenses generally increase  with fuel efficiency declining because of engine idling and weather creating more equipment repairs 
for the reasons stated  first quarter net income historically has been lower than net income in each of the other three quarters of the year 
our equipment utilization typically improves substantially between may and october of each year because of the trucking industry s seasonal shortage of equipment on traffic originating in california and our ability to satisfy some of that requirement 
the seasonal shortage typically occurs between may and august because california produce carriers equipment is fully utilized for produce during those months and does not compete for shipments hauled by our dry van operation 
during september and october  business increases as a result of increased retail merchandise shipped in anticipation of the holidays 
the table below sets forth quarterly information reflecting our equipment utilization miles per tractor per period during   and we believe that equipment utilization more accurately demonstrates the seasonality for our business than changes in revenue  which are affected by the timing of deliveries of new revenue equipment 
results of any one or more quarters are not necessarily indicative of annual results or continuing trends 
equipment utilization table miles per tractor per period first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter factors that may affect future results a number of factors  over which we have little or no control  may affect our future results 
factors that might cause such a difference include  but are not limited to  the following o significant increases or rapid fluctuations in fuel price and the prices and volumes of our fuel hedging and volume purchase requirements  if any 
o excess tractor and trailer capacity in the trucking industry 
o declines in the resale value of used equipment 
o strikes or other work stoppages 
o increases in interest rates  fuel taxes  and license and registration fees 
o rising costs of healthcare 
o increases in insurance costs  liability claims  and self insurance levels 
o difficulty in attracting and retaining qualified drivers  including independent contractors 
o regulatory changes  including the new hours of service requirements for drivers that became effective in january we also are affected by recessionary economic cycles and downturns in customers business cycles  particularly in market segments and industries  such as retail and manufacturing  where we have a significant concentration of customers  and regions of the country  such as california  texas  and the southeast  where we have a significant amount of business 
economic conditions may adversely affect our customers and their ability to pay for our services 
customers encountering adverse economic conditions represent a greater potential for loss and we may be required to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts 
in addition  it is not possible to predict the effects of actual or threatened terrorist attacks  efforts to combat terrorism  military action against any foreign state  heightened security requirements  or other related events 
such events  however  could negatively impact the economy and consumer confidence in the united states 
such events could also have a materially adverse effect on our future results of operations 
moreover  our results of operations may be affected by seasonal factors 
customers tend to reduce shipments after the winter holiday season and our operating expenses tend to be higher in the winter months primarily due to colder weather  which causes higher fuel consumption from increased idle time and higher repairs and maintenance costs 
we self insure for a significant portion of our claims exposure  which could significantly increase the volatility of  and decrease the amount of  our earnings 
our future insurance and claims expense could reduce our earnings and make our earnings more volatile 
we currently self insure for a portion of our claims exposure and accrue amounts for liabilities based on our assessment of claims that arise and our insurance coverage for the periods in which the claims arise 
our current insurance policy generally provides that we are self insured for personal injury and property damage claims for amounts up to million per occurrence for the first million of exposure 
however  the policy also provides for an additional million self insured aggregate amount  with a limit of million per occurrence until the million aggregate threshold is reached 
in addition to amounts for which we are self insured in the primary million layer  we self insure for the first million in the layer from million to million  which is our excess coverage limit 
we are responsible for a pro rata portion of legal expenses relating to such claims 
we also are self insured for cargo loss and damage claims for amounts up to million per occurrence 
we maintain a workers compensation plan and group medical plan for our employees with a deductible amount of million for each workers compensation claim and a stop loss amount of  for each group medical claim 
because of our significant self insured retention amounts  we have significant exposure to fluctuations in the number and severity of claims 
if there is an increase in the frequency and severity of claims  or we are required to accrue or pay additional amounts if the claims prove to be more severe than originally assessed  our profitability would be adversely affected and could vary significantly from period to period 
we maintain insurance above the amounts for which we self insure with licensed insurance carriers 
since  insurance carriers have been raising premiums for many businesses  including trucking companies 
as a result  our insurance and claims expense could increase when our current primary casualty and workers compensation coverages expire in march  or we could raise our self insured retention 
if these expenses increase  our earnings could be materially and adversely affected 
our current aggregate primary and excess casualty insurance provides coverage up to a maximum per claim amount of million 
we do not maintain directors and officers insurance coverage  although we are obligated to indemnify them against certain liabilities they may incur while serving in such capacities 
if any claim were to exceed our coverage  we would bear the excess  in addition to our other self insured amounts 
any such claim could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
ongoing insurance requirements could constrain our borrowing capacity 
the increase in our self insured retention has caused our outstanding undrawn letters of credit in favor of insurance companies to increase 
at december   our revolving line of credit had a maximum borrowing limit of million  outstanding borrowings of million  and outstanding letters of credit of million 
we expect outstanding letters of credit to increase in the future 
outstanding letters of credit reduce the available borrowings under our credit agreement  which could negatively affect our liquidity should we need to increase our borrowings in the future 
our casualty insurance coverage may have been limited to million between july and november  accordingly  a significant claim relating to that period could adversely affect our profitability 
on july   we received a binder for million of excess insurance coverage over our million primary layer of accident insurance 
subsequently  we were forced to seek replacement coverage after the insurance agent retained the premium and failed to produce proof of insurance coverage 
in november  we obtained replacement coverage of million in primary coverage with a million self insured retention and million in excess coverage with a million self insured retention 
in march  we obtained our current program  which has an aggregate million in coverage per occurrence  subject to applicable deductibles 
we recognized the premium expense in and have filed a lawsuit to recover our premiums paid and to seek coverage from the insurance agency and its errors and omissions policy on any claims that may exceed million in exposure for the july through november period 
currently  we are not aware of any claims that are expected to exceed either million during the july through november period or million during the november through march period 
if one or more claims from these periods were to exceed the then effective coverage limits  our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
we operate in a highly competitive and fragmented industry  and numerous competitive factors could impair our ability to maintain or improve our current profitability 
these factors include o we compete with many other truckload carriers of varying sizes and  to a lesser extent  with less than truckload carriers  railroads  and other transportation companies  many of which have more equipment and greater capital resources than we do 
o many of our competitors periodically reduce their freight rates to gain business  especially during times of reduced growth rates in the economy  which may limit our ability to maintain or increase freight rates or maintain significant growth in our business 
o many of our customers are other transportation companies  and they may decide to transport their own freight 
o many customers reduce the number of carriers they use by selecting so called core carriers as approved service providers  and in some instances we may not be selected 
o many customers periodically accept bids from multiple carriers for their shipping needs  and this process may depress freight rates or result in the loss of some business to competitors 
o the trend toward consolidation in the trucking industry may create other large carriers with greater financial resources and other competitive advantages relating to their size 
o advances in technology require increased investments to remain competitive  and our customers may not be willing to accept higher freight rates to cover the cost of these investments 
o competition from non asset based logistics and freight brokerage companies may adversely affect our customer relationships and freight rates 
o economies of scale that may be passed on to smaller carriers by procurement aggregation providers may improve their ability to compete with us 
we derive a significant portion of our revenue from our major customers  the loss of one or more of which could have a materially adverse effect on our business 
a significant portion of our revenue is generated from our major customers 
for  our top customers  based on revenue  accounted for approximately of our revenue  and our top customers  approximately of our revenue 
in the aggregate  subsidiaries of cnf  inc accounted for approximately of our revenue in we do not expect these percentages to change materially for generally  we do not have long term contractual relationships with our major customers  and we cannot assure you that our customers will continue to use our services or that they will continue at the same levels 
for some of our customers  we have entered into multi year contracts and we cannot assure you that the rates will remain advantageous 
a reduction in or termination of our services by one or more of our major customers could have a materially adverse effect on our business and operating results 
increases in compensation or difficulty in attracting drivers could affect our profitability and ability to grow 
periodically  the trucking industry experiences substantial difficulty in attracting and retaining qualified drivers  including independent contractors 
our ability to attract and retain drivers could be adversely affected by increased availability of alternative employment opportunities in an economic expansion and by the potential need for more drivers due to more restrictive driver hours of service requirements imposed by the us department of transportation effective january  if we are unable to continue to attract drivers and contract with independent contractors  we could be required to adjust our driver compensation package  let trucks sit idle  or operate with fewer independent contractors and face difficulty meeting shipper demands  all of which could adversely affect our growth and profitability 
we may not be successful in improving our profitability 
from through  we achieved an average annual net margin of 
in  our net margin declined to  and in  we experienced a net loss of million  including a million after tax impairment charge relating to the value of our tractors 
we have implemented certain initiatives designed to improve our profitability  and in  our net margin improved 
however  we face significant cost increases in and we cannot assure you that we will be successful in continuing to improve our profitability 
if we fail to sustain or improve our profitability  our stock price could decline 
our growth may not return to historical rates  which could adversely affect our stock price 
we experienced significant growth in revenue between our founding in and since  however  our revenue base has remained relatively constant 
there can be no assurance that our revenue growth rate will return to historical levels or that we can effectively adapt our management  administrative  and operational systems to respond to any future growth 
we can provide no assurance that our operating margins will not be adversely affected by future changes in and expansion of our business or by changes in economic conditions 
slower or less profitable growth could adversely affect our stock price 
the department of transportation adopted revised hours of service regulations that could reduce the amount of allowable driving time  and increased costs of compliance with  or liability for violation of  these and other regulations could have a materially adverse effect on our business 
the united states department of transportation dot and various state and local agencies exercise broad powers over our business  generally governing such activities as authorization to engage in motor carrier operations  safety  and insurance requirements 
the dot adopted revised hours of service regulations on april   and carriers were required to comply with the regulations beginning january  this change could reduce the potential or practical amount of time that drivers can spend driving  if we are unable to limit their other on duty activities 
these changes could adversely affect our profitability if shippers are unwilling to assist in managing the drivers non driving activities  such as loading  unloading  and waiting 
if these changes increase our costs and we cannot pass the additional costs through to shippers  our operating results could be materially and adversely affected 
we also may become subject to new or more restrictive regulations relating to matters such as fuel emissions and ergonomics 
our company drivers and independent contractors also must comply with the safety and fitness regulations promulgated by the dot  including those relating to drug and alcohol testing 
additional changes in the laws and regulations governing our industry could affect the economics of the industry by requiring changes in operating practices or by influencing the demand for  and the costs of providing  services to shippers 
the irs is auditing our and tax returns and reviewing certain of our tax planning structures  which  if successfully challenged  would subject us to increased tax payments 
federal  state  and local taxes comprise a significant part of our expenses 
as such  we actively manage these expenses when executing our business strategy  and we use a number of structures to permanently decrease our overall tax liability  or to defer cash tax payments when we believe it is appropriate 
we have disclosed to the irs the basic elements of two transactions related to taxes that were implemented in  which we understand are of a type that have been subject to heightened irs scrutiny 
in the first of these structures  we formed a contested liability trust to fund the payment of certain contested third party claims 
we deduct on our federal income tax return the contributions to the trust in the form of our right to receive payment on certain notes issued by our subsidiaries 
we intend to make further deductions if we make future contributions in respect of additional third party claims 
in the second of these structures  we changed our k plan year to end on december  and as a result deducted our plan year contribution on our federal income tax return 
both of these structures were designed to accelerate deductions to an earlier date than when they otherwise would be available 
we estimate that the combined deductions from these two structures generated combined cash federal and state tax deferrals to us of approximately million for and the tax deferrals did not affect our marginal tax rate for financial reporting purposes 
as part of its ongoing audit of our and tax returns  the irs has proposed the disallowance of the deductions relating to the k plan structure  and the deductions relating to the contested liability trust 
the irs also reviewed a captive insurance company that we established in and that also was disclosed  and has proposed the disallowance of deductions relating to the captive insurance company 
we are prepared to defend these challenges 
if the irs successfully challenges the k plan and contested liability trust structures  we estimate that we would have to repay the net federal and state tax deferrals of approximately million  plus tax deductible interest 
we would  however  be able to deduct the payments to satisfy third party claims as they become fixed and the k contributions at a later date 
if the irs successfully challenges the captive insurance company  we would have to pay approximately  in additional taxes for because the deduction would not be allowed 
because we did not change our marginal tax rate for financial reporting purposes when we took the deductions  we do not believe our marginal tax rate will be affected if the structures are disallowed 
in the event of a successful challenge  we also could owe penalties if our disclosures were deemed inadequate 
likewise  if the irs were to successfully challenge other structures we have utilized or may utilize or expand the scope of the audit of our tax returns  we also could have to make additional tax payments and perhaps payments of penalties or interest 
we have significant ongoing capital requirements that could affect our profitability if we are unable to generate sufficient cash from operations and obtain financing on favorable terms 
the truckload industry is capital intensive 
historically  we have depended on cash from operations and our credit facility to expand the size of our fleet and maintain modern revenue equipment 
we review our tractor and trailer trade cycle from time to time 
in  we extended our trade cycle for tractors from three years to four years because of a depressed market for used equipment 
we are in the process of returning to a tractor trade cycle of approximately three years 
in addition  we are increasing the ratio of trailers to tractors in our fleet and are replacing many of our older trailers with new ones 
these changes will increase our capital expenditures and borrowing requirements  or  depending on the method of financing  our leasing requirements 
our budget for capital expenditures  net of any offsets from sales or trades of equipment  is million in  exclusive of acquisitions 
we expect to pay for the projected capital expenditures with cash flows from operations  borrowings under our line of credit  and proceeds under the securitization facility 
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash from operations and obtain financing on favorable terms in the future  we may have to limit our growth  enter into less favorable financing arrangements  or operate our revenue equipment for longer periods  any of which could have a materially adverse effect on our profitability 
we currently have trade in or fixed residual agreements with certain equipment suppliers concerning the substantial majority of our tractor fleet 
if the suppliers refuse or are unable to meet their financial obligations under these agreements  or if we decline to purchase the relevant number of replacement units from the suppliers  we may suffer a financial loss upon the disposition of our equipment 
fluctuations in the price or availability of fuel  as well as hedging activities  surcharge collection  and the volume and terms of diesel fuel purchase commitments  may increase our cost of operation  which could materially and adversely affect our profitability 
fuel is one of our largest operating expenses 
diesel fuel prices fluctuate greatly due to economic  political  and other factors beyond our control 
for example  our average price for diesel fuel was per gallon in  as compared to per gallon in from time to time we have used fuel surcharges  hedging contracts  and volume purchase arrangements to attempt to limit the effect of price fluctuations 
we impose fuel surcharges on substantially all accounts 
these arrangements may not fully protect us from fuel price increases and also may result in us not receiving the full benefit of any fuel price decreases 
we currently do not have any fuel hedging contracts in place 
if we do hedge  we may be forced to make cash payments under the hedging arrangements 
a small portion of our fuel requirements for are covered by volume purchase commitments 
based on current market conditions  we have decided to limit our hedging and purchase commitments  but we continue to evaluate such measures 
the absence of meaningful fuel price protection through these measures could adversely affect our profitability 
we require large amounts of diesel fuel  particularly on the west coast and in texas 
fluctuations in fuel prices  or a shortage of diesel fuel  could materially and adversely affect our results of operations 
we may not make acquisitions in the future  or if we do  we may not be successful in our acquisition strategy 
we made nine acquisitions between and  including four between september and august accordingly  acquisitions have provided a substantial portion of our growth 
there is no assurance that we will be successful in identifying  negotiating  or consummating any future acquisitions 
if we fail to make any future acquisitions  our growth rate could be materially and adversely affected 
any acquisitions we undertake could involve the dilutive issuance of equity securities and or incurring indebtedness 
in addition  acquisitions involve numerous risks  including difficulties in assimilating the acquired company s operations  the diversion of our management s attention from other business concerns  risks of entering into markets in which we have had no or only limited direct experience  and the potential loss of customers  key employees  and drivers of the acquired company  all of which could have a materially adverse effect on our business and operating results 
if we make acquisitions in the future  we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully integrate the acquired companies or assets into our business 
our operations are subject to various environmental laws and regulations  the violation of which could result in substantial fines or penalties 
we are subject to various environmental laws and regulations dealing with the hauling and handling of hazardous materials  fuel storage tanks  air emissions from our vehicles and facilities  and discharge and retention of stormwater 
we operate in industrial areas  where truck terminals and other industrial activities are located  and where groundwater or other forms of environmental contamination have occurred 
our operations involve the risks of fuel spillage or seepage  environmental damage  and hazardous waste disposal  among others 
we also maintain above ground bulk fuel storage tanks and fueling islands at two of our facilities 
a small percentage of our freight consists of low grade hazardous substances  which subjects us to a wide array of regulations 
if we are involved in a spill or other accident involving hazardous substances  if there are releases of hazardous substances we transport  or if we are found to be in violation of applicable laws or regulations  we could be subject to liabilities that could have a materially adverse effect on our business and operating results 
if we should fail to comply with applicable environmental regulations  we could be subject to substantial fines or penalties and to civil and criminal liability 
the engines used in our newer tractors are subject to new emissions control regulations  which may substantially increase our operating expense 
the federal environmental protection agency epa recently adopted new emissions control regulations  which require progressive reductions in exhaust emissions from diesel engines through  for engines manufactured in october  and thereafter 
the new regulations decrease the amount of emissions that can be released by truck engines and affect tractors produced after the effective date of the regulations 
compliance with such regulations has increased the cost of our new tractors and could substantially impair equipment productivity  lower fuel mileage  and increase our operating expenses 
some manufacturers have significantly increased new equipment prices  in part to meet new engine design requirements  and have eliminated or sharply reduced the price of repurchase commitments 
these adverse effects combined with the uncertainty as to the reliability of the vehicles equipped with the newly designed diesel engines and the residual values that will be realized from the disposition of these vehicles could increase our costs or otherwise adversely affect our business or operations 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas provides new guidance on the recognition and measurement of an asset retirement obligation and its associated asset retirement cost 
it also provides accounting guidance for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets 
this pronouncement was effective january  we adopted sfas effective january  the adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations

 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity

many of those instruments were previously classified as equity 
sfas was developed in response to concerns expressed about issuers classification in the statement of financial position of certain financial instruments that have characteristics of both liabilities and equity  but that have been presented either entirely as equity or between the liabilities section and the equity section of the balance sheet 
sfas was effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise was effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  sfas did not affect our balance sheet presentation of our debt and equity financial instruments 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks from changes in i certain commodity prices and ii certain interest rates on our debt 
commodity price risk prices and availability of all petroleum products are subject to political  economic  and market factors that are generally outside our control 
because our operations are dependent upon diesel fuel  significant increases in diesel fuel costs could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
historically  we have been able to recover a portion of long term fuel price increases from customers in the form of fuel surcharges 
the price and availability of diesel fuel can be unpredictable as well as the extent to which fuel surcharges could be collected to offset such increases 
for diesel fuel expenses net of fuel surcharge represented of our total operating expenses and of freight revenue 
at december  we had no derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to fuel price fluctuations 
we do not trade in derivatives with the objective of earning financial gains on price fluctuations  on a speculative basis  nor do we trade in these instruments when there are no underlying related exposures 
interest rate risk our market risk is also affected by changes in interest rates 
historically  we have used a combination of fixed rate and variable rate obligations to manage our interest rate exposure 
fixed rate obligations expose us to the risk that interest rates might fall 
variable rate obligations expose us to the risk that interest rates might rise 
our variable rate obligations consist of our credit agreement and our accounts receivable securitization facility 
borrowings under the credit agreement  provided there has been no default  are based on the banks base rate  which floats daily  or libor  which accrues interest based on one  two  three  or six month libor rates plus an applicable margin that is adjusted quarterly between and based on cash flow coverage the applicable margin was at december  
during the first quarter of  we entered into two million notional amount interest rate swap agreements to manage the risk of variability in cash flows associated with floating rate debt 
the swaps expire january and march these derivatives are not designated as hedging instruments under sfas no 
and consequently are marked to fair value through earnings  in other expense in the accompanying statement of operations 
at december   the fair value of these interest rate swap agreements was a liability of million 
at december   we had variable  base rate borrowings of million outstanding under the credit agreement 
our securitization facility carries a variable interest rate based on the commercial paper rate plus an applicable margin of 
at december   borrowings of million had been drawn on the securitization facility 
assuming variable rate borrowings under the credit agreement and securitization facility at december  levels  a one percentage point increase in interest rates would increase our annual interest expense by  we do not trade in derivatives with the objective of earning financial gains on price fluctuations  on a speculative basis  nor do we trade in these instruments when there are no underlying related exposures
