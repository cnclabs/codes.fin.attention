overview the company is the nation s largest domestic inland tank barge operator with a fleet of active tank barges and towing vessels 
the company uses the inland waterway system of the us to transport bulk liquids including petrochemicals  black oil products  refined petroleum products and agricultural chemicals 
through its diesel engine services segment  the company provides after market services for large medium speed diesel engines used in marine  power generation and industrial  and rail applications 
during  approximately of the company s revenue was generated by its marine transportation segment 
the segment s customers include many of the major petrochemical and refining companies in the us products transported include raw materials for many of the end products used widely by businesses and consumers every day plastics  fiber  paints  detergents  oil additives and paper  among others 
consequently  the company s business tends to mirror the general performance of the us economy and the performance of the company s customer base 
the following table shows the products transported by the company  the revenue distribution for  the uses of these products and the factors that drive the demand for the products the company transports end uses of products transported revenue products moved distribution uses of products moved drivers petrochemicals plastics  fibers  paper  gasoline additives housing  consumer goods  autos  clothing  vehicle usages black oil products asphalt  boiler fuel  no

oil  jet fuel  heating oil vehicle usage  air travel  weather conditions agricultural chemicals liquid fertilizers  chemical feedstocks corn  cotton  wheat production although the us economy has been sluggish for several years  the company s performance has benefited from several strategic acquisitions and from cost savings initiatives 
in  the company recorded the highest revenue in its history and second highest net earnings despite a challenging economic environment for the petrochemical industry 
the company reported net earnings of  per share  on revenues of  the increase in revenues in over was achieved primarily as a result of the marine transportation equipment acquisitions from coastal in october and seariver in january in the coastal transaction  the company purchased double hull black oil tank barges and towboats  and assumed the management of coastal s remaining active black oil tank barges 
the purchase of the seariver fleet  the us marine transportation affiliate of exxonmobil  included double hull tank barges and seven towboats  and assumption of the leases on double hull tank barges 
the company s largest marine transportation market is the petrochemical market  which contributed of marine transportation revenue 
the petrochemical market was weak in due to a sluggish us economy 
as a result  the company was unable to pass through most inflationary increases in its costs to its customers  which contributed to the lower marine transportation operating margin of in versus in in addition  the company s management of the coastal tank barges is accounted for as an unincorporated joint venture  whereby all revenues and certain expenses of the managed tank barges are consolidated in the company s financial statements 
the distribution of coastal s share of the joint venture s operating profits is recognized as an operating expense  which lowered the company s marine transportation operating margin by an estimated 
the company was able to modestly raise rates during the fourth quarter of on several contract renewals 
currently  approximately of the company s marine transportation business is under term contracts with the remaining participating in the spot market  giving the company a more stable revenue stream with a smaller amount of exposure to day to day pricing fluctuations 
the marine transportation segment experienced an increase in navigational delay days during compared with due primarily to high and low water levels on the mississippi river system  fog and high winds along the gulf intracoastal waterway  and navigational delays due to repairs to a major lock located on the gulf intracoastal waterway 
these delays required the use of additional chartered towboats to meet customer delivery schedules and resulted in increased transit times that had a negative effect on the marine transportation segment s operating margins 
higher fuel prices also negatively impacted the marine transportation segment during the average price of fuel consumed in was higher by over despite fuel escalation clauses that allow the company to recover increases in the cost of fuel on a to day delay  the company estimates that the increase in fuel prices in the first quarter reduced the company s first quarter net earnings by an estimated 
per share  of which approximately 
per share was recovered in the second quarter 
for the third and fourth quarters  the negative impact of the higher fuel cost was marginal 
the company s diesel engine services segment s revenues and operating income fell and  respectively  compared with these results reflected a continued weak gulf coast offshore oil service market and a weak midwest inland dry cargo barge market 
these weak markets were partially offset by stronger west coast marine and power generation markets 
operating margins in the diesel engine services segment fell to in from in due primarily to a greater mix of parts sales versus service revenue  as parts sales historically earn a lower operating margin than service work 
the company continued to generate strong cash flow provided by operating activities during the company reduced its debt to capitalization ratio from to during  despite spending  on the seariver acquisition discussed above and  in capital expenditures 
long term debt was reduced by  to  as of december  in  the company spent  in capital expenditures  including delivery of new barges for a total of  the company s new barge construction program is designed to replace older tank barges that are retired from service without adding additional capacity 
the company projects that capital expenditures will be  to  in the projection includes the construction of new tank barges for approximately  including  for ten black oil tank barges to replace retired coastal equipment 
the company currently anticipates that it will spend an average of  per year through on new tank barge construction to replace the company s retiring tank barges 
funding for these capital expenditures is expected to be provided through operating cash flows and through available credit under the company s revolving credit facility 
during  the company undertook two important steps to secure its financial strength and flexibility 
in february  the company issued  of ten year senior notes at an interest rate of the london interbank offered rate libor plus that are callable after one year without penalty  with no principal payments required until maturity in this provided the company a substantial long term debt component for its capital structure at an attractive rate 
in addition  the company extended the maturity on its  revolving credit facility by three years to december and added an accordion feature that allows the maximum amount to increase from  to  without amendment 
at december   only  was outstanding under the revolving credit facility 
these steps allowed the company to be in position to take advantage of internal and external growth opportunities in a consolidating industry 
these growth opportunities include potential acquisitions of inland tank barge operations due to competitors facing fleet replacement decisions  and outsourcing by shippers and customers seeking to single source their tank barge requirements 
increased fleet size allows the company to improve asset utilization through more backhaul opportunities  faster barge turnarounds  more efficient use of horsepower  barges positioned closer to cargos  lower incremental costs due to enhanced purchasing power  minimal incremental administration staff and less cleaning due to operating more barges with compatible prior cargos 
the company anticipates that a stronger us and global economy in will improve petrochemical volumes 
feedstock and energy costs are expected to remain high and volatile  especially in the first half of the year  and may delay a recovery of the us petrochemical industry 
industry wide  tank barge capacity has declined since this decline should assist the tank barge industry to come into balance between the number of tank barges needed to carry its customers cargoes and the actual volumes moved  which should help the company s earnings and investment returns 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the company evaluates its estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis based on a combination of historical information and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the particular circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates based on different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the critical accounting policies that most impact the consolidated financial statements are described below 
it is also suggested that the company s significant accounting policies  as described in the company s financial statements in note  summary of significant accounting policies  be read in conjunction with this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
accounts receivable 
the company extends credit to its customers in the normal course of business 
the company regularly reviews its accounts and estimates the amount of uncollectable receivables each period and establishes an allowance for uncollectable amounts 
the amount of the allowance is based on the age of unpaid amounts  information about the current financial strength of customers  and other relevant information 
estimates of uncollectable amounts are revised each period  and changes are recorded in the period they become known 
historically  credit risk with respect to these trade receivables has generally been considered minimal because of the financial strength of the company s customers  however  a significant change in the level of uncollectable amounts could have a material effect on the company s results of operations 
property  maintenance and repairs 
property is recorded at cost 
improvements and betterments are capitalized as incurred 
depreciation is recorded on the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the individual assets 
when property items are retired  sold or otherwise disposed of  the related cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts with any gain or loss on the disposition included in income 
routine maintenance and repairs are charged to operating expense as incurred on an annual basis 
the company reviews long lived assets for impairment by vessel class whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
recoverability of the assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to future net cash expected to be generated by the assets 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
there are many assumptions and estimates underlying the determination of an impairment event or loss  if any 
the assumptions and estimates include  but are not limited to  estimated fair market value of the assets and estimated future cash flows expected to be generated by these assets  which are based on additional assumptions such as asset utilization  length of service the asset will be used  and estimated salvage values 
although the company believes its assumptions and estimates are reasonable  deviations from the assumptions and estimates could produce a materially different result 
goodwill 
the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired in transactions accounted for as a purchase are included in goodwill 
management monitors the recoverability of goodwill on an annual basis  or whenever events or circumstances indicate that interim impairment testing is necessary 
the amount of goodwill impairment  if any  is measured based on projected discounted future operating cash flows using a discount rate reflecting the company s average weighted cost of capital 
the assessment of the recoverability of goodwill will be impacted if estimated future operating cash flows are not achieved 
there are many assumptions and estimates underlying the determination of an impairment event or loss  if any 
although the company believes its assumptions and estimates are reasonable  deviations from the assumptions and estimates could produce a materially different result 
accrued insurance 
the company is subject to property damage and casualty risks associated with operating vessels carrying large volumes of bulk cargo in a marine environment 
the company maintains insurance coverage against these risks subject to a deductible  below which the company is liable 
in addition to expensing claims below the deductible amount as incurred  the company also maintains a reserve for losses that may have occurred but have not been reported to the company 
the company uses historic experience and actuarial analysis by outside consultants to estimate an appropriate level of reserves 
if the actual number of claims and magnitude were substantially greater than assumed  the required level of reserves for claims incurred but not reported could be materially understated 
the company records receivables from its insurers for incurred claims above the company s deductible 
if the solvency of the insurers became impaired  there could be an adverse impact on the accrued receivables and the availability of insurance 
acquisitions and leases in february  the company  through its marine transportation segment  entered into a long term lease with union carbide for inland tank barges 
the inland tank barges  all double hull  have a total capacity of  barrels 
the inland tank barges were acquired by dow as part of the february  merger between union carbide and dow 
the company has a long term contract with dow to provide for dow s bulk liquid inland marine transportation requirements throughout the united states inland waterway system 
with the merger between union carbide and dow  the company s long term contract with dow was amended to provide for union carbide s bulk liquid inland marine transportation requirements 
at the inception of the lease  the union carbide barges were used exclusively in union carbide service 
partial transition of the tank barges into the company s marine transportation fleet began in the third quarter and was completed during september in march  the company purchased the cargo carriers fleet of inland tank barges for  in cash from cargill  and resold six of the tank barges for  in april on october   the company completed the acquisition of seven inland tank barges and inland towboats from coastal for  in cash 
in addition  the company and coastal entered into a barge management agreement whereby the company will serve as manager of the two companies combined black oil fleet for a period of seven years 
the combined black oil fleet consists of barges owned by coastal  of which are currently active  and the company s active black oil barges 
in a related transaction  on september   the company purchased from coastal three black oil tank barges for  in cash 
on december   the company purchased the inland tank barges leased in february  as noted above  from union carbide for  nine of the tank barges were out of service and eventually sold 
on january   the company purchased from seariver  the us transportation affiliate of exxonmobil  double hull inland tank barges and seven inland towboats for  in cash  and assumed from seariver the leases of double hull inland tank barges 
on february   the company purchased three double hull inland tank barges leased by seariver from banc of america leasing for  in cash 
in addition  the company entered into a contract to provide inland marine transportation services to seariver

marine transportation the company  through its marine transportation segment  is a provider of marine transportation services  operating a current fleet of active inland tank barges and active inland towing vessels  transporting petrochemicals  black oil products  refined petroleum products and agricultural chemicals along the united states inland waterways 
the marine transportation segment is also the managing partner of a owned offshore marine partnership  consisting of four dry bulk barge and tug units 
the partnership is accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
the following table sets forth the company s marine transportation segment s revenues  costs and expenses  operating income and operating margins for the three years ended december  dollars in thousands change change to to marine transportation revenues costs and expenses costs of sales and operating expenses selling  general and administrative taxes  other than on income depreciation and other amortization amortization of goodwill  n a operating income operating margins compared with marine transportation revenues revenues for compared with increased  reflecting revenues generated from the october acquisition of inland black oil tank barges and towboats from coastal and the signing of a barge management agreement to manage coastal s remaining black oil barges  of which are currently active 
revenues from the managed coastal tank barges were included in marine transportation revenues 
the increase also reflected revenues generated from the purchase of inland tank barges and seven towboats  and the assumption of leased inland tank barges  from seariver in january petrochemical volumes transported into the midwest  excluding the seariver volumes noted above  reflected a continued gradual improvement during when compared with during the second half of  volumes of petrochemicals used in the production of gasoline blending components were strong 
petrochemical volumes along the gulf coast  excluding the seariver volumes  also reflected a continued gradual improvement 
excluding the seariver volumes  midwest and gulf coast petrochemical volumes have not fully recovered to their volume levels prior to the start of the current us recession in the spring of black oil volumes were higher than volume levels  reflecting the october coastal acquisition noted above 
during  volumes of residual fuel  a black oil product  increased as residual fuel served as a substitute for natural gas and cat cracker feedstock for the production of refined products  and offset a decline in asphalt volumes  which declined during due to a reduction in state and federal funding for road construction 
refined product volumes into the midwest for were generally at traditional seasonal levels  slow in the first quarter  improving with seasonal demand in the second and third quarters and stronger than normal in the fourth quarter 
during the second and third quarters  low midwest inventory levels and gulf coast versus midwest gasoline price differentials encouraged the movements of gasoline from the gulf coast into the midwest 
the stronger than normal fourth quarter demand for gasoline movements was fueled by numerous midwest refinery outages for maintenance  as well as low midwest inventory levels 
liquid fertilizer volumes were weak for the first nine months of  as a depressed us midwest farm belt economy significantly curtailed the application of nitrogen based fertilizer  and high natural gas prices significantly curtailed the us production of such fertilizer  thereby reducing the demand for midwest volumes of such products by tank barge 
during the fourth quarter  liquid fertilizer volumes to the midwest strengthened as the midwest farm economy improved and imported products replaced curtailed us domestic production to meet the demand to replenish low midwest inventory levels 
during  approximately of marine transportation volumes were under term contracts and were spot market volumes 
contract rates on renewals remained relatively flat for the first nine months of  with limited ability to pass through inflationary cost increases in renewals 
during the fourth quarter  the modest improvement in the petrochemical and refined products markets resulted in some modest contract renewal increases 
the modestly stronger petrochemical and refined products markets also helped overall spot market rates 
during  spot market rates fluctuated over and under contracts rates  depending on market demand  fuel prices  weather conditions and other factors  however  on average  spot market rates were modestly higher than marine transportation costs and expenses total costs and expenses for increased compared with  reflecting the additional costs and expenses associated with operating additional tank barges and towboats purchased from coastal in october and the related barge management agreement signed with coastal  and the seariver fleet acquisition in january costs of sales and operating expenses for were higher than  reflecting additional vessel personnel and higher operating expenses from the acquisitions noted above 
the segment operated an average of towboats during the first quarter  during the second quarter  during the third quarter and during the fourth quarter 
the number of towboats operated and crews required is adjusted daily  depending on the amount of volumes moved  weather conditions and voyage times 
the first quarter costs and expenses were higher due to navigational delays caused by periods of both high and low water levels on the mississippi river system  and fog and high winds along the gulf intracoastal waterway 
navigational delays also resulted from repairs to a major lock located on the gulf intracoastal waterway 
the navigational delays necessitated the use of additional chartered towboats during the first quarter and part of the second quarter  as noted above  to meet customer service requirements and schedules 
costs of sales and operating expenses for included significantly higher fuel costs when compared with the average price per gallon of diesel fuel consumed in was cents  up from the average price per gallon of cents 
for the first quarter  the price per gallon was over the first quarter of  with the second  third and fourth quarters up  and  respectively  over the corresponding quarters of term contracts contain fuel escalation clauses that allow the company to recover increases in the cost of fuel  however  there is generally a to day delay before contracts are adjusted 
it is estimated that the higher fuel prices reduced the company s first quarter earnings by an estimated 
per share  of which approximately 
per share was recovered in the second quarter 
for the third and fourth quarters  the negative impact of the higher fuel costs was marginal 
for the year  the segment consumed million gallons of diesel fuel compared with million gallons consumed in the increase primarily reflected the acquisitions noted above 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the year increased when compared with the year 
the increase reflected higher incentive compensation accruals  professional fees  and additional administrative personnel to support the acquisitions noted above 
taxes  other than on income for the year increased compared with the year  primarily reflecting increased waterway use taxes and property taxes resulting from the acquisitions noted above 
depreciation and other amortization expense for the year increased over the increase reflected new tank barge additions in and  as well as the acquisitions noted above 
marine transportation operating income and operating margins the marine transportation operating income for increased compared with the operating margin declined to compared with earned in the year 
the lower operating margin for reflected the segment s inability to pass through to its customers  through contract rate renewals and spot market rates  increases in its costs and expenses over inflationary rates 
the lower operating margin for also reflected more severe winter weather conditions in the first quarter of compared with the first quarter  major repairs to a critical lock on the gulf intracoastal waterway and rapidly escalating fuel prices during the first quarter that were only partially recovered under contractual fuel escalation clauses in the second quarter 
the year also included a full year of revenue from the october  purchase of the coastal tank barges and towboats and barge management agreement between the company and coastal 
the company s management of the coastal tank barges is accounted for as an unincorporated joint venture  whereby all revenues and certain expenses of the managed tank barges are consolidated in the company s financial statements 
the distribution of coastal s share of the joint venture s operating profits is recognized as an operating expense  which lowered the company s marine transportation operating margin by an estimated 
compared with marine transportation revenues revenues for compared with declined  reflecting an overall continued weakness in petrochemical volumes  lower refined products volumes into the midwest and lower liquid fertilizer volumes 
during  petrochemical volumes along the gulf coast remained depressed  the continued impact of the sluggish us economy  however  petrochemical volumes into the midwest improved in the second half of with the gradual replenishment of low inventory levels by midwest manufacturers 
late in the fourth quarter  petrochemical volumes along the gulf coast reflected some improvement 
black oil volumes were below volume levels for the first nine months of in november and december  volumes increased with the addition of the black oil tank barges and towboats purchased from coastal and the barge management agreement signed with coastal for the management of coastal s remaining black oil barges 
refined products volumes began the year strong  declined during the first quarter  remained weak the entire second quarter  and improved during the second half 
during the first half  high midwest refined products inventories and a new refined products pipeline from the gulf coast to the midwest that went online april   negatively impacted the volumes moved by inland tank barge 
during the second half  the movement of refined products into the midwest returned to more traditional levels  or pre levels  driven by seasonal demand variables based on inventory requirements and midwest refinery outages for maintenance 
liquid fertilizer volumes were weak in the first half  the result of significant rainfall amounts in the midwest that kept farmers out of their fields  reducing the demand for fertilizer usage  thereby reducing the demand for upriver volumes of liquid fertilizer by tank barge 
during the third quarter  volumes returned to normal seasonal levels  but declined in the fourth quarter as a major customer significantly curtailed its fertilizer output due to production problems at its facility 
in late september  tropical storm isidore  and in early october  hurricane lili  both made landfall in central louisiana  creating delays and diversions of marine equipment away from the path of the storms  and thereby lowering the company s third and fourth quarter revenues 
the impact of tropical storm isidore and hurricane lili on the results was an estimated 
per share after taxes 
during the year  approximately of marine transportation volumes were under term contracts and were spot market volumes 
during  contract renewals remained relatively flat 
spot market rates declined approximately to during the first quarter and certain spot market rates declined an additional to during the second quarter 
weak petrochemical and refined products volumes during the first half created lower utilization and excess tank barge capacity industry wide 
during the third quarter  spot market rates remained depressed  even though petrochemical and refined products volumes into the midwest improved 
during the fourth quarter  spot market rates moved higher as petrochemical and refined products volumes improved  however  spot market rates for remained below fourth quarter levels 
marine transportation costs and expenses total costs and expenses for were lower than  primarily reflecting the reduction in revenues for compared with and corresponding lower expenses 
the year included  of amortization of goodwill  which the company ceased amortizing in under sfas no 
costs of sales and operating expenses for decreased compared with the year  primarily reflecting the decrease in marine transportation activity and corresponding lower voyage related expenses 
depending on the amount of volumes moved  the segment adjusts the number of towboats operated and crews required on a daily basis 
the segment operated towboats at december   at march   at june   at september  and at december  the increase in the number of towboats operated from september to december  reflected the fourth quarter acquisition of the coastal vessels and the management of coastal s remaining black oil barge fleet  of which are currently active 
partially offsetting the operating cost savings was the negative impact of inclement weather conditions  which decreased revenues and increased operating expenses 
ice conditions  frontal systems and high water during the first half and fourth quarter  and the tropical storm and hurricane noted above in the third and fourth quarters  required additional horsepower to complete movements  additional fuel and other variable expenses associated with longer transit times 
selling  general and administrative expenses for decreased compared with  reflecting lower incentive compensation accruals and professional fees  partially offset by annual salary increases effective january taxes  other than on income for decreased compared with the decrease reflected lower waterway use taxes  the result of decreased marine transportation volumes  and lower franchise taxes attributable to legal restructuring 
depreciation and other amortization expense for increased compared with the increase reflected new inland tank barge additions in and  the acquisition of the cargill barge fleet in march  the acquisition of the black oil barges and towboats from coastal in late october  and the acquisition of tank barges from union carbide in december in addition  the segment decreased the remaining useful lives of certain older tank barges to correspond with the anticipated retirement dates of such barges 
marine transportation operating income and operating margins operating income for was lower than the operating income included  of goodwill amortization expense 
amortization of goodwill ceased january  with the adoption of sfas no 
goodwill will be evaluated annually for impairment  or whenever events or circumstances indicate that interim impairment testing is necessary 
the operating margin for was compared with for  or when adjusted for goodwill amortization expense 
the decline in the operating margin primarily reflected lower spot market rates and relatively flat contract renewals compared with  as well as reduced volumes 
diesel engine services the company  through its diesel engine services segment  sells genuine replacement parts  provides service mechanics to overhaul and repair large medium speed diesel engines and reduction gears  and maintains facilities to rebuild component parts or entire large medium speed diesel engines or entire reduction gears 
the segment services the marine  power generation and industrial  and railroad markets 
the following table sets forth the company s diesel engine services segment s revenues  costs and expenses  operating income and operating margins for the three years ended december  dollars in thousands change change to to diesel engine services revenues costs and expenses costs of sales and operating expenses selling  general and administrative taxes  other than on income depreciation and other amortization amortization of goodwill n a operating income operating margins compared with diesel engine services revenues revenues for reflected a decrease when compared with during  two of diesel engine services primary markets  the gulf coast offshore well service market and the midwest dry cargo barge market  remained weak 
the gulf coast offshore well service market has been weak since the second half of  while the midwest dry cargo barge market has been depressed since early these markets  as well as a weak east coast marine market  negatively impacted revenues  and were only partially offset by a stronger west coast marine  as well as power generation  particularly nuclear  market 
diesel engine services costs and expenses cost of sales and operating expenses for decreased compared with  reflecting the lower service activity 
selling  general and administrative expenses were slightly higher in versus primarily due to higher incentive compensation accruals and employee medical costs  partially offset during the second half of by employee reductions in the segment s midwest market 
diesel engine services operating income and operating margins operating income for the diesel engine services segment for was lower than  and the operating margin declined to compared with for the lower operating margin was primarily attributable to an increase in parts sales and lower service revenue 
during  service revenue represented of total revenue compared with for  while parts revenue represented of total revenue compared with in historically  parts sales earn a lower operating margin than service work 
compared with diesel engine services revenues revenues for compared with were relatively flat  benefiting from strong power generation  industrial and railroad markets  thereby offsetting a weak gulf coast oil and gas services market  a market weak since the second half of the power generation market benefited from favorable service and parts sales to the nuclear industry 
sales to the railroad market benefited from the july agreement with emd to distribute replacement parts for locomotive engines used by certain us transit and class ii railroads  and improved service and parts sales to a slightly improved us steel industry 
diesel engine services costs and expenses costs and expenses for compared with were in line with revenues  remaining relatively flat 
the year included  of amortization of goodwill  which the company ceased amortizing in  in accordance with sfas no 
diesel engine services operating income and operating margins operating income for the diesel engine services segment for was higher than  primarily the result of the  of goodwill amortization recorded in the operating margin for was compared with for  or adjusted for amortization of goodwill 
the operating margin for was positively influenced by increased power generation revenues  which historically earn a higher gross profit margin  and negatively influenced by increased railroad revenues  which historically earn a lower gross profit margin 
general corporate expenses general corporate expenses for  and were   and  respectively 
the increase in compared with is primarily due to higher employee incentive compensation accruals and professional fees 
the decline in compared with reflected lower employee incentive compensation accruals and professional fees  partially offset by annual salary increases effective january other income and expenses the following table sets forth the impairment of long lived assets  gain loss on disposition of assets  equity in earnings of marine affiliates  impairment of equity investment  other expense  minority interests and interest expense for the three years ended december  dollars in thousands change change to to impairment of long lived assets  n a n a gain loss on disposition of assets equity in earnings of marine affiliates 
impairment of equity investment  n a n a other expense minority interests interest expense asset impairments during the fourth quarter of  the company recorded  of non cash pre tax impairment charges 
the after tax effect of the charges was  or 
per share 
of the total pre tax charges   was due to reduced estimated cash flows resulting from reduced lives on the company s single hull fleet and its commitment to sell certain vessels 
the reduced estimated useful lives on single hull tank barges was due to market bias against single hull tank barges and the assessment of the impact of new regulations issued in september by the uscg that require the installation of tank level monitoring devices on all single hull tank barges by october the company plans to retire all of its single hull tank barges by october  the company committed to sell inactive or out of service double hull tank barges and five inactive towboats and reduced the carrying value of these vessels by  to fair value of  the charges also included a  write down of an investment in a non consolidated affiliate to its estimated fair value and a  write down of surplus diesel shop equipment 
gain loss on disposition of assets the company reported a net loss on disposition of assets of  in compared with net gains of  in and  in the net gains and loss were predominantly from the sale of marine equipment 
equity in earnings of marine affiliates equity in earnings of marine affiliates  consisting primarily of a owned offshore marine partnership  increased to  a increase for compared with for the year  the equity in earnings declined to  compared with  for the year 
during the  and years  the four offshore dry cargo barge and tugboats units owned through the owned partnership with a public utility were generally employed under the partnership s contract to transport coal across the gulf of mexico  with a separate contract for the backhaul of limestone rock 
the significant improvement for over reflected close to full utilization of the partnership s fleet 
the lower results for primarily reflected reduced rates on the recently renewed coal transportation contract  and the timing of maintenance on three of the four units in the partnership 
the results for reflected major maintenance at the customer s docking facility which closed the facility for a portion of the third quarter  and the company s decision to conduct maintenance on two of the offshore barge and tugboat units while the facility was closed 
interest expense the increase in interest expense for compared with reflected higher average debt  offset to some degree by lower average interest rates 
the higher average debt level was attributable to the coastal acquisition in october  the union carbide acquisition in december  the seariver acquisition in january and higher capital expenditures levels  partially offset by higher cash flow from operating activities 
the reduction in interest expense for compared with was attributable to lower debt levels and lower average interest rates 
in january  the company retired the remaining  of medium term notes  refinancing the notes through the company s bank revolving credit facility

other receivables increased  primarily from expected irs federal income tax refunds for the and tax years totaling approximately  partially offset by the increased collection of diesel engine services engine core receivables 
the decrease in inventory finished goods reflected enhanced emphasis on inventory management in the diesel engine services segment 
the company also increased its allowance for doubtful accounts by  primarily related to two marine transportation customers 
property and equipment  net of accumulated depreciation  as of december  increased compared with december  the increase reflected  of capital expenditures  more fully described under capital expenditures below  the acquisition of the seariver fleet and the purchase of two tankering companies for a total of  less  of depreciation expense and property disposals of  for the year
