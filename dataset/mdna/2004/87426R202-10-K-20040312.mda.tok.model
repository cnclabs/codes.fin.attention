overview talk america holdings  inc  through its subsidiaries  offers a bundle of local and long distance phone services to residential and small business customers in the united states 
our business strategy is to build a large  profitable base of bundled phone service customers using the wholesale operating platforms of the incumbent local exchange companies and then to migrate customers to our own networking platform and further increase our revenues and profitability by offering new products and services to these customers 
we refer to this strategy as our customer first strategy 
in  we decided to expand beyond our historical long distance service offerings and utilize the unbundled network element platform to enter the large local telecommunications market and diversify our product portfolio through the bundling of local service with our core long distance service offerings 
we encountered a number of operational and business difficulties during the rollout of our bundled service offering in and worked to address the operational issues that we encountered 
we focused on improving the overall efficiency of the bundled business model in during  our top operating priorities were to lower bad debt expense  reduce customer turnover  or churn  and lower our customer acquisition costs 
during  our primary focus was increasing sales of our bundled services within the targets established by management for acquisition costs  customer turnover and bad debt expense 
we ended with  billed bundled lines 
we expect our existing base of long distance customers to continue to decline in through attrition due to our decision to focus our marketing efforts on the sale of our bundled product 
an integral element of our business strategy is our development of our own local networking capacity 
this development  if successful  will enhance our operating flexibility and provide us with an alternative to the wholesale operating platforms of the incumbent local exchange companies 
as the first step in enabling us to implement this stage of our business strategy  during  we deployed networking assets in michigan and have begun to carry test calls over our own switching platform 
we are in the process of automating the business processes required to provide local network based services and to support the proposed deployment of our own local network 
our objective is to develop a viable networking opportunity as an alternative to the whole sale operating platforms of the incumbent local exchange companies to provide us with operating flexibility 
in addition  we will add new services and enhance our existing service and product offerings  as available  to increase our revenues and profitability from our customers

the increase in revenue in from was due to the increase in bundled revenue offset by a decline in long distance revenue 
in both long distance and bundled revenue decreased 
in  we decided to shift our focus to the bundled product and no longer actively market the long distance product 
during and  we increased certain fees and rates related to our long distance and bundled products and such changes in rates may adversely impact customer turnover 
the increase in bundled revenue to million in from million in was due to higher average bundled lines in as compared to  partially offset by lower average monthly revenue per customer 
we ended with  billed bundled lines 
approximately of the bundled lines in december were in michigan 
while we have expanded our marketing efforts in additional states during  including georgia  illinois  new york  new jersey  indiana  wisconsin  ohio and maryland  continued growth in revenues will depend upon our ability to develop and scale various market ing programs in additional states or areas and to maintain or reduce the current level of customer turnover 
the decrease in bundled revenue to million in from million in was due to lower average revenue per bundled line in as compared to such decrease resulted from our strategy to market lower priced products to be more competitive with incumbent and other competitive local exchange carriers 
we ended  with  billed bundled lines compared with approximately  billed bundled lines in approximately of the bundled lines in december were in michigan 
our long distance revenue decreased in to million from million in  and from million in our decision in to invest in building a bundled customer base  together with customer turnover  contributed to the decline in long distance customers and revenue  although the effect on revenue of the decline in customers was offset partially by an increase in average monthly revenue per customer due to price increases 
we expect this decline in long distance customers and revenues to continue 
long distance revenues for and included non cash amortization of deferred revenue of million and million  respectively  related to a telecommunications service agreement entered into in deferred revenue re lating to this agreement had been amortized over a five year period 
the agreement and related amortization terminated in october network and line costs 
the increase of network and line costs in from is primarily due to the increase in bundled customers  partially offset by the decrease in long distance customers 
the lower total network and line costs as a percentage of revenue were due primarily to lower network costs as a percentage of revenue for both the bundled and long distance products 
this decrease was partially offset by a shift in our customer base to the higher cost bundled product from the lower cost long distance product 
bundled network and line costs were million for  as compared to million for and million for long distance network and line costs were million for  as compared to million for and million for as a percentage of bundled revenue  bundled and network line costs were for  as compared to for and for long distance network and line costs as a percentage of long distance revenue were for  as compared to for and for the decrease of network and line costs in from was primarily due to the decrease in long distance customers and a reduction in access and usage rates 
network and line costs for benefited from a credit of million in connection with a new york public service commission mandated refund from verizon new york of certain unbundled network element platform switching costs 
the growth in of local bundled service as a percentage of total revenue from and product mix has contributed to the increase in overall network and line cost as a percentage of revenues 
we structure and price our products in order to maintain network and line costs as a percentage of revenue at certain targeted levels 
while the control of the structure and pricing of our products assists us in mitigating risks of increases in network and line costs  the telecommunications industry is highly competitive and there can be no assurances that we will be able to effectively market these higher priced products 
there are several factors that could cause our network and line costs as a percentage of revenue to increase in the future  including without limitation determinations by the fcc  courts  or state commission s that make unbundled local switching and or combinations of unbundled network elements effectively unavailable to us in some or all of our geographic service areas  requiring us to provide services in these areas through total service resale agreements with incumbent local exchange companies  through network elements purchased from the regional bell operating companies at just and reasonable rates under section of the act or through the switching facilities of other non incumbent carriers  in any case at significantly increased costs  or to provide services over our own switching facilities  if they have been deployed 
the court of appeals  on march   issued an order that reversed the fcc s triennial review order in part and remanded to the fcc with instructions to revise the order in material ways that may make unbundled local switching and or combinations of unbundled network elements effectively unavailable to us in some or all of our geographic service areas see item regulation  above and liquidity and capital resources  other matters  below  adverse changes to the current pricing methodology mandated by the fcc for use in establishing the prices charged to us by incumbent local telephone companies for the use of their unbundled network elements 
the fcc s triennial review order  which was reversed in part and remanded to the fcc with instructions to revise the order in material ways  see item  regulation  above and liquidity and capital resources  other matters  below clarified several aspects of these pricing principles related to depreciation  fill factors ie network utilization and cost of capital  which could enable incumbent local telephone companies to increase the prices for unbundle d network elements 
in addition  the fcc released a notice of proposed rulemaking on december   which initiated a proceeding to consider making additional changes to its unbundled network element pricing methodology  including reforms that would base prices more on the actual network costs incurred by incumbent local exchange companies than on the hypothetical network costs that would be incurred when the most efficient technology is used 
these changes could result in material increases in prices charged to us for unbundled network elements  and determinations by state commissions to increase prices for unbundled network elements in ongoing state cost dockets 
changes in the pricing of our service plans could also cause network and line costs as a percentage of revenue to change in the future 
see our discussion under liquidity and capital resources  other matters  below 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased in from in  general and administrative expenses were reduced by a settlement of litigation relating to an obligation with a third party of million 
the increase was also due to an increase in the number of employees for customer service and information technology to support our expanding base of bundled customers 
as of december   we had and employees within customer service and information technology  respectively  as compared to and as of december  the decrease in general and administrative expenses in from was due primarily to significant reductions in workforce and other cost cutting efforts by us as we pursued improvements in operating efficiencies of our bundled business model and the litigation settlement 
while we expect general and administrative expense as a percentage of revenue to continue to decline as the customer base grows  realization of such efficiencies will be dependent on the ability of management to continue to control personnel costs in areas such as customer service and collections 
there can be no assurances that we will be able to realize these efficiencies 
provision for doubtful accounts 
the provision for doubtful accounts increased in from in  the provision for doubtful accounts was reduced by a reversal of the reserve for doubtful accounts of million due to better than expected collections experience on accounts receivable outstanding at year end the benefits of our actions taken during the third and fourth quarters of to reduce bad debt expense and improve the overall credit quality of our customer base were reflected in the lower bad debt expense for in general  bad debt expense as a percentage of revenue of our long distance customers is lower than that of our bundled customers because of the relatively greater maturity of the long distance customer base  however  the impact of this lower bad debt expense is decreasing as our base of long distance customers continues to decline 
sales and marketing expenses 
the increase in sales and marketing expenses in from is primarily attributable to increased levels of sales and marketing activity to continue our bundled sales growth 
the decrease in sales and marketing costs in from was primarily attributable to the reduction in marketing fees paid to aol due to the termination of the marketing relationship with aol effective september  currently  substantially all of our sales and marketing expenses relate to the bundled product 
included in sales and marketing expenses are advertising expenses of million for  million for  and mill ion for we expect sales and marketing expenses to increase in as we continue to target growth in the bundled product and invest in the development of our marketing programs 
impairment and restructuring charges 
included in impairment and restructuring charges for was an impairment charge of million primarily related to the write down of goodwill associated with the august acquisition of access one communications corp 
in september  we approved a plan to close one of our call center operations 
we incurred expenses of million during to reflect the elimination of approximately positions and lease exit costs in connection with the call center closure 
there were no impairment or restructuring charges in interest expense 
the decrease in interest expense in from is primarily due to lower outstanding debt balances 
as a result of the restructuring agreement with aol on december   we recorded interest expense associated with the secured convertible notes on our consolidated statement of operations for  partially offsetting the decrease due to lower outstanding debt 
the increase in interest expense in from was primarily due to the higher yielding debt instruments delivered in the exchange of our and convertible subordinated notes for convertible senior subordinated notes and senior subordinated notes and the restructuring of our senior credit facility 
the issuance in of the secured convertible notes was initially accounted for as a troubled debt restructuring 
as such  the aggregate interest expense for these notes was recorded as a liability at such time and the subsequent interest expense associated with these notes of million and million for and  respectively  were not reflected in the statement of operations 
depreciation and amortization 
amortization expense decreased significantly in from due to the write down in of goodwill associated with the acquisition of access one 
additionally  we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which established the impairment approach rather than amortization for goodwill  resulting in reduced amortization as a result of the elimination of goodwill amortization in other income  net 
other income for consists of gains from our repurchase of a portion of our senior subordinated notes at a discount to par 
other income in included million attributed to the restructuring and repurchase of a portion of our secured convertible notes and million attributed to the repurchase of a portion of our senior subordinated notes  partially offset by a loss of million related to the retirement of our senior credit facility 
other income for of million include a million gain on the restructuring of the aol contingent redemptions in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting by debtors and creditors for troubled debt restructurings 
in addition  we reacquired million of our convertible subordinated notes due at a million discount from the face amount 
the amount for also consisted of a million unrealized loss on the increase in fair value of the aol contingent redemptions in accordance with the fair value accounting treatment under eitf abstract no 
this amount did not recur  as the aol contingent redemptions had been restructured effective december on january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
  and  amendment of fasb statements no 
 and technical corrections as of april  issued in may  by the financial accounting standards board  which eliminates the requirement to report gains and losses from extinguishment of debt as extraordinary items 
the adoption of sfas resulted in a reclassification from extraordinary gains losses from the extinguishment of debt of million and million to other income expense for and  respectively 
provision for income taxes 
in both and  management evaluated the deferred tax asset valuation allowance and determined that a portion of the allowance should be reversed 
the evaluation considered profitability of the business  the ability to utilize the deferred tax assets in the future and possible restrictions on use due to provisions of the internal revenue code section change in ownership 
after consideration of each of these factors  we concluded certain deferred tax assets will more likely than not be utilized  and reversed deferred tax asset valuation allowances of million and million for and  respectivel y  and recognized non cash deferred income tax benefits in these amounts 
in  the tax benefit was partially offset by an income tax expense of million 
as a result of the application of net operating loss carryforwards  or nols  we currently need only pay accrued alternative minimum taxes and certain state income taxes 
as of december   we had approximately million of nols of which approximately million are estimated to be available to offset taxable income 
a valuation allowance has been recorded to reduce the carrying amounts of certain deferred tax assets for such assets that may not be realized 
we will continue to assess the valuation allowance of these deferred tax assets  and will reverse such allowance if we conclude that it is more likely than not these deferred tax assets will be utilized 
we expect that our nols will be fully utilized by cumulative effect of an accounting change 
we adopted emerging issues task force eitf abstract no 
 accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to  and potentially settled in  a company s own stock  in the quarter ended june  the cumulative effect of the adoption of this change in accounting principle resulted in a non cash charge to operations of million in the second quarter of  representing the change in fair value of contingent redemption features of warrants and common stock held by aol from issuance on january  through june  the requirements under eitf will not apply to future chang es in the value of these instruments  as the aol contingent redemptions have been restructured effective december liquidity and capital resources our management assesses our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operations  our capital expenditures and our debt service obligations 
in and  our operating activities provided net cash flow of million and million  respectively  more than half of which in each year was used by us to reduce our outstanding debt obligations and a significant portion of the balance of which was used to fund capital expenditures and capitalized software development costs 
as of december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents and long term debt of million  compared to million and million  respectively  at december  our contractual obligations as of december  are summarized by years to maturity as follows in thousands contractual obligations total year or less years years thereafter talk america holdings  inc senior subordinated notes due convertible senior subordinated notes due convertible subordinated notes due talk america inc and other subsidiaries capital lease obligations operating leases carrier commitments total contractual obligations since the end of and through february   we have purchased  or committed to purchase  a further million principal amount of these senior subordinated notes 
the amount of the convertible senior subordinated notes include million of principal and million of future accrued interest 
in december  we entered into a new four year master carrier agreement with at t 
the agreement provides us with a variety of services  including transmission facilities to connect our network switches as well as services for international calls  local traffic  international calling cards  overflow traffic and operator assisted calls 
the agreement also provides that  subject to certain terms and conditions  we will purchase these services exclusively from at t during the term of the agreement  provided  however  that we are not obligated to purchase exclusively in certain cases  including if such purchases would result in a breach of any contract with another carrier that was in place when we entered into the at t agreement  or if vendor diversity is requ ired 
certain of our network service agreements  including the at t agreement  contain certain minimum usage commitments 
our contract with at t establishes pricing and provides for annual minimum revenue commitments based upon usage as follows million  million  million and million and obligates us to pay percent of the revenue shortfall  if any 
a separate contract with a different vendor establishes pricing and provides for annual minimum payments for of million 
while we believe we will meet these annual minimum revenue commitments  and that we will not have to pay the shortfalls  here can be no assurances of this  and  if we are required to pay any of the shortfall amounts under one of these agreements  our costs of purchasing the services under the agreement will correspondingly increase 
cash provided by operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in and million in in  the major contributors to the net cash provided by operating activities were net income of million  increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses of million  primarily due to increased levels of sales and marketing activity to continue our bundled sales growth  and an increase in network and line costs primarily due to the increase in bundled customers  a decrease in other assets of million  primarily from repayment of a related party loan  an increase in deferred revenue of million for advance customer billings  primarily due to the growth in bundled customers 
partially offsetting these contributors to the net cash provided by operating activities were non cash benefits of million  primarily consisting of a net deferred tax asset of million and gain from debt extinguishments of million 
we recognized non cash deferred income tax benefits of million because of our outlook for continued profitability and our ability to more likely than not utilize the deferred tax assets 
the tax benefit was partially offset by income tax expense of million 
the application of nol carryforwards have limited our current payment of income taxes to cash taxes for alternative minimum taxes and state income taxes 
we expect that our nols will be fully utilized by  an increase in accounts receivable of million due to the continued shift in our customer base from long distance customers to local bundled customers with higher average monthly revenue per customer 
we generally do not have a significant concentration of credit risk with respect to net trade accounts receivable  due to the large number of end users comprising our customer base 
in  the major contributors to the net cash provided by operating activities were net income of million  and an increase in other liabilities of million  primarily consisting of an increase in interest payable due to higher yielding debt instruments delivered in the exchange for our and convertible subordinated notes for convertible senior subordinated notes and senior subordinated notes  and the restructuring of our senior credit facility 
partially offsetting these contributors to the net cash provided by operating activities were an increase in accounts receivable of million  primarily due to the continued shift in our customer base from long distance customers to local bundled customers with higher average monthly revenue per customer  a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses of million  primarily due to decreases in of network and line costs  sales and marketing expenses and general and administrative expenses from and due to prompter payment of vendors  and non cash items of million  primarily consisting of a gain from restructuring and redemption of convertible debt of million and the deferred income tax valuation reserve reversal of million 
on december   we restructured our secured convertible notes and  accordingly  these notes were no longer accounted for as a troubled debt restructuring 
the million gain from the restructuring and repurchase of these notes was related to the decrease in future accrued interest  which was reflected as a million reduction in long term debt 
we recognized non cash deferred income tax benefits because of our outlook for continued profitability and our ability to utilize the deferred tax assets 
net cash used in investing activities 
in  approximately of our million in capital expenditures million consisted of costs related to our deployment of networking assets local switch and colocation equipment in michigan 
also in  to support our customer growth  we opened a new customer service call center 
costs associated with our call center initiatives were approximately of total capital expenditures 
the remaining capital expenditures consisted primarily of upgrades to our information technology capabilities to support our customer growth 
in addition  during  we entered into a capital lease valued at million for upgrades to our customer data storage equipment 
in  we plan to add two more colocations and to start migrating local bundled customers over to our network  and expect to incur capital expenditures of approximately to million for both network and non network assets 
as we pursue our customer first strategy of building a large  profitable base of bundled service customers using the wholesale operating platforms of the incumbent local exchange companies and then migrate those customers to our own networking platform and offer new products and services to these customers  our capital expenditures are expected to increase significant ly 
capitalized software development costs consist of direct development costs associated with internal use computer software including external direct costs of material and services and payroll costs for employees devoting time to the software projects 
in  capitalized software development costs totaled million and were primarily related to the development of customer relations management software 
in  we expect software development costs to increase moderately as we continue to develop the integrated information systems required to provide local switch based service 
net cash used in investing activities was million during  consisting of capitalized software development costs of million and capital expenditures primarily for the purchase of equipment of million 
net cash used in financing activities 
net cash used in financing activities for and was primarily attributable to debt repayment and purchases of and million  respectively 
for  million of interest was recorded as additional principal on the senior subordinated notes and secured convertible notes for payment of interest in kind rather than in cash 
since december  and through february   we have purchased million principal amount of our senior subordinated notes at par and committed to redeem an additional million principal amount in april in addition  in  pursuant to our share buyback program announced in january  we purchased  shares for a purchase price of million 
under the buyback program  we are authorized to spend up to million for share purchases  with a cap of million shares 
in  we will continue to evaluate opportunities to purchase our debt prior to maturity  as well as to consider acquiring shares under the balance of our share buyback program 
the remaining shares authorized under the program may be purchased  from time to time  in the open market and or in private transactions 
note obligations secured convertible notes in september  we restructured our financial obligations with america online  inc that arose under our investment agreement and  effective september   also ended our marketing relationship with aol 
in connection with the restructuring  we entered into a restructuring and note agreement with aol  pursuant to which we had outstanding as of december   million principal amount of our secured convertible notes 
on december   we restructured these secured convertible notes to provide for a new maturity date of september   the elimination of a pay in kind interest option and additional flexibility to purchase subordinated debt and common stock through september  during  we purchased all of these secured convertible notes 
in add ition  we concurrently purchased from aol the  shares of our common stock held by aol for an aggregate price of million 
convertible subordinated notes and exchange offers effective april   we completed the exchange of million of the million outstanding principal balance of our convertible subordinated notes that matured on september  for million principal amount of new senior subordinated pik notes due august and million principal amount of new convertible senior subordinated notes due august and cash paid of million 
in addition  we exchanged million of the million outstanding principal balance of our convertible subordinated notes that mature on december  for million principal amount of the new senior subordinated notes 
in and  we acquired million and million principal amount of our senior subordinated notes  respectively  at respectiv e discounts from face amount of million and million  which discounts are reported as other income in our consolidated statement of operations 
we paid at maturity the remaining million principal balance of our outstanding convertible subordinated notes due september since december  and through february   we have purchased an additional million principal amount of our senior subordinated notes at face amount and have committed to redeem an additional million principal amount in april other matters our provision of telecommunication services is subject to government regulation 
see item  regulation  above 
changes in existing regulations could have a material adverse effect on us 
our local telecommunication services are provided almost exclusively through the use of unbundled network elements purchased from incumbent local telephone companies  and it is primarily the availability of cost based unbundled network element rates that enables us to price our local telecommunications services competitively 
the fcc currently requires incumbent local telephone companies to provide an unbundled network element platform  that includes all of the network elements required by a competitor to provide a retail telecommunications service  in most geographic areas 
through the use of such un bundled network element platforms we are able to provide retail local services entirely through the use of the incumbent local telephone company s facilities at lower prices than those available for local resale through total resale service agreements 
in its une triennial review proceeding  the fcc sought to identify  among other issues  which if any network elements the incumbent local telephone companies should no longer be required to offer on an unbundled basis 
the fcc also analyzed the issue of which elements must be unbundled in response to a remand of its previous rules by the us court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit 
in the fcc s une triennial review order  released august  and effective as of october   the commission determined that certain network elements will no longer be subject to unbundling  while other elements must continue to be offered subject to further  more detailed review by the state public utility commissions 
the order was subject to nume rous federal judicial appeals  which were consolidated in the us court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit 
the court  on march   issued an order that reversed the fcc s order in part and remanded to the fcc with instructions to revise the order in material ways 
the court stayed its decision until the denial of any petitions for rehearing or for a day period ie  until may   whichever is later 
should the local circuit switching unbundled network element become effectively unavailable due to this adverse decision or otherwise  we would be unable to offer services on an unbundled network element platform basis and would instead have to serve customers through total service resale agreements with the incumbent local exchange companies  through network elements purchased from the regional bell operating companies at just and reasonable rates under section of the act or through our own facilities or the switching facilities of other non incumbent carriers 
our transition from providing telecommunications services on an unbundled network element platform basis could delay our service roll out in some markets  increase our costs  and negat ively impact our business  prospects  operating margins  results of operations  cash flows and financial condition 
see item  regulation 
we are party to a number of legal actions and proceedings arising from our provision and marketing of telecommunications services  as well as certain legal actions and regulatory matters arising in the ordinary course of business 
during the second quarter  we were made aware that aol agreed to settle a class action case for approximately million  the claims in the case allegedly relate to marketing activities conducted pursuant to a former telecommunications marketing agreement  between us and aol 
at the time of the settlement agreement  aol asserted that we are required to indemnify aol in this matter under the terms of the marketing agreement and advised that it will seek such indemnification from us 
we believe that we do not have an obligation to indemnify aol in this matter and that any claim by aol for this indemnification would be without merit 
we have received no further information regarding this matter and it is our intention  if aol initiates a claim for indemnification under the marketing agreement  to defend against the claim vigorously 
we believe that the ultimate outcome of the foregoing actions will not result in liability that would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
while we believe that we have access to new capital in the public or private markets to fund our ongoing cash requirements  there can be no assurance as to the timing  amounts  terms or conditions of any such new capital or whether it could be obtained on terms acceptable to us 
we anticipate that our cash requirements will generally be met from our cash on hand and from cash generated from operations 
based on our current projections for operations  we believe that our cash on hand and our cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund our currently contemplated capital expenditures  our debt service obligations  and the expenses of conducting our operations for at least the next twelve months 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be able to realize our projected cash flows f rom operations  which is subject to the risks and uncertainties discussed above  or that we will not be required to consider capital expenditures in excess of those currently contemplated  as discussed above 
our business involves risks and uncertainties and our actual results could differ materially from our expectations 
in addition to those factors discussed elsewhere in this form k  important factors that could impact our business include  among others changes in government policy  regulation and enforcement and or adverse judicial or administrative interpretations and rulings relating to regulations and enforcement  including  but not limited to  those that affect the continued availability to us  on acceptable economic terms  of the unbundled network element platform of the local exchange carriers network  on which our business  as now conducted  is substantially dependent  our ability successfully to implement our business strategy  including the development and deployment of our own local services networking platform and the migration of our customer base to the new platform  and our ability to finance the costs of such implementation  the success of such business strategy if and when implemented  increased price competition for long distance and local services  our ability to continue to manage the nonpayment of amounts due us from our customers from bundled and long distance services  attrition in the number of our customers  our ability to continue to manage our operations  including attracting and retaining qualified personnel  our ability to continue to expand our active offering of local bundled services to a greater number of states  our ability to continue to manage our collection management systems and credit controls for customers  interruptions in our network and information systems  and our ability to continue to provide adequate customer service 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to bad debt  goodwill and intangible assets  income taxes  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
allowance for doubtful accounts allowances for doubtful accounts are maintained for estimated losses resulting from the failure of customers to make required payments on their accounts 
we review accounts receivable aging trends  historical bad debt trends  and customer credit worthiness through customer credit scores  current economic trends and changes in customer payment history when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
in addition  we review the financial condition of the carriers that pay us access charges to assess their ability to make payments 
valuation of long lived assets and intangible assets with a definite life we review the recoverability of the carrying value of long lived assets  including intangibles with a definite life  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
when such events occur  we compare the carrying amount of the assets to the undiscounted expected future cash flows from them 
factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business significant negative industry or economic trends significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period and market capitalization relative to net book value if this comparison indicates there is impairment  the amount of the impairment loss to be recorded is calculated by the excess of the net assets carrying value over its fair value and is typically calculated using discounted expected future cash flows 
goodwill goodwill represents the cost in excess of net assets of acquired companies 
effective january   with the adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill comprised of goodwill acquired in the access one acquisition in august will not be amortized  but rather will be tested for impairment annually  and will be tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount may be impaired 
prior to january   goodwill and intangibles were amortized on a straight line basis over periods ranging from years to years 
impairment testing for goodwill is performed at a reporting unit level  we determined that we have one reporting unit under the guidance of sfas no 
an impairment loss would generally be recognized when the carrying amount of the reporting unit s net assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit 
prior to january   goodwill was tested for impairment in a manner consistent with long lived assets and intangible assets with a definite life 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
during  we recorded income taxes at a rate equal to our combined federal and state effective rates 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards
