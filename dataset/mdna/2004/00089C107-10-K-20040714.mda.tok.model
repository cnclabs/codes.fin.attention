item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the description of business  financial statements and the related notes of ade which appear elsewhere in this annual report 
the following discussion contains forward looking statements that reflect ade s plans  estimates and beliefs 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed below and in the forward looking statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report 
overview ade was incorporated in to develop and market certain advanced concepts and designs in capacitance and other measurement technologies suitable for industrial applications requiring precise  reliable  damage free and repeatable measurements 
our products have evolved from single instruments used in off line engineering analysis to multi function systems for automated in line monitoring of process induced defects throughout the semiconductor wafer  device and magnetic data storage manufacturing processes 
we operate three major business segments  the semiconductor systems group ssg  ade phase shift pst and ade technologies ati 
the semiconductor systems group manufactures multifunctional semiconductor metrology and automation systems and optical wafer defect inspection equipment used to detect particles and other defects on silicon wafer surfaces 
ade phase shift manufactures high performance  non contact surface metrology equipment using advanced interferometric technology that provides enhanced yield management to the data storage  semiconductor and optics industries 
ade technologies manufactures high precision magnetic characterization and non contact dimensional metrology gauging systems primarily for the magnetic data storage and semiconductor manufacturing industries 
the company s markets are cyclical 
beginning in fiscal year  the company experienced decreased demand for its products in all business segments as a result of the downturn in the semiconductor wafer and device manufacturing industries as well as the data storage industry 
consequently  the company experienced reduced order levels and revenues during fiscal year and early fiscal in response to the industry downturn  the company underwent cost reduction measures  including headcount reductions  and focused its research and development activities on projects to put the company in the best possible position for the next wave of capital spending in the semiconductor wafer and device manufacturing industries as well as the magnetic data storage industry 
beginning in fiscal year and continuing through fiscal year  the company has experienced steady increases in quarterly orders  revenue and backlog 
as a result  the company has achieved profitability  on a quarterly basis  since the third quarter of fiscal year these results were due in part to increased order activity from asia during fiscal year and as well as the aforementioned cost reduction measures 
however  the company makes no assurances that the order  revenue  backlog and profit levels can be sustained in future periods 
restructurings during the first quarter of fiscal  as a result of continued cost cutting initiatives  the company recorded a restructuring charge of  which consisted primarily of severance expenses for terminated employees 
the employees were terminated from various functional areas within the company s semiconductor systems and ade technologies business segments 
the majority of all the severance payments from the first quarter restructuring were made by the end of fiscal year in connection with the first quarter restructuring  the company did not renew its lease at its bethel  connecticut facility  which expired in august prior to the end of the first quarter  the operations of the bethel facility were relocated to the westwood  massachusetts and tucson  arizona facilities 
during the first quarter of fiscal  the company implemented selective headcount reductions and closed three satellite offices in response to the prolonged downturn in the semiconductor wafer and device manufacturing and magnetic data storage industries 
the company recorded a restructuring charge of  which consisted of  in employee severance expenses for the terminated employees spread across all functional areas of the company and  related to the closing of the satellite offices  which primarily represents future lease obligations on the vacated offices 
when applicable  anticipated future sublease income relating to vacated offices was offset against the charge for the remaining lease payments 
during the second quarter of fiscal  as a result of the continued downturn in the semiconductor wafer and device manufacturing and magnetic data storage industries  the company recorded a restructuring charge of  which consisted primarily of severance expenses for the terminated employees across all segments and various functional areas of the company 
on august   an agreement was entered into between the company and its former chief executive officer  robert c 
abbe 
under the terms of the agreement  ade agreed to pay a total of million over a three year period  beginning in september  for severance and consulting services 
the company recorded a restructuring charge of  for the severance portion of mr 
abbe s agreement  which was paid through september this amount is included in the  discussed above 
the consulting portion of the agreement was expensed as incurred 
below is a table summarizing the activity related to the restructuring accrual for the years ended april  and severance office closures total in thousands restructuring accrual cash payments balance at april  restructuring accrual cash payments balance at april  sale of long term investment on july   the company entered into an agreement to sell the majority of its ownership in jal to kanematsu electronics  ltd  the other owner of jal 
the company received proceeds of million and realized a gain of million from this transaction 
the company retained a ownership interest in jal 
prior to the transaction  the company accounted for its investment in jal under the equity method 
as a result of the decrease in both ownership and influence over the affairs of jal  the company accounts for its remaining interest under the cost method 
the million gain on the transaction was calculated as follows ade shares held prior to sale kel shares held prior to sale total ownership shares shares sold by ade shares retained by ade in thousands book value of ade investment at less dividend received add income from affiliate april june book value of ade investment before sale book value per share before sale book value of shares sold proceeds from sale gain on sale of ownership prior to july   when the company was accounting for its investment in jal under the equity method  the revenue from sales to jal  which had not in turn been sold by jal to unrelated third parties  was eliminated and the related profit on such sales was recorded as deferred income on sales to affiliate 
as a result of the reduction of the company s investment in jal to and the change in accounting method for the remaining investment to the cost method  the company recognized approximately million of system and parts revenue in its statement of operations that otherwise may have been deferred revenue on the balance sheet as of july  cost of revenue  systems and parts in the statement of operations increased by million during the quarter ended july  as a result of the sale of part of the company s jal investment 
therefore  gross profit in the statement of operations increased by million during the same period 
sale leaseback on july   the company entered into an agreement to sell and leaseback its headquarters site in westwood  massachusetts  which resulted in a deferred gain of million 
the company used million of the approximately million in proceeds  less transaction costs  from the transaction to retire its industrial development bond the bond and terminated the related letter of credit 
on july   the company used approximately million of the proceeds to retire its industrial development bond the bond  which resulted in million of restricted cash becoming available for general corporate purposes 
as part of this transaction  the company entered into a lease agreement with a year term and annual rent payments increasing from approximately million at the beginning of the lease term to approximately million by the end of the lease term 
the lease has been classified as an operating lease and the gain of million on the transaction has been deferred and is being amortized as a reduction of rent expense on a straight line basis over the term of the lease 
the total rent expense from the lease is being amortized on a straight line basis 
in addition  as required by the lease agreement  million of cash has been restricted as a security deposit on the building 
critical accounting policies  significant judgments and estimates the discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures at the date of and for the periods reflected in the company s financial statements 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to bad debts  inventories  intangible assets  income taxes  and warranty obligations 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company considers certain accounting policies related to revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory valuation  accounting for income taxes  valuation of goodwill and software and the accounting for leases to be critical policies due to the estimates and judgments involved in each 
revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts the company s revenue recognition policy complies with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition in financial statements 
the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
the company s standard customer arrangement includes a signed purchase order  in which it offers payment terms of to days  no right of return of delivered products and a twelve month warranty 
the company assesses whether the fee associated with its revenue transactions is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction 
if a significant portion of the fee is due after the company s normal payment terms  to days  it determines that the fee is not fixed or determinable 
in these cases  the company recognizes revenue as the fees become due 
the company assesses collectibility based on the credit worthiness of the customer and past transaction history 
the company performs on going credit evaluations of its customers and does not require collateral from its customers 
for many of the company s international customers  it requires that an irrevocable letter of credit be issued by the customer before the purchase order is accepted 
if the company determines that collection of a fee is not reasonably assured  it defers the fee and recognizes the revenue at the time that collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon the receipt of cash 
for some of the company s sales transactions  a portion  usually  of the fee is not due until installation occurs and the customer accepts the product 
the other of the fee is normally due to days after shipment 
if the company has met defined customer acceptance experience levels with a specific type of product  these transactions are accounted for as multiple element arrangements with the deferral of the portion of the fee not due until installation is complete and customer acceptance has occurred 
management of the company must make a determination of what constitutes an appropriate experience level with a product 
this determination is based on  but not limited to  the extent to which a product contains significantly new technology  the number of similarly configured products previously delivered and the company s experience with a particular customer 
for new products  the company must obtain at least three acceptances before it will recognize the portion of the fee upon shipment 
all other sales with customer acceptance provisions are recognized as revenue upon customer acceptance 
the portion of the fee related to the installation of the product and customer training is classified as service revenue 
the company s transactions frequently involve the sales of systems and services under multiple element arrangements 
revenue under multiple element arrangements is allocated to all elements except systems based upon the fair value of those elements 
the amounts allocated to training are based upon the price charged when this element is sold separately and unaccompanied by the other elements 
the amount allocated to installation revenue is based upon hourly rates and the estimated time to complete the service 
the amount allocated to system and parts is done on a residual method basis 
under this method  the total arrangement value is allocated first to undelivered elements  based on their fair values  with the remainder being allocated to system revenue 
the company accrues for anticipated warranty costs upon shipment 
service revenue is recognized as the services are performed provided collection of the related receivable is probable 
service contract revenue is recognized ratably over the contractual periods in which the services are provided 
revenue from software licenses is recognized when an agreement has been executed  software has been delivered  fees are fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is probable 
revenue from systems sales to jal  the company s previously owned affiliate and a distributor of the company s products  by the ssg  ati and pst segments was reflected in segment revenue during the period they were shipped by the respective segment  which could differ from the period the revenue was recognized for consolidated financial reporting purposes 
consolidated revenue on systems sales to jal was recognized when the related product or software was shipped to and accepted by the end user of the product or software 
as a result of the company s decreased investment in jal  beginning july   all sales to jal are reflected in both segment and consolidated revenue in the same period 
the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts based on a continuous review of customer accounts  payment patterns and specific collection issues 
where specific collection issues are identified  the company records a specific allowance based on the amount that the company believes will be collected 
for accounts where specific collection issues are not identified  the company will record a reserve based on the age of the receivable and historical collection patterns 
inventory valuation inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market  cost being determined on a first in  first out basis 
management evaluates the need to record adjustments for impairment of inventory on a monthly basis 
the company s policy is to assess the valuation of all inventories  including raw materials  work in process  finished goods and spare parts 
inventory that  in the judgment of management  is obsolete or in excess of the company s estimated usage is written down to its estimated market value  if less than its cost 
inherent in the estimates of market value are management s estimates related to current economic trends  future demand for the company s products  and technological obsolescence 
significant management judgments must be made when establishing the reserve for obsolete and excess inventory 
if the company s judgments and estimates relating to obsolete and excess inventory prove to be inadequate  its financial results could be materially adversely affected in future periods 
if the inventory value is written down to its net realizable value  and subsequently there is an increased demand for the inventory at a higher value  the increased value of the inventory is not realized until the inventory is sold 
accounting for income taxes the company records income taxes using the asset and liability method 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective income tax bases  and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
the company s financial statements contain certain deferred tax assets  which have arisen primarily as a result of operating losses incurred in prior years  as well as other temporary differences between book and tax accounting 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes  requires the establishment of a valuation allowance to reflect the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax assets 
significant management judgment is required in determining the company s provision for income taxes  its deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against its net deferred tax assets 
the company evaluates the weight of all available evidence to determine whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized 
as of april   the company has a valuation allowance against the full amount of its deferred tax assets 
the company recorded a full valuation allowance during fiscal as described in note the decision to record the valuation allowance required significant judgment 
had the company not recorded this allowance  it would have reported materially different results 
if the realization of deferred tax assets in the future is considered more likely than not  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase net income in the period such determination was made 
the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable is based on significant estimates  and it is at least reasonably possible that changes in these estimates in the near term could materially affect the company s financial condition and results of operations 
if the company continues to generate profits in fiscal  it is possible that all  or a portion  of the valuation allowance will be released in fiscal the company s effective tax rate may vary from period to period based on changes in estimated taxable income or loss  changes to the valuation allowance  changes to federal  state or foreign tax laws  and deductibility of certain costs and expenses by jurisdiction 
valuation of goodwill and software intangible assets consist of million of goodwill obtained through the acquisition of the semiconductor solutions division of lpa software  inc ssd in september as well as million of capitalized license fees  net of amortization  for software included in the company s products 
in july  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  which was effective for the company on may  sfas requires  among other things  the discontinuance of goodwill amortization and includes provisions for the reclassification of certain existing recognized intangibles as goodwill  reassessment of the useful lives of existing recognized intangibles  and reclassification of certain intangibles out of previously reported goodwill 
in accordance with this statement  the company discontinued the amortization of its net goodwill of million on may  in addition  the company was required to perform a transitional impairment test for goodwill under sfas the impairment test under sfas uses a two step process 
the first step compares the fair value of the reporting unit with the unit s carrying value  including goodwill 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit is greater than fair value  the unit s goodwill may be impaired  and the second step must be completed to measure the amount of the goodwill impairment charge  if any 
in the second step  the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill is compared with the carrying amount of the unit s goodwill 
if the carrying amount is greater than the implied fair value  the carrying value of the goodwill must be written down to its implied fair value 
the company is required to perform impairment tests under sfas annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances suggest that the goodwill may be impaired 
factors the company considers important that could trigger the impairment review include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results significant negative industry or economic trends significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate significant decline in the company s stock price for a sustained period significant decline in the company s technological value as compared to the market the company s market capitalization relative to net book value unanticipated competition 
during the fourth quarter in each of the fiscal years ended april  and  the company performed its annual impairment test in accordance with sfas and determined that the carrying value of its goodwill was not impaired 
net capitalized license fees of million for software included in the company s products are amortized at the greater of the ratio that current gross revenue for the related products bears to the total current and anticipated future gross revenue for those products or on a straight line basis over its estimated useful life 
at each quarter end  the carrying value of the software is compared to net realizable value nrv 
nrv is the estimated future gross revenues from products that incorporate the software reduced by the estimated future costs of disposal 
if nrv is less than the carrying value  the excess is written off and nrv becomes the new carrying value of the software 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made when establishing criteria for future cash flows  estimating reporting unit fair value and assessing impairment 
if the company s judgments and estimates relating to goodwill and software prove to be inadequate  an asset may be determined to be impaired and the company s financial results could be materially adversely impacted 
likewise  if a future event or circumstance indicates that an impairment assessment is required and  through the performance of that assessment  an asset is determined to be impaired  the company s financial results could be materially and adversely impacted in future periods 
accounting for leases on july   the company entered into a lease agreement for its corporate headquarters in westwood  massachusetts 
the classification of this lease as an operating lease involved a significant judgement by the company s management with respect to the company s incremental borrowing rate 
at the date of lease inception  the incremental borrowing rate is a significant element of the calculation in one of the four tests that must be performed to determine if a lease should be classified as an operating lease or a capital lease 
the company s management determined the company s incremental borrowing rate based on an analysis of its negotiations with various financial institutions  the implicit interest rate in the lease for the westwood  massachusetts building and an estimate of the current yield on debt financing of comparable companies in the public securities markets 
because the criteria necessary for classification as a capital lease were not met  the lease was accounted for as an operating lease and the leased building and related liability have not been recorded in the company s consolidated balance sheet 
if the company s incremental borrowing rate was determined to be lower than what was determined by the company s management  the lease could have met the criteria for classification as a capital lease  which would have resulted in an asset of approximately million and a liability of approximately million being recorded in the company s consolidated balance sheet 
off balance sheet arrangements the company has not created  and is not party to  any special purpose or off balance sheet entities for the purpose of raising capital  incurring debt or operating parts of its business that are not consolidated into its financial statements 
the company does not have any arrangements or relationships with entities that are not consolidated into its financial statements that are reasonably likely to materially affect its liquidity or the availability of capital resources  except as set forth below under liquidity and capital resources 
results of operations the following table presents the percentage of total revenue for the respective line items in ade s consolidated statements of operations 
year ended april  revenue cost of revenue gross profit operating expenses research and development marketing and sales general and administrative restructuring charges income loss from operations gain on sale of long term investment gain on sale of marketable securities interest and other income expense  net equity in net earnings of affiliated companies provision for income taxes net income loss fiscal year ended april  compared to fiscal year ended april  systems and parts revenue 
systems and parts revenue increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal revenue in the ssg segment increased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increase in revenues from the company s products in the ssg segment was due to increased demand for the company s products  particularly in japan and asia  as semiconductor wafer manufacturers have increased capacity in their production of both mm and mm wafers 
revenue in the pst segment increased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increase in revenue from the pst segment was due primarily to industry acceptance of and the resulting increase in demand for its semiconductor industry products 
the magnetic data storage industry has experienced extreme pricing pressure over the years  consolidation and excess supply in many data storage market segments  which has resulted in reduced production and capital equipment purchases 
more recently  the magnetic data storage industry has shown increased interest in the company s magnetic data storage industry products 
consequently  revenue from the products that are marketed to the data storage industry by the company s ati segment increased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal as a result of the company s sale of the majority of its ownership in jal on july   the company recorded revenue systems and parts revenue in its statement of operations during the first quarter ended july  of approximately million that may otherwise have been deferred revenue on the balance sheet as of july  cost of revenue  systems and parts in the statement of operations increased by million as a result of the jal sale 
therefore  gross profit in the statement of operations increased by million during the first quarter of fiscal due to the margin from systems and parts sales recognized as a result of the sale of part of the company s jal investment 
prior to the transaction  the company accounted for its investment in jal under the equity method 
as a result of the decrease in both ownership and influence over the affairs of jal  the company will account for its remaining interest under the cost method 
because jal was an equity method investee prior to the sale on july   revenue from sales to jal  which had not in turn been sold by jal to unrelated third parties  was eliminated and the related profit on such sales was recorded to deferred income on sales to affiliate 
the change from the equity method to the cost method of accounting for the jal investment resulted in the recognition of all deferred revenue and profit from sales to jal as of the date of the sale of the majority of ade s interest in jal 
a breakdown of the company s total revenues by industry is as follows year ended april  wafer device oem magnetic data storage total the company s total revenues by region are distributed as follows year ended april  united states japan asia europe total for the first quarter of fiscal  the company expects consolidated revenue to increase by a range of from fourth quarter revenue 
however  the company can make no assurances that the expected increase in revenue will occur or  if it does  that it can be sustained for the remainder of fiscal service revenue 
service revenue increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the company s service revenue consists of fees for installation  training  product maintenance and technical support services 
the majority of the company s service revenue is derived from the ssg segment 
the increase is primarily due to service calls to customers bringing equipment back on line to increase capacity 
gross profit systems and parts 
gross profit increased to in fiscal from in fiscal the increase in gross profit was due to increased gross profit in the ssg segment as a result of increased volume combined with factory overhead cost reductions undertaken over the past fiscal year 
also contributing to the increase in gross profit was an increase in the gross profit of the ati segment due to increased volume as described in the discussion of system and parts revenue combined with cost reduction measures taken over the past fiscal year 
the increase in gross profit was slightly offset by a slight decrease in the gross profit of the pst segment as a result of increased overhead expenses necessary to meet increased production levels 
gross profit service 
gross profit decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal the decreased gross profit was the result of increased payroll expenses in the company s service organization as well as increased material costs during fiscal research and development 
research and development expense in fiscal decreased to million from million in fiscal and decreased as a percentage of revenue to in fiscal from in fiscal the decrease in expense resulted primarily from a decrease in payroll of million and a decrease in consulting expense of million as previous cost reduction measures taken by the company take effect 
the decrease in payroll and consulting expenses was partially offset by an increase of million of project material expenses 
the company continues to invest in its semiconductor wafer and device industry products as well as new products for the magnetic storage industry  including those that measure the magnetic properties of materials used in manufacturing disk drives 
the decrease in expense as a percentage of revenues reflects the cost reduction measures mentioned above as well as the increase in revenues 
the company expects research and development expense over the short term to be at or near current levels on a dollar basis in order to capitalize on the next wave of worldwide capital spending  which is focused on mm wafer production 
marketing and sales 
marketing and sales expense decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  and decreased as a percentage of revenue to in fiscal and from in fiscal the decreased expense resulted from a decrease in commissions expense of million on sales made through internal and external sales representatives 
also contributing to the decrease in expense was decreased payroll expense of million and decreased travel expenses of million in all segments of the company 
the mix of sales channels through which the company s products are sold may have a significant impact on the company s marketing and sales expense and the results in any period may not be indicative of marketing and sales expense for future periods 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and decreased as a percentage of revenue to in fiscal from in fiscal expense increased primarily as a result of an increased payroll related expenses of million and an increase in legal expenses of million associated with the patent infringement lawsuit with kla  which went to trial at the end of january interest and other income 
interest and other income was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increase in interest and other income was due primarily to an increase in other income from bad debt recoveries during fiscal interest expense 
interest expense was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the decrease in interest expense was primarily due to the company s retirement of its and industrial development bonds in the first quarter of fiscal  which resulted in a decrease of interest expense for fiscal of million compared to fiscal provision for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes was  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal the provision for income taxes in fiscal consists of federal and state alternative minimum taxes and foreign income taxes  which were mostly offset by a federal income tax refund of  for the years through as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company has a full valuation allowance on its deferred tax assets at april  significant management judgment is required in determining the company s provision for income taxes  its deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against its net deferred tax assets 
the company evaluates the weight of all available evidence to determine whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized 
if the realization of deferred tax assets in the future is considered more likely than not  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase net income in the period such determination was made 
the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable is based on significant estimates  and it is at least reasonably possible that changes in these estimates in the near term could materially affect the company s financial condition and results of operations 
if the company continues to generate profits in fiscal  it is possible that all  or a portion  of the valuation allowance will be released in fiscal fiscal year ended april  compared to fiscal year ended april  systems and parts revenue 
systems and parts revenue decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal revenue in the ssg segment decreased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal decreased sales of the company s products in the ssg segment reflected a decrease in demand for capital equipment in the semiconductor wafer and device industries as a result of the current severe down cycle 
revenue in the pst segment increased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increase in revenue from the pst segment was due primarily to industry acceptance and demand for its semiconductor industry products 
wafer manufacturers capital equipment purchases have been focused on advanced industry requirements rather than on capacity expansion  which has resulted in technology purchases of the company s next generation of products 
however  wafer manufacturers have been slowly adding capacity and the company has experienced an increase in shipments of legacy products as a result of these capacity related purchases 
the company sells its semiconductor products to both wafer and device manufacturers 
historically  the company s semiconductor revenue has been derived more from wafer manufacturers than device manufacturers 
an increase in short term chip demand or increases in semiconductor market capital expenditures is expected to impact device manufacturers prior to wafer manufacturers as wafer manufacturers are further down on the overall semiconductor industry supply chain 
the data storage industry has experienced extreme pricing pressure  consolidation and excess supply in many data storage market segments  which has resulted in reduced production and capital equipment purchases 
consequently  revenue from the products that are marketed to the data storage industry by the company s ati segment decreased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the decrease in revenue is due primarily to decreased shipments of the company s magnetic storage products during fiscal a breakdown of the company s total revenues by industry is as follows year ended april  wafer device oem magnetic data storage total the company s total revenues by region are distributed as follows year ended april  united states japan asia europe total service revenue 
service revenue was million in both fiscal and fiscal the company s service revenue consists of fees for installation  training  product maintenance and technical support services 
the majority of the company s service revenue is derived from the ssg segment 
gross profit systems and parts 
gross profit increased to in fiscal from in fiscal the increase in gross profit was due to increased gross profit in the ssg segment as a result of factory overhead cost reductions undertaken over the past fiscal year 
also contributing to the increase in gross profit was an increase in the gross profit of the pst segment due to increased volume and product mix as described in the discussion of system and parts revenue 
gross profit service 
gross profit improved to in fiscal from in fiscal the improved gross profit was due to overhead cost reductions undertaken over the past fiscal year 
research and development 
research and development expense in fiscal decreased to million from million in fiscal and decreased as a percentage of revenue to from 
the decrease in expense resulted primarily from a decrease in payroll  consulting and project material expenses in all segments  which were part of the overall cost reduction measures taken by the company over the past fiscal year 
the company continues to invest in its semiconductor wafer and device industry products as well as new products for the magnetic storage industry  including those that measure the magnetic properties of materials used in manufacturing disk drives 
the decrease in expense as a percentage of revenues reflects the cost reduction measures mentioned above 
the company expects research and development expense over the short term to be at or near current levels as a percentage of revenues in order to capitalize on the next wave of worldwide capital spending  which is expected to be focused on mm wafer production 
marketing and sales 
marketing and sales expense decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  and remained consistent as a percentage of revenue at in both fiscal and fiscal the decreased expense resulted from a decrease in commissions expense on sales made through internal and external sales representatives due to the decrease in sales during fiscal also contributing to the decrease in expense was decreased payroll expense and discretionary spending including travel and advertising in all segments of the company 
the mix of sales channels through which the company s products are sold may have a significant impact on the company s marketing and sales expense and the results in any period may not be indicative of marketing and sales expense for future periods 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and decreased as a percentage of revenue to in fiscal from in fiscal expense decreased primarily due to decreased payroll and benefits related expenses as a result of cost cutting measures taken over the past year 
this decrease in payroll related expenses was slightly offset by an increase in legal and patent expense of million primarily as a result of the ongoing litigation with kla 
also included in fiscal expenses was an impairment charge of million related to the company s newton  massachusetts property  which has been classified as held for sale in the company s consolidated balance sheet 
the impairment charge was based on the company s best estimate of the current value of the property less selling costs 
it is possible that the company could record further impairment on this property if market conditions in the real estate market were to deteriorate 
interest and other income 
interest and other income was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the decrease in interest and other income was due primarily to a decrease in invested cash balances as well as a decrease in interest rates during fiscal compared to fiscal interest expense 
interest expense was million in both fiscal and fiscal the company s interest expense is primarily associated with the industrial development bonds used to finance the acquisition and renovation of our corporate headquarters and ssg manufacturing facility in westwood  massachusetts  the headquarters and manufacturing facility of ati in newton  massachusetts and the construction of the pst headquarters and manufacturing facility in tucson  arizona 
the interest rates on these bonds are fixed 
provision for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the provision for income taxes in fiscal consists of state and foreign income taxes 
the decrease in income taxes in fiscal compared to fiscal was due to an increase of million in the valuation allowance against the company s deferred tax assets during fiscal the company has deferred tax assets  which have arisen primarily as a result of operating losses incurred in prior years  as well as other temporary differences between book and tax accounting 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes  requires the establishment of a valuation allowance to reflect the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax assets 
during the second quarter of fiscal  as a result of that year s operating losses to date  anticipated additional operating losses for the third quarter of  an expected operating loss for fiscal year  and uncertainty as to the extent and timing of profitability in future periods  the company recorded an additional valuation allowance to reserve the remaining deferred tax assets  resulting in income tax expense of million 
the company has a full valuation allowance for the full amount of its net deferred taxes 
as of april   the company has available unused operating loss carryforwards  which may be applied against future taxable income 
net operating loss carryforwards generated in fiscal and begin to expire in fiscal for state purposes and for federal purposes 
the fiscal provision for income taxes was partially offset by a  refund due to certain tax law changes 
selected consolidated quarterly operating results the following table presents consolidated statement of operations data for each of the eight quarters in the period beginning may  and ending april  this information has been derived from ade s unaudited consolidated financial statements 
the unaudited financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as the audited financial statements and include all normal recurring adjustments considered necessary to present fairly this information when read in conjunction with ade s annual audited financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this annual report 
our quarterly revenue typically is derived from a relatively small number of customer orders 
these customer orders may consist of multiple systems  each of which is priced between approximately  and  as a result  the timing of significant orders or a reduction in the number of systems shipped in a quarter could have a material effect on our revenue and results of operations for that quarter 
the results for a particular quarter may also vary due to a number of other factors  including economic conditions in the semiconductor and magnetic data storage industries product mix of our sales for the period the sales distribution channel of our sales for the period competitive pricing pressures our ability to design  introduce and manufacture new products on a cost effective and timely basis customer cancellations or rescheduled shipments production difficulties or the inability to obtain critical components resulting in delayed shipments seasonal factors such as customers capital budget approval cycles
