item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this report on form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements 
please see the cautionary statement above and factors affecting our future operating results under item for a discussion of the uncertainties  risks and assumptions associated with these statements 
our fiscal year end financial reporting periods are a or week year ending on the saturday closest to december st 
fiscal had weeks with the extra week occurring in the fourth quarter of the year and ended on january  fiscal had weeks and ended on december  fiscal had weeks and ended on december  overview we design and develop proprietary  analog intensive  mixed signal integrated circuits ics for a broad range of applications 
our innovative ics can dramatically reduce the cost  size and system power requirements of the products that our customers sell to consumers 
we currently offer ics that can be incorporated into communications devices  such as wireless phones and modems  as well as cable and satellite set top boxes  residential communication gateways for cable or digital subscriber line dsl  satellite radios and optical network equipment 
with our recent acquisition of cygnal integrated products  inc we offer a family of bit mcus for use in a broad array of applications such as industrial automation and control  automotive sensors and controls  medical instrumentation  and electronic test and measurement equipment 
our customers during fiscal included agere systems  broadcom  conexant pc tel  echostar  hughes network systems  sagem  samsung  sendo  smart link  texas instruments  thomson and wavecom 
our company was founded in our business has grown rapidly since our inception  as reflected by our employee headcount  which increased to at the end of fiscal  from employees at the end of fiscal and employees at the end of fiscal as a fabless semiconductor company  we rely on third party semiconductor fabricators in asia  and to a lesser extent the united states  to manufacture the silicon wafers that reflect our ic designs 
each wafer contains numerous die  which are cut from the wafer to create a chip for an ic 
we also rely on third parties in asia to assemble  package  and  in the majority of cases  test these die and ship these units to our customers 
we plan to increase the amount of testing performed by such third parties  which we anticipate will facilitate faster delivery of products to our customers particularly those located in asia  shorter production cycle times  lower inventory requirements  lower costs and increased flexibility of test capacity 
we have implemented supply chain management software which we believe will improve our ability to scale our operations  reduce our inventory requirements and improve the quality of our shipment scheduling commitments with our customers through improved efficiency 
our product set has expanded to a broad portfolio targeting the mobile handset and broad based mixed signal applications 
our expertise in analog intensive  high performance  mixed signal ics enables us to develop highly differentiated solutions that address large markets 
for example  our silicon daa product family is optimized for the pc modem market  our isomodem family of embedded modems has been widely adopted by satellite set top box manufacturers  and our aero global system for mobile communications gsm general packet radio services gprs transceiver family is being shipped in mobile handsets worldwide 
we continue to introduce next generation ics with added functionality and further integration 
in fiscal  we expanded our aero transceiver family with the launch of aero i i  a single package gsm gprs transceiver  and we introduced a new isomodem product family that integrates our third generation silicon daa 
through our recently acquired mcu business and our internal development efforts  we further diversified our product portfolio 
we plan to continue to diversify our product portfolio by introducing products that increase the amount of content we provide for existing applications and by introducing ics for markets we do not currently address  thereby expanding our total available market opportunity 
during fiscal and  one customer  samsung  represented and of our revenues  respectively 
no other single end customer accounted for more than of our revenues in either of these years 
in addition to direct sales to customers  some of our end customers purchase products indirectly from us through distributors and contract manufacturers 
an end customer purchasing through a contract manufacturer typically instructs such contract manufacturer to obtain our products and incorporate such products with other components for sale by such contract manufacturer to the end customer 
although we actually sell the products to  and are paid by  the distributors and contract manufacturers  we refer to such end customer as our customer 
there was one distributor  edom technology  which accounted for of our total revenues during fiscal two of our distributors  uniquest and edom technology  represented and of our fiscal revenues  respectively 
no other distributor accounted for more than of our revenues in fiscal years or the percentage of our revenues derived from customers located outside of the united states was in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal this percentage increase in the two most recent years reflects our product and customer diversification  as many of our mobile handset  and increasingly  broad based mixed signal customers manufacture and design their products in the pacific rim region 
all of our revenues to date have been denominated in us dollars 
we believe that a majority of our revenues will continue to be derived from customers outside of the united states as our products receive acceptance in international markets 
the sales cycle for the test and evaluation of our ics can range from one month to months or more 
an additional three to six months or more may be required before a customer ships a significant volume of devices that incorporate our ics 
due to this lengthy sales cycle  we may experience a significant delay between incurring expenses for research and development and selling  general and administrative efforts  and the generation of corresponding sales  if any 
consequently  if sales in any quarter do not occur when expected  expenses and inventory levels could be disproportionately high  and our operating results for that quarter and  potentially  future quarters would be adversely affected 
moreover  the amount of time between initial research and development and commercialization of a product  if ever  can be substantially longer than the sales cycle for the product 
accordingly  if we incur substantial research and development costs without developing a commercially successful product  our operating results  as well as our growth prospects  could be adversely affected 
rapid changes in our markets and across our product areas make it difficult for us to estimate the impact of seasonal factors on our business 
because many of our ics are designed for use in consumer products such as personal computers pcs and wireless telephones  we expect that the demand for our products will be subject to seasonal demand resulting in increased sales in the third and fourth quarters of each year when customers place orders to meet holiday demand 
we now group our products into two categories  mobile handset products or broad based mixed signal products 
mobile handset products include the aero transceivers and  to the extent incorporated into handsets  the rf synthesizers 
broad based mixed signal products include our silicon daa  isomodem  proslic  satellite tuner  dsl analog front end  clock chips  optical transceivers and cdrs  general purpose rf synthesizers for non handset applications  as well as the cygnal mcu products 
comparison of prior year financial results also have been revised to reflect this change in product grouping 
the following describes the line items set forth in our consolidated statements of operations revenues 
revenues are generated principally by sales of our ics 
we recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery of goods has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
generally  we recognize revenue from product sales direct to customers and contract manufacturers upon shipment 
certain of our sales are made to distributors under agreements allowing certain rights of return and price protection on products unsold by distributors 
accordingly  we defer the revenue and gross profit on such sales until the distributors sell the product to the end customer 
our products typically carry a one year replacement warranty 
replacements have been insignificant to date 
our revenues are subject to variation from period to period due to the volume of shipments made within a period and the prices we charge for our products 
the vast majority of our revenues were negotiated at prices that reflect a discount from the list prices for our products 
these discounts are made for a variety of reasons  including to establish a relationship with a new customer  as an incentive for customers to purchase products in larger volumes  to provide profit margin to our distributors who resell our products or in response to competition 
in addition  as a product matures  we expect that the average selling price for such product will decline due to the greater availability of competing products 
our ability to increase revenues in the future is dependent on increased demand for our established products and our ability to ship larger volumes of those products in response to such demand  as well as our ability to develop or acquire new products and subsequently achieve customer acceptance of newly introduced products 
cost of revenues 
cost of revenues includes the cost of purchasing finished silicon wafers processed by independent foundries  costs associated with assembly  test and shipping of those products  costs of personnel and equipment associated with manufacturing support  logistics and quality assurance  costs of software royalties and amortization of purchased software  other intellectual property license costs  and certain acquired intangible assets  an allocated portion of our occupancy costs  allocable depreciation of testing equipment and leasehold improvements  impairment charges related to certain manufacturing equipment held for sale or abandoned  and a portion of the settlement costs associated with the tdk semiconductor corporation tdk patent infringement lawsuit 
generally  we depreciate equipment over four years on a straight line basis and leasehold improvements over the shorter of the estimated useful life or the applicable lease term 
recently introduced products tend to have higher cost of revenues per unit due to initially low production volumes required by our customers and higher costs associated with new package variations 
generally  as production volumes for a product increase  unit production costs tend to decrease as our yields improve and our semiconductor fabricators  assemblers and test operations achieve greater economies of scale for that product 
additionally  the cost of wafer procurement and assembly and test services  which are significant components of cost of goods sold  vary cyclically with overall demand for semiconductors and our suppliers available capacity of such products and services 
research and development 
research and development expense consists primarily of compensation and related costs of employees engaged in research and development activities  new product mask  wafer and packaging costs  external consulting and services costs  amortization of purchased software  equipment tooling  amortization of acquired intangible assets  as well as an allocated portion of our occupancy costs for such operations 
we generally depreciate our research and development equipment over four years and amortize our purchased software from computer aided design tool vendors over three to four years 
development activities include the design of new products  refinement of existing products and design of test methodologies to ensure compliance with required specifications 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expense consists primarily of personnel related expenses  related allocable portion of our occupancy costs  sales commissions to independent sales representatives  professional fees  directors and officers liability insurance  patent litigation legal fees  other promotional and marketing expenses  and reserves for bad debt 
write offs of uncollectible accounts have been insignificant to date 
write off of in process research development 
write off of in process research development reflects the write off of in process research and development costs which we acquired in connection with our acquisition of cygnal integrated products  inc cygnal in fiscal and krypton isolation  inc krypton in fiscal goodwill amortization 
we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  at the beginning of fiscal and accordingly ceased amortization of goodwill 
goodwill amortization through december includes the amortization of goodwill purchased in connection with our acquisitions of krypton in august and snr in october goodwill was amortized over four to five years using the straight line method 
impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets 
impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets reflects the charge to write down that portion of the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets that was in excess of its fair market value 
amortization of deferred stock compensation 
in connection with the grant of stock options and direct issuances of stock to our employees  we record deferred stock compensation  representing  for accounting purposes  the difference between the exercise price of option grants  or the issuance price of direct issuances of stock  as the case may be  and the fair value of our common stock at the time of such grants or issuances 
the deferred stock compensation is amortized over the vesting period of the applicable options or shares  generally five to eight years 
the amortization of deferred stock compensation is recorded as an operating expense 
interest income 
interest income reflects interest earned on average cash  cash equivalents and investment balances 
we may from time to time elect to invest in tax advantaged short term investments yielding lower nominal interest proceeds 
interest expense 
interest expense consists of interest on our long term debt  capital leases and other long term obligations 
other income expense 
other income expense reflects our share of income and losses related to our equity investment in asic design services  inc ads and the gain on the disposal of fixed assets 
provision for income taxes 
we accrue a provision for federal and state income tax at the applicable statutory rates adjusted for non deductible expenses  research and development tax credits and interest income from tax advantaged short term investments 
results of operations comparison of fiscal to fiscal revenues 
revenues in fiscal were million  an increase of million  or  from revenues of million in fiscal the increase was primarily attributable to significant growth in the volume of sales for our aero transceiver used in gsm mobile handsets and isomodem products used in satellite set top boxes  primarily reflecting gains in market share and an increase in the overall market size 
we also continued to see significant growth in the sales of our daa products  primarily reflecting an increase in the overall market demand for these products and strength in mobile notebook computer modems 
during fiscal  we experienced normal decreases in the average selling prices for certain products 
however  these price decreases were offset by the significant increases in sales volumes for our products and the introduction of higher priced next generation products and product extensions 
as a product becomes more mature  we expect it to experience additional decreases in average selling prices in the future 
our revenue will be dependent on our ability to increase sales volumes and introduce higher priced next generation products and product extensions 
gross profit 
gross profit in fiscal was million  or of revenues  an increase of million  or  as compared with gross profit of million  or of revenues  in fiscal the increase in gross profit dollars was primarily due to the substantial increase in sales volume 
the decrease in gross margin percentage was primarily due to a million charge associated with a patent litigation settlement in fiscal  a greater portion of our sales being comprised of our lower margin mobile handset products  and a million impairment charge associated with test equipment held for sale 
we expect to experience continued declines in the average selling prices of our mobile handset products 
this downward pressure on gross profit as a percentage of revenues may be offset to the extent we are able to introduce higher margin new products and continue to gain market share with our broad based mixed signal ics 
research and development 
research and development expense in fiscal was million  or of revenues  which reflected an increase of million  or  as compared with research and development expense of million  or of revenues  in fiscal the increase in the dollar amount of research and development expense was principally due to increased staffing and associated costs to pursue new product development opportunities  and continue to develop new testing methodologies for newly introduced and existing products 
as a percentage of revenues  research and development expense decreased due to the substantial increase in revenues in fiscal we expect that research and development expense will increase in absolute dollars in future periods as we continue to increase our staffing and associated costs to pursue additional new product development opportunities  and may fluctuate as a percentage of revenues due to changes in sales volume and the timing of certain expensive items related to new product development initiatives  such as engineering mask and wafer costs 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expense in fiscal was million  or of revenues  which reflected an increase of million  or  as compared to selling  general and administrative expense of million or of revenues  in fiscal the increase in the dollar amount of selling  general and administrative expense was principally attributable to increased staffing and associated costs  sales commissions associated with our higher revenues and the conversion of our largest customer account  samsung  from a non commission bearing distributor account to a commission bearing direct account  and employee bonuses resulting from increased earnings 
this increase was partially offset by lower patent litigation related legal costs following settlement of the tdk litigation 
we expect that selling  general and administrative expense will increase in absolute dollars in future periods as we expand our sales channels  marketing efforts and administrative infrastructure 
in addition  we expect selling  general and administrative expense to fluctuate as a percentage of revenues because of potential significant variability in our future sales volumes  the likelihood that indirect sales distribution channels  which typically entail the payment of commissions  will account for a larger portion of our revenues in future periods and  therefore  increase our selling  general and administrative expense relative to a direct sales force performing at satisfactory levels of productivity  fluctuating usage of advertising to promote our products and  in particular  our newly introduced products  and fluctuating legal costs related to litigation and intellectual property matters 
write off of in process research and development 
we wrote off million of in process research and development in fiscal related to our acquisition of cygnal 
we did not have any write offs in fiscal impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets 
we did not recognize any impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets during fiscal during fiscal  we wrote off thousand  which represented the remaining goodwill related to the fiscal acquisition of krypton 
amortization of deferred stock compensation 
we recorded deferred stock compensation for the difference between the exercise price of option grants or the issuance price of direct issuances of stock  as the case may be  and the deemed fair value of our common stock at the time of such grants or issuances 
we are amortizing this amount over the vesting periods of the applicable options or issuances  which resulted in amortization expense of million in fiscal  as compared to million in fiscal in fiscal  we expect our amortization expense to remain at approximately this same level 
interest income 
interest income in fiscal was million  as compared to million in fiscal the decrease was generally due to lower interest rates on cash and short term investments balances during the current year and our transition to tax exempt investments which bear even lower interest rates 
interest expense 
interest expense in fiscal was thousand as compared to million in fiscal the decrease in interest expense was primarily due to lower debt  lease and other long term payable balances during the recent period 
we expect our interest expense to remain at a modest level in fiscal other income expense 
other expense in fiscal was million as compared to million in fiscal  which primarily reflects our share of the losses in our investment in ads 
provision benefit for income taxes 
our tax provision rate  excluding the impact of the amortization of deferred stock compensation  the write off of in process research and development and impairment of goodwill and other intangibles  was in fiscal as compared to the rate in fiscal this increase was due in part to the fact that our tax advantaged interest income as a percentage of pre tax income was lower in fiscal than it was in fiscal for fiscal  our tax provision reflects a deduction for the amount of employee income attributable to employee stock based awards that relates to the amortization of deferred stock compensation 
in prior years such deductions were recorded as an increase to additional paid in capital 
the impact of not reflecting these deductions in the tax provision benefit in prior years is not material 
the tax provision rate differs from the statutory rate due to the impact of research and development tax credits  state taxes  tax advantaged interest income and other permanent items 
comparison of fiscal to fiscal revenues 
revenues in fiscal were million  an increase of million  or  from revenues of million in fiscal the increase was primarily attributable to significant growth in the volume of sales for our mobile handset products  reflecting a growing number of customers adopting these products into their offerings 
we also continued to see significant growth in the sales of our broad based mixed signal ics  particularly the isomodem and daa  reflecting increasing demand by existing customers for these products 
during fiscal  we experienced normal decreases in the average selling prices for certain products 
however  these price decreases were offset by the significant increases in sales volumes for our products and the introduction of higher priced next generation products and product extensions 
gross profit 
gross profit in fiscal was million  or of revenues  an increase of million  or  as compared with gross profit of million  or of revenues  in fiscal the increase in gross profit dollars was primarily due to the substantial increase in sales volume 
the decrease in gross margin percentage was primarily due to a greater portion of our sales being comprised of our lower margin mobile handset products which have lower average selling prices and higher material costs than our other products 
the gross margin percentage in fiscal year was also negatively impacted by start up costs associated with the rapid production ramp of our aero transceiver product 
research and development 
research and development expense in fiscal was million  or of revenues  which reflected an increase of million  or  as compared with research and development expense of million  or of revenues  in fiscal the increase in the dollar amount of research and development expense was principally due to increased staffing and associated costs to pursue new product development opportunities  and continue to develop new testing methodologies for newly introduced and existing products 
as a percentage of revenues  research and development expense decreased significantly due to the substantial increase in revenues in fiscal selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expense in fiscal was million  or of revenues  which reflected an increase of million  or  as compared to selling  general and administrative expense of million or of revenues  in fiscal the increase in the dollar amount of selling  general and administrative expense was principally attributable to increased staffing and associated costs  legal fees incurred during patent litigation  sales commissions associated with our higher revenues and employee bonuses resulting from increased earnings 
goodwill amortization 
we did not incur goodwill amortization in fiscal due to the adoption of sfas no 
goodwill amortization in fiscal was million 
in fiscal  we wrote off the majority of our goodwill balances after determining that they were permanently impaired 
impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets 
during fiscal  we performed an assessment of the carrying value of our long lived assets recorded in connection with our acquisitions of krypton and snr 
as a result of this assessment  we concluded that the value of these assets had become permanently impaired and recorded charges of million to write off related goodwill and million to reduce the carrying value of related intangible assets to their fair value 
during fiscal  we determined that the remaining goodwill of  related to krypton was impaired and wrote off the balance 
there were no other impairments of goodwill and other intangible assets in fiscal amortization of deferred stock compensation 
we recorded deferred stock compensation for the difference between the exercise price of option grants or the issuance price of direct issuances of stock  as the case may be  and the deemed fair value of our common stock at the time of such grants or issuances 
we are amortizing this amount over the vesting periods of the applicable options or issuances  which resulted in amortization expense of million in fiscal  as compared to million in fiscal interest income 
interest income in fiscal was million  as compared to million in fiscal the decrease was generally due to lower interest rates on cash and short term investments balances during the current year and our transition to tax exempt investments which bear even lower interest rates 
interest expense 
interest expense in fiscal was million as compared to million in fiscal the decrease in interest expense was primarily due to lower debt and lease payable balances during the recent period 
in december  we prepaid million in satisfaction of our remaining debt and lease obligations to three equipment financing institutions 
other income expense 
other expense in fiscal was million  which primarily reflects our share of the losses in our investment in ads 
we did not have any equity investments  and therefore no corresponding losses  in fiscal provision benefit for income taxes 
our effective tax provision rate  excluding the impact of goodwill amortization  impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets  and deferred stock compensation amortization  was in fiscal  as compared to our effective tax benefit rate of in fiscal such fiscal effective tax provision rate reflects our tax benefits from our estimated research and development tax credit  tax exempt interest income  and other deductions 
the effective tax benefit in fiscal was attributable to our pre tax loss as well as tax benefits from our estimated research and development tax credit  tax exempt interest income and other deductions 
liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity as of january  consisted of million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
our short term investments consist primarily of obligations of municipalities and agencies of the us government that have initial maturities of less than one year 
in august  we terminated our bank credit facility for a revolving line of credit for borrowings and letters of credit 
at january   a letter of credit for million related to a building lease was outstanding under a letter of credit agreement with our bank 
net cash provided by operating activities was million during the fiscal year ended january   compared to million during the fiscal year ended december  the increase was principally due to revenues generated by a higher volume of sales over a relatively fixed cost structure 
this increase was partially offset by a million cash payment relating to the settlement of patent litigation with tdk 
operating cash flows during the fiscal year ended january  reflect our net income of million  as adjusted for non cash adjustments depreciation  amortization  write off of in process research and development  equity investment losses  and tax benefits associated with the exercise of stock options of million  and a net decrease in the components of our working capital of million 
net cash used in investing activities was million during the fiscal year ended january   compared to net cash used of million during the fiscal year ended december  the decrease was principally due to an increase in net maturities of short term investments of million  net cash acquired of million related to the purchase of cygnal  and a decrease of million in purchases of fixed assets and other assets 
we anticipate capital expenditures of approximately million for fiscal additionally  as part of our growth strategy  we expect to evaluate opportunities to invest in or acquire other businesses  intellectual property or technologies that would complement or expand our current offerings  expand the breadth of our markets or enhance our technical capabilities 
net cash provided by financing activities was million during the fiscal year ended january   compared to net cash used of million during the fiscal year ended december  the increase in cash flows from financing activities during the fiscal year ended january  was principally due to proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan 
in our day to day business activities  we incur certain commitments to make future payments under contracts such as purchase orders  leases and other long term contracts 
maturities under these contracts are set forth in the following table as of january   in thousands payments due by period thereafter operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term obligations our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the rate of sales growth  market acceptance of our products  the timing and extent of research and development projects  and the expansion of our sales and marketing activities 
we believe our existing cash and investment balances are sufficient to meet our capital requirements through at least the next months  although we could be required  or could elect  to seek additional funding prior to that time 
we may enter into acquisitions or strategic arrangements in the future which also could require us to seek additional equity or debt financing 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported 
changes in facts and circumstances could have a significant impact on the resulting estimated amounts included in the financial statements 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more complex judgments and estimates 
we also have other policies that we consider to be key accounting policies  such as our policies for revenue recognition  including the deferral of revenues and gross profit on sales to distributors  however  these policies do not meet the definition of critical accounting estimates because they do not generally require us to make estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective 
allowance for doubtful accounts we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to us  we record a specific allowance to reduce the net receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected 
for all other customers  we recognize allowances for doubtful accounts based on a variety of factors including the length of time the receivables are past their contractual due date  the current business environment  and our historical experience 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate or if economic conditions worsened  additional allowances may be required in the future 
accounts receivable write offs to date have been minimal 
inventory valuation we assess the recoverability of inventories through an on going review of inventory levels in relation to sales history  backlog and forecasts  product marketing plans and product life cycles 
to address the difficult  subjective and complex area of judgment in determining appropriate inventory valuation in a consistent manner  we apply a set of methods  assumptions and estimates to arrive at the net inventory amount by completing the following first  we identify any inventory that has been previously reserved in prior periods 
this inventory remains reserved until sold  destroyed or otherwise disposed of 
second  we examine the inventory line items that may have some form of obsolescence due to non conformance with electrical and mechanical standards as identified by our quality assurance personnel and provide reserves 
third  the remaining inventory not otherwise identified to be reserved is compared to an assessment of product history and forecasted demand  typically over the last six months and next six months  or actual firm backlog on hand 
however  microcontroller product history and forecasted demand is typically measured over the last twelve months and next twelve months  respectively  due to the breadth of customers and markets served and longer product life cycles 
finally  the result of this methodology is compared against the product life cycle and competitive situations in the marketplace driving the outlook for the consumption of the inventory and the appropriateness of the resulting inventory levels 
demand for our products may fluctuate significantly over time  and actual demand and market conditions may be more or less favorable than those that we project 
in the event that actual demand is lower or market conditions are worse than originally projected  additional inventory write downs may be required 
impairment of long lived assets we review long lived assets which are held and used  including fixed assets and purchased intangible assets  for impairment whenever changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable and record an impairment charge if necessary 
such evaluations compare the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset and are significantly impacted by estimates of future prices and volumes for our products  capital needs  economic trends and other factors which are inherently difficult to forecast 
occasionally  we may hold certain assets for sale 
in those cases  the assets are reclassified on our balance sheet from long term to current  and the carrying value of such assets are reviewed and adjusted each period thereafter to the fair value less expected cost to sell 
we also review the carrying values of goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives annually for possible impairment 
the goodwill impairment test is a two step process 
the first step of the impairment analysis compares our fair value for such assets to our net book value 
in determining fair value  the accounting guidance allows for the use of several valuation methodologies  although it states quoted market prices are the best evidence of fair value 
the second step of the analysis compares the implied fair value of our goodwill to its carrying amount 
if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  we recognize an impairment loss equal to that excess amount 
we test our goodwill for impairment annually as of the first day of our fourth fiscal quarter and in interim periods if certain events occur indicating that the carrying value of goodwill may be impaired 
income taxes we are required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating the actual current tax liability together with assessing temporary differences in recognition of income loss for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income loss and  to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset 
further  we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in these jurisdictions 
these audits can involve complex issues  which may require an extended period of time to resolve and could result in additional assessments of income tax 
in our opinion  adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all periods 
recent accounting pronouncements in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
 which addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities vies either that do not have sufficient equity investment at risk to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support  or in which the equity investors lack an essential characteristic of a controlling financial interest 
in december  the fasb completed deliberations of proposed modifications to fin revised interpretations resulting in multiple effective dates based on the nature as well as the creation date of the vie 
vies created after january   but prior to january   may be accounted for either based on the original interpretation or the revised interpretations 
however  the revised interpretations must be applied no later than the first quarter of fiscal year vies created after january  must be accounted for under the revised interpretations 
there has been no material impact to our financial statements from potential vies entered into after january  and we do not expect there to be a material impact to our financial statements from the adoption of the deferred provisions in the first quarter of fiscal year in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas establishes standards on the classification and measurement of certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
the provisions of sfas are effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may  and to all other instruments that exist as of the beginning of the first interim financial reporting period beginning after june  the adoption of sfas did not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
in december  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition sab no 
 which codifies  revises and rescinds certain sections of sab no 
 revenue recognition  in order to make this interpretive guidance consistent with current authoritative accounting and auditing guidance and sec rules and regulations 
the changes noted in sab no 
did not have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations  consolidated financial position or consolidated cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk all of our investments are entered into for other than trading purposes 
our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates  particularly since the majority of our investments are in short term instruments 
based on our investment holdings as of january   an immediate percentage point decline in the yield for such instruments would decrease our annual interest income by million 
we believe that our investment policy is conservative  both in terms of the average maturity of our investments and the credit quality of the investments we hold
