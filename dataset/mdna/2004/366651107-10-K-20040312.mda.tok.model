overview with the convergence of it and business  technology has become increasingly more important not just to technology professionals  but also to business executives 
we are an independent and objective research and advisory firm that helps it and business executives use technology to build  guide and grow their enterprises 
we employ a diversified business model that leverages the breadth and depth of our research intellectual capital while enabling us to maintain and grow our market leading position and brand franchise 
our strategy is to align our resources and our infrastructure to leverage that intellectual capital into additional revenue streams through effective packaging  campaigning and cross selling of our products and services 
our diversified business model provides multiple entry points and synergies that facilitate increased client spending on our research  consulting and events 
a key strategy is to increase business volume with our most valuable clients  identifying relationships with the greatest sales potential and expanding those relationships by offering strategically relevant research and analysis 
we intend to maintain a balance between pursuing opportunities and applying resources with a strict focus on growing our businesses and generating profitability through a streamlined cost structure 
we have been organized into three business segments research  consulting and events 
o research products and services highlight industry developments  review new products and technologies  provide quantitative market research  and analyze industry trends within a particular technology or market sector 
o consulting consists primarily of consulting  measurement engagements and strategic advisory services paid one day analyst engagements sas  which provide assessments of cost  performance  efficiency and quality focused on the it industry 
o events consists of various symposia  conferences and exhibitions focused on the it industry 
we have recently begun to undertake a plan to ensure that our business units are closely aligned with client need and market opportunity 
as part of that process  we have begun to reorganize our business in to three distinct business units o gartner intelligence will deliver content and advice to it professionals  technology vendors and investors through vehicles such as research  events and sas 
o gartner executive programs will offer membership and peer networking services for chief information officers cios and other key executives  through offerings such as the highly successful exp membership program 
o gartner consulting will focus on customized engagements that allow cios and their counterparts to apply gartner s knowledge to their specific business situations  with an emphasis on areas such as outsourcing and it management 
k 
organizing our business units around distinct client segments will allow us to make our existing products more relevant  accelerate the development of new products that provide solutions for specific client needs  and increase the gartner value proposition overall 
as part of implementing this plan  we will be analyzing whether or not it impacts how we report on our business segments 
we will continue to report our segment information as we have historically until we complete the alignment of our financial reporting to this new structure and can then analyze what impact  if any  this alignment will have 
we believe the following business measurements are important performance indicators for our business segments 
revenue category business measurements research contract value represents the value attributable to all of our subscription related research products that recognize revenue on a ratable basis 
contract value is calculated as the annualized value of all subscription research contracts in effect at a specific point in time  without regard to the duration of the contract 
client retention rate represents a measure of client satisfaction and renewed business relationships at a specific point in time 
client retention is calculated on a percentage basis by dividing our current clients who were also clients a year ago  by all clients from a year ago 
wallet retention rate represents a measure of the amount of contract value we have retained with clients over a twelve month period 
wallet retention is calculated on a percentage basis by dividing the contract value of clients  who were clients one year earlier  by the total contract value from a year earlier 
when wallet retention exceeds client retention  it is an indication of retention of higher spending clients 
consulting consulting backlog represents future revenue to be derived from in process consulting  measurement and strategic advisory services engagements 
utilization rates represent a measure of productivity of our consultants 
utilization rates are calculated for billable headcount on a percentage basis by dividing total hours billed by total hours available to bill 
events number of events represents the total number of hosted events completed during the period 
executive summary of operations and financial position technology spending has decreased steadily over the past few years 
as a result  sales of our it related research have declined as well 
during this period  we have been focused on stabilizing and then growing revenue in our core research business 
this continued focus began to yield the desired outcome during the latter half of calendar we ended the latter half of with two consecutive quarters of sequential increases in contract value after seven consecutive quarters of sequentially decreasing contract value 
our research client retention rates steadily increased to at december  from at december  we believe the technology market is showing signs of a recovery  and we believe the realignment of our business units discussed previously will help us grow during this expected recovery 
our consulting business also ended the year with a positive trend 
we ended calendar with two consecutive quarters of sequential increases in backlog after five consecutive quarters of sequential decreases 
as part of the realignment previously discussed  we will be exiting certain less profitable consulting practices and geographies 
we expect this realignment to address our sub optimal utilization rates and our lack of scale in some regions 
our events business continues to deliver strong results  particularly in an environment where few competitors have survived 
our emphasis on managing the events portfolio to retain our long time successful events and introduce promising new events has resulted in improved revenue performance 
we achieved these results while hosting fewer events  during calendar  which was nine fewer than calendar during the fourth quarter of calendar  we made an important change to our capital structure 
our convertible notes were converted into class a common stock 
this eliminated all of our outstanding debt  and the related interest expense  and we ended the year with million of stockholders equity 
in addition  our cash increased from million at december  to million at december   while repurchasing million of our common stock 
we have strong financial resources to support additional investments in growth 
k 
fluctuations in quarterly operating results our quarterly and annual revenue and operating income fluctuate as a result of many factors  including the timing of symposia  our flagship event that normally occurs during the fourth calendar quarter  and other events  the amount of new business generated  the mix of domestic and international business  changes in market demand for our products and services  changes in foreign currency rates  the timing of the development  introduction and marketing of new products and services  and competition in the industry 
the potential fluctuations in our operating income could cause period to period comparisons of operating results not to be meaningful and could provide an unreliable indication of future operating results 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements requires the application of appropriate accounting policies 
our significant accounting policies are described in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
management considers the policies discussed below to be critical to an understanding of our financial statements because their application requires complex and subjective judgements and estimates 
specific risks for these critical accounting policies are described below 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab 
revenue by significant source is accounted for as follows o research revenues are derived from subscription contracts for research products 
revenues from research products are deferred and recognized ratably over the applicable contract term  o consulting revenues are based primarily on fixed fees or time and materials for discrete projects 
revenues for such projects are recognized as work is delivered and or services are provided and are evaluated on a contract by contract basis  o events revenues are deferred and recognized upon the completion of the related symposium  conference or exhibition  and o other revenues  principally software licensing fees  are recognized when a signed non cancelable software license exists  delivery has occurred  collection is probable  and the fees are fixed or determinable 
revenue from software maintenance is deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance agreement  which is typically twelve months 
uncollectible fees receivable provisions for bad debts are recognized as incurred 
the measurement of likely and probable losses and the allowance for uncollectible fees receivable is based on historical loss experience  aging of outstanding receivables  an assessment of current economic conditions and the financial health of specific clients 
this evaluation is inherently judgmental and requires material estimates 
these valuation reserves are periodically re evaluated and adjusted as more information about the ultimate collectibility of fees receivable becomes available 
circumstances that could cause our valuation reserves to increase include changes in our clients liquidity and credit quality  other factors negatively impacting our clients ability to pay their obligations as they come due  and the effectiveness of our collection efforts 
the following tables provides our total fees receivables  along with the related allowance for losses in thousands december  september  total fees receivables    allowance for losses    fees receivables  net    impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets the evaluation of goodwill is performed in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
among other requirements  this standard eliminated goodwill amortization upon adoption and requires an annual assessment for goodwill impairment 
the evaluation of other intangible assets is performed on a periodic basis 
k 
these assessments require management to estimate the fair values of our reporting units based on estimates of future business operations and market and economic conditions in developing long term forecasts 
if we determine that the fair value of any reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  we must recognize an impairment charge  for the associated goodwill of that reporting unit  to earnings in our financial statements 
goodwill is evaluated for impairment at least annually  or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important that could trigger a review for impairment include the following o significant under performance relative to historical or projected future operating results  o significant changes in the manner of our use of acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  o significant negative industry or economic trends  o significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and o our market capitalization relative to net book value 
due to the numerous variables associated with our judgments and assumptions relating to the valuation of the reporting units and the effects of changes in circumstances affecting these valuations  both the precision and reliability of the resulting estimates are subject to uncertainty  and as additional information becomes known  we may change our estimates 
accounting for income taxes as we prepare our consolidated financial statements  we estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions where we operate 
this process involves estimating our current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets when future realization is in question 
we consider future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
in the event we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would decrease income in the period such determination was made 
contingencies and other loss reserves and accruals we establish reserves for severance costs  contract terminations and asset impairments as a result of actions we undertake to streamline our organization  reposition certain businesses and reduce ongoing costs 
estimates of costs to be incurred to complete these actions  such as future lease payments  sublease income  the fair value of assets  and severance and related benefits  are based on assumptions at the time the actions are initiated 
to the extent actual costs differ from those estimates  reserve levels may need to be adjusted 
in addition  these actions may be revised due to changes in business conditions that we did not foresee at the time such plans were approved 
during the fourth quarter of calendar  we revised our previous estimates for costs and losses associated with excess facilities due to declines in market rates for expected sublease income and revised expected periods of sublease 
as a result of these revised estimates  we recorded a charge of million  which was included in other charges along with severance costs 
additionally  we record accruals for estimated incentive compensation costs during the year 
the ultimate amount paid associated with these incentives are sometimes not known until after year end 
during the fourth quarter of calendar  we lowered our estimates for incentive compensation accruals  including bonuses  based on company performance by approximately million as compared to the estimates recorded as of the end of the third quarter of calendar impairment of investment securities a charge to earnings is made when a market decline below cost is other than temporary 
management regularly reviews each investment security for impairment based on criteria that include the length of time and the extent to which market value has been less than cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  the valuation of comparable companies and our intent and ability to retain k 
the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
total investments in equity securities were million at december   million at december   and million at september  see note investments in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
change in fiscal year on october   we announced that the board of directors approved a change of our fiscal year end from september to december  effective january  this change resulted in a three month transitional period ending december  references to transition  unless otherwise indicated  refer to the three month transitional period ended december  references to fiscal and fiscal  unless otherwise indicated  are to the respective fiscal year period from october through september references to calendar and calendar  unless otherwise indicated  are to the respective twelve month period from january through december results of operations calendar versus calendar total revenues decreased to million during calendar from million during calendar o research revenues decreased in calendar to million  compared to million in calendar  and comprised approximately and of total revenues in calendar and calendar  respectively 
o consulting revenues decreased to million in calendar  compared to million in calendar  and comprised approximately and of total revenues in calendar and calendar  respectively 
o events revenues were million in calendar  an increase of from the million in calendar  and comprised approximately of total revenues in calendar versus in calendar o other revenues  consisting principally of software licensing and maintenance fees  decreased to million in calendar from million in calendar while revenues declined in the united states and canada region  they increased in our europe  middle east and africa region emea and the other international region 
revenues from sales to united states and canadian clients decreased to million in calendar from million in calendar revenues from sales to clients in the emea region increased to million in calendar from million in calendar revenues from sales to clients in other international regions increased to million in calendar from million in calendar the decrease in our total revenues was a result of a decline in demand throughout the entire technology sector and the overall weakness in the economy  partially offset by the positive effects of foreign currency exchange rates 
excluding the effects of foreign currency translation  revenues would have decreased approximately 
see segment analysis section below for a further discussion of segment revenues 
cost of services and product development increased during calendar to million from million during calendar excluding the effects of foreign currency translation  cost of services and product development would have decreased by 
as a percentage of sales  cost of services and product development increased to from due primarily to investments in gartner exp  membership programs  product development and costs associated with customer intelligence  higher conference related expenses and lower utilization rates for our consulting practice 
k 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased  to million during calendar from million during calendar sg a would have decreased by approximately had it not been for the negative effect of foreign currency translation 
the decrease in sg a was primarily the result of lower sales commissions and our continued focus on streamlining our support organizations and restructuring efforts 
depreciation expense for calendar decreased to million  compared to million for calendar the decrease was due to a reduction in capital spending during calendar and calendar relative to the capital spending during fiscal and  which led to a decrease in depreciation expense 
in addition  costs capitalized during fiscal associated with the initial launch of the gartner 
com web site in january have been fully depreciated as of the beginning of calendar amortization of intangibles decreased when comparing calendar to calendar due to certain intangible assets having been fully amortized over the past year 
other charges of million during calendar were for costs for employee severance and benefits associated with workforce reductions initiated under two separate actions  million during the first quarter of calendar and million during the fourth quarter of calendar additionally  during the fourth quarter of calendar  we revised our estimates of previously recorded costs and losses associated with excess facilities and recorded million of additional provisions 
the revised estimate was due to a decline in market lease rates for expected subleases  as well as a reduction in estimated periods of subleases 
the workforce reduction that occurred during the first quarter of calendar was a continuation of the action taken in transition  which resulted in the termination of employees  or approximately of our workforce 
the purpose of this reduction was to reduce costs in underperforming segments 
the workforce reduction that occurred during the fourth quarter of calendar resulted in the termination of employees  or approximately of our workforce 
the purpose of this workforce reduction was part of an effort to streamline operations  to strengthen key consulting practices  and to align our organizational structure to focus on client needs 
we expect the remaining payments associated with the workforce reduction to be substantially completed by the end of the second quarter of we are funding all of these costs out of existing cash 
we expect to record additional expenses for severance during the first quarter of of approximately million to million associated with the realignment plan initiated during the fourth quarter of calendar during calendar  other charges were million 
these charges were the result of two actions  one during the first quarter of calendar amounting to million  and the other occurring during the fourth quarter of calendar  or transition  amounting to million 
of the charges occurring during the first quarter of calendar  million related to costs and losses associated with the elimination of excess facilities  principally leasehold improvements and ongoing lease costs and losses associated with sub lease arrangements 
in addition  approximately million of these charges were associated with our workforce reduction initiated during the first quarter of calendar and were for employee termination severance and benefits 
this workforce reduction resulted in the termination of employees  or approximately of the company s workforce at that time 
we expect the payments associated with the workforce reduction to be completed by the end of the first quarter of the remaining million of expenses recorded as other charges during the first quarter of calendar relates to the impairment of certain database related assets 
of the million of charges during the fourth quarter of calendar  million related to costs and losses associated with our elimination of excess facilities  principally leased facilities and ongoing lease costs and losses associated with sub lease arrangements 
the remaining million of these charges related to severance payments and related benefits associated with a workforce reduction  which included million of non cash compensation 
this workforce reduction resulted in the elimination of approximately positions  or approximately of our workforce at the time 
we are funding all of the remaining costs out of existing cash 
interest expense decreased during calendar due to the conversion of our debt to equity in october the conversion of our debt has eliminated most of our interest expense since the conversion date 
k 
gain loss on investments  net during calendar includes a million insurance recovery received during calendar associated with previously incurred losses arising from the sale of a business 
gain loss on investments  net during calendar also includes an impairment loss of million associated with a minority owned investment not publicly traded 
we evaluated the investment for impairment because of the investee s recapitalization due to its lack of capital resources to redeem its mandatorily redeemable equity  which led us to write the investment down to our estimate of fair value 
the loss on investments during calendar was caused primarily by the recognition of impairment losses related to equity securities owned by us through two limited partnerships  si venture associates si i and si venture fund ii si ii 
si i and si ii are venture capital funds engaged in making investments in early to mid stage it based or internet enabled companies 
we own of si i and of si ii 
see note investments in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of the gains and losses on investments 
the impairment factors evaluated by management may change in subsequent periods  given that the entities underlying these investments operate in a volatile business environment 
in addition  these entities may require additional financing to meet their cash and operational needs 
however  there can be no assurance that such funds will be available to the extent needed  at terms acceptable to the entities  if at all 
this could result in additional material non cash impairment charges in the future 
other income  net for calendar of million consists primarily of net foreign exchange gains 
for calendar  other income  net of million includes a million gain from the sale of certain assets during the first quarter of calendar  partially offset by net foreign exchange losses 
provision for income taxes was and of income before income taxes for calendar and  respectively 
excluding the other charges for workforce reductions  excess facilities and asset impairments and the gains and losses from investments  the effective tax rate would have been in calendar as compared to in calendar the reduction in the effective tax rate for calendar  as compared to that of calendar  reflects the implementation of tax planning strategies 
basic and diluted income per common share was for calendar  compared to for calendar for calendar  basic and diluted eps were negatively impacted by our restructuring costs and the impairment of an investment 
partially offsetting these items was the favorable impact of the insurance recovery 
during calendar  the restructuring charges and impairment of investments had an unfavorable impact on basic and diluted eps 
segment results during calendar  our business was managed through three reportable segments research  consulting and events 
as announced in the fourth quarter of  we are moving toward a client focus and realigning our business into three business units gartner intelligence  gartner executive programs  and gartner consulting 
as this realignment is finalized during  we will evaluate the needs  if any  to realign our segment reporting 
our segment discussion is based on our historical segments as managed through we evaluate reportable segment performance and allocate resources based on gross contribution margin 
gross contribution is defined as operating income excluding certain selling  general and administrative expenses  depreciation  amortization of intangibles and other charges 
gross contribution margin is defined as gross contribution as a percentage of revenues 
research research revenues decreased when comparing calendar and calendar foreign currency exchange rates favorably impacted research revenues by approximately 
the decrease in research revenues was due to the overall weakness in the economy and the impact of this weakness on corporate information technology spending causing lower demand throughout the entire technology sector 
k 
research gross contribution of million for calendar decreased from million for calendar  while gross contribution margin for calendar decreased to from in the prior year 
the decrease in gross contribution and gross contribution margin is a result of the lower revenues and costs associated with investments in gartner exp  gartner g  membership programs  product development and marketing and costs associated with customer intelligence 
research contract value  an indicator of future research revenue  was million at december   a decrease of from million at december  however  research contract value increased sequentially during both the third and fourth quarters of calendar from million at june  and million at september  prior to these sequential increases during calendar  contract value had decreased sequentially for seven consecutive quarters 
we believe these sequential increases may be an indication of an upturn in demand for our products coinciding with potentially increasing demand in the technology sector 
at december   our client retention rates increased percentage points to as compared to the same measure at december  wallet retention increased percentage points during calendar to 
the client and wallet retention rates increased steadily over the four quarters of calendar we believe these increases were a result of implementing a named account sales strategy with our sales staff and the focusing of their efforts on companies with revenues greater than billion 
consulting consulting revenues decreased during calendar to million from million for calendar foreign currency exchange rates had a positive impact of approximately during calendar the decrease in revenues was caused by lower billable headcount and lower utilization 
workforce reductions over the past year have resulted in reduced billable headcount in response to the lower demand in the technology sector 
billable headcount for our consulting business as of december  has decreased approximately to at december  as compared to at december  consulting gross contribution of million for calendar decreased from million for calendar  and gross contribution margin for calendar decreased to from in the prior year 
the decrease in the gross contribution margin was primarily attributable to lower consultant utilization rates  which were approximately during calendar as compared to approximately during calendar as part of our realignment that caused workforce reductions during the fourth quarter of calendar  we decided to exit certain lines of business and geographies within our consulting business in order to focus on areas with potential for higher growth and profitability 
the realignment is expected to address the sub optimal utilization rates and our lack of scale in some regions 
in the near term  this decision will affect overall revenue growth for consulting as revenues from those areas exited are allowed to wind down  while new areas of focus are beginning to ramp up 
consulting backlog decreased to million at december   compared to million at december   but increased sequentially during both the third and fourth quarters of calendar  when it was million at june  and million at september  consulting backlog decreased as compared to the prior year due to the decline in demand throughout the entire technology sector  as technology customers continued to constrain spending 
as noted in the discussion of the research segment  the sequential backlog increases in the latter half of calendar may be an indication of increased demand in the technology sector 
events events revenues increased to million for calendar  compared to million for calendar changes in foreign currency exchange rates had approximately a favorable impact on revenues when comparing calendar to calendar revenues have increased slightly despite having nine fewer events during calendar as compared to calendar the average revenue per event has increased during calendar due to the strong performance of our recurring events  as well as the addition of new events during calendar that had higher revenues than the events that were eliminated 
k 
gross contribution of million for calendar was relatively consistent with calendar as a percentage of revenues  gross contribution decreased to during calendar from during calendar the decrease in gross contribution margin was due primarily to increased personnel expenses and increased event marketing costs 
during  we invested more in marketing and promoting our events to maintain our attendance levels during a weak economy  especially in the technology sector 
fiscal year ended september  versus fiscal year ended september  total revenues decreased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal o research revenue decreased in fiscal to million  compared to million in fiscal  and comprised approximately and of total revenues in fiscal and  respectively

the cost of services and product development expenses decreased as a percentage of total revenues to from 
the decrease is attributable to reduced personnel costs associated with headcount reductions  more effective cost management of events and other cost savings  including reduced travel 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease was due to reduced payroll associated with lower headcount  reduced travel  telephone and other infrastructure costs across the entire company 
depreciation expense increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  primarily due to the additional depreciation from significant capital expenditures made during fiscal for internal use software required to support the business and also due to the amortization of costs associated with the launch of gartner 
com in january amortization of intangibles of million in fiscal was down from million in fiscal the primary reason for the decrease was our adoption of sfas which eliminated the amortization of goodwill for fiscal for fiscal  goodwill amortization was million and  on an after tax basis  was million 
as a result of adoption  diluted earnings per share for the year ended september  improved by 
during fiscal  we recorded other charges of million 
of these charges  million related to costs and losses associated with our elimination of excess facilities  principally leased facilities and ongoing lease costs and losses associated with sub lease arrangements 
in addition  approximately million of these charges are associated with a workforce reduction announced in january and were for employee termination severance payments and related benefits 
this workforce reduction resulted in the elimination of approximately positions  or approximately of our workforce at the time  and the payment of million of termination benefits during fiscal the remaining million relates to the impairment of certain database related assets 
other charges totaled million for fiscal of these charges  million was associated with our workforce reduction k 
announced in april this workforce reduction resulted in the elimination of positions  or approximately of our workforce at the time  and the payment of million and million of termination benefits during fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the million charge was comprised of employee termination severance payments and related benefits 
approximately million of the other charges were associated with the write down of goodwill and other long lived assets to net realizable value as a result of our decision to discontinue certain unprofitable products  and million of the charge was associated primarily with the write off of internally developed systems retired in connection with the launch of gartner 
com 
at december   an insignificant amount of severance costs remain to be paid during these costs will be paid from existing cash 
the estimated costs associated with the excess facilities have been reevaluated as part of the charge taken during the fourth quarter of calendar discussed previously 
operating income increased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal in fiscal  our united states and canadian business and our european business experienced an increase in operating income of and  respectively 
our other international business experienced an operating loss for the year  which was slightly lower than a year ago 
on a consolidated basis  operating income as a percentage of total revenues was and  respectively  for fiscal and operating income was impacted  in part  by other charges of million and million in fiscal and  respectively  and additional costs associated with the re architecture of our internet capabilities and our research methodology and delivery processes in fiscal excluding the other charges  operating income for fiscal and was and  respectively  of total revenues 
we decreased our staff by approximately in the second half of fiscal and in mid fiscal and  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  decreased the expense to revenue ratio associated with our cost of services and selling  general and administrative expenses through various cost reduction initiatives 
the improvement in operating income was also impacted by lower amortization of intangibles due to the adoption of sfas amortization of goodwill was million in fiscal gain loss on investments  net for fiscal included the sale of  shares of cnet for million  resulting in a pre tax gain of million 
we acquired this investment as partial consideration for our sale of techrepublic to cnet in july the remaining million loss on investments during fiscal was primarily the result of impairment losses related to investments owned by us through si i  si ii and other directly owned investments for other than temporary declines in value 
see note investments in the notes to consolidated financial statements for a further discussion 
gain loss on investments  net in fiscal of million included the sale of shares of an investment  in which we held a minority interest  for net cash proceeds of million and a pre tax loss of million 
fiscal also included a million gain as a result of the sale of shares received from our venture capital funds  si i  si ii and other securities for net cash proceeds of million 
the remaining loss of million during fiscal was primarily the result of impairment losses related to investments owned by us through si i  si ii and other directly owned investments for other than temporary declines in value 
see note investments in the notes to consolidated financial statements for a further discussion 
interest expense increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase relates primarily to increased interest expense on the convertible long term debt compared to fiscal interest income of million in fiscal was up from million in fiscal due to a higher average balance of funds available for investment  offset in part by lower interest earnings rates 
other expense  net decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease related primarily to lower foreign currency exchange losses of and a million gain from the sale of a business in fiscal provision for income taxes on continuing operations was million in fiscal compared to a benefit of million in fiscal the effective tax rate was for fiscal the effective tax rate in fiscal  less the impact of a one time tax benefit of million due to the utilization of foreign tax credits in the second half of fiscal and other charges and losses on investments and related tax impact  was 
the reduction in the effective tax rate in fiscal reflects on going tax planning and the elimination of non deductible amortization of goodwill pursuant to the adoption of sfas a more detailed analysis of the changes in the provision benefit for income taxes is provided in note income taxes of the notes to consolidated financial statements

basic income loss per common share from continuing operations was per share in fiscal compared to per share in fiscal diluted income loss per common share from continuing operations was per share in fiscal compared to per share in fiscal the elimination of goodwill amortization in accordance with sfas improved basic and diluted income per share from continuing operations by and  respectively  for fiscal as compared to fiscal segment analysis research research revenues of million in fiscal were down from million in fiscal the decline in revenues was due to lower demand throughout the entire technology sector and the overall weakness in the general economy 
research s gross contribution in fiscal decreased to million from million in fiscal research s gross contribution margin was in fiscal and although revenues declined  gross contribution margin remained flat  in part due to reductions in expenses 
the decline in gross contribution was due to lower revenues 
our research client retention rate was for fiscal compared to for fiscal total research contract value decreased to approximately million at september  from million at september  the decrease in contract value reflects a decline in demand throughout the entire technology sector as well as overall weakness in the general economy 
consulting consulting revenues of million in fiscal were down from million in fiscal revenues for fiscal reflect a strategic reduction in certain client segments and geographies based on market share  competitive advantage  client size and other factors 
the reduction in revenue was partially offset by increases in average project size and length 
consulting s gross contribution increased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal consulting s gross contribution margin of in fiscal increased from in fiscal primarily due to reduced expenses  higher utilization rates and higher billing rates 
we reduced headcount and eliminated expenses in practice areas and markets where we did not have sufficient scale and volume 
consulting backlog decreased to approximately million at september  from million at september  the decrease in backlog primarily reflects the overall weakness in the general economy 
events events revenues of million in fiscal were down from million in fiscal the decline was primarily due to fewer events due to the strategic elimination of less profitable and unproven events with the expectation of obtaining greater attendee and exhibitor participation at higher profit events  the overall weakness in the general economy  and lower travel budgets 
events gross contribution increased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal with gross contribution margin of in fiscal compared to in fiscal the increase in gross contribution and margin was due to better cost management and the elimination of less profitable events 
liquidity and capital resources calendar cash provided by operating activities during calendar was million  compared to million during calendar the decrease was primarily due to lower cash related earnings and a smaller decrease in receivables during calendar compared to calendar cash related earnings are income from continuing operations adjusted for the non cash items included in income  such as depreciation and amortization  the accretion of interest and amortization of debt issue costs  along with other non cash charges

obligations and commitments we have a million unsecured senior revolving credit facility led by jpmorgan chase bank 
at december   there were no amounts outstanding under the facility 
we are subject to certain customary affirmative  negative and financial covenants under this credit facility  and continued compliance with these covenants preclude us from borrowing the maximum amount of the credit facility from time to time 
these covenants are primarily based on financial results and other measures such as contract value 
as a result of these covenants  our borrowing availability at december  was million 
this credit facility expires in july we expect to obtain a revolving credit facility to replace the current facility upon expiration 
on april   we issued  in a private placement transaction  million of convertible subordinated notes to silver lake partners  lp slp and other noteholders 
interest accrued semi annually by a corresponding increase in the face amount of the convertible notes 
these notes were due and payable on april  in october  our notes were converted into  shares of gartner class a common stock 
the shares owned by slp  as a result of this conversion  represent approximately of our outstanding class a common stock and approximately on a combined basis with our outstanding class b common stock  based upon shares outstanding as of december  the conversion was in accordance with the original terms of the notes 
the determination of the number of shares issued upon conversion was based upon a conversion price and a convertible note of million  consisting of the original face amount of million plus accrued interest of million 
the unamortized balances of debt issue costs of million and debt discount of million as of the conversion date were netted against the outstanding principal and interest balances  resulting in a million increase to stockholders equity 
additionally  certain costs directly associated with the conversion  such as regulatory filings  banking and legal fees totaling million were charged to equity 
the following table represents our contractual commitments at december  in millions less than more than total year years years years operating leases severance associated with workforce reductions si ii funding commitment other service agreements totals we believe that our current cash balances  together with cash anticipated to be provided by operating activities and borrowings available under the existing credit facility  will be sufficient for our expected short term and foreseeable long term cash needs in the ordinary course of business 
if we were to require substantial amounts of additional capital to pursue business opportunities that may arise involving substantial investments of additional capital  there can be no assurances that such capital will be available to us or will be available on commercially reasonable terms

stock repurchases in july  our board of directors approved the repurchase of up to million of class a and class b common stock 
our board of directors has subsequently increased the authorized stock repurchase program to a total authorization for repurchase of million 
on a cumulative basis at december   we have purchased million of our stock under this stock repurchase program

in addition  we and our clients are affected by the economy 
the following section discusses many  but not all  of these risks and uncertainties 
economic conditions 
our revenues and results of operations are influenced by economic conditions in general and more particularly by business conditions in the it industry 
a general economic downturn or recession  anywhere in the world  could negatively affect demand for our products and services and may substantially reduce existing and potential client information technology related budgets 
the recent economic downturn in the united states and globally has led to constrained it spending  which has impacted our business and may materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations  including the ability to maintain client retention  wallet retention and consulting utilization rates  and achieve contract value and consulting backlog 
to the extent our clients are in the it industry  the severe decline in that sector has also had a significant impact on it spending 
acts of terrorism or war 
acts of terrorism  acts of war and other unforeseen events  may cause damage or disruption to our properties  business  employees  suppliers  distributors and clients  which could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
such events may also result in an economic slowdown in the united states or elsewhere  which could adversely affect our business  financial condition and operating results 
competitive environment 
we face direct competition from a significant number of independent providers of information products and services  including information that can be found on the internet free of charge 
we also compete indirectly against consulting firms and other information providers  including electronic and print media companies  some of which may have greater financial  information gathering and marketing resources than we do 
these indirect competitors could choose to compete directly with us in the future 
in addition  limited barriers to entry exist in the markets in which we do business 
as a result  additional new competitors may emerge and existing competitors may start to provide additional or complementary services 
additionally  technological advances may provide increased competition from a variety of sources 
however  we believe the breadth and depth of our research assets position us well versus our competition 
increased competition may result in loss of market share  diminished value in our products and services  reduced pricing and increased marketing expenditures 
we may not be successful if we cannot compete effectively on quality of research and analysis  timely delivery of information  customer service  the ability to offer products to meet changing market needs for information and analysis  or price 
renewal of research business by existing clients 
some of our success depends on renewals of our subscription based research products and services  which constituted of our revenues for calendar these research subscription agreements have terms that generally range from twelve to thirty months 
our ability to maintain contract renewals is subject to numerous factors  including those described in this annual report 
additionally  as we implement our strategy to realign our business to client needs  we may shift the type and k 
pricing of our products which may impact client renewal rates 
while client retention rates were at december  and at december   there can be no guarantee that we will continue to have this level of client renewals 
any material decline in renewal rates could have an adverse impact on our revenues and our financial condition 
non recurring consulting engagements 
consulting segment revenues constituted of our revenues for calendar these consulting engagements typically are project based and non recurring 
our ability to replace consulting engagements is subject to numerous factors  including those described in this annual report 
any material decline in our ability to replace consulting arrangements could have an adverse impact on our revenues and our financial condition 
restructuring  reorganization and management team 
our future success depends  in significant part  upon the continued service and performance of our senior management and other key personnel 
we have recently reorganized our business around specific client needs 
as part of this reorganization  a number of key management positions have been filled by the promotion of current employees or the hiring of new employees 
as part of this reorganization  we have restructured our workforce in order to streamline operations and strengthen key consulting practices 
if the reorganization and restructuring of our business do not lead to the results we expect  our ability to effectively deliver our products  manage our company and carry out our business plan may be impaired 
hiring and retention of employees 
our success depends heavily upon the quality of our senior management  research analysts  consultants  sales and other key personnel 
we face competition for the limited pool of these qualified professionals from  among others  technology companies  market research firms  consulting firms  financial services companies and electronic and print media companies  some of which have a greater ability to attract and compensate these professionals 
some of the personnel that we attempt to hire are subject to non compete agreements that could impede our short term recruitment efforts 
any failure to retain key personnel or hire and train additional qualified personnel as required to support the evolving needs of clients or growth in our business  could adversely affect the quality of our products and services  and therefore  our future business and operating results 
maintenance of existing products and services 
we operate in a rapidly evolving market  and our success depends upon our ability to deliver high quality and timely research and analysis to our clients 
any failure to continue to provide credible and reliable information that is useful to our clients could have a material adverse effect on future business and operating results 
further  if our predictions prove to be wrong or are not substantiated by appropriate research  our reputation may suffer and demand for our products and services may decline 
in addition  we must continue to improve our methods for delivering our products and services in a cost effective manner 
failure to increase and improve our electronic delivery capabilities could adversely affect our future business and operating results 
introduction of new products and services 
the market for our products and services is characterized by rapidly changing needs for information and analysis 
to maintain our competitive position  we must continue to enhance and improve our products and services  develop or acquire new products and services in a timely manner  and appropriately position and price new products and services relative to the marketplace and our costs of producing them 
any failure to achieve successful client acceptance of new products and services could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial position 
international operations 
a substantial portion of our revenues is derived from sales outside of north america  for calendar as a result  our operating results are subject to the risks inherent in international business activities  including general political and economic conditions in each country  changes in market demand as a result of exchange rate fluctuations and tariffs and other trade barriers  challenges in staffing and managing foreign operations  changes in regulatory requirements  compliance with numerous foreign laws and regulations  different or overlapping tax structures  higher levels of united states taxation on foreign income  and the difficulty of enforcing client agreements  collecting accounts receivable and protecting intellectual property rights in international jurisdictions 
we rely on local distributors or sales agents in some international locations 
if any of k 
these arrangements are terminated by our agent or us  we may not be able to replace the arrangement on beneficial terms or on a timely basis  or clients of the local distributor or sales agent may not want to continue to do business with us or our new agent 
branding 
we believe that our gartner brand is critical to our efforts to attract and retain clients and that the importance of brand recognition will increase as competition increases 
we may expand our marketing activities to promote and strengthen the gartner brand and may need to increase our marketing budget  hire additional marketing and public relations personnel  expend additional sums to protect the brand and otherwise increase expenditures to create and maintain client brand loyalty 
if we fail to effectively promote and maintain the gartner brand  or incur excessive expenses in doing so  our future business and operating results could be materially and adversely impacted 
indebtedness 
we have a million senior revolving credit facility under which we can incur significant additional indebtedness  although there were no amounts outstanding at december  the affirmative  negative and financial covenants of this debt facility could limit our future financial flexibility 
as a result of these covenants  our borrowing availability at december  was million 
the associated debt service costs could impair future operating results 
any outstanding debt may limit the amount of cash or additional credit available to us  which could restrain our ability to expand or enhance products and services  respond to competitive pressures or pursue future business opportunities requiring substantial investments of additional capital 
organizational and product integration related to acquisitions 
we have made and may continue to make acquisitions of  or significant investments in  businesses that offer complementary products and services 
the risks involved in each acquisition or investment include the possibility of paying more than the value we derive from the acquisition  dilution of the interests of our current stockholders or decreased working capital  increased indebtedness  the assumption of undisclosed liabilities and unknown and unforeseen risks  the ability to integrate successfully the operations and personnel of the acquired business  the ability to retain key personnel of the acquired company  the time to train the sales force to market and sell the products of the acquired company  the potential disruption of our ongoing business and the distraction of management from our business 
the realization of any of these risks could adversely affect our business 
enforcement of our intellectual property rights 
we rely on a combination of copyright  patent  trademark  trade secret  confidentiality  non compete and other contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property rights 
despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights  unauthorized third parties may obtain and use technology or other information that we regard as proprietary 
our intellectual property rights may not survive a legal challenge to their validity or provide significant protection for us 
the laws of certain countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
accordingly  we may not be able to protect our intellectual property against unauthorized third party copying or use  which could adversely affect our competitive position 
our employees are subject to non compete agreements 
when the non competition period expires  former employees may compete against us 
if a former employee chooses to compete against us prior to the expiration of the non competition period  there is no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts to enforce the non compete provision 
possibility of infringement claims 
third parties may assert infringement claims against us 
regardless of the merits  responding to any such claim could be time consuming  result in costly litigation and require us to enter into royalty and licensing agreements which may not be offered or available on reasonable terms 
if a successful claim is made against us and we fail to develop or license a substitute technology  our business  results of operations or financial position could be materially adversely affected 
potential fluctuations in operating results 
our quarterly and annual operating income may fluctuate in the future as a result of many factors  including the timing of the execution of research contracts  which typically occurs in the fourth calendar quarter  the extent of completion of consulting engagements  the timing of symposia and other events  which also occur to a greater extent in the fourth calendar quarter  the amount of new business generated  the mix of domestic and international business  changes in market demand for our products and services  the k 
timing of the development  introduction and marketing of new products and services  and competition in the industry 
an inability to generate sufficient earnings and cash flow  and achieve our forecasts  may impact our operating and other activities 
the potential fluctuations in our operating income could cause period to period comparisons of operating results not to be meaningful and may provide an unreliable indication of future operating results 
significant stockholder 
silver lake partners  lp slp and its affiliates own approximately of our outstanding class a common stock and approximately on a combined basis with our outstanding class b common stock as of december  currently  the owners of our class a common stock are only entitled to vote for two of the ten members of our board of directors and vote together with the holders of the class b common stock as a single class on all other matters coming before the stockholders 
slp is restricted from purchasing additional stock without our consent pursuant to the terms of a securityholders agreement 
this securityholders agreement also provides that we cannot take certain actions  including acquisitions and sales of stock and or assets without slp s consent 
while slp does not hold a majority of our outstanding shares  it may be able to exercise significant influence over matters requiring stockholder approval  including the election of directors and the approval of mergers  consolidations and sales of our assets 
slp s interests may differ from the interests of other stockholders 
anti takeover protections 
provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law may make it difficult for any party to acquire control of us in a transaction not approved by the requisite number of directors 
these provisions include o the presence of a classified board of directors  o the existence of two classes of common stock with our class b common stock having the ability to elect of our board of directors o the ability of the board of directors to issue and determine the terms of preferred stock  o advance notice requirements for inclusion of stockholder proposals at stockholder meetings  and o the anti takeover provisions of delaware law 
these provisions could delay or prevent a change of control or change in management that might provide stockholders with a premium to the market price of their common stock 
recently issued accounting standards none

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk as of december   we have limited exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates since our long term debt was converted to equity during the fourth quarter of calendar additionally  we have no borrowings under our million unsecured senior revolving credit facility with jpmorgan chase bank 
under the revolving credit facility  the interest rate on borrowings is libor plus an additional to basis points based on our debt to ebitda ratio 
we believe that an increase or decrease of in the effective interest rate on available borrowings from our senior revolving credit facility  if fully utilized  would not have a material effect on our future results of operations 
each basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would have an approximate million annual effect under the revolving credit facility if fully utilized 
investment risk we are exposed to market risk as it relates to changes in the market value of our equity investments 
we invest in equity securities of public and private companies directly and through si i  a wholly owned affiliate  and si ii  of which we own 
si i and si ii are engaged in making venture capital investments in early to mid stage it based or internet enabled companies see note investments in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
as of december   we had investments in equity securities totaling million 
unrealized gains and losses were insignificant 
these investments are inherently risky as the businesses are typically in early development stages and may never develop 
further  certain of these investments are in publicly traded companies whose shares are subject to significant market price volatility 
adverse changes in market conditions and poor operating results of the underlying investments may result in us incurring additional losses or an inability to recover the original carrying value of our investments 
if there were a adverse change in the value of our equity portfolio as of december   this would result in a non cash impairment charge of million 
additionally  we have a commitment to fund an additional million of investments with si ii 
foreign currency exchange risk we face two risks related to foreign currency exchange translation risk and transaction risk 
amounts invested in our foreign operations are translated into us dollars at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date 
the resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss in the stockholders equity deficit section of the consolidated balance sheets 
our foreign subsidiaries generally collect revenues and pay expenses in currencies other than the united states dollar 
since the functional currencies of our foreign operations are generally denominated in the local currency of our subsidiaries  the foreign currency translation adjustments are reflected as a component of stockholders equity and do not impact operating results 
revenues and expenses in foreign currencies translate into higher or lower revenues and expenses in us dollars as the us dollar weakens or strengthens against other currencies 
therefore  changes in exchange rates may negatively affect our consolidated revenues and expenses as expressed in us dollars from foreign operations 
currency transaction gains or losses arising from transactions in currencies other than the functional currency are included within other income expense  net within the consolidated statements of operations 
currency transaction gains losses  net were million during calendar  million during calendar   million during transition  million during fiscal  and million during fiscal from time to time we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts or other derivative financial instruments to hedge the effects of adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
at december   we had one foreign currency forward contract outstanding 
foreign exchange forward contracts are reflected at fair value with gains and losses recorded currently in earnings 
the following table presents information about our foreign currency forward contract outstanding as of december   expressed in us dollar equivalents
