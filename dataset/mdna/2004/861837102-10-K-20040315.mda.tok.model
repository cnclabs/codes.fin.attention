item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this discussion is intended to further the reader s understanding of our financial condition and results of operations and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere herein 
this discussion also contains statements that are forward looking 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of the risks and uncertainties set forth elsewhere in this annual report and in our other sec filings 
readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forward looking statements  which speak only as of the date hereof 
overview we are a non asset based third party logistics services company providing supply chain solutions on a global basis 
we offer a full range of time definite transportation and distribution solutions through our domestic services platform where we manage and arrange the movement of raw materials  supplies  components and finished goods for our customers 
these services are offered through our domestic air and ground freight forwarding business 
we offer a full range of international logistics services including international air and ocean transportation as well as customs house brokerage services through our international services platform 
in addition to these core service offerings  we also provide a broad range of value added supply chain management services  including warehousing  order fulfillment and inventory management solutions 
we service a customer base of manufacturers  distributors and national retail chains through a network of offices in major metropolitan areas in north america  puerto rico and ten locations in asia  using an extensive network of independent carriers and service partners strategically located around the world 

back to contents as a non asset based provider of third party logistics services  we seek to limit our investment in equipment  facilities and working capital through contracts and preferred provider arrangements with various transportation providers who generally provide us with favorable rates  minimum service levels  capacity assurances and priority handling status 
the dollar volume of our purchased transportation services enables us to negotiate attractive pricing with our transportation providers 
our strategic objective is to build a leading global logistics services organization that integrates established operating businesses and innovative technologies 
we plan to achieve this objective by broadening our network through a combination of synergistic acquisitions and the organic expansion of our existing base of operations 
we are currently pursuing an aggressive acquisition strategy to enhance our position in our current markets and to acquire operations in new markets 
the focus of this strategy is on acquiring businesses that have demonstrated historic levels of profitability  have a proven record of delivering high quality services  have a customer base of large and mid sized companies and which otherwise may benefit from our long term growth strategy and status as a public company 
our acquisition strategy relies upon two primary factors first  our ability to identify and acquire target businesses that fit within our general acquisition criteria and  second  the continued availability of capital and financing resources sufficient to complete these acquisitions 
our growth strategy relies upon a number of factors  including our ability to efficiently integrate the businesses of the companies we acquire  generate the anticipated economies of scale from the integration  and maintain the historic sales growth of the acquired businesses so as to generate continued organic growth 
the business risks associated with these factors are discussed in item of this report under the heading risks particular to our business 
our principal source of income is derived from freight forwarding services 
as a freight forwarder  we arrange for the shipment of our customers freight from point of origin to point of destination 
generally  we quote our customers a turnkey cost for the movement of their freight 
our price quote will often depend upon the customer s time definite needs first day through fifth day delivery  special handling needs heavy equipment  delicate items  environmentally sensitive goods  electronic components  etc 
and the means of transport truck  air  ocean or rail 
in turn  we assume the responsibility for arranging and paying for the underlying means of transportation 
we also provide a range of other services including customs brokerage  warehousing and other services which include customized distribution and inventory management services  fulfillment services and other value added supply chain services 
gross revenues represent the total dollar value of services we sell to our customers 
our cost of transportation includes direct costs of transportation  including motor carrier  air  ocean and rail services 
we act principally as the service provider to add value in the execution and procurement of these services to our customers 
our net transportation revenues gross transportation revenues less the direct cost of transportation are the primary indicator of our ability to source  add value and resell services provided by third parties  and are considered by management to be a key performance measure 
management believes that net revenues are also an important measure of economic performance 
net revenues include transportation revenues and our fee based activities  after giving effect to the cost of purchased transportation 
in addition  management believes measuring operating costs as a function of net revenues provides a useful metric as our ability to control costs as a function of net revenues directly impacts operating earnings 
with respect to our services other than freight transportation  net revenues are identical to gross revenues 
our operating results will be affected as acquisitions occur 
since all acquisitions are made using the purchase method of accounting for business combinations  our financial statements will only include the results of operations and cash flows of acquired companies for periods subsequent to the date of acquisition 
accordingly  our results of operations only reflect the operations of air plus for periods subsequent to october   slis formerly known as global for periods subsequent to april   united american for periods subsequent to may   tsi for periods subsequent to october   trwl for periods subsequent to january   regroup for periods subsequent to june   and csi for periods subsequent to july  starting in the second half of  we began a program to establish an offshore network of owned offices with an initial focus in asia commencing with the acquisition of g link s singapore and cambodia operations on august  to help facilitate the consolidation  analysis and public reporting process  our offshore operations are included within our consolidated results on a one month lag  or more specifically  our calendar year results will include results from offshore operations for the period december though november as a result  our results include the financial results for the g link cambodia and singapore operations for the period august  through november  we also closed a number of small transactions in december of  the earnings impact of which will not be reflected in our results until 
back to contents our gaap based net income will also be affected by non cash charges relating to the amortization of customer related intangible assets and other intangible assets arising from our completed acquisitions 
under applicable accounting standards  purchasers are required to allocate the total consideration in a business combination to the identified assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values at the time of acquisition 
the excess of the consideration paid over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired is to be allocated to goodwill  which is tested at least annually for impairment 
applicable accounting standards require the company to separately account for and value certain identifiable intangible assets based on the unique facts and circumstances of each acquisition 
as a result of the company s acquisition strategy  our net income will include material non cash charges relating to the amortization of customer related intangible assets and other intangible assets acquired in our acquisitions 
although these charges may increase as the company completes more acquisitions  we believe we are actually growing the value of our intangible assets eg  customer relationships 
thus  we believe that earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  or ebitda  is a useful financial measure for investors because it eliminates the effect of these non cash costs and provides an important metric of the economic reality of the business 
accordingly  we employ ebitda as a measure of our historical financial performance and as a benchmark for future guidance 
a significant portion of our revenues is derived from our international operations  and the growth of those operations is an important part of our business strategy 
our current international operations are focused on the shipment of goods into and out of the united states and are dependent on the volume of international trade with the united states 
our strategic plan contemplates the growth of those operations  as well as the expansion into the transportation of goods wholly outside of the united states 
a list of the factors that could adversely affect our current international operations has been included in item of this annual report on form k  under the heading risks particular to our business 
our operating results are also subject to seasonal trends when measured on a quarterly basis 
our first and second quarters are likely to be weaker as compared with our other fiscal quarters  which we believe is consistent with the operating results of other supply chain service providers 
this trend is dependent on numerous factors  including the markets in which we operate  holiday seasons  consumer demand and economic conditions 
since our revenues are largely derived from customers whose shipments are dependent upon consumer demand and just in time production schedules  the timing of our revenues is often beyond our control 
factors such as shifting demand for retail goods and or manufacturing production delays could unexpectedly affect the timing of our revenues 
as we increase the scale of our operations  seasonal trends in one area may be offset to an extent by opposite trends in another area 
we cannot accurately predict the timing of these factors  nor can we accurately estimate the impact of any particular factor  and thus we can give no assurance that historical seasonal patterns will continue in future periods 
critical accounting policies accounting policies  methods and estimates are an integral part of the consolidated financial statements prepared by us and are based upon our current judgments 
those judgments are normally based on knowledge and experience with regard to past and current events and assumptions about future events 
certain accounting policies  methods and estimates are particularly sensitive because of their significance to the consolidated financial statements and because of the possibility that future events affecting them may differ from our current judgments 
while there are a number of accounting policies  methods and estimates that affect our consolidated financial statements as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  areas that are particularly significant include revenue recognition  accounting for stock options  the assessment of the recoverability of long lived assets  specifically goodwill and acquired intangibles  the establishment of an allowance for doubtful accounts and the valuation allowance for deferred income tax assets 
the company derives its revenues from three principal sources freight forwarding  customs brokerage  and warehousing and other value added services 
as a freight forwarder  the company is primarily a non asset based carrier that does not own or lease any significant transportation assets 
the company generates the majority of its revenues by purchasing transportation services from direct asset based carriers and using those services to provide transportation of property for compensation to its customers 
the company is able to negotiate favorable buy rates from the direct carriers by consolidating shipments from multiple customers and concentrating its buying power  while at the same time offering lower sell rates than most customers would otherwise be able to negotiate themselves 
when acting as an indirect carrier  the company will enter into a written agreement with its customers or issue a tariff and a house bill of lading to customers as the contract of carriage 
when the freight is physically tendered to a direct carrier  the company receives a separate contract of carriage  or master bill of lading 
in order to claim for any loss associated with the freight  the customer is first obligated to pay the freight charges 
based on the terms in the contract of carriage  revenues related to shipments where the company issues a house bill of lading are recognized when the freight is delivered to the direct carrier at origin 
costs related to the shipment are also recognized at this same time 
all other revenues  including revenues for customs brokerage and warehousing and other value added services  are recognized upon completion of the service 

back to contents in certain instances  accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america allow for the selection of alternative accounting methods 
two alternative methods for accounting for stock options are available the intrinsic value method and the fair value method 
we use the intrinsic value method of accounting for stock options  and accordingly  no compensation expense has been recognized for options issued at an exercise price equal to or greater than the quoted market price on the date of grant to employees  officers and directors 
under the fair value method  the determination of the pro forma amounts involves several assumptions including option life and volatility 
if the fair value method were used  basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share would have decreased by and  respectively  in as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the goodwill arising from our acquisitions is not amortized  but instead is tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the impairment test requires several estimates including future cash flows  growth rates and the selection of a discount rate 
in addition  the acquired intangibles arising from those transactions are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
the recoverability of long lived assets to be held and used including our identifiable intangible assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
in developing our future cash flow estimates we incorporate assumptions that marketplace participants would use in their estimates  including  among other things  that i existing operations are evaluated on a stand alone basis and  as such  achieve no revenue or cost synergies  ii no further acquisitions are made  iii formerly acquired companies achieve their earnings targets and their earn outs are fully paid  iv future earnings are fully taxed and v no additional equity is raised 
we cannot guarantee that our assets will not be impaired in future periods 
we maintain reserves for specific and general allowances against accounts receivable 
the specific reserves are established on a case by case basis by management 
a general reserve is established for all other accounts receivable  based on a specified percentage of the accounts receivable balance 
we continually assess the adequacy of the recorded allowance for doubtful accounts  based on our knowledge concerning the customer base 
while credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
our discontinued operations  which focused on the development of early stage technology businesses  generated significant net operating loss carryforwards nols which could have value in the future 
after giving effect for certain annual limitations based on changes in ownership as defined in section of the internal revenue code  we estimate that as much as million in nols may be available to offset future federal taxable income 
under sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  we are required to provide a valuation allowance to offset deferred tax assets if  based upon available evidence  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
in the fourth quarter of  we reversed million of the valuation allowance based on the company s history of profitable operations for the past year and projected profitability in the near future 
in addition we also recorded a deferred tax liability generated principally by the tax amortization of goodwill  which is deductible for tax purposes over a life of years but is not amortized for book purposes 
as a result  we recognized a net non cash tax benefit of million in in addition  as of december  we have an additional million in valuation allowance which if removed in could give rise to another million in non cash tax benefits and be available to offset any tax expense arising in we do not anticipate paying federal income taxes during as we expect that our existing nols should be sufficient to offset current taxable income 
however  additional sales of our securities could have the effect of significantly limiting our ability to utilize our existing nols in the future 
discontinued operations prior to the first quarter of  our principal business was developing early stage technology businesses with significant internet features and applications 
largely as a result of the significant correction in the global stock markets which began during  and the corresponding decrease in the valuation of technology businesses and contraction in the availability of venture financing during  we elected to shift our business strategy to focus on the acquisition of operating businesses within a particular industry segment 
following a wind down of the technology business  during the second quarter of we focused our acquisition efforts specifically within the transportation and logistics industry 
this decision occurred in conjunction with our june  appointment of dennis l 
pelino as our chairman and chief executive officer 
mr 
pelino brings to us over years of logistics experience  including most recently  as president and chief operating officer of fritz companies  inc  where he was employed from to

financial outlook for  we are forecasting million of ebitda on expected total revenue of million and expect net earnings of million  compared to million of ebitda on total revenue of million and net earnings of million for this guidance includes the earnings power of our most recently completed acquisitions up to and including the benefit of our acquisition of a interest in the operations of shaanxi 
this guidance does not include the benefit of any further acquisitions we may complete over the course of we expect to deploy an incremental million in acquisition capital in acquiring businesses that are generally expected to follow the form and valuation of our previous transactions 
with this general framework  we would expect to generate an additional million of ebitda for every million of capital we deploy 
the timing of transactions over the course of the year will affect our results for 
back to contents because of the potential discrepancy between our gaap based financials and the economic reality of our business resulting from the increased amortization of our customer related intangible assets  we believe ebitda is a useful non gaap performance measure 
a reconciliation of ebitda to the most directly comparable gaap measure in accordance with sec regulation s k follows amounts in millions net income interest expense income tax benefit depreciation and amortization ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization prior to the fourth quarter of  we maintained a valuation allowance to offset of the net deferred tax assets associated with the tax losses generated prior to the company s move into the logistics business 
in the fourth quarter of  a portion of the valuation allowance was reversed  resulting in the recognition of a deferred tax asset and related nonrecurring non cash tax benefit of million  resulting in an overall income tax benefit of million for although we do not anticipate paying federal taxes in  our effective tax rate will increase to approximately commencing with the first quarter of for purposes of developing our net earnings guidance  we have assumed that an additional portion of the valuation allowance will be reversed in that will result in additional tax benefits to offset any tax expense for the year 
our revenue and net income estimates have been developed based on a number of principal assumptions including  among others i that revenue and net income will continue to grow at an annual rate that is consistent with recent results  ii that operating margins will not decline from current levels  iii that no material economic or customer disruptions will occur  iv that we will not be required to repay some portion or all of the million received by us as a payment of pre petition indebtedness during the bankruptcy of a material customer  v that we will not be caused to incur additional charges as a result of the bankruptcy of fao  inc  a significant customer serviced by the recently acquired business of regroup  vi that we continue to maintain existing relationships with key employees  vii that there are no unexpected adverse results in any legal proceedings  and viii that the risks otherwise identified in this annual report on form k under risks particular to our business will not have an adverse effect on our operations 
in prior forward looking guidance  we had assumed that each of our operating companies  on a stand alone basis  would deliver the level of pre tax operating income necessary to fully achieve the earn out payments under each of their acquisition agreements 
our present guidance no longer relies upon that assumption based upon expected performance of certain of our operating units  and since some of our most recent acquisitions establish earn out levels based upon forecasted  rather than current levels of earnings 
furthermore  our estimates as to the expected financial results that may be realized from the acquisitions we made during have been developed based upon an analysis of the historic financial statements of such acquired businesses 
we may need to adjust our guidance if the results of operations of the acquired businesses in are inconsistent with the historical results provided to us by the sellers of those businesses 
these adjustments could materially affect our estimates 
assuming we can continue to execute on our business plan and acquisition model without any material disruptions  and identify and close transactions similar to the transactions accomplished to date  it is our goal to generate million in annualized total revenue by the end of notwithstanding our expectations regarding our ability to deliver these results  we can never be certain that future revenue or earnings will be achieved at any particular level 
estimates of future financial performance are forward looking statements and are subject to uncertainty created by the risk elements otherwise identified in item under risks particular to our business 
furthermore  even though we believe our current operations will achieve a certain level of earnings on an annual basis  our interim results are subject to seasonal trends 

back to contents sources of growth management believes that a comparison of same store growth is critical in the evaluation of the quality and extent of the company s internally generated growth 
this same store analysis isolates the financial contributions from operations that have been included in the company s operating results for the full comparable prior year period 
the table below presents same store comparisons for the year ended december  which is the measure of any increase from the same period of 
for the year ended december  domestic international n a liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents totaled million and million as of december  and working capital totaled million and million at december  and cash used in operating activities was million for compared to million used in  which included an increase of million in working capital 
net cash used in investing activities was million in compared to million in investing activities were driven principally by the acquisition of new businesses 
we deployed million for the acquisition of new businesses in compared to million in and million in support of our web based operating platform  tech logis  in compared to million in in addition  we funded million in earn out payments in cash from financing activities generated million in compared to cash provided by financing activities of million in  with the majority of the increase due to the company s two private placements of equity 
we expect to pay approximately million in cash for earn outs on or around april   based on the performance of our acquired companies relative to their respective pre tax earnings targets 
on july  we completed a private exchange transaction that eliminated approximately million of our series c preferred stock 
the terms of the series c preferred stock would have significantly constrained our future growth opportunities 
in return for eliminating the series c preferred stock  we issued  shares of common stock  warrants to purchase  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share for a term of three years  and a new class of series d preferred stock that would convert into  shares of our common stock no later than december  the terms of the series d preferred stock were structured to make it much like a common equity equivalent in that it receives no dividend  it is subordinated to new rounds of equity  and it held a limited liquidation preference which expired at the end of in addition  the holders of the series d preferred stock were restricted from selling the common stock received upon conversion of the series d preferred stock until july  and are now permitted limited resale based on trading volume through july  at march  there were  shares of the series d preferred stock outstanding 
in march  we completed a private placement of  shares of our common stock in exchange for gross proceeds of approximately million 
this placement yielded net proceeds of million for the company  after the payment of placement agent fees and other out of pocket costs associated with the placement 
on october   we completed the private placement of  shares of our common stock at a price of per share 
in connection with this transaction  we realized gross proceeds of million and paid a brokerage fee of four percent  or million 
we may receive proceeds in the future from the exercise of warrants and options outstanding as of march  in accordance with the following schedule number of shares proceeds options outstanding under our stock option plan   non plan options   warrants   total   
back to contents we believe that our current working capital  our anticipated cash flow from operations and our existing credit facility are adequate to support our existing operations and to implement our acquisition strategy in the short term 
however  we will need additional financing to pursue our acquisition strategy in the longer term 
we intend to finance these acquisitions primarily through the use of cash  funds from our debt facility and shares of our common stock or other securities 
in the event that our common stock does not attain or maintain a sufficient market value or potential acquisition candidates are otherwise unwilling to accept our securities as part of the purchase price for the sale of their businesses  we may be required to utilize more of our cash resources  if available  in order to continue our acquisition program 
if we do not have sufficient cash resources through either operations or from debt facilities  our growth could be limited unless we are able to obtain such additional capital 
to ensure that we have adequate near term liquidity  we maintain a revolving credit facility of million the facility with lasalle business credit  inc that is collateralized by accounts receivable and other assets of the company and its subsidiaries 
the facility requires the company and its subsidiaries to comply with certain financial covenants 
advances under the facility are available to fund future acquisitions  capital expenditures or for other corporate purposes 
there were no advances against the facility at december  we expect that the cash flow from our existing operations and any other subsidiaries acquired during the year will be sufficient to support our operations and some portion  if not all  of the contingent earn out payments or other cash requirements associated with our acquisitions 
therefore  we anticipate that our primary uses of capital in the near term will be to finance the cost of new acquisitions and to pay any portion of existing earn out arrangements that cash flow from operations is otherwise unable to fund
