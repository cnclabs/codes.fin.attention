item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the following discussion should be read in conjunction with columbia bancorp s columbia audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto as of december  and and for each of the three years in the period ended december  included elsewhere in this report 
columbia is a financial holding company which conducts operations principally through its wholly owned subsidiary  columbia river bank crb 
crb is a state chartered bank which offers a broad range of services to its customers  primarily small and medium sized businesses  farmers  and individuals

the trust issued million of trust preferred securities at a floating rate indexed to the day libor with a margin of 
these securities are considered to be tier i for regulatory capital purposes 
management s goal is to grow columbia s earning assets while maintaining a high return on equity and high asset quality 
the key to this  in management s view  is to emphasize personalized  quality banking products and services for its customers  to hire and retain competent branch and administrative personnel  and to respond quickly to customer demand and growth opportunities 
management also intends to increase columbia s penetration in our existing markets  and to expand into new markets through suitable acquisitions and new branch openings

as of december  and  total assets were million and million  total deposits were million and million  and shareholders equity were million and million  respectively 
columbia s net income for years ended december   and  was million  million and million  respectively 
columbia s year net income represents the seventeenth consecutive year of increasing net income 
for the year ended december   columbia s return on average assets was and return on average equity was  as compared to and  where return on average assets were and and return on average equity were and  respectively

the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates the estimates used  including the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses  impairment of intangible assets  and contingencies and litigation 
estimates are based upon historical experience  current economic conditions and other factors that management considers reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates result in judgments regarding the carrying values of assets and liabilities when these values are not readily available from other sources as well as assessing and identifying the accounting treatments of commitments and contingencies 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the following critical accounting policies involve the more significant judgments and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
the allowance for loan and lease losses is established to absorb known and inherent losses attributable to loans and leases outstanding and related off balance sheet commitments 
the adequacy of the allowance is monitored on an ongoing basis and is based on management s evaluation of numerous factors 
these factors include the quality of the current loan portfolio  the trend in the loan portfolio s risk ratings  current economic conditions  loan concentrations  loan growth rates  past due and nonperforming trends  evaluation of specific loss estimates for all significant problem loans  historical charge off and recovery experience and other pertinent information 
approximately of columbia s gross loan portfolio is secured by real estate and a significant depreciation in real estate values in oregon and washington would cause management to increase the allowance for loan and lease losses 
during and prior years  columbia capitalized service retained mortgage premiums which resulted in recognition of a mortgage servicing asset msa and a corresponding recognition of servicing income 
the msa has been valued on a quarterly basis by a qualified  third party with access and knowledge of current servicing portfolio values in the market place 
the techniques used in valuing the msa incorporate assumptions relative to prevailing conditions in the secondary servicing market 
these assumptions have been dependent upon near term transactions and include prepayment speed forecasts  market discount rates  earning rates  servicing costs  acquisition costs and ancillary income 
a calculated decrease in the value of the msa is recorded as a valuation write down adjustment 
however  actual fair 
table of contents values may differ from the measured valuation due to limitations in available third party market quotations and potential changes in the underlying assumptions 
mortgage servicing assets have been amortized over the expected life of the outstanding net servicing income 
the expected life of the outstanding net servicing income that is generated from the msa can vary from management s estimates due to interest rate volatility and changing prepayment speeds 
prepayment speeds in excess of management s estimates could negatively impact the recorded value of the msa 
columbia initiated a strategic shift in the fourth quarter of and discontinued the practice of capitalizing service retained mortgage premiums 
columbia river bank mortgage team mortgage team now originates mortgage loans which are sold exclusively on a brokerage basis with mortgage servicing released 

this means the existing msa balance will not increase as a result of additional mortgage loan activity in which mortgage premiums are retained 

this strategy will continue into with a focus on producing quality loans  providing competitive loan products  and selling service released mortgage premiums in the secondary servicing market 
management believes this will reduce interest rate risk associated with the msa 
any future decision to sell the msa will be dependent upon the movement of interest rates 
a rise in interest rates in will likely improve the value of the msa and provide management with the ability to examine sale options 
at december   columbia had approximately million in goodwill as a result of business combinations 
columbia adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
on january  annual and periodic analyses of the fair value of recorded goodwill for impairment will involve judgment on the part of management 
columbia applies accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations in accounting for its stock option plans 
accordingly  compensation costs are recognized as the difference between the exercise price of each option and the market price of columbia s stock at the date of each grant 
had compensation cost for columbia s   and grants for stock based compensation plans been determined consistent with sfas no

table of contents the effects of applying sfas no 
in the pro forma disclosure are not indicative of future amounts 
additionally  there can be no assurance that the public accounting oversight board pcaob  the accounting standard setting organization for public companies  will not issue new pronouncements that will change the accounting for stock based compensation plans in the future 
columbia may become party to various legal proceedings 
these matters have a high degree of uncertainty associated with them 
there can be no assurance that the ultimate outcome will not differ materially from columbia s assessment of them 
there can also be no assurance that all matters that may be brought against columbia are known to them at any point in time 
results of operations net interest income for financial institutions  the primary component of earnings is net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between interest income  principally from loan and investment security portfolios  and interest expense  principally on customer deposits and bank borrowings from other sources  such as trust preferred securities 
changes in net interest income result from changes in volume  spread and margin 
volume refers to the dollar level of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
spread refers to the difference between the yield on interest earning assets and the cost of interest bearing liabilities 
net interest margin is the ratio of net interest income to total average interest earning assets and is influenced by the relative level of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
average balances and average rates earned and paid 
the following table shows average balances and interest income or interest expense  with the resulting average yield or rates by category of earning assets or interest bearing liabilities table year ended december  year ended december  interest average interest average average income or yields or average income or yields or dollars in thousands balance expense rates balance expense rates interest earning assets loans investment securities taxable securities nontaxable securities total investment securities interest earning balances due from banks federal funds sold total interest earning assets non interest earning assets total assets interest bearing liabilities interest bearing checking and savings accounts time deposit iras borrowed funds total interest bearing liabilities noninterest bearing deposits total deposits and borrowed funds other liabilities total liabilities shareholders equity total liabilities and shareholders equity net interest income taxable equivalent basis net interest income as reported average yield on average earning assets interest expense to average earning assets net interest margin net interest spread

table of contents analysis of changes in interest differential 
the following table shows the dollar amount of the increase decrease in columbia s net interest income and expense and attributes such dollar amounts to changes in volume as well as changes in rates 
rate and volume variances have been allocated proportionally between rate and volume changes table over over over increase decrease due to increase decrease due to increase decrease due to net net net dollars in thousands volume rate change volume rate change volume rate change interest earning assets loans investment securities taxable securities nontaxable securities balances due from banks federal funds sold total interest bearing liabilities interest bearing checking and savings accounts time deposits borrowed funds total net increase decrease in net interest income net interest income on a tax equivalent basis  before provision for loan losses  for the year ended december  was million  an increase of compared to net interest income of million in  an increase of compared to net interest income of million in the overall tax equivalent earning asset yield was in compared to in and in for the same years  rates on interest bearing liabilities were  and  respectively 
net interest spread in was  in it was and in it was 
the net interest spread for year  decreased basis points over year  due in large part to the effect of falling interest rates lowering yields on earning assets and a reduced ability to parallel reductions in deposit rates 
total interest earning assets averaged million for the year ended december   compared to million and million for the corresponding periods in and most of the increase occurred in the loan category 
increases in the loan portfolio are attributed to favorable interest rates and the execution of columbia s strategy to provide personal  quality banking products and services  to hire experienced lending personnel in strategic branch locations and administrative support staff  and to emphasize marketing strategies 
average loans  which generally carry a higher yield than investment securities and other earning assets  comprised of average earning assets during  compared to in and in during the same periods  average yields on loans were in  in  and in average investment securities comprised of average earning assets in  which was down from in and in tax equivalent interest yields on investment securities were for  in and in interest bearing liabilities averaged million for the year ended december   million during the same period in and million during the same period in interest cost  as a percentage of earning assets  decreased to in  compared to in and in the decline in interest cost as a percentage of earning assets resulted from falling interest rates during the previous three years ending deposit rates are near historical low levels 

table of contents provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses represents charges made to earnings to maintain an adequate allowance for loan losses 
the allowance is maintained at an amount management believes to be sufficient to absorb losses in the loan portfolio 
factors considered in establishing an appropriate allowance include a careful assessment of the financial condition of the borrower  a realistic determination of the value and adequacy of underlying collateral  the condition of the local economy and the condition of the specific industry of the borrower  a comprehensive analysis of the levels and trends of loan categories  and  a review of delinquent and classified loans 
columbia applies a systematic process for determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  including an internal loan review function and a quarterly analysis of the adequacy of the allowance 
the quarterly analysis includes determination of specific potential loss factors on individual classified loans  historical potential loss factors derived from actual net charge off experience and trends in nonperforming loans  and potential loss factors for other loan portfolio risks such as loan concentrations  the condition of the local economy  and the nature and volume of loans 
for the year ended december  the allowance for loan losses totaled million  compared to million at december   and million at december  this represents an increase of between and and an increase of between and a more detailed review of the loan loss provision and allowance for loan losses is presented in table the recorded values of loans actually removed from the consolidated balance sheets are referred to as charge offs and  after netting out recoveries on previously charged off loans  become net charge offs 
columbia s policy is to charge off loans when  in management s opinion  the loan or a portion thereof is deemed uncollectible  although concerted efforts are made to maximize recovery after the charge off 
when a provision for loan loss is recorded  the amount is based on past charge off experience  a careful analysis of the current portfolio  and an evaluation of economic trends in columbia s market areas 
management will continue to closely monitor the loan quality of new and existing relationships through stringent review and evaluation procedures and by making loan officers accountable for collection efforts 
for the year ended december   loan charge offs exceeded recoveries by million as compared to and  when loan charge offs exceeded recoveries by  and  respectively 
the increase in loan losses is primarily attributable to the write down of million which is real estate secured 
columbia is working with legal counsel in pursuing a government guarantee  which also supported the outstanding loan balance 
the likelihood of success in receiving funds pursuant to the government guarantee is currently not known 
since this guarantee is in dispute  a million charge off was taken to reduce the loan balance to million as determined by a re appraisal of the real estate that secures the loan 
information currently available to management indicates the carrying value of this loan approximates the fair value of collateral and any additional losses relating to this loan are expected to be negligible 
columbia believes this write down is an unusual or infrequent occurrence 
noninterest income total noninterest income declined from year through year  but increased from year through during the prior three years  noninterest income changed from million in  to million in  and to million in noninterest income is primarily comprised of five categories  service charges and fees  mortgage team net revenues  credit card discounts and fees  crb financial services team financial services team revenues  and other noninterest income 
each of the categories increased during the prior three years  except for mortgage team revenues and other noninterest income 
mortgage team net revenues declined million from to  but increased  from to the increase in mortgage team net revenues during was due to lower amortization expense and valuation write downs of crb s mortgage servicing asset 
management attributes this to a slow down in the prepayment rates in mortgage loans serviced due in large part to the slight increase in the mortgage rate environment 
service charges and fees were million for the year  compared to million for the year  and million for the year the growth in service charges and fees were attributable to growth in deposits and the implementation of an overdraft protection product known as bounce 
the bounce product allows demand deposit customers to overdraw their accounts within a pre established limit for a fee 
the remainder of the increases in noninterest income is primarily attributable to improved revenues and growth received from credit card discounts and fees  financial services fee income and net gains on the sale of investment securities 

table of contents noninterest expense noninterest expenses consist principally of salaries and benefits  occupancy costs  data processing expenses and other noninterest expenses 
a measure of columbia s ability to control noninterest expenses is the efficiency ratio 
for the year ended december   the efficiency ratio was  as compared to in and in the efficiency ratio reflects an improving trend due to growth in revenue from the net interest income and efforts by management to monitor and control overhead expenses 
noninterest expense for was million  as compared to million for and million for the changes in noninterest expense are primarily the result of an increase in occupancy expense  and other noninterest expenses 
the additional increases relate primarily to costs associated with growth in operations and continued investment in technology and communication systems 
income taxes the provision for income taxes was million in  million in and million in the provision resulted in effective combined federal and state tax rates of in  in  and in the effective tax rates differ from combined estimated statutory rates of principally due to the effects of nontaxable interest income  which is recognized for accounting purposes but not for tax purposes

table of contents financial condition investments a year to year comparison shows that columbia s investment securities at december   totaled million  compared to million at december   and million at december  this represents a decrease of between and and a decrease of between and the decrease in the investment portfolio is primarily a function of call provisions that were being exercised during the prior two years of falling interest rates 
for the years ended december   and  no single investment security held by columbia equaled or exceeded of it consolidated shareholders equity 
on december   investments in federal funds sold an overnight investment were million and investments in restricted stock were million 
the balance of federal funds sold is influenced by cash demands  customer deposit levels  loan activity  and other investment transactions 
columbia follows a financial accounting principle which requires that investment securities be identified as held to maturity or available for sale 
held to maturity securities are those that columbia has the intent and ability to hold until they mature or are called 
available for sale securities are those that management may sell if liquidity requirements dictate or if alternative investment opportunities arise 
management determines the mix of available for sale and held to maturity investment securitiesbased on the board of director s asset liability policy  management s assessment of the relative liquidity of columbia  and other factors 
at december   the investment portfolio  excluding restricted equity securities  consisted of available for sale securities and held to maturity securities 
at december   the portfolio consisted of available for sale securities and held to maturity securities 
at december   columbia s investment portfolio  excluding restricted equity securities  consisted of available for sale securities and held to maturity securities 
at december   columbia s investment portfolio had total net unrealized gains of approximately  this compares to net unrealized gains of approximately million at december  and net unrealized gains of  at december  unrealized gains and losses reflect changes in market conditions and do not represent the amount of actual profits or losses 
actual realized gains and losses occur at the time investment securities are sold or called 
federal funds sold are short term investments that mature on a daily basis 
columbia invests in these instruments to provide for additional earnings on excess available cash balances 
because of their short maturities  the balance of federal funds sold fluctuates dramatically on a day to day basis 
the balance on any one day is influenced by cash demands  customer deposit levels  loan activity and other investment transactions 
investments in federal funds sold totaled million at december   compared to million at december   and million at december

table of contents loans columbia s loan policies and procedures establish the basic guidelines governing its lending operations 
generally  the guidelines address the types of loans that it seeks  target markets  underwriting and collateral requirements  terms  interest rate and yield considerations  and compliance with laws and regulations 
all loans or credit lines are subject to approval procedures and amount limitations 
these limitations apply to the borrower s total outstanding indebtedness to crb  including the indebtedness of any guarantor 
the policies are reviewed and approved by the board of directors of crb 
bank officers are charged with loan origination in compliance with underwriting standards overseen by the loan administration department and in conformity with established loan policies 
on an annual basis  the board of directors determines the lending authority of the president and the chief credit officer  who then delegate lending authority to other lending officers 
such delegated authority may include authority related to loans  letters of credit  overdrafts  uncollected funds  and such other authority as determined by the board  the president or chief credit officer within their delegated authority 
the chief credit officer has the authority to approve loans up to a lending limit as set by the board of directors 
all loans above the lending limit of the chief credit officer  and up to a certain limit  are reviewed for approval by the president or chief operating officer 
loans  which exceed this limit  are subject to review and approval by the board s loan committee 
all loans approved by the board loan committee are reviewed by the full board at regularly scheduled meetings 
columbia s unsecured legal lending limit was million and its real estate secured lending limit was million at december  columbia seldom makes loans for an amount approaching its legal lending limits 
net outstanding loans totaled million at december   representing an increase of million  or compared to million at december  loan commitments grew to million as of december   representing an increase of million  or over year end columbia s net loan portfolio at december   includes loans secured by real estate  commercial loans  agricultural loans  consumer and other loans  deferred loan fees and reserve for loan loss 
the largest category is concentrated in real estate loans 
this is primarily due to the significant growth of mortgage and commercial real estate loan activity 
residential mortgage loans usually are temporarily financed on the balance sheet before being sold to the secondary market 
some commercial loans are secured by real estate  but are used for purposes other than financing the purchase of real property  such as inventory financing and equipment purchases  where real property serves as collateral for the loan

the reserve is an amount that management believes will be adequate to absorb possible losses on existing loans that may become uncollectible  based on evaluations of the collectibility of loans and prior loan loss experience 
management charges loans against the reserve when they determine that the principal or a portion thereof may be uncollectible 
accrual of interest is discontinued on a loan when management believes  after considering economic and business conditions  collection efforts and collateral position that the borrower s financial condition is such that collection of interest is doubtful 
columbia follows guidance from the interagency policy statement issued by the federal financial institutions examination council ffiec regarding allowance for loan and lease losses methodologies 
on a quarterly basis  management determines the appropriate allowance for loan and lease losses using the following three methodologies loss allocation to groups of loans by internal risk grade loss allocation by loan type loss allocation by historical loss percentage management s determination of the adequacy of the reserve is based on an assessment of the risk in the portfolio given the conditions at the time 
this assessment consists of certain loans and leases being evaluated on an individual basis  as well as all loans being categorized based on common credit risk attributes and as a group 
the adequacy of the allowance is monitored on an ongoing basis and is based on management s evaluation of numerous factors 
these factors include the quality of the current loan portfolio  the trend in the loan portfolio s risk ratings  current economic conditions  loan concentrations  loan growth rates  past due and non performing trends  evaluations of specific loss estimates for all 
table of contents significant problem loans  historical charge off and recovery experience and other pertinent information 
the following table shows columbia s loan loss experience for the periods indicated table years ended december  dollars in thousands loans outstanding at end of period  net of unearned loan fees average loans outstanding for the period reserve for loan losses balance  beginning of year loans charged off commercial real estate real estate construction agriculture consumer loans credit card and related accounts total loans charged off recoveries commercial real estate real estate construction agriculture consumer loans credit card and related accounts total recoveries net charge offs provision charged to operations allowance for loan losses balance  end of period ratio of net loans charged off to average loans outstanding ratio of allowance for loan losses to loans at end of period includes loans held for sale 
the adequacy of the reserve for loan losses should be measured in the context of several key ratios the ratio of the reserve to total outstanding loans  the ratio of total nonperforming loans to total loans  and  the ratio of net charge offs to average loans outstanding 
since  columbia s ratio of the reserve for loan losses to total loans has ranged from to 
the amounts provided by these ratios have been sufficient to fund columbia s charge offs  which have not been historically significant  and to provide for potential losses as the loan portfolio has grown 
these ratios have also been consistent with the level of nonperforming loans to total loans 
from december  through december   nonperforming loans to total loans have ranged from a low of to a high of 
this experience tracks with changes in the ratio of the reserve for loan losses to total loans and with the actual balances maintained in the reserve account 
finally  columbia s historical ratio of net charge offs to average outstanding loans illustrates its favorable loan charge off and recovery experience 
from december  through december   net charge offs ranged from to of average loans 
management believes columbia s loan underwriting policies and its loan officers knowledge of their customers are significant contributors to columbia s success in limiting loan losses 
during the year ended december   columbia recognized million in loan losses and  in recoveries for a net charge off of million 
the increase in loan losses is primarily 
table of contents attributable to the write down of million on a single real estate secured loan  the amount of the write down represents the principal amount of the loan less the appraised value of the related collateral 
columbia is working with legal counsel in pursing a government guarantee  which also supported the outstanding loan balance 
the likelihood of success in receiving funds pursuant to the government guarantee is currently not known 
information currently available to management suggests that the carrying value of this loan approximates the fair value of collateral and any additional losses relating to this loan are expected to be negligible 
management believes this write down is an unusual or infrequent occurrence 
aside from this single loan  net charge offs were consistent with columbia s historical experience in view of the growth in its loan portfolio

further  management may place loans that are not contractually past due or that are deemed fully collateralized on nonaccrual status to promote better oversight and review of loan arrangements 
loans on nonaccrual status at december  totaled approximately  compared to  at december  and  at december  the increase in nonaccrual loans is attributable to the single real estate secured loan for million  mentioned above 
management has adopted procedures to identify and monitor loans that have had their original terms restructured to accommodate borrowers financial needs 
loan revisions and modifications are provided to meet the credit needs of borrowers in weakened financial condition and to enhance ultimate collection 
as of december   loans that had been classified as restructured were insignificant and were performing in accordance with their restructured terms 
however  management will continue to monitor restructured loans for any changes or deterioration in performance

trust preferred securities in december  columbia issued million in unsecured subordinated debentures to its wholly owned subsidiary  columbia bancorp trust i 
the interest payments on the subordinated debentures are intended to pass through columbia bancorp trust i to the beneficial owners of the columbia bancorp trust i trust preferred securities 
the subordinated debentures and trust preferred securities have identical rate  terms and conditions variable rates tied to the day libor with a margin of and year maturities 
the trust preferred securities are considered tier i capital for regulatory purposes 
management entered into this transaction in order to repurchase  shares of common stock at a price of in november and maintain regulatory capital within the well capitalized category as defined by the bank s regulators 

table of contents shareholders equity and regulatory capital shareholders equity increased million during shareholders equity at december  was million compared to million at december  this increase reflects net income other and comprehensive income of million and  in exercised stock options 
these additions to equity were partially offset by cash dividends paid or declared of million 
during  columbia s board of directors authorized a program to repurchase shares of columbia s common stock valued at up to million 
columbia has authorized the repurchase program because the board of directors believes in the long term value of columbia s stock  and that such repurchase constitutes a sound investment use of columbia s funds 
during  columbia repurchased  shares valued at  management expects repurchases to continue from time to time until june  the federal reserve board and the federal deposit insurance corporation have established minimum requirements for capital adequacy for financial holding companies and member banks 
the requirements address both risk based capital and leveraged capital 
the regulatory agencies may establish higher minimum requirements if  for example  a corporation has previously received special attention or has a high susceptibility to interest rate risk 
the following reflects columbia s various capital ratios at december   and december   as compared to regulatory minimums for capital adequacy purposes table december  december  regulatory minimum tier i capital total risk based capital leverage ratio liquidity and capital resources columbia s management has adopted policies to help maintain liquidity so that we may respond to changes in the financial environment and ensure sufficient funds are available to meet our anticipated cash demands  which ordinarily come from customers needs for borrowing and deposit withdrawals 
generally  columbia s major sources of liquidity are customer deposits  sales and maturities of investment securities  and net cash provided by operating activities 
from time to time  columbia also may draw upon credit lines with the federal home loan bank of seattle and correspondent banks  as well as brokered certificates of deposit 
scheduled loan repayments are a relatively stable source of funds  while deposit inflows and unscheduled loan prepayments are not as stable because they are influenced by general interest rate levels  competing interest rates available on other investments  market competition  economic conditions and other factors 
liquid asset balances include cash  amounts due from other banks  federal funds sold and securities available for sale and securities held to maturity with maturities occurring within three months 
at december  these liquid assets totaled million or of total assets  as compared to million or of total assets at december  the total liquid assets of million or of total assets as of december  compare to million or of total assets at december  as of december  and  unused and available lines of credit totaled million and million  respectively 
liquidity was stable during the year as a result of steady deposit growth 
the analysis of liquidity also includes a review of the changes that appear in the consolidated statements of cash flows for the year ended december  the statement of cash flows includes operating  investing  and financing categories 
operating activities include net income of million  which is adjusted for non cash items and increases or decreases in cash due to changes in certain assets and liabilities 
investing activities consist primarily of both proceeds from and purchases of securities and the impact of the net growth in loans 
financing activities present the cash flows associated with deposit accounts and reflect various transactions with shareholders 

table of contents at december   columbia had outstanding unfunded lending commitments of million 
nearly all of these commitments represented unused portions of commitments to extend credit to businesses  credit lines available to consumers under credit card and other arrangements and commercial and standby letters of credit 
many of these credit lines will not be fully drawn upon and  accordingly  the aggregate commitments do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
management believes that columbia s sources of liquidity are sufficient to meet likely calls on outstanding commitments  although there can be no assurance in this regard 
business segment information columbia derives revenues from two primary business segments  community banking and mortgage banking 
the following table presents financial information about each of these business segments for the three most recent fiscal years 
table community mortgage dollars in thousands banking banking consolidated december  net interest income before provision for loan losses noninterest income amortization of the mortgage servicing asset impairment of mortgage servicing asset salaries and benefits occupancy expense  excluding depreciation depreciation other noninterest expenses income before provision for income taxes total assets december  net interest income before provision for loan losses noninterest income amortization of the mortgage servicing asset impairment of mortgage servicing asset salaries and benefits occupancy expense  excluding depreciation depreciation other noninterest expenses income before provision for income taxes total assets december  net interest income before provision for loan losses noninterest income amortization of the mortgage servicing asset impairment of mortgage servicing asset salaries and benefits occupancy expense  excluding depreciation depreciation goodwill amortization other noninterest expenses income before provision for income taxes total assets 
table of contents the mortgage team has decreased total assets over the last year to million at year end assets were million and million for years ending and  respectively 
assets of the mortgage team are primarily comprised of real estate loans in the portfolio  real estate loans held for sale  mortgage servicing asset  accrued interest receivable  and furniture and equipment 
the mortgage servicing asset as of december   and  was valued at million  million and million  respectively 
crb uses a qualified independent third party to value the mortgage service asset msa in accordance with statement of accounting standard sfas  accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities 
a qualified independent third party measures the msa using information obtained from knowledge of the secondary servicing market and assesses current transaction values between willing parties 
the techniques used in valuing the msa incorporate assumptions relative to prevailing conditions in the secondary servicing market 
the assumptions used for valuing the msa are gathered from near term transactions and include prepayment speed forecasts  market discount rates  earning rates  servicing costs  acquisition costs and ancillary income 
the mortgage servicing asset is amortized in proportion to and over the period of the estimated life of the net servicing income 
in  the mortgage team recorded a loss before income taxes of  a loss for the year ended december  was million  income of million was recognized in the mortgage team s earnings in and were negatively impacted by higher mortgage servicing asset amortization and valuation write downs 
this was caused by the prevailing low mortgage interest rate environment present during the last three years  which motivated a record number of borrowers to refinance their mortgage loans 
because borrowers refinance their mortgage loans or pay them off early  amortization expense is adjusted to properly match the estimated period of the outstanding net servicing income 
in addition  the mortgage servicing asset is periodically valued based on a fair value assessment as measured by a qualified and independent entity with access and knowledge of current servicing portfolio transaction values 
during the previous three years ending december   net valuation write downs were assessed upon the mortgage servicing asset  resulting in corresponding charges to the income statement in the amounts of  million and  respectively 
inflation at this time  management does not consider the long term effects of inflation  as measured by the consumer price index  will be material to columbia s financial position and results of operations 
off balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of business  columbia utilizes financial instruments with off balance sheet risk to meet the financing needs of its customers  including loan commitments to extend credit  commercial letters of credit  standby letters of credit  unused portions of visa credit cards  and commitments to fund mortgage loans 
the increase in off balance sheet items has occurred during the last three years as a result of growth in the loan portfolio 
the table below sets forth the distribution of columbia s contingent liabilities by off balance sheet type 
commitments to extend credit increased primarily due to growth and expansion of commercial real estate construction lending from our deschutes county trade area

derivative management the mortgage team has accepted loan applications that often did not fund and close for to days 
during this time  the loan has been considered to be in the open mortgage pipeline 
once the loan was either funded or closed  it was then removed from the open mortgage pipeline 
the loans that comprise the open mortgage pipeline have been price locked to the borrower  therefore  interest rate fluctuations may result in gains and or losses from the sale of loans to the secondary market 
the risk of price fluctuations to the open mortgage pipeline is managed by the use of derivative forward contracts and put options 
the underlying securities of the derivatives are mortgage backed securities  which generally correspond with the composition of the open mortgage pipeline 
the structure of the derivatives is intended to serve as a hedge against the impact of rising and falling interest rates 
the gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk is recognized in earnings in the same period  as required by statement of financial standards sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
however  during the fourth quarter of  the mortgage team discontinued the practice of using derivative instruments to hedge the open mortgage pipeline 
therefore  as of december   there were no outstanding derivatives in use for managing interest rate risk in the pipeline 
the mortgage team instituted a new practice of locking mortgage loan applicants using a method known as best efforts 
the method of selling best efforts involves the sale of mortgage loans to third party investors at a committed loan rate and loan amount within a predetermined time period without risk of a penalty for failure to deliver the locked mortgage loans 
the benefit to columbia is that it shifts the interest rate risk to the investor and eliminates the need to use derivatives for managing interest rate risk  but it does have the effect of lowering the amount of service release mortgage premium income 
management determined it is in columbia s best interests to accept the lower income for a reduction in interest rate risk exposure 
this strategy will be evaluated on a periodic basis and may change as information becomes available and or personnel are hired with specialized skills to effectively manage the interest rate risk exposure from secondary marketing activity 
recently issued accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
this statement establishes standards regarding classification and measurement of certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
it requires financial instruments within the scope of this statement to be classified as liabilities or an asset in some circumstances 
many of these financial instruments were previously classified as equity 
this statement is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and was otherwise effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  for financial instruments created before the issuance date of this statement and still existing at the beginning of the interim period of adoption  transition is achieved by reporting the cumulative effect of a change in an accounting principle by initially measuring the financial instruments at fair value 
columbia s management does not expect that the application of the provisions of this statement will have a material impact on columbia s consolidated financial statements 

table of contents in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement amends and clarifies financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
columbia s management does not expect that the application of the provisions of this statement will have a material impact on columbia s consolidated financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities 
this interpretation clarifies the application of accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements  and requires existing unconsolidated variable interest entities to be consolidated by their primary beneficiaries if the entities do not effectively disperse risks among parties involved 
this interpretation explains how to identify variable interest entities and how an enterprise assesses its interests in a variable interest entity to decide whether to consolidate that entity 
in december  fasb made revisions and delayed implementation of certain provisions of fin as a public entity that is not a small business issuer  columbia is now required to apply fin to all unconsolidated variable interest entities no later than march   with the exception of unconsolidated special purpose entities  which had an implementation deadline of december  special purpose entities for this provision are expected to include entities whose activities are primarily related to securitizations or other forms of asset backed financings or single lessee leasing arrangements 
columbia s management does not expect that the application of the provisions of this interpretation will have a material impact on columbia s consolidated financial statements 
factors that may affect future results of operations our past experience may not be indicative of future performance  and as noted elsewhere in this report  management has included forward looking statements about our business  plans and prospects that are subject to change 
in addition to the other risks or uncertainties contained in this report  the following risks may affect our operating results  financial condition and cash flows 
if any of these risks occur  either alone or in combination with other factors  our business  financial condition or operating results could be adversely affected 
moreover  readers should note that this is not an exhaustive list of the risks we face  some risks are unknown or not quantifiable  and other risks that we currently perceive as immaterial may ultimately prove more significant than we expect 
you should therefore not construe our statements about plans  predictions or expectations to be assurances of performance or promises to take a given course of action 
adequacy of loan loss allowance 
we have established a reserve for probable losses management expects in connection with loans in our credit portfolio 
this allowance reflects management s estimates of the collectibility of certain identified loans  as well as an overall risk assessment of our total loans outstanding 
management s determination of the amount of our loan loss allowance is highly subjective  although management personnel apply criteria such as risk ratings and historical loss rates  these factors may not be adequate predictors of future loan performance 
accordingly  we cannot offer assurances that management s estimates ultimately will prove correct or that the loan loss allowance will be sufficient to protect against losses that ultimately may occur 
if our loan loss allowance proves to be inadequate  we may suffer unexpected charges to income  which would adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition 
moreover  bank regulators frequently monitor banks loan loss allowances  and if regulators were to determine that our allowance is inadequate  they may require us to increase the allowance  which also would adversely impact our revenues and financial condition 
valuation of the mortgage servicing asset 
we include on our balance sheet an asset that is largely influenced by the net present value of expected net servicing income  which is generated from mortgages originated and sold in the secondary market 
this valuation reflects certain assumptions about net service fee income  servicing costs  prospective interest rates  real estate markets  rates of debt retirement  and other factors relating to the length of time during which those revenues can be expected to continue 
the estimates and assumptions used in valuing the mortgage servicing asset are determined by a qualified independent third party 
the qualified independent third party measures the value of the mortgage service asset based on assumptions influenced by current market conditions and near term transactions  which are likely to cause the value of the mortgage servicing asset to fluctuate 
therefore  potential valuation adjustments  which are charged against or credited to current income  may have a material adverse impact on revenues for the periods in which adjustments occur 

table of contents growth and management 
our financial performance and profitability will depend on our ability to manage recent and possible future growth 
although management believes that it has substantially integrated the business and operations of past acquisitions  there can be no assurance that unforeseen issues relating to the acquisitions will not adversely affect us 
in addition  any future acquisitions and continued growth may present operating and other problems that could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that we will be able to execute our growth strategy or maintain the level of profitability that we have experienced 
changes in market interest rates 
our earnings are impacted by changing interest rates 
changes in interest rates affect the demand for new loans  the credit profile of existing loans  the rates received on loans and securities  and rates paid on deposits and borrowings 
the relationship between the rates received on loans and securities and the rates paid on deposits and borrowings is known as interest rate spread 
given our current volume and mix of interest bearing liabilities and interest earning assets  our interest rate spread could be expected to increase during times of rapidly rising interest rates and  conversely  to decline during times of falling interest rates 
however  due to the fact that approximately one third of columbia s loans are on rate floors it will take approximately an basis point rise in market rates before the net interest spread will improve 
exposure to interest rate risk is managed by monitoring the re pricing frequency of crb s rate sensitive assets and rate sensitive liabilities over any given period 
although we believe our current level of interest rate sensitivity is reasonable  significant fluctuations in interest rates may have an adverse affect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
geographic concentration 
substantially all of our business is derived from a nine county area in central  north central and northeastern oregon and south central washington 
these areas are not extensively populated  and rely primarily upon the agricultural  electrical power generation and transportation markets for their economic success 
while management has planned columbia s expansion strategy in part as a means to diversify the geographic concentration of our business  our business is and will remain sensitive to economic factors that relate to these industries and local and regional business conditions 
as a result  local or regional economic downturns  or downturns that disproportionately affect one or more of our region s key industries  may have a more pronounced effect upon our business than they might on an institution that is a less geographically concentrated 
the extent of the future impact of these events on economic and business conditions cannot be predicted  however  prolonged or acute fluctuations could have a material and adverse impact upon our results of operation and financial condition 
regulation 
we are subject to government regulation that could limit or restrict our activities  which in turn could adversely impact our operations 
the financial services industry is regulated extensively 
federal and state regulation is designed primarily to protect the deposit insurance funds and consumers  and not to benefit our shareholders 
these regulations can sometimes impose significant limitations on our operations 
in addition  these regulations are constantly evolving and may change significantly over time 
significant new laws or changes in existing laws or repeal of existing laws may cause our results to differ materially 
further  federal monetary policy  particularly as implemented through the federal reserve system  can significantly affect credit conditions for us 
competition 
competition may adversely affect our performance 
the financial services business in our market areas is highly competitive 
it is becoming increasingly competitive due to changes in regulation  technological advances  and the accelerating pace of consolidation among financial services providers 
we face competition both in attracting deposits and in making loans 
we compete for loans principally through the interest rates and loan fees we charge and the efficiency and quality of services we provide 
increasing levels of competition in the banking and financial services industries may reduce our market share or cause the prices we charge for our services to fall 
our results may differ in future periods depending upon the nature or level of competition 
credit risk 
a source of risk arises from the possibility that losses will be sustained if a significant number of our borrowers  guarantors and related parties fail to perform in accordance with the terms of their loans 
we have adopted underwriting and credit monitoring procedures and credit policies  including the establishment and review of the allowance for credit losses  that management believes are appropriate to minimize this risk by assessing the likelihood of nonperformance  tracking loan performance and diversifying our credit portfolio 
these policies and procedures  however  may not prevent unexpected losses that could materially affect our results of operations 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk management in the banking industry  a major risk involves changing interest rates  which can have a significant impact on columbia s profitability 
columbia manages its exposure to changes in interest rates through asset and liability management activities within the guidelines established by its asset liability committee alco 
alco has the responsibility for approving and ensuring compliance with asset liability management policies  including interest rate risk exposure  capital position  liquidity management and the investment portfolio 
reports prepared by alco are provided to the board of directors on a regular basis 
asset liability management simulation models are used to measure interest rate risk 
the models quantify interest rate risk through simulating forecasted net interest income and economic value of equity over a month time horizon under various rate scenarios 
the economic value of equity is defined as the difference between the market value of current assets less the market value liabilities 
by measuring the change in the present value of equity under different rate scenarios  management is able to identify interest rate risk that may not be evident in simulating changes in the forecasted net interest income 
table below shows the simulated percentage change in forecasted net interest income and the economic value of equity based on changes in the interest rate environment 
the change in interest rates assumes an immediate  parallel and sustained shift in the base interest rate forecast 
through these simulations  management estimates the impact on net interest income and present value of equity based on a and basis point upward and downward gradual change of market interest rates over a one year period 
the analysis did not allow rates to fall below zero 
table percent change percent change in net interest in present value change in interest rates income of equity basis points basis points basis points basis points as illustrated in the above table  our balance sheet is currently asset sensitive  meaning that interest earning assets mature or reprice more quickly than interest bearing liabilities in a given period 
therefore  according to the model  net interest income should increase slightly when rates increase and shrink somewhat when rates fall 
this is primarily a result of the concentration of variable rate and short term commercial loans in columbia s portfolio 
the simulation model does not take into account future management actions that could be undertaken  should a change occur in actual market interest rates 
also  certain assumptions underlie modeling simulation results and these assumptions may have significant impact on the results 
these include assumptions regarding the level of interest rates and balance changes of deposit products that do not have stated maturities 
these assumptions have been developed through a combination of industry standards and expected pricing behavior in the future 
the model also includes assumptions about changes in the composition or mix of the balance sheet 
the results derived from the simulation model could vary significantly due to external factors such as changes in prepayment assumptions  early withdrawals of deposits and unforeseen competitive factors 
mortgage servicing asset the mortgage team has recorded a mortgage servicing asset msa that contains risk due to loan prepayments 
the value of the msa will likely decline when interest rates fall due to an increase in loan prepayments 
the msa is measured on a quarterly basis by a qualified independent entity with access and knowledge of current servicing transaction values between willing parties 
the techniques used in valuing the msa incorporate assumptions relative to prevailing conditions in the secondary servicing market 
the assumptions used for valuing the msa are gathered from near term transactions and include prepayment speed forecasts  market discount rates  earning rates  servicing costs  acquisition 
table of contents costs and ancillary income 
a decrease in the value of the msa is recorded as a valuation write down adjustment 
however  actual fair values may differ from the measured valuation due to limitations in available third party market quotations and assumptions 
the value of the mortgage servicing asset is interest rate sensitive and may require quarterly valuation adjustments during if mortgage interest rates decline further from levels experienced during however  if mortgage rates were to increase in  management would expect the mortgage servicing asset value to stabilize and may in some instances be increased 
in this instance  the monthly mortgage servicing asset amortization expense would be adjusted to meet the expected remaining life of the outstanding net servicing income
