the company records an investment impairment charge when it believes an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than is temporary 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investment that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event that the company were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase net income in the period such determination was made

 consolidation of variable interest entities  and subsequently revised the interpretation in december fin r 
this interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements  addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities  which have certain characteristics 
as revised  fin r is now generally effective for financial statements for interim or annual periods ending on or after march  we have no identified any variable interest entities 
in the event a variable interest entity is identified  we do not expect the requirements of fin r to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity  sfas which establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope  which may have previously been reported as equity  as a liability or an asset in some circumstances 
this statement is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  for public companies 
the adoption of sfas no did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in july  an issue was bought before the financial accounting standards board regarding whether or not sontract based oil and gas mineral rights held by lease or contact mineral rights should be recorded or disclosed as intangible assets 
the issue presents a view that these mineral rights are classified assests as defined in sfas no 
 business combinations  and therefore  should be classified separately on the balance sheet as intangible assets 
sfas no 
and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  became effective for transactions subsquent to june   with the disclosure requirments of sfas no 
required as of january  sfas no 
requires that all business combinations initiated after june  be accounted for using the purchase method and that intangible assets be disaggregated and reported separately from goodwill sfas no 
established new accounting guidelines for both finite lived intangible assets and indefinite lived intangible assets 
under the statement  intangible assets should be separately reported on the face of the balance sheet and accompanied by disclosure in the notes to financial statements 
sfas no 
does not apply to accounting utilized by the oil and gas industry as prescribed by sfas no 
 and is silent about whether ot not its disclosure provisions apply to oil and gas mineral rights to an upcoming agenda  which may result in a change in how isramco classifies these assets 
should such a change be required the amounts related to business combinations and major asset purchases that would be classified as intangible mineral interest are estimated to be  as of december  and  as december  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk  including adverse changes in commodity prices 
the company produces and sells natural gas and crude oil 
as a result  the company s financial results can be significantly affected if these commodity prices fluctuate widely in response to changing market forces
