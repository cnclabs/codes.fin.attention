executive overview watson wyatt company holdings is a global provider of human capital consulting services 
we provide services in three principal practice areas benefits  technology solutions and human capital consulting  operating from offices in countries throughout north america  asia pacific and latin america 
we also operate through our affiliates in europe watson wyatt llp which conducts operations in the united kingdom and ireland and in which we hold a percent interest in a defined distribution pool and watson wyatt company holdings europe limited  a holding company through which we conduct continental european operations 
we own percent of watson wyatt company holdings europe limited and watson wyatt llp owns the remaining percent 
we collectively market our services globally under the watson wyatt worldwide brand  sharing resources  technologies  processes and business referrals with our alliance partners 
we design  develop and implement hr strategies and programs through the following closely interrelated practice areas benefits group the benefits group  accounting for percent of our fiscal year revenues  is the foundation of our business 
retirement  the core of our benefits business  is less impacted by discretionary spending reductions than our other segments  mainly due to the recurring nature of many projects 
our corporate client retention rate within this group has remained very high  averaging over percent over the past two years 
revenue for our retirement practice is seasonal  with the third and fourth quarters of each fiscal year being the busier periods 
major revenue growth drivers in this practice include changes in regulations  particularly those affecting pension plans  leverage from other practices  an improving economy  increased global demand and increased market share 
technology solutions group our technology solutions group  accounting for percent of our fiscal year revenues  provides information technology services to our customers 
in fiscal year  delays in discretionary technology spending resulted in lower revenues  but the backlog of work  which is a fairly accurate indicator of future revenues  has improved over the past two quarters 
we are seeing particular acceptance of our scalable benefits administration solutions as an alternative to total business process outsourcing 
enhancing our applications and leveraging our other segments are vital to our growth strategy 
human capital group our human capital group  accounting for percent of our fiscal year revenues  generally encompasses short term projects and as a result is most sensitive to economic conditions 
growth slowed significantly in the second half of fiscal year and continued to contract in fiscal years  and presently  our executive compensation area is seeing vigorous demand in response to issues related to stock compensation programs and changes resulting from new accounting rules  but this increase is offset by weak demand for broad based talent management consulting 
in the short term  our revenues are driven by many factors including the general state of the economy and the resulting level of discretionary spending by our clients  the ability of our consultants to attract new clients or cross sell to existing clients  and the impact of new regulations in the legal and accounting fields that most recently increased demand for our executive compensation and benefits practices 
during fiscal year  we continued to add new target market clients  and grew revenues from existing clients 
the human resources consulting industry  although highly fragmented  is highly competitive and is comprised of major human capital consulting firms  specialist firms  consulting arms of accounting firms and information technology consulting firms 
our overall revenues have been flat over the past three years  and it is clear that the competitive environment will remain challenging until the economy rebounds and companies are committed to spending on human capital projects 
to mitigate the pressures faced by the economic downturn  we have successfully managed costs throughout the company by leveraging our variable compensation cost structure  initiating targeted job reductions and controlling discretionary spending 
we believe we are well positioned to take advantage of an improvement in the overall economy 
in the long term  we believe that benefits spending will continue to be the largest component of us corporate spending 
we believe that the aging workforce  the projected shortfall in workers over the next decade and changing regulations will translate into opportunities for us 
we believe that the company s financial results will depend in large part upon how well we succeed in deepening our existing client relationships through thought leadership and focus on cross practice solutions  actively pursuing new clients in our target markets  cross selling and strategic acquisitions 
we believe that our highly fragmented industry represents tremendous growth opportunities for us  because we are the only firm to offer a comprehensive line of benefits and human capital consulting as well as strategic technology solutions 
financial statement overview the financial statements contained in this annual report on form k reflect consolidated balance sheets as of june  and  consolidated statements of operations for the month periods ended june   and  consolidated statements of cash flows for the month periods ended june   and  and a consolidated statement of changes in stockholders equity for the month periods ended june   and we operate globally as an alliance with our affiliates 
however  the revenues and operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations only reflect the results of operations of watson wyatt company holdings 
our share of the results of our affiliates  recorded using the equity method of accounting  is reflected in the income from affiliates line 
our affiliates are watson wyatt llp  watson wyatt holdings europe limited and professional consultants insurance company  inc pcic  our captive insurance company 
we derive substantially all of our revenue from fees for consulting services  which generally are billed at standard hourly rates or on a fixed fee basis 
clients are typically invoiced on a monthly basis with revenue recognized as services are performed 
for the most recent three fiscal years  revenue from us consulting operations has comprised approximately percent of consolidated revenue 
no single client accounted for more than four percent of our consolidated revenue for any of the most recent three fiscal years 
in delivering consulting services  our principal direct expenses relate to compensation of personnel 
salaries and employee benefits are comprised of wages paid to associates  related taxes  benefit expenses such as pension  medical and insurance costs and fiscal year end incentive bonuses 
professional and subcontracted services represent fees paid to external service providers for employment  marketing and other services 
for the most recent three fiscal years  approximately percent of these professional and subcontracted services were directly incurred on behalf of our clients and were reimbursed by them  with such reimbursements being included in revenue 
occupancy  communications and other expenses represent expenses for rent  utilities  supplies and telephone to operate office locations as well as non client reimbursed travel by associates  publications and professional development 
general and administrative expenses include the operational costs and professional fees paid by corporate management  general counsel  marketing  human resources  finance  research and technology support 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
our estimates  judgments and assumptions are continually evaluated based on available information and experience 
because of the use of estimates inherent in the financial reporting process  actual results could differ from those estimates 
the accounting policies discussed below are critical to the understanding of the use of estimates in the company s financial statements 
revenue recognition revenue includes fees primarily generated from consulting services provided in the areas of employee benefits  human capital strategies and related technology solutions 
we recognize revenue from these consulting engagements either on a time and materials basis or on a fixed fee basis  depending on the terms and conditions defined at the inception of an engagement with a client 
revenue is recognized on time and materials engagements based on billable rates times hours worked plus expenses incurred 
for fixed fee arrangements  revenue is also recognized based on billable rates times hours worked plus expenses incurred 
however  for significant fixed fee engagements in our technology solutions group  we periodically review ongoing engagements through the preparation of an estimate to complete 
revenue recognition for fixed fee engagements is affected by a number of factors that change the estimated amount of work required to complete the project such as changes in scope  the staffing on the engagement and or the level of client participation 
these periodic engagement reviews require us to make judgments and estimates regarding the overall profitability and stage of project completion which  in turn  affect how we recognize revenue 
the company recognizes a loss on an engagement when estimated revenue to be received for that engagement is less than the total estimated direct and indirect costs associated with the engagement 
losses are recognized in the period in which the loss becomes probable and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable 
the company has developed various software programs and technologies that we provide to clients in connection with consulting services 
in most instances  such software is hosted and maintained by the company 
software developed to be utilized in providing services to a client  but for which the client does not have the contractual right to take possession  is capitalized in accordance with the aicpa s statement of position accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
revenue associated with the related contract  together with amortization of the related capitalized software  is recognized over the service period 
revenue recognized in excess of billings is recorded as unbilled accounts receivable 
cash collections and invoices generated in excess of revenue recognized are recorded as deferred revenue until the revenue recognition criteria are met 
client reimbursable expenses  including those relating to travel  other out of pocket expenses and any third party costs  are included in revenue  and an equivalent amount of reimbursable expenses are included in professional and subcontracted services as a cost of revenue 
in december  the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition  which supercedes staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition in financial statements 
the primary purpose of sab is to rescind accounting guidance contained in sab related to multiple element revenue arrangements  superceded as a result of the issuance of eitf while the wording of sab has changed to reflect the issuance of eitf  the revenue recognition principles of sab remain largely unchanged by the issuance of sab the issuance of sab has not had an effect on our revenue recognition policies as they are in accordance with sab valuation of billed and unbilled receivables from clients we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts to reflect estimated losses resulting from our clients failure to pay for our services after the services have been rendered  including allowances when customer disputes may exist 
the related provision is recorded as a reduction to revenue 
our allowance policy is based on the aging of our billed and unbilled client receivables and has been developed based on our write off history 
facts and circumstances such as the average length of time the receivables are past due  general market conditions  current economic trends and our clients ability to pay may cause fluctuations in our valuation of billed and unbilled receivables 
discretionary compensation the company s compensation program includes a discretionary annual bonus that is determined by management and paid once per fiscal year in the form of cash and or deferred stock units after the company s annual operating results are finalized 
an estimated annual bonus amount is initially developed at the beginning of each fiscal year in conjunction with our budgeting process 
quarterly  estimated annual operating performance is reviewed by the company and the discretionary annual bonus amount is then adjusted  if necessary  by management to reflect changes in the forecast of pre bonus profitability for the year 
after determining the estimated annual bonus amount  the bonus is then allocated to remaining quarterly reporting periods as a constant percentage of estimated pre bonus profitability 
in those quarters where the estimated annual bonus level changes  the remaining estimated annual bonus is accrued over the remaining quarters as a constant percentage of estimated future pre bonus profitability 
annual bonus levels may vary from current expectations as a result of changes in the company s forecast of pre bonus profitability and competitive employment market conditions 
as a result of a million pre tax non operating gain recorded in the first quarter of fiscal year  the company recorded a million supplemental bonus accrual in the first quarter that is incremental to the company s fiscal year end bonus 
this supplemental bonus amount  which will be paid out in september with the regular bonus cycle  is included in salaries and employee benefits 
management does not expect this charge to recur 
income taxes determining the consolidated provision for income tax expense  deferred tax assets and liabilities and the related valuation allowance involves judgment 
as a global company with offices in countries  we are required to calculate and provide for estimated income tax liabilities for each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating current tax obligations and exposures in each jurisdiction as well as making judgments regarding the future recoverability of deferred tax assets 
tax costs can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve 
changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual pre tax income  limitations on the use of the company s foreign subsidiary losses  changes in tax laws and changes resulting from tax audits can all affect the overall effective income tax rate which  in turn  impacts the overall level of income tax expense and net income 
pension assumptions we sponsor both qualified and non qualified  non contributory defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all of our associates 
under our principal plans united states  canada  hong kong and the united kingdom  benefits are based on our associates years of service and compensation during the five highest paid consecutive years of service 
pension and other postretirement employee benefits opeb costs and obligations are dependent on assumptions used in calculating such amounts 
these assumptions include discount rates  health care cost trend rates  benefits earned  interest cost  expected return on plan assets  mortality rates  and other factors 
in accordance with gaap  actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and  therefore  generally affect recognized expense and the recorded obligation in future periods 
while management believes that the assumptions used are appropriate  differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect watson wyatt company s pension and other postretirement obligations and future expense 
the company has established a discount rate of at year end june   for its u 
s 
pension and opeb plans which represents a basis point increase from the discount rate used for the prior year 
the company s u 
s 
pre tax pension expense is forecasted to decrease from approximately million in fiscal year  excluding any curtailments and settlements  to approximately million in fiscal year due to the approximately fiscal year actual return on assets  a million pension contribution in fiscal year and the increase in the discount rate 
the us opeb plan expense is expected to remain constant at million for fiscal year the expected long term rate of return on assets assumption remained unchanged at percent at the end of fiscal year selection of the percent return assumption was supported by an analysis performed by the company of the weighted average yield expected to be achieved with the anticipated investment allocations 
the investment makeup is heavily weighted towards equities 
the return on assets in fiscal year was percent  compared to a return of percent in fiscal year the following information illustrates the sensitivity to a change in certain assumptions for the u 
s 
pension plans change in assumption effect on fy pre tax pension expense basis point decrease in discount rate million basis point increase in discount rate million basis point decrease in expected return on assets million basis point increase in expected return on assets million the above sensitivities reflect the impact of changing one assumption at a time 
it should be noted that economic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not necessarily linear 
these changes in assumptions would have no effect on the company s funding requirements 
in addition  at june   a basis point decrease in the discount rate would cause the accumulated benefit obligation to exceed the value of plan assets  thereby necessitating the recording of a minimum pension liability 
as a result  we would be required to record an increase in the pension liability of million  a non cash charge to stockholders equity of million and an increase in deferred tax assets of million 
a basis point increase in the discount rate would have no impact on the liability  stockholders equity or deferred tax assets since there is no unfunded accumulated benefit obligation when using either a or discount rate 
the company us other postretirement employee benefits plan is relatively insensitive to discount rate changes due to the plan provisions that have been established to control costs and as such no sensitivity results are shown in this display 
incurred but not reported claims the company uses actuarial assumptions to estimate and record a liability for incurred but not reported ibnr professional liability claims and engaged an external actuarial firm to assist in the calculation of these estimates 
our estimated ibnr liability is based on long term trends and averages  and considers a number of factors  including changes in claim reporting patterns  claim settlement patterns  judicial decisions  and legislation and economic decisions  but excludes the effect of claims data for large cases due to the insufficiency of actual experience with such cases 
management does not currently expect significant fluctuations in the ibnr liability  based on the company s historical claims experience 
however  our estimated ibnr liability will fluctuate if claims experience changes over time

off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations operating leases 
we lease office space  furniture and selected computer equipment under operating lease agreements with terms ranging from one to ten years 
future expected payments are as follows remaining payments due by fiscal year as of june  contractual cash obligations total through through thereafter lease commitments management has determined that there is not a large concentration of leases that will expire in any one fiscal year 
consequently  management anticipates that any increase in future rent expense will be mainly market driven 
on april   the company executed a new lease agreement committing its washington  dc  office  which includes consulting and corporate operations  to move to northern virginia 
the terms of the lease are expected to result in cost savings over the year term 
the company simultaneously provided notice of early termination of its existing washington  dc lease  which resulted in a million charge during the fourth quarter of fiscal year the million charge had no net cash impact on the company because the company will receive a million payment from the new lessor as an incentive to enter into the new lease

credit agreement in june  we reduced the size of our revolving credit facility to million from million in order to better align it with our business needs 
the facility is provided by a syndicate of banks 
interest rates associated with this facility vary with libor and or the prime rate and are based on our leverage ratio  as defined by the credit agreement

no amounts were outstanding under the company s revolving credit facility as of june  or june  credit under the facility is available upon demand  although the credit facility requires us to observe certain covenants including requirements for a fixed coverage charge  cashflow leverage ratio and asset coverage and is collateralized with a pledge of stock of material subsidiaries

the credit facility is scheduled to mature on june  risk management as a part of our overall risk management program  we carry customary commercial insurance policies  including commercial general liability  employment practices liability  and claims made professional liability insurance with a self insured retention of million per claim  which provides coverage for professional liability claims including the cost of defending such claims 
our primary insurance coverage beyond this retention is written by an affiliated captive insurance company owned by us and two other professional services firms 
prior to july   the first million of coverage had a premium structure which provided that the captive insurance company would recover from the firm defending the claim approximately percent of any loss up to million 
the company recorded an accrual for this liability 
this recovery occurred through insurance premium payments in subsequent years 
the remaining percent of any loss up to million was a risk borne by the captive insurance company  which carried reinsurance in the commercial markets for most losses above million 
as of july   pcic has attempted to recover through its premium structure the amounts it expects to pay out for member companies in claims losses  continuing the loss sharing formula whereby of the losses incurred by pcic with respect to each member are incorporated in the member s future premium charges  and will increase such member s premium by approximately a like amount over the next five years 
pcic now bases premium calculations  which are determined annually based on experience through march of each year  on relative risk of the various lines of business performed by each of the owner companies  past claim experience of each owner company  growth of each of those companies  industry risk profiles in general and the overall insurance markets 
as of july   the captive insurance company carries reinsurance for a substantial portion of losses above million 
our agreements with pcic could require additional payments to pcic in the event that the company decided to exit pcic and adverse claims significantly exceed prior expectations 
if these circumstances were to occur  the company would record a liability at the time it becomes estimable and probable 
the company will continue to provide for the self insured retention where specific estimated losses for known claims in excess of million are considered probable and reasonably estimable 
although the company maintains professional liability insurance coverage  this insurance does not cover claims made after expiration of our current insurance contracts 
generally accepted accounting principles require that we record a liability for incurred but not reported ibnr professional liability claims if they are estimable and probable  and for which we have not yet contracted for insurance coverage 
the company uses actuarial assumptions to estimate and record its ibnr liability and has a million ibnr liability recorded as of june  current insurance market conditions for our industry include increases in overall premium cost  higher self insured retentions and reductions in aggregate excess coverages  trends that are anticipated to continue 
we expect these trends to be reflected in our future annual insurance renewals and  as a result  we will continue to assess our ability to secure future insurance coverage 
in anticipation of the possibility of future reductions in risk transfer from pcic to reinsurers  as well as the trend toward a generally hardening insurance market  the firms that own pcic  including the company  increased pcic s capital in fiscal years and no capital contribution was provided during fiscal year in light of increasing worldwide litigation  including litigation against professionals  the company has been implementing a requirement that all client relationships be documented by engagement letters containing specific risk mitigation clauses that were not included in all historical client agreements 
nearly percent of the company s us corporate clients have signed engagement letters including mitigation clauses  and initiatives to complete that process both in the united states and elsewhere are underway 
the company has disengaged from certain client relationships where satisfactory engagement terms could not be achieved
