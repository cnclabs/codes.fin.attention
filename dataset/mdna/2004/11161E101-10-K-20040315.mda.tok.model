item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
you should read the following discussion and analysis along with our consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements included elsewhere in this report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements as a result of various factors including the risks discussed in factors that may affect our future results below and elsewhere in this report 
overview corvis corporation operates two divisions that serve different elements within the communications industry 
our communications services division  acquired on june  and managed within our broadwing communications  llc subsidiary broadwing  delivers data and internet  broadband transport and voice communications services nationwide 
our equipment division designs  manufactures and sells high performance all optical and electrical optical communications systems that we believe accelerate carrier revenue opportunities and lower the overall cost of network ownership for carriers 
until the broadwing acquisition  the corvis equipment division was the primary focus of our capital investment and the sole source of our revenues 
due to significant declines in the opportunities within the communications equipment market  the communications services division is now our major focus of capital investment for the company 
revenues from the communications services division will account for most of corvis revenues for the foreseeable future 
reflecting our realigned business focus  the communications services division comprised of total revenue for fiscal year  while the remaining is attributable to equipment sales 
our equipment division has been restructured through staff reductions and other consolidation efforts that were completed in late the full effect of these cost reductions will be reflected starting in our equipment division continues to service the networks of our existing customers  maintains certain centralized business operations and supports our broadwing network 
because our consolidated results of operations only include the results of broadwing since the acquisition date  the consolidated results of operations are not comparable to prior or future years 
communications services on february   we entered into an agreement to invest approximately million  including acquisition costs  for most of the assets and certain of the liabilities of broadwing communications services  inc this purchase price was subject to a pre closing reduction of up to million if broadwing communications services  inc failed to reach certain revenue and ebitda targets it had established  and a post closing reduction of an additional million if certain ebitda targets were not reached in a one year period after the closing 
the agreement also committed broadwing communications services  inc to make capital expenditures of million each month  consistent with its financial plan 
on june   the parties agreed to reduce the purchase price by million due to failure to meet the revenue target and by an additional million for failure to achieve the targeted reduction in negative cash ebitda  as defined in the agreement 
an additional reduction in the purchase price of approximately million was negotiated to reflect the seller s desire to forego making additional required capital expenditures  such as equipment and network upgrades  and to accelerate the closing of the transaction 
these reductions reduced the purchase price to million  including acquisition costs 
the broadwing acquisition closed on june  subsequently in november  the parties agreed on an additional post closing reduction in the purchase price to million  as negotiated pursuant to working capital and receivable adjustment obligations set forth in the agreement 
broadwing provides communications services to large enterprises  mid market business and other communications service provider customers over a a nationwide facilities based network connecting cities nationwide 
we believe that broadwing s network and growth oriented strategy will enable broadwing to compete effectively in the markets in which it operates 
broadwing s optical network  capable of transmitting up to gbs per fiber  gives customers the benefit of high quality  technologically advanced solutions allowing for rapid provisioning  and highly flexible customized networking 
at the date of acquisition  corvis owned a interest and appointed of the board members of a holding company  which in turn owned broading communications  llc 
cequel iii  llc cequel contributed approximately million for a ownership interest 
table of contents and the ability to appoint of the holding company board members 
cincinnati bell  previously the parent company of broadwing communications services  inc  retained a non voting equity interest 
in addition  we entered into a management services agreement with cequel under which cequel would manage broadwing 
on november   we acquired cequel s one percent equity stake and additional interests in broadwing and terminated our management services agreement in exchange for a combination of cash and corvis equity 
in addition  we entered into a new master network services agreement to provide cequel services at prices ranging from cost reimbursement to current market pricing 
as a result of this agreement  we recorded restructuring charges of million in the fourth quarter of the broadwing purchase price has been allocated to the assets and liabilities acquired on a preliminary basis and may change as additional information becomes available 
the following table summarizes the preliminary purchase price allocation in thousands 
current assets property plant and equipment intangible assets other long term assets total assets acquired current liabilities long term liabilities total liabilities assumed minority interest purchase price as part of the acquisition  the company reduced its warranty reserve for that portion associated with previous equipment sales to broadwing 
in february  corvis signed an agreement to acquire focal communications corporation focal  a chicago based competitive local exchange carrier that provides voice and data solutions to enterprises  carriers and resellers for total consideration of million  which will be comprised of approximately million in equity to be issued to focal s equity holders and the assumption or payment of approximately million of focal s existing debt and other long term capital lease obligations 
focal operates in tier markets from boston to miami and new york to los angeles  owns metro fiber footprint in nine tier national markets and maintains a  enterprise and wholesale carrier customer base 
corvis equipment starting in and continuing through  conditions within the general economy and communications sector in particular have resulted in reduced capital expenditures by carriers and a reduced demand for communications networking systems 
these declines have had a severe adverse impact on our equipment revenue and results of operations 
we cannot predict when or if market conditions will improve 
in response to these conditions  we have implemented a series of restructuring initiatives within our equipment division designed to decrease our business expenses and to conserve our resources 
these actions included staff reductions  facility consolidations and the curtailment of discretionary spending 
these restructuring plans have been reflected in our results of operations in  and these plans are ongoing and will be reflected in our results of operations in the next quarter and beyond  as necessary 
our equipment division is now focused strategically on selective engagements with customers  including the us government  servicing the networks of our existing customers  maintaining certain centralized business operations and supporting the broadwing network 
in  prior to the acquisition  broadwing communications services  inc agreed to purchase our on products and services as part of a multi year purchase agreement 
since successfully completing field trials in july 
table of contents  broadwing communications services  inc deployed a wide range of our optical networking products  including our all optical switch  to create a national all optical network that has been in service for over three years 
prior to the acquisition  broadwing was our largest customer representing sales of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
as a result of the broadwing acquisition  future equipment revenues from sales to broadwing will be eliminated in the consolidated financial statements 
in  wiltel communications group  inc formerly williams communications  llc accepted a field trial system and agreed to purchase our optical networking products and services as part of a multi year purchase agreement 
wiltel has deployed our integrated switching and transport equipment in their national network  which is currently in service carrying commercial traffic 
revenues attributable to wiltel were million and million in and  respectively 
purchase commitments totaling approximately million remain under the wiltel agreement  however  we are in discussions with wiltel which could result in  among other things  reductions or elimination of this amount 
on april   we reached an agreement with qwest communications corporation qwest modifying the terms of previous agreements to purchase our products and services over a multi year period 
during  we recognized revenue of million under this agreement 
during the fourth quarter of  we reached an agreement with qwest in which qwest would purchase approximately million of our equipment  subject to certain acceptance criteria and would pay million in settlement of all remaining purchase obligations 
we expect to recognize revenue associated with equipment sales to qwest in the first half of in the third quarter of  we created a wholly owned subsidiary  corvis government solutions  inc  to provide optical networking solutions to the us federal government 
during the third quarter of  corvis government solutions secured its first contract and purchase order from the us federal government for a limited field trial  which was accepted in the first quarter of most of our equipment customers have met or are approaching contractual minimum purchase commitments 
we do not expect material sales of our on product in the foreseeable future 
while we do expect sales of our ocs product to the us government and other customers  these sales will likely be at levels that are consistent with activities 
critical accounting policies we have identified the following critical accounting policies that affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
some of these policies were adopted upon the broadwing acquisition 
the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to inventory obsolescence  asset impairment  revenue recognition  product warranty liabilities  allowance for doubtful accounts  and contingencies and litigation 
we state these accounting policies in the notes to annual consolidated financial statements see item and at relevant sections in this discussion and analysis 
these estimates are based on the information that is currently available to us and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could vary from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions and the variances could be material 
revenue recognition communications services 
switched services are billed monthly in arrears  while the revenue is recognized as the services are provided 
customers are billed in advance for month to month dedicated network services including certain data and broadband transport  while associated revenue is deferred and recognized as the services are provided 
indefeasible right of use  or iru  agreements represent the lease of network capacity or dark fiber and are recorded as deferred revenue at the earlier of the acceptance of the applicable portion of the network by the customer or the receipt of cash 
the buyer of iru services typically pays cash upon execution of the contract  and the associated iru revenue is then recognized over the life of the agreement as services are provided  beginning on the date of customer acceptance 
in the event the buyer of an iru terminates a contract prior to the contract expiration and releases us from the obligation to provide future services  the remaining unamortized deferred revenue is recognized in the period in which the contract is terminated 
fees billed in connection with a service installation are deferred and recognized ratably over estimated contract lives 

table of contents equipment sales and services 
revenue from equipment sales is recognized upon execution of a contract and the completion of all delivery obligations provided that there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance and collectibility is deemed probable 
if uncertainties exist  revenue is recognized when such uncertainties are resolved 
customer contracts generally include extensive lab and field trial testing and some include other acceptance criteria 
allowance for bad debt we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we determine the estimate of the allowance for doubtful accounts based on a variety of factors including the length of time receivables are past due  the financial health of customers  and historical experience 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate or other circumstances occur that result in an impairment of customers ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
asset impairment and other charges reflecting continued unfavorable economic conditions and continued lack of expected equipment sales  our board of directors approved plans from through for the restructuring of equipment division operations including the consolidation of facilities  reduction in the number of employees and the outsourcing of a majority of our manufacturing capabilities 
these decisions  as well as reductions in projected sales and cash flows  have resulted in various asset impairment charges  which are based on recoverability estimates and estimated fair values 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management or if events occur or circumstances change that would reduce the estimated recoverability of our assets  additional restructuring and impairment charges may be required 
intangible assets we have recorded intangible assets resulting from our acquisitions 
we account for goodwill and other intangible assets under sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas requires that goodwill and other intangible assets with an indefinite life will be tested for impairment at least annually 
the impairment test is a two step process that requires goodwill to be allocated to reporting units 
in the first step  the fair value of the reporting unit is compared with the carrying value of the reporting unit 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit  an impairment may exist  and the second step of the test is performed 
in the second step  the fair value of the intangible asset is compared with the carrying value  and an impairment loss will be recognized to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the fair value 
we are required to review the recoverability of our goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives  at least annually 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management or if events occur or circumstances change that would reduce the estimated recoverability of these assets  impairment charges may be required 
litigation in july  ciena corporation ciena informed us of its belief that there is significant correspondence between products that we offer and several us patents held by ciena relating to optical networking systems and related dense wavelength division multiplexing wdm communications systems technologies 
in general  the technologies at issue involve how some of our equipment is used to transmit and receive communication signals between two points in the network 
on july   ciena filed a lawsuit in the united states district court for the district of delaware alleging that we are willfully infringing three of ciena s patents relating to dense wavelength division multiplexing communications technologies 
on march   a motion was granted allowing ciena to amend its complaint to include allegations that we are willfully infringing two additional patents 
one patent was dropped from the litigation by agreement of the parties prior to trial 
in february  jury trials were held on the issues of infringement and invalidity of the four patents 
our all optical networking products were found not to 
table of contents infringe two of ciena s wdm patents 
the jury did not reach a verdict on a third ciena wdm patent  which is related to the two non infringed wdm patents 
corvis oc inverse multiplexing transceiver product  which can generally be described as a device that separates higher speed signals into lower speed signals for transmission and then recombines the lower speed signals after transmission that can be used along with our all optical networking products  was found by the jury to infringe a ciena patent on bit rate transparent devices 
in an april retrial  the manner in which certain corvis oc transmitters and receivers convert the signals from optical form to an electronic form and back again  in a wdm system was found by a jury to infringe the patent  upon which a jury verdict was not reached in the february trial 
the jury verdicts to date are interim verdicts  in so far as additional trial court proceedings remain before a decision is made by the court and judgment is entered 
in may  we filed a motion to certify the record for interlocutory appeal to the us federal circuit court of appeals and ciena filed motions for entry of judgment and for a permanent injunction  all of which are pending 
in february  our motion requesting a jury trial on a pending infringement issue was denied and we filed a writ of mandamus with the us federal circuit court of appeals requesting that a retrial be ordered 
while management believes that we will ultimately prevail  we cannot be certain that the interim jury verdicts of infringement will be overturned  or that infringement of other patents in the suit will not be found in later legal proceedings 
we expect that ciena will attempt to use the interim jury verdicts and the possibility of an injunction to disrupt our equipment sales efforts and customer relationships 
to the extent it is necessary  a trial to determine damages will be held following any appeals 
such appeals can take up to a year or more before final determination 
based on the current status of the litigation  we cannot reasonably predict the likelihood of any final outcome 
between may  and june   nine class action lawsuits were filed in the united states district court for the southern district of new york relating to our initial public offering on behalf of all persons who purchased our stock between july  and the filing of the complaints 
each of the complaints named as defendants corvis  our directors and officers who signed the registration statement in connection with our initial public offering  and certain of the underwriters that participated in our initial public offering 
our directors and officers have since been dismissed from the case  without prejudice 
the complaints allege that the registration statement and prospectus relating to our initial public offering contained material misrepresentations and or omissions in that those documents did not disclose that certain of the underwriters had solicited and received undisclosed fees and commissions and other economic benefits from some investors in connection with the distribution of our common stock in the initial public offering and that certain of the underwriters had entered into arrangements with some investors that were designed to distort and or inflate the market price for our common stock in the aftermarket following the initial public offering 
the complaints ask the court to award to members of the class the right to rescind their purchases of corvis common stock or to be awarded rescissory damages if the class member has sold its corvis stock and prejudgment and post judgment interest  reasonable attorneys and experts witness fees and other costs 
by order dated october   the court appointed an executive committee of six plaintiffs law firms to coordinate their claims and function as lead counsel 
lead plaintiffs have been appointed in almost all of the ipo allocation actions  including the corvis action 
on april   plaintiffs filed amended complaints in each of the ipo allocation actions  including the corvis action 
on february   the issuer defendants motion to dismiss was granted with regard to certain claims and denied with regard to certain other claims 
as to the company  the section b and rule b claims  alleging that the company participated in a scheme to defraud investors by artificially driving up the price of the securities  were dismissed with prejudice  but the section claims  alleging that the registration statement contained a material misstatement of  or omitted  a material fact at the time it became effective  survived the motion to dismiss 
on june   the plaintiffs executive committee announced a proposed settlement between plaintiffs  on the one hand  and the issuer defendants and their respective officer and director defendants  including the company and its named officers and directors  on the other 
a memorandum of understanding to settle plaintiffs claims against the issuers and their directors and officers has been approved by each of the issuer defendants  including the company 
the settlement agreement is currently being prepared by the parties but has not yet been entered into 
the proposed settlement is also subject to approval by the district court 
the principal components of the proposed settlement include i a release of all of plaintiffs claims against the issuer defendants and their officers and directors which have  or could have  been asserted in this litigation arising out of the conduct alleged in the amended complaints to be wrongful  ii the assignment by the issuers to the plaintiffs of certain potential claims against the underwriter defendants and the agreement by the issuers not to assert certain claims against the underwriter defendants  and iii an undertaking by the insurers of the issuer defendants to pay to plaintiffs the difference the recovery deficit between billion and any lesser amount recovered from the underwriter defendants in this litigation 
if recoveries in excess of billion are obtained by plaintiffs from the 
table of contents underwriters  the insurers of the settling issuer defendants will owe no money to the plaintiffs 
the proposed settlement does not resolve plaintiffs claims against the underwriter defendants 
while it is possible that the underwriter defendants and the plaintiffs may settle their claims eventually  pre trial activity continues  including the selection by the plaintiffs of five issuer test cases on which to determine certain class certification matters 
we have been selected as one of the five issuer test cases for that matter 
however  in accordance with the terms of the proposed settlement  we do not anticipate that our continued involvement as a test case regarding this matter or any other  will result in any additional liability for the company 
we cannot be certain that we will not be subject to additional claims in the future  including claims brought by the underwriter defendants still involved in the litigation 
the denver  colorado regional office of the sec is conducting two investigations titled in the matter of qwest communications international  inc and in the matter of issuers related to qwest 
we believe the first of these investigations does not involve any allegation of wrongful conduct on the part of corvis 
in connection with the second investigation  the sec is examining various transactions and business relationships involving qwest and eleven companies having a vendor relationship with qwest  including corvis and has conducted interviews with certain current and former officers and employees 
this investigation  insofar as it relates to corvis  appears to focus generally on whether corvis transactions and relationships with qwest and its employees were appropriately disclosed in corvis public filings and other public statements 
in addition  the united states attorney in denver is conducting an investigation involving qwest  including qwest s relationships with certain of its vendors  including corvis 
in connection with that investigation  the us attorney has sought documents and information from corvis and has conducted interviews from persons associated or formerly associated with corvis  including certain corvis officers 
the us attorney has indicated that  while aspects of its investigation are in an early stage  neither corvis nor any of its current or former officers or employees is a target or a subject of the investigation 
corvis is cooperating fully with these investigations 
corvis is not able  at this time  to say when the sec and or us attorney investigations will be completed and resolved  or what the ultimate outcome with respect to the company will be 
these investigations could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention that may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we and our subsidiaries from time to time are also subject to pending and threatened legal action and proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business 
management believes that the outcome of such actions and proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 

table of contents results of operations selected financial data in thousands year ended december  december  december  equipment communications services total revenue communications services equipment total revenue operating expenses cost of revenue communications services equipment sales total cost of revenue research and development  excluding equity based expense selling  general and administrative  excluding equity based expense depreciation amortization equity based expense restructuring and other charges purchased research and development operating loss other income expense  net net loss before minority interest minority interest net loss year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue 
revenue increased to million for the fiscal year ended december  from million for the fiscal year ended december  principally due to the inclusion of million of broadwing communications services revenue earned after the june  acquisition through year end 
communications services revenue 
communications services revenue consists of the sale of data and internet  broadband transport and voice communication services 
data and internet sales consist of high speed data transport utilizing technology based on internet protocol ip and atm frame relay 
broadband transport services consist of long haul transmission of data  voice and internet traffic over dedicated circuits 
voice services consist of dedicated and billed minutes of use  primarily for the transmission of voice long distance services on behalf of wholesale and retail customers 
a summary of communications services revenue is as follows quarter ended june  september  december  total data and internet services broadband transport voice services total communications services revenue includes revenues beginning on the date of acquisition  june  communications services revenues totaled million for the fiscal year ended december  reflecting two full quarters of broadwing operations 
prior to the acquisition  broadwing communications services  inc revenues had declined substantially as a result of the downturn within the communications industry and intense price competition 
since the date of acquisition and with consideration to seasonality from varying business days within each reporting period  we have seen a stabilization in the decline of revenue in data and internet  
table of contents broadband transport and voice services 
competition and pricing pressures continue to affect broadwing in all of its product lines 
to address these issues  we focus our efforts on selling higher margin products to larger customers with complex communications needs  developing new products that differentiate broadwing from its competition and reducing incremental service costs to allow us to better compete on the sale of price sensitive products 
significant portions of broadwing communication services  inc s historical revenues were generated through indefeasible right of use agreements iru  whereby the customer leases network capacity or dark fiber 
the buyer of iru services typically pays cash upon the execution of the contract and the associated revenue is deferred and then recognized over the life of the agreement 
at the date of acquisition  the company recorded the deferred revenue associated with acquired iru contracts at fair value  which was substantially less than historical book value 
as a result  the company expects that revenues from iru s will be significantly less than those previously reported by broadwing communications services  inc iru revenues totaled million for the year ended december  equipment revenues 
equipment revenue decreased to million for the fiscal year ended december  from million for the fiscal year ended december   reflecting a continued decrease in the volume of equipment sales 
most of our customers have met or are approaching contractual minimum purchase commitments 
a significant portion of our future revenue will therefore depend on the amount and timing of new firm order commitments from existing customers  as well as new contract wins 
given our historical declines in equipment sales and the focus of our investment away from our equipment division  revenues associated with the sale of our equipment and services will likely remain at current or lower levels for the next quarter and beyond 
cost of revenues 
cost of revenues increased to million for the fiscal year ended december  from million for the fiscal year ended december  principally due to the inclusion of approximately million for broadwing communications services costs of revenue incurred after the june  acquisition through year end 
communications services cost of revenue 
communications services cost of revenue primarily reflects access charges paid to local exchange carriers and other providers and transmission lease payments to other carriers 
communications services cost of revenue totaled million for the fiscal year ended december   reflecting operations for the period june  through december  during the third quarter of  we began making capital expenditures associated with our network assets in the form of fiber and equipment purchases designed to reduce the access charges we incur 
during this process  our cost of sales may increase due to one time charges as we transition to lower cost network alternatives 
there can be no assurance  however  as to the amount or timing of the cost savings we are attempting to achieve 
equipment cost of revenue 
equipment cost of revenue decreased to million for the fiscal year ended december  from million for the fiscal year ended december  equipment cost of revenue consists of component costs  direct compensation costs  warranty and other contractual obligations  inventory obsolescence costs and manufacturing overhead including depreciation 
as a result of our restructuring plans and excess inventories resulting from reduced capital expenditures by telecommunication carriers  we recorded inventory impairment charges as a cost of revenue totaling million during and million during at december   inventory balances relate principally to manufactured items built to fulfill firm customer orders 
we do not anticipate inventory build ups in excess of firm customer orders 
as a result  we do not expect significant inventory impairment charges in the coming quarters 
research and development expense  excluding equity based expense 
research and development expense  all of which is included in our equipment division  excluding equity based expense  consists primarily of personnel  material  laboratory and facilities costs related to the design of our hardware and software equipment products 
all costs related to product development  both hardware and software  are recorded as expenses in the period in which they are incurred 
due to the timing and nature of the expenses associated with research and development  significant quarterly fluctuations may result 

table of contents research and development expenses  excluding equity based expense  decreased to million for the fiscal year ended december  from million for the fiscal year ended december  the decrease in expense was primarily attributable to the effect of cost savings initiatives including staff reductions  facilities and equipment consolidation and the curtailment of certain discretionary spending 
during  we reduced our research and development staff from to employees 
remaining research and development efforts will be focused on a limited number of strategic initiatives 
as a result  we expect research and development expense to be lower in future quarters 
sales  general administrative  excluding equity based expense 
sales  general administrative expense  excluding equity based expense  consists primarily of costs associated with personnel  travel  information systems support and facilities related to our sales  network operations  network engineering and administrative support functions 
in addition  sales  general and administrative charges include laboratory trial systems provided to equipment customers and trade shows 
sales  general and administrative expense  excluding equity based expense  increased to million for the fiscal year ended december  from million for the fiscal year ended december  the increase was primarily due to the inclusion of approximately million of sales  general and administrative expenses related to broadwing since the acquisition date 
depreciation expense 
depreciation expense decreased to million for the fiscal year ended december  from million for the fiscal year ended december  this decrease is primarily due to million asset impairment charges recorded in fiscal year  offset in part by an increase in depreciation associated with the broadwing assets 
amortization of intangible assets 
amortization of intangible assets expense decreased to million for the fiscal year ended december  from million for the fiscal year ended december  the decrease is attributable to declines in amortizable intangible assets in the equipment division due to previously recorded impairment charges 
we record amortization expense associated with certain intangible assets with finite useful lives  such as acquired customer relationships and in place contracts licenses with lives ranging from three to nine years 
equity based expense 
equity based expense consists primarily of charges associated with employee options granted at below fair market value 
equity based expense related to research and development and sales  general and administrative functions for the fiscal year ended december  decreased to million from million for the fiscal year ended december  the decrease in equity based compensation resulted from a decrease in employee headcount within our equipment division 
however  in  the company granted a number of employee incentive stock options with exercise prices below fair value 
as a result  we recorded increased expense in the second half of and we expect these expenses to continue in the coming quarters 
inventory write downs  restructuring and other charges 
starting in and continuing through  conditions within the general economy and communications sector have resulted in reduced capital expenditures by carriers and a reduced demand for communications networking systems 
these declines have had a severe adverse impact on corvis equipment revenue and the results of operations within the equipment division 
management cannot predict when or if market conditions will improve 
in response to these conditions  our equipment division has been restructured through staff reductions and other consolidation efforts and is now focused strategically on selective customer engagements principally related to our ocs product 
in addition  the equipment division continues to service the networks of existing customers  maintains certain centralized business operations and supports the broadwing network 
these restructuring plans have been reflected in the results of operations in   and  and management will continue to assess the need for additional restructurings in response to economic changes or strategic initiatives in the future 

table of contents we are continually evaluating the recoverability of our long lived assets in light of these initiatives and the projected economic and operating environment 
as a result  we recorded the following charges in and in thousands year ended december  december  equipment cost of sales inventory write downs and other restructuring  impairment and other charges workforce reductions and facilities consolidation valuation and impairment of long lived assets contract termination charges communications services division total restructuring  impairment and other charges other income  net impairment of strategic equity investments total restructuring and related charges equipment cost of sales inventory write downs and other 
we write down inventory for estimated obsolete  excess and overvalued inventory based on estimated sales projections and market values 
as a result of the decline in spending by communications carriers and the discontinuation of certain products  the company recorded million and million in inventory write downs and other related charges in and  respectively 
workforce reductions and facility consolidation 
during  workforce reduction programs continued and resulted in the elimination of approximately positions and million in related charges 
in addition  we recorded approximately million associated with adjustments to reduce estimated facility consolidation accruals recorded in prior periods 
during  workforce reduction programs continued and resulted in the elimination of approximately positions and charges of million 
in addition we recorded approximately million associated with facility consolidation and the cumulative effect of the foreign currency impact associated with the shut down of our french operations and write off of accumulated translation adjustment losses 
valuation and impairment of long lived assets 
sfas requires that goodwill be tested for impairment initially within one year of adoption transitional test and at least annually thereafter 
the goodwill impairment test is a two step process that requires goodwill to be allocated to reporting units 
in the first step  the fair value of the reporting unit is compared with the carrying value of the reporting unit 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit  a goodwill impairment may exist  and the second step of the test is performed 
in the second step  the implied fair value of the goodwill is compared with the carrying value of the goodwill  and an impairment loss will be recognized to the extent that the carrying value of the goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill 
if an impairment loss exists as a result of the transitional goodwill impairment test  the implementation of sfas could result in a one time charge to earnings as a cumulative effect of an accounting change 
in january  the company performed the transitional test and determined that no adjustment to carrying value was required 

table of contents in performing the annual test in  the company determined the estimated fair value of its reporting units and compared it to the carrying value of the reporting unit 
as a result of the comparison  there was an indication that a certain reporting unit s goodwill may have been impaired and the second step of the impairment test was performed 
in the second step  the company compared the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill 
the implied fair value of the goodwill was determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation  in accordance with sfas no 
the residual fair value after this allocation was the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill 
as a result of the second step of the impairment test  in the fourth quarter of  the company recognized an impairment charge of approximately million as a component of restructuring  impairment and other charges 
also in  the company announced a multi year manufacturing outsourcing agreement with celestica  a provider of electronics manufacturing services 
under the agreement  the company transitioned substantially all of its manufacturing capabilities to celestica with the exception of final assembly  system integration and testing capabilities 
in addition  the company further reduced its headcount and operations as part of restructuring plans implemented during in connection with these restructuring initiatives  certain fixed assets were decommissioned and the recoverability of the long lived assets still in use was reviewed 
as a result  in the fourth quarter of  we recorded charges totaling million associated with the impairment of certain fixed assets  patents and intellectual property 
in  in light of projected market conditions associated with our equipment division  the company performed an analysis as to the recoverability of our long lived assets  using discounted projected cash flows for each reporting unit 
as a result  we recorded a write down of fixed assets totaling million and a write down of intangible assets totaling million 
cequel contract termination charges at the date of the broadwing acquisition  corvis owned a interest and the ability to appoint of the board members in a holding company which in turn owned broadwing communications llc 
cequel contributed approximately million for a ownership interest and the ability to appoint of the board members 
cincinnati bell  previously the parent company of broadwing communications services  inc  retained a non voting equity interest 
in addition  we entered into a management services agreement with cequel under which cequel would manage broadwing 
on november   we acquired cequel s one percent equity stake and additional interests and terminated the management services agreement 
in aggregate  corvis paid million as a return of cequel s initial investment  as final payment for services rendered  for termination of the cequel management services agreement  and in exchange for ongoing consulting services 
corvis now owns of the equity interest in broadwing communications and maintains control  including the ability to appoint all holding company board members 
cincinnati bell continues to retain a non voting equity stake in broadwing 
as additional consideration  we also issued  and agreed to register with the securities and exchange commission  million shares of corvis common stock to cequel and granted them a warrant to purchase an additional million shares at prices ranging from  the closing price on november  to per share 
as part of this agreement  corvis entered into a year network services agreement with cequel in which the company will provide network services at prices ranging from incremental cost reimbursement to current market pricing 
in addition  cequel agreed to provide certain consulting services to corvis over the next four years and will act as a non exclusive sales agent for broadwing products and services  for which they will receive sales commissions 
corvis recorded a charge in the fourth quarter of million equal to the excess of the fair value of the cash  equity and services committed over the fair value of cequel s ownership interest and services performed 
strategic equity investments 
in prior years  the company made strategic equity investments in certain non public startup companies totaling million 
these investments were carried at cost as the company owns less than percent of the voting equity and does not have the ability to exercise significant influence over these companies 
during and  the company recorded charges totaling million and million  respectively  associated with the other than temporary impairment of these investments resulting from the impact of economic conditions on certain of these investees 
the carrying value of these investments was fully impaired at december  
table of contents other income net 
other income  net increased to million for the fiscal year ended december  from million for the fiscal year ended december  the increase is attributable primarily to charges of approximately million related to the write down of strategic non controlling equity investments in and million from gains on the disposal of fixed assets  the settlement of certain insurance claims and settlement of certain claims with qwest recognized in  offset in part by a million decrease in interest income due to lower average invested balances 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue 
revenue decreased to million for the fiscal year ended december  from million for the fiscal year ended december  the decrease in revenue was attributable to a decrease in demand for optical communications systems 
revenue for the years ended and is attributable to five customers and two customers  respectively 
in  broadwing communications services  qwest communications corporation  wiltel communications group  inc formerly known as williams communications  llc  telefonica de espana sau  and france telecom represented million or of total revenue  million or of total revenue  million or of total revenue  million or of total revenue  and million or of total revenue  respectively 
in  broadwing and wiltel represented million or of total revenue and million or of total revenue  respectively 
services  including customer support  installation and training  represented and of total revenue in and  respectively 
cost of sales 
cost of revenues decreased to million for the fiscal year ended december  from million for the fiscal year ended december   principally due to a decline in demand for our products and impairment charges associated with our restructuring initiatives 
cost of revenue consists of component costs  direct compensation costs  warranty and other contractual obligations  inventory obsolescence costs and overhead related to our manufacturing and engineering  finishing and installation operations 
as a result of discontinued product lines under our restructuring plans and excessive inventories due to reduced capital expenditures by communications carriers  we recorded cost of revenue charges totaling million in and million in research and development  excluding equity based expense 
research and development  excluding equity based expense  consists primarily of salaries and related personnel costs  test and prototype expenses related to the design of our hardware and software products  laboratory costs and facilities costs 
all costs related to product development  both hardware and software  are recorded as expenses in the period in which they are incurred 
due to the timing and nature of the expenses associated with research and development  significant quarterly fluctuations may result 
we believe that research and development is critical in achieving current and future strategic product objectives 
research and development expenses  excluding equity based expense  decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decrease in expenses was primarily attributable to a reduction in prototype material usage 
sales  general  and administrative  excluding equity based expense 
sales  general  and administrative  excluding equity based expense  consists primarily of salaries and related personnel costs  laboratory trial systems provided to customers  trade shows  other marketing programs  executive  financial  legal  information systems and other administrative responsibilities 
sales  general and administrative excluding equity based expense  decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decrease in expenses was primarily attributable to a reduction in headcount and marketing and tradeshow programs offset  in part  by an increase in lab trial expenses 

table of contents depreciation expense 
depreciation expense increased to million for the fiscal year ended december  from million for the fiscal year ended december  the increase was primarily associated with a higher average depreciable asset base throughout the year 
amortization of intangible assets 
historically  amortization of intangible assets primarily related to the amortization of goodwill associated with the acquisition of algety telecom sa as a result of the issuance of sfas no 
 we no longer record amortization of goodwill as of january  under sfas no 
 goodwill is tested at least annually for impairment 
intangible assets that are separate and have finite useful lives  such as acquired patent rights and intellectual property licenses  continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
amortization of intangible assets expenses decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily attributable to the discontinuation of amortization of goodwill under sfas no 
equity based expense 
equity based expenses consists primarily of charges associated with amortization of employee options granted at below fair market value prior to our initial public offering 
equity based expense related to research and development  sales and marketing and general and administrative functions for the year ended december  decreased to million from million for the year ended december  the decrease in equity based compensation resulted from decreases in employee headcount 
restructuring  impairment and other charges 
during and continuing in  we developed and implemented restructuring plans designed to decrease our operating expenses and to align our resources for long term growth opportunities 
in addition  we evaluated the recoverability of our inventory and long lived assets in light of these plans and the current and projected economic environment 
as a result  we recorded the following charges in thousands year ended december  december  cost of sales inventory write down and other restructuring and other workforce and facility reductions valuation and impairment of long lived assets  including goodwill total restructuring and other charges other charges impairment of strategic equity investments total restructuring and impairment charges cost of sales inventory write downs and other 
we write down our inventory for estimated obsolete  excess and overvalued inventory based on estimated sales projections and market values 
as a result of the decline in spending by communications carriers and the discontinuation of certain products  we recorded million in and million in in inventory write downs and other related charges 
workforce reductions and facility consolidation 
during  we initiated companywide workforce reduction programs that resulted in the elimination of approximately positions and associated charges of approximately million 
in addition  we recorded approximately million in charges associated with the cost of closing certain facilities 

table of contents during  workforce reduction programs continued including substantial reductions in our french operations and resulted in the elimination of approximately positions and million in related charges offset in part by approximately million associated with adjustments to reduce facility consolidation accruals recorded in prior periods 
valuation and impairment of long lived assets 
in  in light of current and projected market conditions within the communications industry  we performed an analysis as to the recoverability of our long lived assets 
as a result  we recorded a write down of goodwill totaling million associated with our july acquisition of algety sa  a french company that develops and markets high capacity  high speed optical networking equipment 
in  we adopted sfas no 
and ceased amortizing goodwill 
in the fourth quarter of  under the provisions of sfas no 
and sfas no 
 we completed an impairment review of our goodwill 
based on the assessment  we recorded a write down of goodwill and intangible assets totaling million associated with our may acquisition of dors l networks 
also in  in light of the outsourcing of our manufacturing operations and the reduction of research and development initiatives  we decommissioned certain fixed assets and reviewed the recoverability of the long lived assets still in use 
as a result  in the fourth quarter of  we recorded impairment charges totaling million 
other charges impairment of strategic equity investment 
we have made strategic equity investments in certain startup companies totaling million 
these investments are initially carried at cost as we own less than of the voting equity and do not have the ability to exercise significant influence over these companies 
we recorded charges within other income  net totaling million in and million in  associated with the permanent impairment of these investments resulting from the impact of economic conditions on certain of these investees 
purchased research development 
on may   we completed our acquisition of dors l networks  inc  a privately held provider of next generation transoceanic and regional undersea optical network solutions  for million shares of common stock valued at approximately million 
the purchase price of dors l was allocated to identifiable assets and liabilities acquired and included approximately million of purchased in process research and development that was expensed on the acquisition date 
interest income expense  net 
interest income  net of interest expense  decreased to million for the year ended december  from million of net interest income for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily attributable to lower average invested cash balances from the proceeds of our initial public offering and other private placements  lower average returns on investments net of charges associated with the write down of certain strategic equity investments 
liquidity and capital resources overview since inception through december   we have financed our operations  capital expenditures and working capital primarily through public and private sales of our capital stock 
at december   our cash and cash equivalents and investments totaled million 
during and early in  we have entered into a series of significant transactions  including in june  we invested approximately million in cash  net of subsequent purchase adjustments and acquisition costs  to acquire most of the assets and certain of the liabilities of broadwing communications services  inc in august   we completed a private placement of million shares of common stock for net proceeds of million 
in november  we acquired an additional one percent interest in broadwing and terminated our management services agreement with cequel for a combination of cash  equity and other consideration 
we recorded an million restructuring charge associated with this transaction

the decrease in net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  was primarily attributable to significant reductions in capital expenditures 
on february   we originally agreed to invest approximately million  including acquisition costs for most of the assets and certain of the liabilities of broadwing communication services  inc this purchase price was subject to a pre closing reduction of up to million if broadwing communications services  inc failed to reach certain revenue and ebitda targets it had established and a post closing reduction of an additional million if certain ebitda targets were not reached in a one year period after the closing 
the agreement also committed broadwing communications services  inc to make capital expenditures of million each month  consistent with its financial plan 
on june   the parties agreed to reduce the purchase price by million due to failure to meet the revenue target and by an additional million for failure to achieve the targeted reduction in negative cash ebitda  as defined in the agreement 
an additional reduction in the purchase price of approximately million was negotiated to reflect the seller s desire to forego making additional required capital expenditures such as equipment and network upgrades and to accelerate the closing of the transaction 
these reduction reduced the purchase price to million including acquisition costs 
the broadwing acquisition closed on june  subsequently in november  the parties agreed on an additional post closing reduction in the purchase price to million  including acquisitions costs as negotiated pursuant to working capital and receivable adjustment obligations set forth in the agreement and our release of any rights to the post closing adjustment as a result of failure to meet post closing ebitda targets 
in february  we signed an agreement to acquire focal communications corporation focal  a chicago based competitive local exchange carrier that provides voice and data solutions to enterprises  carriers and resellers for a total consideration of million  which will be comprised of approximately million in equity to be issued to focal s equity holders and the assumption or payment of approximately million of focal s existing debt and other long term capital lease obligations 
focal operated in tier markets from boston to miami and new york to los angeles and owns metro fiber footprint in nine tier national markets and maintains a  enterprise and wholesale carrier customer base 
as part of our efforts to lower overall cost of service associated with broadwing  we have implemented a series of capital projects associated with the broadwing network infrastructure 
these capital programs will continue in with projected spending of to million per quarter 
during  capital projects included million of equipment division inventory that was transferred to the broadwing network at its net carrying value 
as part of our efforts to improve and expand the broadwing network  we will likely install corvis inventory that has previously been written down to zero value as well as network elements previously capitalized as research and development fixed assets within our equipment division 
the decision to use this equipment is dependent on further cost benefit analysis  expansion requirements and interoperability 

table of contents financing cash flow net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was million  primarily attributable to the august  private placement of approximately million shares of common stock for proceeds of million  net of offering costs and proceeds from stock and warrant exercises offset in part by treasury stock purchases and capital lease payments 
we have granted the private placement investors additional investment rights to purchase up to an additional million shares of our common stock at per share 
net cash used in financing activities for the year ended december  was million  primarily attributable to the repayment of principal on notes and capital leases as well as the purchase of treasury stock 
net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was million  primarily attributable to the sale of investments associated with restricted cash and proceeds from stock options and warrants exercised  offset in part by the repayment of principal on notes and capital leases 
in february  corvis completed a private placement of million of senior unsecured convertible notes with several institutional investors 
the rates have a final maturity date of two years from issuance and bear interest at a rate of five percent per annum 
interest is payable quarterly at corvis option in cash or  subject to certain conditions  in registered shares of corvis common stock at a five percent discount to the company s common stock trading price at the time of payment 
the notes are convertible at the investors option at any time into corvis common stock at a fixed conversion price of per share  subject to anti dilution adjustments 
principal is payable in quarterly installments beginning august  we intend to use the net proceeds to support the general operations of our broadwing subsidiary and to support new market initiatives within broadwing  as for well as working capital requirements for strategic acquisitions 
corvis has the option  beginning six months after closing august   to cause the investors to subscribe to the placement of up to an additional million in senior unsecured convertible notes having a final maturity date of two years after that issuance and otherwise having similar terms as the initial senior unsecured convertible notes 
we are contractually committed to register shares that investors bought in connection with our august  private placement 
however  we have been unable to do so due to broadwing s predecessor auditors inability to consent to our referencing certain financial statements they audited relating to the broadwing business while it was owned by cincinnati bell 
allegations have been made that such financial statements contained inaccuracies and cincinnati bell s audit committee has launched an internal investigation 
until we  and the predecessor auditors  are satisfied that such allegations have been appropriately addressed or until we no longer are required to reference such financials  expected in mid  we will be unable to register the private placement or any other securities 
our inability to register our shares due to the cincinnati bell issue could have a material adverse effect on our cash position 
under our agreement with the august  private placement purchasers  we are obligated to pay them million per month for each additional month of delay after december  in registering the resale of their securities 
in addition  if we are not able to have a registration statement effective for the purchasers of million our senior unsecured convertible notes by august   we will owe them a penalty equal to two percent of million for the first month of delay and one percent for each additional month of delay up to a maximum of five percent 
if we still do not have a registration statement effective for the noteholders by october   the noteholders could declare an event of default and we would be obligated to pay them less any previously paid penalties of the million  as well as accrued interest 
also  in connection with our agreement to purchase focal  if we do not have a registration statement filed by july   which we could only do if the registration statement for our august  private placement has already become effective  then we are obligated  at the investor s election  to close with cash instead of shares of our common stock  an amount we estimate at million 
in addition  absent an amendment to the agreement under which we issued the senior unsecured convertible notes  if we have not been able to register the shares issued under the notes  we will not be permitted to assume debt and  absent other arrangements  we may be obligated to repay indebtedness of focal in an aggregate amount of up to million 
finally  in connection with our agreements with cequel iii  if at the time we fulfill our obligation of registering the million shares we have previously issued to them  such shares do not have a market value of at least million  we are obligated to issue them additional shares up to million additional shares necessary to bring the total market value of such shares up to such market value 
based on discussions with cincinnati bell and the associated external auditors  we believe that this issue will be resolved during the early portion of there can be no assurances  however  as to if and when this issue will be resolved 
we plan to undertake action to reduce the risks outlined above by commencing to arrange for alternative financing should we be obligated to make one or more of the identified cash payments 
in addition  we are in discussions with the holders of our senior unsecured convertible notes to amend the terms of such notes to permit our incurrence of indebtedness in connection with acquisitions below the threshold of million aggregate indebtedness prior to effectiveness of a registration statement relating to such notes and the related warrants and to provide for greater flexibility in raising additional funds if necessary if they declare an event of default  and accelerate payment of the notes  for failure to timely register the sale of their shares 
as of december   long term restricted cash totaled million associated with outstanding irrevocable letters of credit relating to lease obligations for various manufacturing and office facilities and other business arrangements 
these letters of credit are collateralized by funds in our operating account 
various portions of the letters of credit expire at the end of each respective lease term or agreement term 
on october   we announced that our board of directors had had authorized a share repurchase program under which we can acquire up to million of our common stock in the open market 
cumulative at december    shares had been purchase under the plan for a total of million 
the purchases will be executed at times and prices considered appropriate by us through october the share repurchase program may be suspended at any time and from time to time without prior notice 
the repurchase program will be funded using our existing cash balances and the repurchased shares may be use for corporate purposes in compliance with applicable law

risks related to our communications services division broadwing s ability to utilize its network may be severely limited if it is not able to maintain rights of way and permits  which would adversely affect revenues and cash flow 
broadwing s network consists of several thousand miles of fiber optic cable buried across the united states on property that it does not own 
its ability to utilize this network depends on it maintaining rights of way and required permits from railroads  utilities  government authorities and third party landlords on satisfactory terms and conditions 
broadwing cannot guarantee that it will be able to maintain all of the existing rights and permits 
although broadwing expects to maintain and renew its existing agreements  the loss of a substantial number of existing rights and permits could have a material adverse impact on our sales if we are unable to provide services to our customers or on our profitability and financial condition if we are required to purchase higher priced network alternatives 
for portions of broadwing s network that it leases or purchases use rights from third parties  broadwing must rely on such third parties maintenance of all necessary rights of way and permits 
some agreements that broadwing may rely on to use portions of other companies networks could be terminated if associated rights of way were terminated  which would adversely affect our ability to serve our customers and our revenue and profitability 
significant capital expenditures will be required to maintain broadwing s network  and if broadwing fails or is unable to adequately maintain its networks there could be a material adverse effect on our sales  revenues and financial condition 
broadwing could incur significant capital expenditures as a result of unanticipated expenses  regulatory changes and other events that impact its business 
if broadwing does not have sufficient cash on hand or the ability 
table of contents to borrow sufficient cash on favorable terms  it may be unable to make any necessary capital expenditures 
if broadwing fails to adequately maintain its networks to meet customer needs there could be a material adverse impact on our revenue and profitability 
broadwing also could be subject to lawsuits or regulatory proceedings for failure to adequately maintain its networks 
regulatory initiatives could put broadwing at a competitive disadvantage or lower the rates that broadwing is permitted to charge for its services  which would decrease broadwing s revenue  profitability and adversely effect its results of operations 
broadwing is subject to regulatory oversight of varying degrees at the state and federal levels 
broadwing is regulated primarily by both the federal communications commission  or fcc  and the state public utility commissions in the states in which it provides services to customers 
the fcc provides regulatory oversight for service terms and rates offered by the broadwing business 
state public utility commissions can issue regulations that affect the types of services that broadwing can provide and the rates broadwing can charge for its services  as well as with respect to certain other consumer related issues 
regulatory initiatives that would put broadwing at a competitive disadvantage or mandate lower rates for its services could result in lower profitability and cash flow 
the fcc or other federal  state and local governmental authorities having jurisdiction over the broadwing business could adopt regulations or take other actions that would adversely affect broadwing s business prospects or results of operations 
the communications industry has been the subject of legislative initiatives at both the federal and state levels  and we expect these initiatives to continue 
the telecommunications act of  which we refer to as the telecom act  provides  among other things  a framework for local competition  but requires the fcc and state governmental agencies to implement rules for this framework 
these rules have been the subject of numerous appeals  both in the courts and to congress 
legislation has been proposed to amend the telecom act in almost every session of congress since its adoption  and members of congress use hearings and letters to regulators to influence the rules adopted to implement it 
this congressional participation in the development of regulatory policy and enforcement has caused the regulatory process relating to the communications industry to become less predictable and increases the risk that broadwing will be adversely affected by the rules that are ultimately implemented and or the regulatory process 
similar legislative involvement has occurred in various states 
any regulatory changes could have a material adverse impact on our revenue and profitability 
broadwing relies  in part  on portions of competitors networks to carry communications signals 
if broadwing is not able to continue these agreements  it may incur additional significant expenses obtaining alternate agreements with other carriers to carry communications signals  which could adversely affect its profitability and financial condition 
broadwing uses network resources owned by other companies for portions of its network 
broadwing obtains the right to use such network portions through operating leases and iru agreements in which broadwing pays for the right to use such other companies fiber assets and through agreements in which broadwing exchanges the use of portions of its network for the use of portions of such other companies networks 
in several of those agreements  the counter party is responsible for network maintenance and repair 
if a counter party to a lease  iru or an exchange suffers financial distress or bankruptcy  broadwing may not be able to enforce its rights to use such network assets or  even if broadwing could continue to use such network assets  it could incur material expenses related to their maintenance and repair 
broadwing also could incur material expenses if it were required to locate alternative network assets 
broadwing may not be successful in obtaining reasonable alternative network assets if needed 
failure to obtain usage of alternative network assets  if necessary  could have a material adverse impact on our ability to carry on business 
in an effort to limit its costs for the use of such third party networks  broadwing has undertaken an initiative to reduce its dependency and diversify the use of the networks of our competitors 
broadwing will execute this initiative in a number of ways  including by strategically moving traffic to lower cost third party networks  purchasing its own fiber in areas where access charges are high and or where warranted by traffic volumes and renegotiating interconnection agreements as opportunities allow 
if broadwing is unable to successfully execute this cost reduction strategy  it will continue to pay higher access costs which may delay its ability to reach profitability and which could have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if broadwing is not able to successfully introduce new products and services  its profitability could be adversely affected 

table of contents if broadwing is not able to successfully introduce new products and services  its sales and profitability could be adversely affected 
broadwing s success depends on being able to anticipate the needs of current and future enterprise and carrier customers 
broadwing seeks to meet these needs through new product introductions  service quality and technological superiority 
broadwing s failure to anticipate the needs of these customers and to introduce the new products and services necessary to attract or retain these customers could have a material adverse impact on our sales and profitability 
continuing softness in the economy is having a disproportionate effect in the communications industry and has adversely affected  and is expected to continue to adversely affect  our sales  profitability and financial condition 
beginning in  the business environment for the communications industry deteriorated significantly and rapidly and remains weak 
this was primarily due to the general weakness of the us economy  which was exacerbated by the events of september   and concerns regarding terrorism  pressure on prices for broadband services due to substantial excess fiber capacity in most markets  and forecasted demand for broadband services not being realized as a result of the state of the economy  the bankruptcy or liquidation of a substantial number of internet companies and financial difficulties experienced by many communications customers 
if these trends continue  they could cause a material adverse impact on our sales profitability and financial condition 
a significant portion of broadwing s revenue is derived from communications carriers  many of which have filed for bankruptcy or have been adversely affected financially by the prolonged decrease in the demand for telecommunication services 
if these carriers are unable to pay the money that they owe to us or shift their business to other fiber companies or otherwise reduce their use of broadwing s network  our sales and financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
revenue from broadwing s ten largest customers accounted for approximately of total revenue since the acquisition 
in addition  a significant portion of broadband s revenue is derived from communications carriers 
revenue from communications carriers accounted for of broadwing s total revenue in most of broadwing s arrangements with large customers do not provide broadwing with guarantees that customer usage will be maintained at current levels 
industry pressures have caused communications carriers to look aggressively for ways to cut costs which has resulted in reduced demand and reduced prices 
in addition  construction of their own facilities by certain broadwing s customers  construction of additional facilities by competitors or further consolidation in the communications industry involving broadwing s customers could lead those customers to reduce or cease their use of broadwing s network 
to the extent these large customers cease to employ broadwing s network to deliver their services  or cannot pay outstanding accounts receivable balances  our sales and financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
broadwing also may be required to expend substantial sums to enforce its contractual rights 
because broadwing is dependent on limited sources of supply for certain key network components  the inability of those suppliers to provide needed equipment or services could materially adverse affect our sales and operating expenses 
where possible and practical  broadwing utilizes commercially available technologies and products from a variety of vendors  including our equipment division 
there can be no assurance that broadwing will be able to obtain equipment from these vendors in the future 
if broadwing cannot obtain adequate replacement equipment or service  or an acceptable alternate vendor  we could experience a material adverse impact on our sales if such losses affect our ability to provide our customers service or if such losses require us to invest in higher cost network alternatives 

table of contents network failure and transmission delays and errors could expose broadwing to potential liability that could materially adversely affect our sales and financial condition 
broadwing s network utilizes a variety of communication equipment  software  operating protocols and components of others networks for the high speed transmission of data and voice traffic among various locations 
such equipment  software and physical locations could malfunction  suffer physical damage or otherwise become impaired 
broadwing is held to high quality and delivery standards in its customer contracts 
network failures or delays in data delivery could cause service interruptions resulting in losses to broadwing s customers 
failures or delays could expose broadwing to claims by its customers that could have a material impact on our sales and financial condition 
increased competition could adversely affect broadwing s sales  profitability and cash flow 
there is substantial competition in the communications industry 
competition may intensify due to the efforts of existing competitors to address difficult market conditions through reduced pricing  bundled offerings or otherwise  as well as a result of the entrance of new competitors and the development of new technologies  products and services 
price competition has been intense and may further intensify 
if broadwing cannot offer reliable  value added services on a price competitive basis in any of its markets  it could experience a decline in revenue 
in addition  if broadwing does not keep pace with technological advances or fails to respond timely to changes in competitive factors in the industry  it could lose market share or experience a decline in its revenue and profit margins 
broadwing faces significant competition from companies such as at t corp  mci  sprint corporation  level communications  inc  qwest communications international  inc  wiltel communications group  inc 
and regional phone companies 
the significant capacity of these competitors could result in decreasing prices even if the demand for higher bandwidth services increases 
in addition  some competitors are experiencing financial difficulties or are in bankruptcy reorganization 
competitors in financial distress or competitors emerging from bankruptcy with lower cost capital structures and substantial excess capacity in most markets could exacerbate downward pricing pressure in the communications industry 
the effect of the foregoing competition could have a material adverse impact on our sales  profitability and cash flow 
risks related to our communications equipment division our optical equipment and services business has been adversely affected by recent developments in the communications industry and the economy in general 
for much of the last five years the market for our optical equipment has been influenced by the entry into the communications business of a substantial number of new companies 
in the united states  that was due largely to changes in the regulatory environment  in particular those brought about by the telecommunications act of these new companies raised billions of dollars in capital  much of which they invested in new equipment  causing an acceleration in the growth of the market for communications equipment 
recently  we have seen a significant reversal of this trend  including the failure of a large number of the new entrants and a sharp contraction of the availability of capital to the industry 
bankruptcies in the industry have slowed expenditures and investments 
this  in turn  has caused a substantial reduction in demand for communications equipment  including our products 
this industry trend has been compounded by the slowing not only of the us economy but the economies in virtually all of the countries in which we are marketing our products 
the combination of these factors has caused customers to become more conservative in their capital investment plans and more uncertain about their future purchases 
as a consequence  we are facing a market that is both reduced in absolute size and more difficult to predict and plan for 

table of contents we expect the factors described above to affect our business  for at least several quarters  in significant ways compared to the recent past it is likely that our markets will be characterized by reduced capital expenditures by our customers  our ability to forecast the volume and product mix of our sales will be substantially reduced  and we will continue to experience price pressures 
we are exposed to the credit risk of our customers and the failure of any of those customers to pay us what they owe us could materially adverse affect our revenues and financial condition 
industry and economic conditions have weakened the financial position of some of our customers and potential customers 
to sell equipment and services to some of these customers  we may be required to extend favorable payment terms 
while we monitor these situations carefully and attempt to take appropriate measures to protect ourselves  it is possible that we may have to write down or write off doubtful accounts 
such write downs or write offs  if large  could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and financial condition 
we have provided extended credit terms to some of our customers 
while we have done only a limited amount of this type of financing in the past  the increasingly competitive environment in which we operate may require us to engage in more competitive financing arrangements 
our ability to recognize revenue from financed sales will depend on the relative financial condition of the specific customer  among other factors 
any change in the financial condition of our customers could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and financial condition 
the markets for optical networking products are evolving and uncertain and our business will suffer if they do not develop as we expect 
most carriers have made substantial investments in their current network infrastructure  and many have announced significant reductions in their capital expenditures 
it is uncertain when these reductions in capital expenditures will be reversed 
in addition  carriers may elect to remain with current network architectures or to adopt new architectures in limited stages or over extended periods of time 
a decision by a customer to purchase our optical networking solutions will involve a significant capital investment 
we will need to convince these carriers of the benefits of our solutions for future network deployment 
we cannot be certain that a viable market for our products will further develop or be sustainable 
if this market does not develop further  or develops more slowly than we expect  our business  financial condition and results of operations would be harmed 
the markets we serve are highly competitive and we may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability 
competition in optical networking markets is intense 
these markets have historically been dominated by large companies  such as alcatel  cisco  lucent  ciena and nortel 
we may face competition from other large communications equipment companies that are currently in or that may enter our market 
in addition  a number of private companies have announced plans for new all optical products to address the same network needs that our products address 
due to several factors  including the lengthy sales cycle  testing and deployment process and manufacturing constraints associated with large scale deployments of our products  we may lose any advantage that we might have by being an early provider of all optical network products prior to achieving market penetration 
many of our competitors have longer operating histories  greater name recognition  larger customer bases and greater financial  technical and sales and marketing resources than we do and may be able to undertake more extensive marketing efforts  adopt more aggressive pricing policies and provide more vendor financing than we can 
moreover  our competitors may foresee the course of market developments more accurately than we do and could develop new technologies that compete with our products or render our products obsolete 
due to the rapidly evolving markets in which we compete  additional competitors with significant market presence and financial 
table of contents resources may enter our markets  further intensifying competition 
in order to compete effectively  we must  among other things  deliver products that provide high reliability  provide an overall cost effective solution for carriers  reduce operating costs  increase network capability easily and efficiently with minimal disruption  operate with existing equipment and network designs  reduce the complexity of the network in which they are installed by decreasing the amount of equipment required  and provide effective network management 
in addition  we believe that a knowledge of the infrastructure requirements applicable to carriers  experience in working with carriers to develop new services for their customers  and an ability to provide vendor financing are important competitive factors in our market 
we have limited knowledge of specific carriers infrastructure requirements and limited experience in working with carriers to develop new services 
in addition  we currently provide only a limited vendor sponsored financing program 
many of our competitors  however  are able to offer more complete financing programs  which may influence prospective customers to purchase from our competitors rather than from us 
if we are unable to compete successfully against our current and future competitors  we may have difficulty obtaining customers  and could experience price reductions  order cancellations  increased expenses and reduced gross margins  any one of which would harm our revenue and profitability 
the communications industry is subject to government regulations that could harm our business 
the federal communications commission  or fcc  has jurisdiction over the entire communications industry and  as a result  our products and our customers products are subject to fcc rules and regulations 
current and future fcc rules and regulations affecting communications services  our products or our customers businesses or products could negatively affect our business 
in addition  international regulatory standards could impair our ability to develop products for international carriers in the future 
delays caused by our compliance with regulatory requirements could result in postponements or cancellations of product orders  which would harm our revenue and profitability 
further  we cannot be sure that we will be successful in obtaining or maintaining any regulatory approvals that may  in the future  be required to operate our business 
risks related to product manufacturing we have transitioned a substantial portion of our manufacturing capability to an outside party as part of a sole source manufacturing outsource agreement 
if we are unable to manage our manufacturing out sourcing arrangement effectively  or if we do not accurately project demand  our revenue and profitability could be harmed 
our future operating results will depend on our ability to develop and manufacture our products cost effectively 
to do so  we will have to develop  with our outsource partner  manufacturing processes that will allow us to produce sufficient quantities of products at competitive prices 
if we are unable to manage our manufacturing capacity or if we do not accurately project demand  we will have insufficient capacity or excess capacity  either of which will seriously harm our business 
there are numerous risks associated with outsourcing manufacturing capabilities  including  among other things  the following 
table of contents difficulties in achieving adequate yields from new manufacturing lines  the inability to meet customer delivery requirements during the transition period  and increased warranty costs due to reductions in quality control 
we currently have limited internal production capacity and we will rely on celestica to meet our production specifications to fill orders on a timely basis 
under the terms of the contract  we will provide celestica with demand forecasts up to six months prior to scheduled delivery to our customers 
if we overestimate our requirements  we may be subject to certain cancellation penalties or be required to purchase quantities in excess of our needs 
if we underestimate our requirements  celestica may not have adequate inventory to meet our production need which could result in shipment delays to our customers or we could be subject to additional charges 
we depend on sole source and limited source suppliers for several key components 
if we are unable to obtain these components on a timely basis  we will be unable to meet our customers product delivery requirements  which would harm our business 
our products include several key components from single or limited sources 
from time to time  there have been industry wide shortages of some optical components 
furthermore  given current economic conditions  several suppliers have made the decision to no longer support certain component manufacturing or have ceased operations entirely 
if any of our sole or limited source suppliers experiences capacity constraints  work stoppages or any other reduction or disruption in output  including ceasing operations entirely  they may be unable to meet our delivery schedule 
our suppliers may enter into exclusive arrangements with our competitors  be acquired by our competitors  go out of business  stop selling their products or components to us at commercially reasonable prices  refuse to sell their products or components to us at any price or be unable to obtain or have difficulty obtaining components for their products from their suppliers  and we may be unable to develop alternative sources for the components 
even if alternate suppliers are available  identifying them is often difficult and time consuming 
we have key components that are available from only one qualified supplier 
the process of qualifying vendors can take a significant amount of time and is not always successful 
if we do not qualify multiple vendors or receive critical components in a timely manner  we will be unable to manufacture our products in a timely manner and would  therefore  be unable to meet customers product delivery requirements 
any failure to meet a customer s delivery requirements could harm our reputation and decrease our sales and profitability 
some of our competitors are also our suppliers and if our supply relationship with them deteriorates  it could limit our access to key components and harm our sales 
some of our component suppliers are both our primary source for those components and major competitors in the market for communications equipment 
for example  we buy some of our key components from lucent and alcatel  each of which offers communications systems and equipment that compete with our products 
our business  financial condition and results of operations could be harmed if these supply relationships were to change in any manner adverse to us 

table of contents risks related to our products our products may have defects that we discover only after full deployment  which could seriously harm our business 
optical products are complex and are designed to be deployed in large quantities across complex networks 
because of the nature of the products  they can only be fully tested when completely deployed in large networks with high amounts of traffic 
our customers may discover errors or defects in the hardware or the software  or our products may not operate as expected  after they have been fully deployed 
if we are unable to fix defects or other problems that may be identified in full deployment  we would experience  among other things loss of  or delay in revenue  loss of existing customers  failure to attract new customers or achieve market acceptance  diversion of development resources  increased service and warranty costs  legal actions by our customers  and increased insurance costs 
defects  integration issues or other performance problems in our products could result in financial or other damages to our customers or could negatively affect market acceptance for our products 
our customers could also seek damages for losses from us  which  if the customers were successful  would seriously harm our sales and profitability 
a product liability claim brought against us  even if unsuccessful  would likely be time consuming and costly and would put a strain on our management and resources 
our equipment business will suffer if we do not respond rapidly to technological changes 
the market for network communications equipment is characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product introductions and changes in customer requirements 
we may not be able to respond quickly or effectively to these developments 
we may experience design  manufacturing  marketing and other difficulties that could delay or prevent our development  introduction or marketing of new products and enhancements 
the constant introduction of new products by competitors  market acceptance of products based on new or alternative technologies or the emergence of new industry standards has led to significant inventory write downs and could render our existing or future products obsolete 
in developing our products  we have made  and will continue to make  assumptions about the industry standards that may be adopted by our competitors and potential customers 
if the standards adopted are different from those that we have chosen to support  market acceptance of our products may be significantly reduced or delayed and our business will be seriously harmed 
in addition  the introduction of products incorporating new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards could render our existing products obsolete 
in order to introduce products incorporating new technologies and new industry standards  we must be able to gain access to the latest technologies of our suppliers  other network vendors and our potential customers 
any failure to gain access to the latest technologies would seriously harm our sales and profitability 

table of contents our business will be adversely affected if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights from third party challenges 
we rely on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights 
we also enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees  consultants and corporate partners and control access to and distribution of our software  documentation and other proprietary information 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology 
monitoring unauthorized use of our technology is difficult  and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent unauthorized use of our technology  particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 
failure to protect our intellectual property could allow others to gain a competitive advantage and adversely affect our sales 
we are involved in an intellectual property dispute and in the future we may become involved in similar disputes  which could subject us to significant liability  divert the time and attention of our management and prevent us from selling our products 
on july   ciena filed a lawsuit in the us district court for the district of delaware alleging that we are willfully infringing three of ciena s patents 
ciena sought injunctive relief  monetary damages including treble damages  as well as costs of the lawsuit  including attorneys fees 
we have filed an answer to the complaint  as well as counter claims alleging  among other things  invalidity and or unenforceability of the patents in question 
a final adverse determination in  or settlement of  the ciena litigation could involve the payment of significant amounts by us  or could include terms in addition to payments  such as a redesign of some of our products  either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
in february  jury trials were held on the issues of infringement and invalidity of the patents 
corvis all optical networking products were found not to infringe two of ciena s wdm system patents 
corvis inverse multiplexing transceiver product  which can be used along with our all optical networking products  was found to infringe a third ciena patent on bit rate transparent devices 
the jury did not reach a verdict on a fourth ciena wdm system patent  but on retrial  a jury found that the manner in which certain corvis oc transmitters and receivers convert the signals from optical form to an electronic form and back again infringed the ciena patent 
the jury verdicts are interim verdicts  and additional trial court proceedings remain before a decision is made by the court and judgment is entered 
although we believe that we will ultimately prevail in this litigation  we cannot be certain that the interim jury verdicts of infringement will be overturned  or that infringement of other patents in the suit will not be found in later legal proceedings 
to the extent it is necessary  a trial to determine damages will be held following any appeals 
such appeals can take up to a year or more before final determination 
based on the current status of the litigation  we cannot reasonably predict the likelihood of any final outcome 

table of contents we or our customers may be a party to additional litigation in the future to protect our intellectual property or to respond to allegations that we infringe others intellectual property 
any parties asserting that our products infringe upon their proprietary rights would force us to defend ourselves and possibly our customers against the alleged infringement 
if we are unsuccessful in any intellectual property litigation  we could be subject to significant liability for damages and loss of our proprietary rights 
intellectual property litigation  regardless of its success  would likely be time consuming and expensive to resolve and would divert management time and attention 
in addition  we could be forced to do one or more of the following stop selling  incorporating or using products that include the challenged intellectual property  obtain from the owner of the infringed intellectual property right a license to sell or use the relevant technology  which license may not be available on reasonable terms  or at all  or redesign those products that use the technology  which may be time consuming or impossible 
if we are forced to take any of these actions  our business may be seriously harmed as a result of reduced sales or increased operating expenses 
if necessary licenses of third party technology for use in our equipment business are not available to us or are very expensive  our business would be seriously harmed 
we currently license technology for our use in our equipment business  and from time to time we may be required to license additional technology  from third parties to sell or develop our products and product enhancements 
our existing and future third party licenses may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
our inability to maintain or obtain any third party license required to sell or develop our products and product enhancements could require us to obtain substitute technology of lower quality or performance standards or at greater cost  any of which could seriously harm our sales and profitability 
our equipment business will suffer if we fail to properly manage our size and continually improve our internal controls and systems 
we continue to adjust the scope of our operations  as well as our manufacturing and customer support capabilities  distribution channels and research and development capabilities 
adjustments have included significant staff reductions in both and  continuing in our ability to successfully offer our products and implement our business plan in a rapidly evolving market requires an effective planning and management process 
in order to manage our size properly  we must train  manage and retain qualified personnel  including engineers and research and development personnel  effectively plan and implement product portfolio improvements and innovations  manage our manufacturing operations  controls and reporting systems  effectively manage multiple relationships with our customers  suppliers and other third parties  and 
table of contents implement additional operational controls  reporting and financial systems and procedures 
failure to do any of the above in an efficient and timely manner could seriously harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
risks related to our financial results we have incurred significant losses since inception  and we expect losses to continue in the future 
we have incurred significant net losses since inception 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately billion 
we expect to incur significant losses in the near term 
we cannot be certain that we will ever achieve profitability 
we will need to generate significant revenue and control costs to achieve profitability 
the unpredictability of our quarterly results may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 
our revenue and operating results will vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors  many of which are outside of our control and any of which may cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate 
the primary factors  among other things  that may affect our quarterly results include the following demand for optical networking products and services  loss of customers or the ability to attract new customers  the timing and size of sales of our products and services  cancellation of or delays in customer orders  changes in our pricing policies or the pricing policies of our competitors  costs related to acquisitions of technology or businesses  and general economic conditions as well as those specific to the communications and related industries 
a delay in generating or recognizing revenue could cause significant variations in our operating results from quarter to quarter and could result in substantial operating losses 
it is possible that in some future quarters our results may be below the expectations of analysts and investors 
in this event  the price of our common stock will likely decrease 

table of contents if we become subject to unfair hiring claims we could incur substantial costs in defending ourselves or management s attention could be diverted away from our operations 
companies in our industry whose employees accept positions with competitors frequently claim that their competitors have engaged in unfair hiring practices 
we have received claims of this kind in the past  and we may receive claims of this kind in the future as we seek to hire qualified personnel 
we could incur substantial costs in defending ourselves or our employees against such claims  regardless of the merits of the claims 
in addition  defending ourselves from such claims could divert the attention of management away from our operations 
we may need additional capital to fund our existing and future operations 
if we are unable to obtain additional capital  we may be required to reduce the scope of our planned product development and marketing and sales efforts  which would harm our sales and profitability 
the development  marketing and sales of new products is expected to require a significant commitment of resources 
we may incur significant operating losses or expend significant amounts of capital if  among other things the market for our products develops more slowly than anticipated  we fail to establish market share or generate revenue  our capital expenditure forecasts change or prove inaccurate  and we need to respond to unforeseen challenges or take advantage of unanticipated opportunities 
as a result  we may need to raise additional capital 
to the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or debt securities  the issuance of such securities could result in dilution to our existing stockholders 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of debt securities  the terms of such debt could impose additional restrictions on our operations 
additional capital  if required  may not be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
if we are unable to obtain additional capital  we may be required to reduce the scope of our planned product development and marketing and sales efforts  which would harm our sales and profitability 
we depend on our key personnel to manage our business effectively 
if we are unable to retain our key personnel  our sales and financial condition could be harmed 
our future success depends upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key engineering  manufacturing  operations  sales  marketing and support personnel who have critical industry experience and relationships that we rely on to implement our business plan 
the loss of the services of any of our key employees  including dr 
david huber  our founder  chairman and chief executive officer  could delay the development and production of our products and negatively impact our ability to maintain customer relationships  which would harm our sales and financial condition 
forward looking statements our prospects are subject to uncertainties and risks 
this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements under the headings item business  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and elsewhere  within the meaning of the federal securities laws that also involve substantial uncertainties and risks 
our future results may differ materially from our historical results and actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements as a result of various risk factors 
readers should pay particular attention to the considerations described above 
readers should also carefully review the risk factors described in the other documents that we file from time to time with the securities and exchange commission 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk 
the following discussion about our market risk disclosures involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in forward looking statements 
we maintain instruments subject to interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate risk 
we categorize all of our market risk sensitive instruments as non trading or other instruments 

table of contents interest rate sensitivity we maintain a portfolio of cash equivalents in a variety of securities including commercial paper  certificates of deposit  money market funds and government and non government debt securities 
substantially all amounts are in money market funds as well as high grade  short term commercial paper and certificates of deposit  the value of which is generally not subject to interest rate changes 
we believe that a increase or decline in interest rates would not be material to our investment income or cash flows 
our long term debt obligations bear fixed interest rates 
however  our long term indebtedness obligations at december  totaled million  and  therefore  we do not consider the impact of any general interest rate changes to be significant 
foreign rate sensitivity we primarily operate in the united states  however  we have limited operations in european countries 
as a result  we may have sales in foreign currencies exposing us to foreign currency rate fluctuations 
for the fiscal year ended december   we recorded million of sales in a foreign currency 
we are exposed to the impact of foreign currency changes  associated with the euro  for our european subsidiaries financial instruments  which are limited to cash and cash equivalents 
it is the policy of management to fund foreign operations on a monthly basis  thus minimizing average cash and overnight investments in the euro 
at december   our european subsidiaries maintained cash and cash equivalents of approximately million euros 
during  we significantly reduced european operations  therefore  our foreign currency risk has been substantially reduced 
we believe that a increase or decline in the euro exchange ratio would not be material to cash and cash equivalent balances  interest income  or cash flows from consolidated operations
