item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we develop  market  license and support access infrastructure software and services that enable effective and efficient enterprise wide deployment  management and access of applications and information  including those designed for microsoft windows operating systems  for unix operating systems  such as sun solaris  hp ux or ibm aix  and for web based information systems  as well as web based desktop access 
our metaframe products permit organizations to provide access to windows based  web based  and unix applications regardless of a user s location  network connection or type of client hardware platforms 
we market and license our products primarily through multiple channels such as value added resellers  channel distributors  system integrators and independent software vendors  managed by our worldwide sales force 
we also promote our products through relationships with a wide variety of industry participants  including microsoft corporation 
acquisitions expertcity on december   we entered into a merger agreement with expertcity 
com  inc expertcity  a market leader in web based desktop access as well as a leader in web based training and customer assistance products 
on february   we acquired all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of expertcity from its stockholders by means of a merger of expertcity and a wholly owned subsidiary of ours with expertcity continuing as the surviving corporation 
subsequently  expertcity was merged into citrix online llc  our wholly owned limited liability company 
the results of operations of expertcity will be included in our results of operations beginning after february  we intend to continue expertcity s business operations utilizing its assets and staff 
the terms of the merger and the consideration received by expertcity s stockholders were the result of arm s length negotiations between expertcity and us 
prior to the merger  neither expertcity nor its stockholders had any material relationship with us  our subsidiaries or any of our affiliates  officers or directors or any associate of any of our officers or directors 
the consideration for this transaction was approximately million  comprised of approximately million in cash and approximately million shares of our common stock valued at approximately million 
the merger agreement provides for additional purchase price consideration of up to approximately million shares of our common stock to be issued to expertcity stockholders in the event certain revenue and other financial milestones are achieved by the expertcity business in for purposes of calculating the number of shares of our common stock issued to the expertcity stockholders  the merger agreement provides that shares of our common stock issued as initial consideration or as additional purchase price consideration be valued on the average closing price of our common stock for ten consecutive trading days ending two trading days prior to the closing of the merger  or approximately per share 
additional purchase price consideration earned by the expertcity stockholders  if any  will be calculated by dividing the amount earned pursuant to the merger agreement up to a maximum of million by approximately per share 
the fair value of the shares issued as additional purchase price consideration  if any  will be based on the market value of our common stock at the date that the shares are earned 
in addition to the purchase price  there were direct transaction costs associated with the merger of approximately million 
additional purchase price payments  if any  and direct transaction costs associated with the merger are expected to be recorded to goodwill 
the sources of funds for consideration paid in this transaction consisted of available cash and investments and our authorized common stock 
independent valuation specialists are conducting a valuation in order to assist us in determining the fair values of a significant portion of expertcity s net assets 
the work being performed by the independent valuation specialists was considered in our preliminary allocation of the purchase price summarized below 
under the purchase method of accounting  the total estimated purchase price was allocated to expertcity s net tangible and intangible assets based on their estimated fair values as of the date of the completion of the acquisition 
due to the preliminary nature of the allocation  amounts may be adjusted when 
table of contents the valuation is finalized  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations 
the estimated purchase price is preliminarily allocated as follows in thousands preliminary purchase price asset allocation life net assets acquired  n a intangible assets  years purchased in process research and development  expected to be expensed in goodwill  indefinite total purchase consideration  including direct transaction costs net assets acquired from expertcity consisted mainly of cash and investments  accounts receivable  deferred revenues and other current liabilities 
the fair values used in the preliminary purchase price allocation were based on estimated discounted future cash flows  royalty rates and historical data  among other information 
the estimated purchased in process research and development is expected to be expensed immediately upon the closing of the merger in accordance with financial accounting standards board  or fasb  interpretation no 
 applicability of fasb statement no 
to business combinations accounted for by the purchase method due to the fact that it pertains to technology that was not currently technologically feasible  meaning it had not reached the working model stage  did not contain all of the major functions planned for the product  was not ready for initial customer testing and had no alternative future use 
we expect to record approximately million of goodwill resulting from the acquisition  which will not be deductible for tax purposes 
acquisitions prior to in april  we acquired sequoia software corporation for million in cash 
sequoia provided xml based portal software 
the sequoia technology is a core component of our metaframe secure access manager software 
in february  we acquired all of the operating assets of innovex group  inc for approximately million 
on the date of the acquisition  we paid approximately million in cash  including closing costs 
under the terms of the acquisition agreement  we were required to pay the remaining purchase price  plus interest  if certain events occurred 
during  these events occurred and  as a result  we paid the remaining purchase price and the associated interest of million in cash in august and million in cash in february we have no remaining contingent obligations related to this acquisition 
we accounted for the sequoia and innovex acquisitions under the purchase method of accounting in accordance with accounting principles board  or apb  opinion no 
 accounting for business combinations 
we allocated the cost of the acquisitions to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values 
in the sequoia acquisition  a portion of the acquired intangible assets were related to research and development that had not reached technological feasibility and for which there was no alternative future use 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and 
table of contents related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
we base these estimates on our historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  and these estimates form the basis for our judgments concerning the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
we periodically evaluate these estimates and judgments based on available information and experience 
actual results could differ from our estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
if actual results significantly differ from our estimates  our financial condition and results of operations could be materially impacted 
we believe that the accounting policies described below are critical to understanding our business  results of operations and financial condition because they involve more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  and if different estimates that could have been used  or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically  could materially impact our consolidated financial statements 
we have discussed the development  selection and application of our critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors  and our audit committee has reviewed our disclosure relating to our critical accounting policies in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
other significant accounting policies  primarily those with lower levels of uncertainty than those discussed below  are also critical to understanding our consolidated financial statements 
the notes to our consolidated financial statements contain additional information related to our accounting policies and should be read in conjunction with this discussion 
revenue recognition 
the accounting related to revenue recognition in the software industry is complex and affected by interpretations of the rules and an understanding of industry practices  both of which are subject to change 
as a result  revenue recognition accounting rules require us to make significant judgments 
in addition  our judgment is required in assessing the probability of collection  which is generally based on evaluation of customer specific information  historical collection experience and economic market conditions 
we sell most of our software products bundled with an initial subscription for software license updates that provide the end user with free enhancements and upgrades to the licensed product on a when and if available basis 
customers may also elect to purchase technical support  product training or consulting services 
we allocate revenue to software license updates and any other undelivered elements of the arrangement based on vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe  of fair value of each element and such amounts are deferred until the applicable delivery criteria and other revenue recognition criteria described above have been met 
the balance of the revenue  net of any discounts inherent in the arrangement  is allocated to the delivered software product using the residual method and recognized at the outset of the arrangement as the software licenses are delivered 
if we cannot objectively determine the fair value of each undelivered element based on vsoe  we defer revenue recognition until all elements are delivered  all services have been performed  or until fair value can be objectively determined 
we must apply judgment in determining all elements of the arrangement and in determining the vsoe of fair value for each element  considering the price charged for each product or applicable renewal rates for software license updates 
in the normal course of business  we do not permit product returns  but we do provide most of our distributors and value added resellers with stock balancing and price protection rights 
stock balancing rights permit distributors to return products to us  subject to ordering an equal dollar amount of our other products 
price protection rights require that we grant retroactive price adjustments for inventories of our products held by distributors or resellers if we lower our prices for such products 
we establish provisions for estimated returns for stock balancing and price protection rights  as well as other sales allowances  concurrently with the recognition of revenue 
the provisions are established based upon consideration of a variety of factors  including  among other things  recent and historical return rates for both specific products and distributors  estimated distributor inventory levels by product  the impact of any new product releases and projected economic conditions 
actual product returns for stock balancing and price protection provisions incurred are  however  dependent upon future events  including the amount of stock balancing activity by our distributors 
table of contents and the level of distributor inventories at the time of any price adjustments 
we continually monitor the factors that influence the pricing of our products and distributor inventory levels and make adjustments to these provisions when we believe actual returns and other allowances could differ from established reserves 
our ability to recognize revenue upon shipment to our distributors is predicated on our ability to reliably estimate future stock balancing returns 
if actual experience or changes in market condition impairs our ability to estimate returns  we would be required to defer the recognition of revenue until the delivery of the product to the end user 
allowances for estimated product returns amounted to approximately million at december  and million at december  the decrease in allowances for estimated product returns is a reflection of the decrease in stock rotation experience primarily due to a reduction in packaged product inventory held by our distributors resulting from an increase in enterprise customer license arrangements  which are typically delivered electronically 
we have not reduced and have no current plans to reduce our prices for inventory currently held by distributors or resellers 
accordingly  there were no reserves required for price protection at december  or december  we record estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs and incentive offerings including volume based incentives 
if market conditions were to decline  we could take actions to increase our customer incentive offerings  which could result in an incremental reduction to our revenue at the time the incentive is offered 
core and product technology assets 
we review acquired core and product technology assets for impairment on a periodic basis by comparing the estimated net realizable value to the unamortized cost of the technology 
the core and product technology assets acquired in our sequoia acquisition form the basis for our metaframe secure access manager product 
the recoverability of this technology is primarily dependent upon our ability to commercialize this product 
the estimated net realizable value of the purchased sequoia technology is based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows associated with our metaframe secure access manager 
our revenues are forecasted based on historical sales  data received from rate projections on our installed customer base and estimates from our sales channels and end customer sales force 
our assumptions about future revenues and expenses require significant judgment associated with the forecast of metaframe secure access manager 
actual revenues and costs could vary significantly from these forecasted amounts 
as of december   we estimated that the net realizable value of these core and product technology assets is greater than the million unamortized cost of these assets 
if these products are not ultimately accepted by our customers  and there is no alternative future use for this technology  we could determine that some or all of the remaining million carrying value of the related core and product technology assets are impaired 
in the event of impairment  we would be required to incur a charge to earnings that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
on february  we acquired expertcity  which is expected to result in additional core and product technology assets during the first quarter of for more information see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations acquisitions 
goodwill 
at december   we had million in indefinite lived goodwill primarily related to our acquisition of sequoia 
we operate in a single market consisting of the design  development  marketing and support of access infrastructure software and services for enterprise applications 
our revenues are derived from sales in the americas  europe  the middle east and africa  or emea  and asia pacific regions 
these three geographic regions constitute our reportable segments 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our geographic segments 
we evaluate goodwill along these geographic segments  which represent our reporting units 
substantially all of our goodwill at december  was associated with our americas reportable segment 
on january   we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
as a result of adopting sfas no 
 our goodwill is no longer amortized but is subject to an annual impairment test 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we ceased amortizing goodwill with a net book value at january  of million  including million of acquired workforce previously classified as purchased intangible assets 
excluding goodwill  we have no intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives 
we use judgment in assessing goodwill for impairment 
goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually  or sooner if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount could exceed fair value 
fair values are based on discounted cash flows using a discount rate determined by our management to be 
table of contents consistent with industry discount rates and the risks inherent in our current business model 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we completed the required impairment tests of goodwill at the date of adoption and annually as required 
there were no impairment charges recorded as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
or annual impairment tests 
due to uncertain market conditions and potential changes in our strategy and product portfolio  it is possible that the forecasts we use to support our goodwill could change in the future  which could result in non cash charges that would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
on february  we acquired expertcity  which is expected to result in additional goodwill during the first quarter of for more information concerning the acquisition of expertcity  see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations acquisitions 
current and deferred tax assets 
we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements 
at december   the company has million in net deferred tax assets 
sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  requires a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets reported if  based on the weight of the evidence  it is not more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
management reviews deferred tax assets periodically for recoverability and makes estimates and judgments regarding the expected geographic sources of taxable income  gains from investments  as well as tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
we determined that a valuation allowance of approximately million relating to foreign tax credit carryovers was necessary to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that will more likely than not be realized 
if the estimates and assumptions used in our determination change in the future  we could be required to revise our estimates of the valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets and adjust our provisions for additional income taxes 
in the ordinary course of global business  there are transactions for which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain  thus judgment is required in determining the worldwide provision for income taxes 
we provide for income taxes on transactions based on our estimate of the probable liability 
we adjust our provision as appropriate for changes that impact our underlying judgments 
changes that impact provision estimates include such items as jurisdictional interpretations on tax filing positions based on the results of tax audits and general tax authority rulings 
due to the evolving nature of tax rules combined with the large number of jurisdictions in which we operate  it is possible that our estimates of our tax liability and the realizability of our deferred tax assets could change in the future  which may result in additional tax liabilities and adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
stock based compensation disclosures our stock option program is a broad based  long term retention program that is intended to attract and reward talented employees and align stockholder and employee interests 
the number and frequency of stock option grants are based on competitive practices  our operating results  the number of options available for grant under our shareholder approved plans  and other factors 
all employees are eligible to participate in the stock option program 
as of december   we had four stock based compensation plans 
we grant stock options for a fixed number of shares to employees with an exercise price equal to or above the market value of the shares at the date of grant 
as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  we apply the intrinsic value method under apb opinion no 
and related interpretations in accounting for our plans 
accordingly  no compensation cost has been recognized for our fixed stock plans and our stock purchase plan 
however  the impact on our consolidated financial statements from the use of options is reflected in the calculation of earnings per share in the form of dilution

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth our consolidated statements of income data and presentation of that data as a percentage of change from period to period 
year ended december  compared to compared to revenues software licenses software license updates services other total net revenues cost of revenues excluding amortization  presented separately below gross margin operating expenses research and development sales  marketing and support general and administrative amortization of intangible assets in process research and development total operating expenses income from operations interest income interest expense other income expense  net income before income taxes income taxes net income not meaningful 
net revenues 
our operations consist of the design  development  marketing and support of access infrastructure software and services that enable effective and efficient enterprise wide deployment and management of applications and information 
net revenues include the following categories software licenses  software license updates  services  and other 
software licenses primarily represents fees related to the licensing of our metaframe products  additional user licenses and management products such as load balancing and resource management products 
these amounts are reflected net of sales allowances and provisions for stock balancing return rights 
software license updates consists of fees related to our subscription advantage program our terminology for pcs that are recognized ratably over the term of the contract  which is typically to months 
subscription advantage is an annual renewable program that provides subscribers with automatic delivery of software upgrades  enhancements and maintenance releases when and if they become available during the term of the subscription 
services consist primarily of technical support services revenue recognized ratably over the contract term  revenue from product training and certification  and consulting services revenue related to implementation of our software products  which are recognized as the services are provided 
in may  we entered into a five year joint license  development and marketing agreement with the microsoft corporation  which expired in may other represents the royalty fees recognized in connection with the microsoft development agreement 

table of contents the million increase in net revenues during was due primarily to a significant increase in revenues from software license updates mainly due to the continued acceptance of our renewable subscription advantage program 
to a lesser extent  the increase was due to an increase in software licenses  primarily of citrix metaframe presentation server  particularly under enterprise customer license arrangements 
also  the increase over was partially due to weakness during in packaged product sales to our distributors and resellers  associated with a reduction in packaged product inventory held by our distributors and the overall weakness in it spending during these increases were partially offset by a decrease in other revenue associated with the expiration of the microsoft development agreement in may we currently expect software license updates revenue to continue to increase as we invest in customer care teams and other programs to increase subscription advantage renewal rates in also  we currently expect subscription advantage to continue to be of strategic importance to our business in because it fosters long term customer relationships and gives us improved visibility and predictability due to the recurring nature of this revenue stream 
the million decrease in net revenues during compared to was due primarily to a decrease in software licenses due mainly to a decrease in revenue from metaframe presentation server 
this resulted from a decrease in packaged product sales due to an overall weakness in it spending and a reduction in packaged product inventory held by our distributors 
the decrease in packaged product sales was partially offset by an increase in software license updates due to increased customer acceptance of our subscription advantage program 
in addition  the decrease in net revenue also resulted from a significant decline in other revenue due to the expiration of the microsoft development agreement in may deferred revenues  primarily related to citrix subscription advantage and services revenues  increased approximately million compared to december  the significant increase was due primarily to increased renewals of citrix subscription advantage  as well as an increase in enterprise customer license arrangements  which typically result in a greater portion of revenue being deferred 
we currently expect citrix subscription advantage renewals to continue to increase and as a result we currently expect deferred revenue to also increase in international and segment revenues 
international revenues sales outside of the united states accounted for approximately of our net revenues for the year ended december   of our net revenues for the year ended december   and of our net revenues for the year ended december  an analysis of our geographic segment net revenue as a percentage of net revenue is presented below year ended december  revenue revenue growth growth to to americas emea asia pacific other consolidated net revenues our americas segment is comprised of the united states  canada and latin america 
defined as europe  middle east and africa 
represents royalty fees in connection with the microsoft development agreement  which expired during may with respect to our geographic segment revenues  the increase in net revenues during as compared to  was due primarily to the factors mentioned above across all geographic segments 
the decrease in net revenues during as compared to was due primarily to the factors mentioned above  particularly in europe and the united states 
for additional information on international revenues  please refer to note to our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents cost of revenues 
cost of revenues consisted primarily of the cost of royalties  product media and duplication  manuals  packaging materials and shipping expense 
cost of revenues also consisted of compensation and other personnel related costs of generating services revenues 
our cost of revenues excludes amortization of core technology  which is shown as a component of amortization expense in our accompanying consolidated statements of income 
cost of revenues for remained relatively unchanged compared to during  we implemented a new enterprise resource planning system 
as a result of this implementation  we have an enhanced ability to obtain information regarding personnel related costs of generating services revenues 
the million decrease in the cost of revenues for as compared to  is primarily attributable to our ability to identify certain non revenue generating services expenses and classify such costs as operating expenses 
enterprise customer license arrangements are typically fulfilled with a nominal level of product media and the licenses are delivered electronically 
the cost of fulfilling such sales is less than traditional packaged product sales  thereby reducing costs of revenues as a percentage of revenue 
during  certain royalty agreements are expected to expire 
although these expirations are expected to reduce certain costs of royalties  cost of revenues will fluctuate from time to time based on a number of factors discussed above 
gross margin 
gross margin as a percent of revenue was for  for and for the increase in gross margin as a percentage of net revenue from to was primarily due to the decrease in cost of revenues as discussed above 
we currently anticipate that in the next months  gross margin as a percentage of net revenues will remain relatively unchanged as compared with current levels 
during  certain royalty agreements are expected to expire  however  gross margin will fluctuate from time to time based on a number of factors attributable to the cost of revenues as discussed above 
operating expenses 
as further discussed below  during we reduced our worldwide workforce by approximately approximately employees and consolidated certain functions from our salt lake city  utah and columbia  maryland facilities into our fort lauderdale  florida facility 
as a result of such actions  we incurred expenses of approximately million  primarily for severance and related facility expenses  of which approximately million were included in research and development expenses  million were included in sales  marketing and support expenses and million were included in general and administrative expenses 
our results of operations are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
in order to minimize adverse impacts on our operating results  we generally initiate our hedging of currency exchange risks one year in advance of anticipated foreign currency expenses 
as a result of this policy  foreign currency denominated expenses will be higher or lower in the current year depending on the weakness or strength of the dollar in the prior year 
since the dollar was generally weak in  particularly against the euro and british pound sterling  we currently expect that operating expenses will be higher in but further dollar weakness in will not have a further material impact on our operating expenses until research and development expenses 
research and development expenses consisted primarily of personnel related costs 
we expensed all development costs included in the research and development of software products and enhancements to existing products as incurred except for certain core technologies with alternative future use 
research and development expenses decreased approximately million during  primarily due to severance  relocation and reduced headcount costs and related facility charges associated with the consolidation of our salt lake city  utah and columbia  maryland development teams into our remaining engineering facilities in fort lauderdale  florida during these decreases were partially offset by an increase in costs for external consultants and developers 
research and development expenses increased approximately million during primarily from an increase in staffing and associated salaries that primarily related to the sequoia acquisition in the second quarter of  additional costs for severance for the worldwide workforce reduction  and relocation and facility related charges associated with the consolidation of our salt lake city  utah and columbia  maryland development teams into our remaining engineering facilities during these increases were partially offset by a reduction in costs for third party software  external consultants and developers and a decrease in personnel costs due to the worldwide workforce reduction 

table of contents sales  marketing and support expenses 
sales  marketing and support expenses increased approximately million during primarily due to increases in commissions and other variable compensation costs due to the achievement of targeted sales goals 
in addition  to a lesser extent  there was an increase in marketing program costs resulting primarily from our launch of a worldwide brand awareness and advertising campaign 
to a lesser extent the increase was due to increases in product training costs and distributor commissions associated with the increase in our software license updates 
we currently expect sales  marketing and support expenses to increase as we continue our worldwide brand awareness and advertising campaign and invest in sales and marketing initiatives 
sales  marketing and support expenses increased approximately million during primarily from additional end customer sales personnel hired during and particularly for medium to large customers  an increase in staffing and associated salaries related to the sequoia acquisition during  and severance charges associated with our worldwide workforce reduction 
to a lesser extent  the reallocation of certain non revenue generating services expense from cost of revenues to operating expenses also contributed to the increase 
the increase was partially offset by a reduction in marketing costs due to a refocus in marketing programs spending based on the current operating environment  and the reallocation of certain overhead expenses to other departments  primarily depreciation expense to certain general and administrative cost centers 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses decreased approximately million during due primarily to a decrease in depreciation expense resulting from asset maturities and the abandonment of certain leasehold improvements during and a decrease in our provision for doubtful accounts 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in incentive compensation resulting from the achievement of our financial targets and an increase in insurance costs 
general and administrative expenses increased approximately million during primarily from a reallocation of certain overhead expenses from other departments to general and administrative expenses  primarily depreciation expense from certain sales  marketing and support cost centers into certain general and administrative cost centers 
amortization of intangible assets 
the million decrease in amortization of intangible assets during was substantially due to the adoption of sfas no 
 which requires that we no longer amortize goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives but subject them to an annual impairment test 
other intangibles of million at january  continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
as of december   we had unamortized identified intangible assets with estimable useful lives in the net amount of million 
amortization expense totaled million during and and million during we currently expect amortization expense to increase during as a result of our acquisition of expertcity 
for more information regarding the expertcity acquisition see  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations acquisitions and note to our consolidated financial statements 
in process research and development 
in april  we acquired sequoia  for which million of the purchase price was allocated to in process research and development  or ipr d 
the amounts allocated to ipr d had not yet reached technological feasibility  had no alternative future use and were written off at the time of the acquisition 
there were no write offs of ipr d during and as a result of the expertcity acquisition in february  we allocated approximately million to ipr d that was written off at the closing of the acquisition 
for more information regarding the acquisition  see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations acquisitions and note to our consolidated financial statements 
interest income 
interest income decreased approximately million during and approximately million during primarily due to decreases in interest rates 
during  we terminated an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of million and in december  we sold the investments underlying this swap agreement 
as a result  the decrease in interest income during was partially offset by interest income of approximately million recognized as a result of the termination of this interest rate swap and the hedging relationship 
for more information see liquidity and capital resources and note 
table of contents to our consolidated financial statements 
during the first quarter of  we currently expect to use cash of approximately million for the redemption of our convertible subordinated debentures  and we paid approximately million in cash for the expertcity acquisition 
accordingly  we currently believe that our lower cash balances during will significantly reduce our interest income during for more information see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations acquisitions and liquidity and capital resources and note to our consolidated financial statements 
interest expense 
interest expense remained relatively unchanged during compared to and primarily represented non cash interest accretion on our convertible subordinated debentures 
the million decrease in interest expense for as compared to was due primarily to interest expense incurred during on contingent payments associated with the innovex acquisition 
we currently expect interest expense to decrease substantially during due to the anticipated redemption of our convertible subordinated debentures 
for more information see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations acquisitions and liquidity and capital resources and note to our consolidated financial statements 
other income expense  net 
other income expense  net is primarily comprised of remeasurement and foreign currency transaction gains losses  other than temporary declines in the value of our equity investments and realized gains losses on the sale of available for sale investments 
the million increase in other income expense  net during compared to was due primarily to a decline in remeasurement and foreign currency transaction losses  as well as  realized gains on the sale of certain of our available for sale investments 
the million decrease in other income expense  net for as compared to other income expense  net in was the result of million of losses from other than temporary declines in the fair value of certain of our equity investments and realized losses on the sale of available for sale securities  as well as approximately million in remeasurement and foreign currency transaction losses 
in march  we expect to incur a charge of approximately million for our remaining prepaid issuance costs as a result of the redemption of our convertible subordinated debentures 
for more information on our convertible subordinated debentures see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and note to our consolidated financial statements 
income taxes 
we maintain certain operational and administrative processes in overseas subsidiaries and our foreign earnings are taxed at lower foreign tax rates 
we do not expect to remit earnings from our foreign subsidiaries 
our effective tax rate increased to in from in primarily due to an increase in annual taxable income in our geographic locations that are taxed at a higher rate 
we currently expect our effective tax rate for to be approximately  however our effective tax rate may fluctuate throughout based on a number of factors including variations in estimated taxable income in our geographic locations  completed and potential acquisitions and changes in statutory tax rates  among others 
the decrease in the effective tax rate from in to in was due primarily to the adoption of sfas no 
 pursuant to which amortization of goodwill  which previously increased taxable income in the determination of our effective tax rate  ceased 
the reduction in the tax rate was also due to higher tax credits related to our foreign operations and research and development  and the cessation of revenues from the microsoft development agreement  which expired in may liquidity and capital resources during  we generated positive operating cash flows of million 
these cash flows related primarily to net income of million  adjusted for  among other things  tax benefits from the exercise of non statutory stock options and disqualifying dispositions of incentive stock options of million  non cash charges  including depreciation and amortization expenses of million  the accretion of original issue discount and amortization of financing costs on our convertible subordinated debentures of million and an aggregate increase in cash flow from our operating assets and liabilities of million  primarily resulting from an increase in deferred revenues due to the success of our subscription advantage program 
our investing activities provided million of cash consisting primarily of the net proceeds  after reinvestment  from sales and maturities of investments of million  partially offset by the expenditure of million 
table of contents for the purchase of property and equipment 
our financing activities used cash of million related primarily to the expenditure of million for the stock repurchase program  partially offset by the proceeds received from employee stock compensation plans of million

these cash flows related primarily to net income of million  adjusted for  among other things  tax benefits from the exercise of non statutory stock options and disqualifying dispositions of incentive stock options of million  non cash charges  including depreciation and amortization expenses of million  provisions for product returns of million primarily due to our stock rotation program and the accretion of original issue discount and amortization of financing costs on our convertible subordinated debentures of million 
these cash inflows were partially offset by an aggregate decrease in cash flow from our operating assets and liabilities of million 
our investing activities provided million of cash consisting primarily of the net proceeds  after reinvestment  from sales and maturities of investments of million  offset by the expenditure of million for the purchase of property and equipment and net cash paid for acquisitions a contingent payment resulting from the february innovex acquisition of approximately million 
our financing activities used cash of million related primarily to the expenditure of million for the stock and debt repurchase programs  partially offset by the proceeds received from employee stock compensation plans and the sale of put warrants of million 
cash and investments as of december   we had million in cash and investments  including million in cash and cash equivalents 
in addition  we had million in working capital at december  the million increase in cash and investments as compared to december   is due primarily to positive cash flow from operations and stock option exercises  partially offset by common stock repurchases and capital expenditures 
we generally invest our cash and cash equivalents in investment grade  highly liquid securities to allow for flexibility in the event of immediate cash needs 
our short and long term investments  other than million of equity investments  consist of interest bearing securities 
for more information on our cash and investments balances see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations certain factors that may affect future results and notes and to our consolidated financial statements 
included in short term investments  we have two aaa rated zero coupon corporate securities classified as held to maturity investments that are carried at the combined accreted value of approximately million at december  these securities mature on march  we do not recognize changes in fair value of the held to maturity investment unless a decline in the fair value is other than temporary  in which case we would recognize a loss in earnings 
there have been no losses associated with the corporate securities to date 
at december   the fair value of the securities was million and at december  the fair value of these securities was million 
in november  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of approximately million 
the interest rate swap agreement hedged a like amount of floating rate notes in our investment portfolio 
upon termination in of this interest rate swap agreement and the sale of the underlying investments  we received a cash payment of million as settlement under the swap agreement  recognized the gain of approximately million in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net of taxes 
accounts receivable  net at december   we had approximately million in accounts receivable  net of allowances 
the increase in accounts receivable as compared to is primarily attributed to an increase in sales  particularly in the last month of the quarter and a decrease in the allowance for returns reflective of the decrease in stock rotation experience 
we have experienced a decrease in stock rotation  primarily due to a reduction in packaged product inventory held by our distributors 
our provision for doubtful accounts also decreased as compared to due to account write offs in of amounts specifically reserved in 
table of contents from time to time  we could maintain individually significant accounts receivable balances from our distributors or customers  which are comprised of large business enterprises  governments and small and medium sized businesses 
if the financial condition of our distributors or customers deteriorates  our operating results could be adversely affected 
during and  no distributor or customer accounted for more than of our accounts receivable 
for more information regarding significant customers see note to our consolidated financial statements 
convertible subordinated debentures in march  we sold million principal amount at maturity of our zero coupon convertible subordinated debentures  due in march  in a private placement 
the debentures were priced with a yield to maturity of 
our net proceeds were approximately million  net of original issue discount and net of debt issuance costs of million 
except under limited circumstances  we will pay no interest prior to maturity 
the security holders can convert the debentures at any time on or before the maturity date at a conversion rate of shares of our common stock for each  principal amount at maturity of the debentures  subject to adjustment in certain events 
we can redeem the debentures on or after march   and the holders of the debentures can require us to repurchase the debentures on fixed dates and at set redemption prices equal to the issue price plus accrued original issue discount beginning on march  accordingly  we classified the debentures as a current liability on our consolidated balance sheet to reflect the amount that will be payable on demand within one year of the balance sheet date 
in  our board of directors approved a program authorizing us to spend up to million to repurchase debentures in open market purchases 
additionally  in our board of directors granted us the additional authority to repurchase up to million in debentures through private transactions  bringing our total repurchase authority up to million 
during  we repurchased  units for approximately million  which represents million in principal amount at maturity 
during  we adopted sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections earlier than required  and therefore we recorded an operating gain of approximately million during as a result of our debenture repurchases 
the board of directors limited authorization to repurchase the debentures allows us to repurchase debentures when market conditions are favorable 
there were no debenture repurchases during on february   we notified all holders of our debentures of our intent to call all of the outstanding debentures on march  as of the notice date  debentures in an aggregate principal amount of approximately million were outstanding 
the aggregate redemption price of the debentures will be approximately million 
we currently intend to use the proceeds from the maturity of our two aaa rated zero coupon corporate securities classified as held to maturity investments that mature on march  to fund the majority of the aggregate redemption price 
we believe that our cash on hand and the sale of certain of our available for sale investments will be sufficient to fund the balance of the aggregate redemption price 
additionally  at the date of redemption  we will incur a charge for the associated prepaid debt issuance costs of approximately million  which will be reflected in other income expense  net in march see cash and investments above 
stock repurchase program in april  our board of directors authorized an ongoing stock repurchase program 
during  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of an additional million under our stock repurchase program  increasing the total authority to million  the objective of which is to manage actual and anticipated dilution 
at december   approximately million was available to repurchase common stock pursuant to the stock repurchase program 
all shares repurchased are recorded as treasury stock 
we are authorized to make open market purchases of our common stock using general corporate funds 
additionally  from time to time  we have entered into structured stock repurchase arrangements with large financial institutions using general corporate funds as part of our share repurchase program in order to lower 
table of contents our average cost to acquire shares 
some of these programs include terms that require us to make up front payments to the counter party financial institution and result in the receipt of shares or a return of our payments at the maturity of the agreement  depending on market conditions 
we have also sold put warrants that entitled the holder of each warrant to sell to us  generally by physical delivery  one share of our common stock at a specified price 
the terms of certain put warrants and other repurchase transactions outstanding at december  required that put warrants and common stock subject to repurchase be presented separately in our december  balance sheet 
upon settlement  the transactions were reclassified to stockholders equity when the transactions matured or expired 
there were no put warrant obligations outstanding at december  we expended an aggregate of million and million during and  respectively  net of premiums received  under all stock repurchase transactions 
during  we took delivery of a total of  shares of outstanding common stock with an average per share price of  and during  we took delivery of a total of  shares of outstanding common stock with an average per share price of 
some of these shares were received pursuant to prepaid programs 
since inception of our stock repurchase programs  the average cost of shares acquired was per share compared to an average close price during open trading windows of per share 
as of december   we are a party to a contract that expires on or before march   and provides that for up front payments of million  we will receive a number of shares at monthly intervals based on the average closing price during the contract term less a specified discount 
due to the fact that the total shares to be received for the open repurchase agreements at december  is not determinable until the contracts mature in  the above price per share amounts exclude the remaining shares subject to the agreements 
during and  significant portions of our cash inflows were generated by our operations 
we currently expect this trend to continue throughout in february we paid cash of approximately million in connection with the closing of the acquisition of expertcity 
in march  we currently expect to pay in cash approximately million for the redemption of our outstanding debentures 
although these commitments will significantly deplete our existing cash and investments  we believe the balance of our existing cash and investments together with cash flow expected from operations will be sufficient to meet operating and capital expenditure requirements and the payment of the cash portion of any acquisition commitments for the next months 
future operating results and expected cash flow from operations could vary if we experience a decrease in customer demand or a decrease in customer acceptance of future product offerings 
we could from time to time seek to raise additional funds through the issuance of debt or equity securities 
we continue to search for suitable acquisition candidates and could acquire or make investments in companies we believe are related to our strategic objectives 
such investments could reduce our available working capital 
contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangement contractual obligations we have certain contractual obligations that are recorded as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements 
other items  such as operating lease obligations  are not recognized as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements  but are required to be disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at december  and the future periods in which such obligations are expected to be settled in cash 
additional details regarding these obligations are provided in the footnotes to our consolidated financial statements in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years more than years convertible subordinated debentures operating lease obligations synthetic lease obligations total contractual obligations this is the expected cash payment we will make when we exercise the call option on the debentures 
for more information see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity convertible subordinated debentures and note to our consolidated financial statements 
total contractual obligations do not include agreements where our commitment is variable in nature or where cancellation without payment provisions exist 
as of december   we did not have any material long term debt obligations  capital lease obligations  purchase obligations  or other material long term commitments reflected on our consolidated balance sheets 
off balance sheet arrangement we are a party to a synthetic lease arrangement totaling approximately million for our corporate headquarters office space in fort lauderdale  florida 
the synthetic lease represents a form of off balance sheet financing under which an unrelated third party lessor funded of the costs of acquiring the property and leases the asset to us 
the synthetic lease qualifies as an operating lease for accounting purposes and as a financing lease for tax purposes 
we do not include the property or the lease debt as an asset or a liability on our accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
consequently  payments made pursuant to the lease are recorded as operating expenses in our consolidated statements of income 
we entered into the synthetic lease in order to lease our headquarters properties under more favorable terms than under our previous lease arrangements 
we do not materially rely on off balance sheet arrangements for our liquidity or as capital resources 
for information regarding cash outflows associated with our lease payments see contractual obligations 
the initial term of the synthetic lease is seven years 
upon approval by the lessor  we can renew the lease twice for additional two year periods 
the lease payments vary based on the london interbank offered rate  or libor  plus a margin 
at any time during the lease term  we have the option to sublease the property and upon thirty days written notice  we have the option to purchase the property for an amount representing the original property cost and transaction fees of approximately million plus any lease breakage costs and outstanding amounts owed 
upon at least days notice prior to the termination of the initial lease term  we have the option to remarket the property for sale to a third party 
if we choose not to purchase the property at the end of the lease term  we have guaranteed a residual value to the lessor of approximately million and possession of the buildings will be returned to the lessor 
if the fair value of the building were to decline below million  we would have to make up the difference under our residual value guarantee  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
the synthetic lease includes certain financial covenants including a requirement for us to maintain a pledged balance of approximately million in cash and or investment securities as collateral 
we manage the composition of the pledged investments and investment earnings are available for operating purposes 
additionally  we must maintain a minimum net cash and investment balance  less our debentures  collateralized investments and equity investments  of million  as of the end of each fiscal quarter 
as of december   we had approximately million in cash and investments in excess of those required 
table of contents levels 
the synthetic lease includes non financial covenants  including the maintenance of the properties and adequate insurance  prompt delivery of financial statements to the lender of the lessor and prompt payment of taxes associated with the properties 
as of december   we were in compliance with all material provisions of the arrangement 
in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation  or fin  no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  which addresses the consolidation of variable interest entities in which an enterprise absorbs a majority of the entity s expected losses  receives a majority of the entity s expected residual returns  or both  as a result of ownership  contractual or other financial interests in the entity 
in december  the fasb issued fin no 
revised  which replaced fin no 
fin no 
revised is effective immediately for certain disclosure requirements and variable interest entities referred to as special purpose entities for periods ending after december  and for other types of entities for financial statements for periods ending after march  we determined that we are not required to consolidate the lessor  the leased facility or the related debt associated with our synthetic lease in accordance with fin no 
 as amended 
accordingly  there was no impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows from adoption 
however  if the lessor were to change its ownership of the property or significantly change its ownership of other properties that it currently holds  we could be required to consolidate the entity  the leased facility and the debt in a future period 
commitments capital expenditures were million during  million during and million during during  capital expenditures were primarily related to computer equipment purchases associated with our research and development activities 
the decrease compared to is due to expenditures in for leasehold improvements on newly occupied buildings 
in the normal course of business  we enter into commitments related to capital expenditures  however  we currently have no material contractual commitments for capital expenditures over the next months 
during and  we took actions to consolidate certain of our offices  including the exit of certain leased office space and the abandonment of certain leasehold improvements 
lease obligations related to these existing operating leases continue to october with a total remaining obligation of approximately million  of which million  net of anticipated sublease income  was accrued for as of december   and is reflected in accrued expenses in our consolidated financial statements 
in calculating this accrual  we made estimates  based on market information  including the estimated vacancy periods and sublease rates and opportunities 
if actual circumstances prove to be materially worse than management has estimated  the total charges for these vacant facilities could be significantly higher 
in february  we acquired expertcity for approximately million  comprised of approximately million in cash and approximately million shares of our common stock valued at approximately million 
pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement  we will be required to issue up to approximately an additional million in our common stock if certain financial targets are achieved by the expertcity business in for more information regarding the acquisition  see management s discussion and analysis acquisitions 
certain factors which may affect future results our operating results and financial condition have varied in the past and could in the future vary significantly depending on a number of factors 
from time to time  information provided by us or statements made by our employees contain forward looking information that involves risks and uncertainties

these statements are neither promises nor guarantees 
our actual results of operations and financial condition have varied and could in the future vary significantly from those stated in any forward looking statements 
the following factors  among others  could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward looking statements made in this form k  in the documents incorporated by reference into this form k or presented elsewhere by our management from time to time 
such factors  among others  could have a material adverse effect upon our business  results of operations and financial condition 
because of our relationship with microsoft  our business could be adversely impacted by commercialization  source code access and compatibility risks 
our relationship with microsoft is subject to the following risks and uncertainties  some of which could cause a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition successful commercialization of microsoft operating systems 
our ability to successfully commercialize citrix metaframe access infrastructure is directly related to microsoft s ability to market windows servers and windows server  or collectively windows server operating systems  products 
we do not have control over microsoft s distributors and resellers and  to our knowledge  microsoft s distributors and resellers are not obligated to purchase products from microsoft 
additionally  there could be delays in the release and shipment of future versions of windows server operating systems 
termination of the microsoft source licensing agreement 
in may  we signed an agreement with microsoft that provides us access to microsoft windows server source code for current and future microsoft server operating systems  including access to windows server and terminal services source code  during the three year term of the agreement 
microsoft could terminate the current agreement before the expiration of the three year term for breach and upon our change of control 
if microsoft does terminate the current agreement  our restricted access to source code for current and future microsoft server operating systems could negatively impact the timing of our release of future products and enhancements 
our agreements with microsoft are short in duration 
there can be no assurances that our current agreements with microsoft will be extended or renewed by microsoft after their respective expirations 
our failure to renew certain terms of these agreements with microsoft in a manner favorable to us could negatively impact the timing of our release of future products and enhancements 
compatibility 
future product offerings by microsoft may not provide for compatibility with our products  upon release of such offerings from microsoft 
the lack of compatibility between future microsoft products and our products could negatively impact the timing of our release of future products and enhancements 
our business could be adversely impacted by conditions affecting the information technology market 
the demand for our products depends substantially upon the general demand for business related computer hardware and software  which fluctuates based on numerous factors  including capital spending levels  the spending levels and growth of our current and prospective customers and general economic conditions 
fluctuations in the demand for our products could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
in and for part of  adverse economic conditions decreased demand for our products and negatively impacted our financial results 
future economic projections 
table of contents for the it sector are uncertain 
if the weakened environment persists and slow it spending continues  it could continue to negatively impact our business  results of operations and financial condition 
sales of products within our metaframe access suite constitute a substantial majority of our revenue 
we anticipate that sales of products within our metaframe access suite and related enhancements will constitute a substantial majority of our revenue for the foreseeable future 
our ability to continue to generate revenue from our metaframe product line will depend on market acceptance of windows server operating systems and or unix operating systems 
declines in demand for our metaframe products could occur as a result of new competitive product releases and updates to existing products  price competition  technological change  decreasing or stagnant information technology spending levels  general economic conditions  or lack of success of entities with which we have a technology relationship 
if our customers do not continue to purchase our metaframe products as a result of these or other factors  our revenue would decrease and our results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected 
if we do not develop new products and enhancements to our existing products  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 
the markets for our products are characterized by rapid technological change  evolving industry standards  fluctuations in customer demand  changes in customer requirements  and frequent new product introductions and enhancements 
our future success depends on our ability to continually enhance our current products and develop and introduce new products that our customers choose to buy 
if we are unable to keep pace with technological developments and customer demands by introducing new products and enhancements  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 
our future success could be hindered by delays in our introduction of new products  delays in market acceptance of new products or new releases of our current products  and our  or a competitor s  announcement of new product enhancements or technologies that could replace or shorten the life cycle of our existing product offerings 
for example  we cannot guarantee that our new access infrastructure software will achieve the broad market acceptance by our channel and entities with which we have a technology relationship  customers and prospective customers necessary to generate significant revenue 
in addition  we cannot guarantee that we will be able to respond effectively to technological changes or new product announcements by others 
if we experience material delays or sales shortfalls with respect to our new products or new releases of our current products  those delays or shortfalls could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents we believe that we could incur additional costs and royalties as we develop  license or buy new technologies or enhancements to our existing products 
these added costs and royalties could increase our cost of revenues and operating expenses 
however  we cannot currently quantify the costs for such transactions that have not yet occurred 
in addition  we may need to use a substantial portion of our cash and investments or issue additional shares of our common stock to fund these additional costs 
our long sales cycle for enterprise wide sales could cause significant variability in our revenue and operating results for any particular period 
in recent quarters  a growing number of our large and medium sized customers have decided to implement our enterprise customer license arrangements on a department or enterprise wide basis 
our long sales cycle for these large scale deployments makes it difficult to predict when these sales will occur  and we may not be able to sustain these sales on a predictable basis 
we have a long sales cycle for these enterprise wide sales because our sales force generally needs to explain and demonstrate the benefits of a large scale deployment of our product to potential and existing customers prior to sale  our service personnel typically spend a significant amount of time assisting potential customers in their testing and evaluation of our product  our customers are typically large and medium size organizations that carefully research their technology needs and the many potential projects prior to making capital expenditures for software infrastructure  and before making a purchase  our potential customers usually must get approvals from various levels of decision makers within their organizations  and this process can be lengthy 
the continued long sales cycle for these large scale deployment sales could make it difficult to predict the quarter in which sales will occur 
delays in sales could cause significant variability in our revenue and operating results for any particular period 
we face intense competition  which could result in fewer customer orders and reduced revenues and margins 
we compete in intensely competitive markets 
some of our competitors and potential competitors have significantly greater financial  technical  sales and marketing and other resources than we do 
for example  our ability to market the citrix metaframe access suite  and its individual products including citrix metaframe presentation server  citrix metaframe secure access manager  citrix metaframe conferencing manager and citrix metaframe password manager and other future product offerings could be affected by microsoft s licensing and pricing scheme for client devices  servers and applications 
further  the announcement of the release  and the actual release  of new windows based server operating systems or products incorporating similar features to our products could cause our existing and potential customers to postpone or cancel plans to license certain of our existing and future product offerings 
in addition  alternative products for secure  remote access in the internet software and hardware markets directly and indirectly compete with our current products and anticipated future product offerings 
existing or new products that extend internet software and hardware to provide web based information and application access or interactive computing can materially impact our ability to sell our products in this market 
our competitors in this market include microsoft  oracle  sun microsystems  cisco  and other makers of secure remote access solutions 
as the markets for our products continue to develop  additional companies  including companies with significant market presence in the computer hardware  software and networking industries could enter the markets in which we compete and further intensify competition 
in addition  we believe price competition could become a more significant competitive factor in the future 
as a result  we may not be able to maintain 
table of contents our historic prices and margins  which could adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
if we determine that any of our goodwill or intangible assets  including technology purchased in acquisitions  are impaired  we would be required to take a charge to earnings  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we have a significant amount of goodwill and other intangible assets  such as product and core technology  related to our acquisition of sequoia software corporation in and expertcity in in july  we adopted sfas no 
 business combinations  and in january  we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
as a result  we no longer amortize goodwill and intangible assets that are deemed to have indefinite lives 
however  we continue to amortize certain product and core technologies  trademarks  patents and other intangibles 
we periodically evaluate our intangible assets  including goodwill  for impairment 
as of december  we had million of goodwill 
we review for impairment annually  or sooner if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount could exceed fair value 
fair values are based on discounted cash flows using a discount rate determined by our management to be consistent with industry discount rates and the risks inherent in our current business model 
due to uncertain market conditions and potential changes in our strategy and product portfolio  it is possible that the forecasts we use to support our goodwill could change in the future  which could result in non cash charges that would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
at december   we had million  net  of unamortized identified intangibles with estimable useful lives  of which million consists of product and core technology we purchased in the acquisition of sequoia and million represents core technology purchased under third party licenses 
we have commercialized and currently market the sequoia and other license technology through our secure access infrastructure software  which includes citrix metaframe secure access manager and citrix metaframe password manager 
however  our channel distributors and entities with which we have technology relationships  customers or prospective customers may not purchase or widely accept our new line of products 
if we fail to complete the development of our anticipated future product offerings  if we fail to complete them in a timely manner  or if we are unsuccessful in selling these new products  we could determine that the value of the purchased technology is impaired in whole or in part and take a charge to earnings 
we could also incur additional charges in later periods to reflect costs associated with completing those projects that could not be completed in a timely manner 
if the actual revenues and operating profit attributable to acquired product and core technologies are less than the projections we used to initially value product and core technologies when we acquired it  such intangible assets may be deemed to be impaired 
if we determine that any of our intangible assets are impaired  we would be required to take a related charge to earnings that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
based on the preliminary allocation of the purchase price in the first quarter of we expect to record approximately million of goodwill and intangible assets in connection with our acquisition of expertcity 
if the actual revenues and operating profit attributable to acquired intangible assets are less than the projections we used to initially value these intangible assets when we acquired them  then these intangible assets may be deemed to be impaired 
if we determine that any of the goodwill or other intangible assets associated with our acquisition of expertcity are impaired  then we would be required to reduce the value of those assets or to write them off completely by taking a related charge to earnings 
if we are required to write down or write off all or a portion of those assets  or if financial analysts or investors believe we may need to take such action in the future  our stock price and operating results could be materially adversely affected 
acquisitions present many risks  and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals we anticipate at the time of an acquisition 
our growth is dependent upon market growth  our ability to enhance existing products  and our ability to introduce new products on a timely basis 
we intend to continue to address the need to develop new products and enhance existing products through acquisitions of other companies  product lines and or technologies 

table of contents acquisitions  including those of high technology companies  are inherently risky 
we cannot assure anyone that our previous acquisitions  or any future acquisitions will be successful in helping us reach our financial and strategic goals either for that acquisition or for us generally 
the risks we commonly encounter are difficulties integrating the operations  technologies  and products of the acquired companies  undetected errors or unauthorized use of a third party s code in products of the acquired companies  the risk of diverting management s attention from normal daily operations of the business  potential difficulties in completing products associated with purchased in process research and development  risks of entering markets in which we have no or limited direct prior experience and where competitors have stronger market positions  the potential loss of key employees of the acquired company  and an uncertain sales and earnings stream from the acquired company  which could unexpectedly dilute our earnings 
these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we cannot guarantee that the combined company resulting from any acquisition can continue to support the growth achieved by the companies separately 
we must also focus on our ability to manage and integrate any acquisition 
our failure to manage growth effectively and successfully integrate acquired companies could adversely affect our business and operating results 
the anticipated benefits to us of acquiring expertcity may not be realized 
we acquired expertcity with the expectation that the acquisition would result in various benefits including  among other things  enhanced revenue and profits  greater market presence and development  and enhancements to our product portfolio and customer base 
we expect that the acquisition will enhance our position in the access infrastructure market through the combination of our technologies  products  services  distribution channels and customer contacts with expertcity s  and will enable us to broaden our customer base to include individuals  professionals and small office home office customers as well as extend our presence in the enterprise access infrastructure market 
we may not realize any of these benefits and the acquisition may result in the deterioration or loss of significant business 
for example  if our business or expertcity s business fails to meet the demands of the marketplace  customer acceptance of the products and services of the combined companies could decline  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
costs incurred and potential liabilities assumed in connection with the acquisition also could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
achieving the expected benefits of the acquisition will depend in part on the integration of expertcity s and our businesses in a timely and efficient manner 
the challenges involved in this integration include difficulties integrating expertcity s operations  technologies and products as well as coordinating the efforts of expertcity s sales organization with our larger and more widely dispersed sales organization 
the integration of the two businesses could be complex  time consuming and expensive  may disrupt business and may result in the loss of customers or key employees or the diversion of the attention of management which could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
in addition  we may not achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition as rapidly as  or to the extent  anticipated by our management and certain financial or industry analysts  or other analysts may not perceive the same benefits of the acquisition as we do 
for example  expertcity s uncertain sales and earnings stream could dilute our profits beyond the current expectations of our management 
if these risks materialize  our stock price could be materially adversely affected 

table of contents if we fail to manage our operations or fail to continue to effectively control expenses  our future operating results could be adversely affected 
historically  the scope of our operations  the number of our employees and the geographic area of our operations have grown rapidly 
in addition  we have acquired both domestic and international companies 
this growth and the assimilation of acquired operations and their employees could continue to place a significant strain on our managerial  operational and financial resources 
to manage our growth  if any  effectively  we need to continue to implement and improve additional management and financial systems and controls 
we may not be able to manage the current scope of our operations or future growth effectively and still exploit market opportunities for our products and services in a timely and cost effective way 
our future operating results could also depend on our ability to manage our expanding product line  our marketing and sales organizations  and our client support organization as installations of our products increase 
in our operating expenses will exceed our operating expenses in an increase in operating expenses could reduce our income from operations and cash flows from operating activities in the future 
we could change our licensing programs  which could negatively impact the timing of our recognition of revenue 
we continually re evaluate our licensing programs  including specific license models  delivery methods  and terms and conditions  to market our current and future products and services 
we could implement new licensing programs  including offering specified and unspecified enhancements to our current and future product and service lines 
such changes could result in recognizing revenues over the contract term as opposed to upon the initial shipment or licensing of the software product 
we could implement different licensing models in certain circumstances  for which we would recognize licensing fees over a longer period 
changes to our licensing programs  including the timing of the release of enhancements  discounts and other factors  could impact the timing of the recognition of revenue for our products  related enhancements and services and could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
as our international sales and operations grow  we could become increasingly subject to additional risks that could harm our business 
we conduct significant sales and customer support operations in countries outside of the united states 
for  we derived approximately of our revenues from sales outside the united states 
our continued growth and profitability could require us to further expand our international operations 
to successfully expand international sales  we must establish additional foreign operations  hire additional personnel and recruit additional international resellers 
our international operations are subject to a variety of risks  which could cause international revenues to fluctuate 
these risks include fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  including our ability to adequately hedge our foreign exchange risks  compliance with foreign regulatory and market requirements  variability of foreign economic  political and labor conditions  changing restrictions imposed by regulatory requirements  tariffs or other trade barriers or by united states export laws  longer accounts receivable payment cycles  potentially adverse tax consequences  difficulties in protecting intellectual property  and 
table of contents burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws 
our success depends  in part  on our ability to anticipate and address these risks 
we cannot guarantee that these or other factors will not adversely affect our business or operating results 
further  as we generate cash flow in non us jurisdictions  if required  we may experience difficulty transferring such funds to the us in a tax efficient manner 
in particular  a decrease in demand for software and services in any particular region could adversely affect our future operating results 
our results of operations are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
in order to minimize adverse impacts on our operating results  we generally initiate our hedging of currency exchange risks one year in advance of anticipated foreign currency expenses 
as a result of this policy  foreign currency denominated expenses will be higher or lower in the current year depending on the weakness or strength of the dollar in the prior year 
since the dollar was generally weak in  particularly against euro and british pound sterling  we currently expect that operating expenses will be higher in but further dollar weakness in will not have a further material impact on our operating expenses until our synthetic lease is an off balance sheet arrangement that could negatively affect our financial condition and results 
in april  we entered into a seven year synthetic lease with a lessor for our headquarters office buildings in fort lauderdale  florida 
the synthetic lease qualifies for operating lease accounting treatment under sfas no 
 accounting for leases  so we do not include the property or the lease debt on our consolidated balance sheet 
in january  the fasb issued fin no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  which addresses the consolidation of variable interest entities in which an enterprise absorbs a majority of the entity s expected losses  receives a majority of the entity s expected residual returns  or both  as a result of ownership  contractual or other financial interests in the entity 
in december  the fasb issued fin no 
revised  which replaced fin no 
fin no 
revised is effective immediately for certain disclosure requirements and variable interest entities referred to as special purpose entities for periods ending after december  and for other types of entities for financial statements for periods ending after march  we have determined that we are not required to consolidate the lessor entity  the leased facility or the related debt upon the adoption of fin no 
 as amended 
accordingly  there was no impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows from adoption 
however  if the lessor were to change its ownership of our property or significantly change its ownership of other properties that it currently holds  we could be required to consolidate the entity  the leased facility and the debt in a future period 
if we elect not to purchase the property at the end of the lease term  we have guaranteed a minimum residual value of approximately million to the lessor 
therefore  if the fair value of the property declines below million  we would have to make up the difference under our residual value guarantee  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
for further information on our synthetic lease  please refer to management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangement and note to our consolidated financial statements 
our proprietary rights could offer only limited protection 
our products could infringe third party intellectual property rights  which could result in material costs 
our efforts to protect our proprietary rights may not be successful 
we rely primarily on a combination of copyright  trademark  patent and trade secret laws  confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions  to protect our proprietary rights 
the loss of any material trade secret  trademark  trade name  patent or copyright could have a material adverse effect on our business 
despite our precautions  it could be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy or reverse engineer certain portions of our products or to otherwise obtain and use our proprietary information 
if we cannot protect our proprietary technology against unauthorized copying or use  we may not remain competitive 
any patents owned by us could be invalidated  circumvented or challenged 
any of our pending or future patent applications  whether or not being currently challenged  
table of contents may not be issued with the scope we seek  if at all  and if issued  may not provide any meaningful protection or competitive advantage 
in addition  our ability to protect our proprietary rights could be affected by differences in international law  enforceability of licenses 
the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our intellectual property to the same extent as do the laws of the united states and canada 
for example  we derive a significant portion of our sales from licensing our packaged products under shrink wrap or click to accept license agreements that are not signed by licensees and electronic enterprise customer licensing arrangements that are delivered electronically  all of which could be unenforceable under the laws of many foreign jurisdictions in which we license our products 
third party infringement claims 
third parties have asserted infringement claims against us 
as we expand our product lines and the number of products and competitors in our industry segments increase and the functionality of these products overlap  we could become increasingly subject to infringement claims and claims to the unauthorized use of a third party s code in our products 
companies and inventors are more frequently seeking to patent software and business methods because of developments in the law that could extend the ability to obtain such patents 
as a result  we could receive more patent infringement claims 
responding to any infringement claim  regardless of its validity  could result in costly litigation  injunctive relief or require us to obtain a license to intellectual property rights of those third parties 
licenses may not be available on reasonable terms  on terms compatible with the protection of our proprietary rights  or at all 
in addition  attention to these claims could divert our management s time and attention from developing our business 
if a successful claim is made against us and we fail to develop or license a substitute technology  our business  results of operations  financial condition or cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
we are subject to risks associated with our technology relationships 
our business depends on technology relationships 
we cannot assure you that those relationships will continue in the future 
in addition to our relationship with microsoft  we rely on technology relationships with such companies as ibm  hp  dell and others 
we depend on the entities with which we have technology relationships to successfully test our products  to incorporate our technology into their products and to market and sell those products 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain our current technology relationships or to develop additional technology relationships 
if any entities in which we have a technology relationship are unable to incorporate our technology into their products or to market or sell those products  our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
if we lose access to third party licenses  releases of our products could be delayed 
we believe that we will continue to rely  in part  on third party licenses to enhance and differentiate our products 
third party licensing arrangements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties  including undetected errors or unauthorized use of another person s code in the third party s software  disagreement over the scope of the license and other key terms  such as royalties payable  and infringement actions brought by third party licensees  termination or expiration of the license 
if we lose or are unable to maintain any of these third party licenses or are required to modify software obtained under third party licenses  it could delay the release of our products 
any delays could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our success depends on our ability to attract and retain large enterprise customers 
we must retain and continue to expand our ability to reach and penetrate large enterprise customers by adding effective channel distributors and expanding our consulting services 
our inability to attract and retain 
table of contents large enterprise customers could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
large enterprise customers usually request special pricing and generally have longer sales cycles  which could negatively impact our revenues 
by granting special pricing  such as bundled pricing or discounts  to these large customers  we may have to defer recognition of some portion of the revenue from such sales 
this deferral could reduce our revenues and operating profits for a given reporting period 
additionally  as we attempt to attract and penetrate large enterprise customers  we may need to increase corporate branding and marketing activities  which could increase our operating expenses 
these efforts may not proportionally increase our operating revenues and could reduce our profits 
our business could be adversely affected if we are unable to expand and diversify our distribution channels 
we currently intend to continue to expand our distribution channels by leveraging our relationships with independent hardware and software vendors and system integrators to encourage them to recommend or distribute our products 
in addition  an integral part of our strategy is to diversify our base of channel relationships by adding more channel members with abilities to reach larger enterprise customers 
this will require additional resources  as we will need to expand our internal sales and service coverage of these customers 
if we fail in these efforts and cannot expand or diversify our distribution channels  our business could be adversely affected 
in addition to this diversification of our base  we will need to maintain a healthy mix of members who cater to smaller customers 
we may need to add and remove distribution members to maintain customer satisfaction and a steady adoption rate of our products  which could increase our operating expenses 
through our accesspartner network  citrix authorized learning centers and other programs  we are currently investing  and intend to continue to invest  significant resources to develop these channels  which could reduce our profits 
if we do not generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future  we may not be able to fund our operations and fulfill our future obligations 
our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to fund our operations and product development  including the payment of cash consideration in acquisitions  the redemption of our debentures in the first quarter of and the payment of our other obligations  depends on a range of economic  competitive and business factors  many of which are outside our control 
specifically  the redemption of our outstanding debentures in the first quarter of will require us to expend approximately million and will significantly deplete our existing cash and investments 
we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations  or that we will be able to liquidate our investments  repatriate cash and investments held in our overseas subsidiaries  sell assets or raise equity or debt financings when needed or desirable 
an inability to fund our operations or fulfill outstanding obligations could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
for further information  please refer to liquidity and capital resources 
we rely on indirect distribution channels and major distributors that we do not control 
we rely significantly on independent distributors and resellers to market and distribute our products 
we do not control our distributors and resellers 
additionally  our distributors and resellers are not obligated to buy our products and could also represent other lines of products 
some of our distributors and resellers maintain inventories of our packaged products for resale to smaller end users 
if distributors and resellers reduce their inventory of our packaged products  our business could be adversely affected 
during we believe that our distributors and resellers held smaller inventories of packaged products as compared to inventories they held in prior years 
further  we could maintain individually significant accounts receivable balances with certain distributors 
the financial condition of our distributors could deteriorate and distributors could significantly delay or default on their payment obligations 
any significant delays or defaults could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents our products could contain errors that could delay the release of new products and may not be detected until after our products are shipped 
despite significant testing by us and by current and potential customers  our products  especially new products or releases  could contain errors 
in some cases  these errors may not be discovered until after commercial shipments have been made 
errors in our products could delay the development or release of new products and could adversely affect market acceptance of our products 
additionally  our products depend on third party products  which could contain defects and could reduce the performance of our products or render them useless 
because our products are often used in mission critical applications  errors in our products or the products of third parties upon which our products rely could give rise to warranty or other claims by our customers 
if we lose key personnel or cannot hire enough qualified employees  our ability to manage our business could be adversely affected 
our success depends  in large part  upon the services of a number of key employees 
except for certain key employees of acquired businesses  we do not have long term employment agreements with any of our key personnel 
any officer or employee can terminate his or her relationship with us at any time 
the effective management of our growth  if any  could depend upon our ability to retain our highly skilled technical  managerial  finance and marketing personnel 
if any of those employees leave  we will need to attract and retain replacements for them 
we also need to add key personnel in the future 
the market for these qualified employees is competitive 
we could find it difficult to successfully attract  assimilate or retain sufficiently qualified personnel in sufficient numbers 
furthermore  we may hire key personnel in connection with our future acquisitions  however  any of these employees will be able to terminate his or her relationship with us at any time 
if we cannot retain and add the necessary staff and resources for these acquired businesses  our ability to develop acquired products  markets and customers could be adversely affected 
also  we may need to hire additional personnel to develop new products  product enhancements and technologies 
if we cannot add the necessary staff and resources  our ability to develop future enhancements and features to our existing or future products could be delayed 
any delays could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
if stock balancing returns or price adjustments exceed our reserves  our operating results could be adversely affected 
we provide most of our distributors with stock balancing return rights  which generally permit our distributors to return products to us  subject to ordering an equal dollar amount of our products 
we also provide price protection rights to most of our distributors 
price protection rights require that we grant retroactive price adjustments for inventories of our products held by distributors if we lower our prices for those products within a specified time period 
to cover our exposure to these product returns and price adjustments  we establish reserves based on our evaluation of historical product trends and current marketing plans 
however  we cannot assure you that our reserves will be sufficient to cover our future product returns and price adjustments 
if we inadequately forecast reserves  our operating results could be adversely affected 
our stock price could be volatile  and you could lose the value of your investment 
our stock price has been volatile and has fluctuated significantly to date 
the trading price of our stock is likely to continue to be highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations 
your investment in our stock could lose value 
some of the factors that could significantly affect the market price of our stock include actual or anticipated variations in operating and financial results  analyst reports or recommendations  changes in interest rates  and other events or factors  many of which are beyond our control 

table of contents the stock market in general  the nasdaq national market and the market for software companies and technology companies in particular  have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations 
these broad market and industry factors could materially and adversely affect the market price of our stock  regardless of our actual operating performance 
our business and investments could be adversely impacted by unfavorable economic conditions 
general economic and market conditions  and other factors outside our control  could adversely affect our business and impair the value of our investments 
any further downturn in general economic conditions could result in a reduction in demand for our products and services and could harm our business 
in addition  an economic downturn could result in an impairment in the value of our investments requiring us to record losses related to such investments 
impairment in the value of these investments may disrupt our ongoing business and distract management 
as of december   we had million of short and long term investments with various issuers and financial institutions 
in many cases we do not attempt to reduce or eliminate our market exposure on these investments and could incur losses related to the impairment of these investments 
fluctuations in economic and market conditions could adversely affect the value of our investments  and we could lose some of our investment portfolio 
a total loss of an investment could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
for further information on these investments  please refer to liquidity and capital resources 
our revenue may not grow  and if we do not continue to successfully manage our expenses  our business could be negatively impacted 
we attribute most of our growth during recent years to the introduction of the metaframe software for windows operating systems in mid we cannot assure you that the access infrastructure software markets  in which we operate  will grow 
we cannot assure you that the release of our access infrastructure software suite of products or other new products will increase our revenue growth rate 
in addition  to the extent our revenue grows  if at all  we believe that our cost of revenues and certain operating expenses could also increase 
we cannot assure you that our operating expenses will be lower than our estimated or actual revenues in any given quarter 
if we experience a shortfall in revenue in any given quarter  we likely will not be able to further reduce operating expenses quickly in response 
any significant shortfall in revenue could immediately and adversely affect our results of operations for that quarter 
also  due to the fixed nature of many of our expenses and our current expectation for revenue growth  our income from operations and cash flows from operating and investing activities could be lower than in recent years 
political and social turmoil could adversely impact our business 
political and social turmoil  including terrorist and military actions  can be expected to put further pressure on economic conditions in the united states and foreign jurisdictions 
these conditions make it difficult for us  and our customers  to accurately forecast and plan future business activities and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the market for our web based training and customer assistance products is volatile  and if it does not develop or develops more slowly than we expect  our online division will be harmed 
the market for our web based training and customer assistance products is new and unproven  and it is uncertain whether these services will achieve and sustain high levels of demand and market acceptance 
our success with our online division will depend to a substantial extent on the willingness of enterprises  large and small  to increase their use of application services in general and for gotomypc and gotoassist  in particular 
many enterprises have invested substantial personnel and financial resources to integrate traditional enterprise software into their businesses  and therefore may be reluctant or unwilling to migrate to application services 
furthermore  some enterprises may be reluctant or unwilling to use application services because they have concerns regarding the risks associated with security capabilities  among other things  of the technology delivery model associated with these services 
if enterprises do not perceive the benefits of application services  
table of contents then the market for these services may not further develop at all  or it may develop more slowly than we expect  either of which would significantly adversely affect our financial condition and the operating results for our online division 
if our security measures are breached and unauthorized access is obtained to our online division customers data  our services may be perceived as not being secure and these customers may curtail or stop using our service 
use of our gotomypc or gotoassist services involves the storage and transmission of customers proprietary information  and security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss of this information  litigation and possible liability 
if our security measures are breached as a result of third party action  employee error  malfeasance or otherwise  and  as a result  someone obtains unauthorized access to one of our online customers data  our reputation will be damaged  our business may suffer and we could incur significant liability 
because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target  we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures 
if any compromises of security were to occur  it could have the effect of substantially reducing the use of the web for commerce and communications 
anyone who circumvents our security measures could misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions in our services or operations 
the internet is a public network  and data is sent over this network from many sources 
in the past  computer viruses  software programs that disable or impair computers  have been distributed and have rapidly spread over the internet 
computer viruses could be introduced into our systems or those of our customers or suppliers  which could disrupt our network or make it inaccessible to our online division customers 
if an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs  the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and we could lose sales and customers for our online division  which would significantly adversely affect our financial condition and the operating results for our online division 
evolving regulation of the web may adversely affect our online division 
as web commerce continues to evolve  increasing regulation by federal  state or foreign agencies becomes more likely 
for example  we believe increased regulation is likely in the area of data privacy  and laws and regulations applying to the solicitation  collection  processing or use of personal or consumer information could affect our online customers ability to use and share data and restricting our ability to store  process and share data with these customers 
in addition  taxation of services provided over the web or other charges imposed by government agencies or by private organizations for accessing the web may also be imposed 
any regulation imposing greater fees for web use or restricting information exchange over the web could result in a decline in the use of the web and the viability of web based services  which would significantly adversely affect our financial condition and the operating results for our online division 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about our market risk includes forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
the analysis methods we used to assess and mitigate risk discussed below should not be considered projections of future events  gains or losses 
we are exposed to financial market risks  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates that could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 
to mitigate foreign currency and interest rate risk  we utilize derivative financial instruments 
the counter parties to our derivative instruments are major financial institutions 
all of the potential changes noted below are based on sensitivity analyses performed on our financial position as of december  actual results could differ materially 
discussions of our accounting policies for derivatives and hedging activities are included in notes and to our consolidated financial statements 
exposure to exchange rates a substantial majority of our overseas expense and capital purchasing activities are transacted in local currencies  primarily british pounds sterling  euros  swiss francs  japanese yen and australian dollars 
to reduce exposure to reduction in us dollar value and the volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in currency exchange rates  we have established a hedging program 
we use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge certain forecasted foreign currency expenditures 
our hedging program significantly reduces  but does not entirely eliminate  the impact of currency exchange rate movements 
at december  and  we had in place foreign currency forward sale contracts with a notional amount of million and million  respectively  and foreign currency forward purchase contracts with a notional amount of million and million  respectively 
at december  and  these contracts had an aggregate fair value of million and million  respectively 
based on a hypothetical appreciation of the us dollar from december  market rates the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts would decrease by million 
conversely  a hypothetical depreciation of the us dollar from december  market rates would increase the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts by million 
foreign operating costs in these hypothetical movements would move in the opposite direction 
this calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the us dollar 
in addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates quantified above  changes in exchange rates could also change the dollar value of sales and affect the volume of sales as competitors products become more or less attractive 
our sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in a potential change in levels of local currency prices or sales reported in us dollars 
we do not anticipate any material adverse impact to our consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows as a result of these forward foreign exchange contracts 
exposure to interest rates we have interest rate exposures resulting from our interest based available for sale securities 
in order to better manage our exposure to interest rate risk  we are a party to interest rate swap agreements 
the swap agreements  with an aggregate notional amount of million convert the fixed rate return on certain of our available for sale securities  to a floating rate 
the aggregate fair value of the interest rate swaps at december  was a liability of million 
based upon a hypothetical increase in the market interest rate as of december   the fair value of these aggregated liabilities would have decreased by approximately million 
based on a hypothetical decrease in the market interest rate as of december   the fair value of these aggregated liabilities would have increased by approximately million 
the underlying assets would experience offsetting gains and losses 
we also maintain available for sale and held to maturity investments in debt securities  which limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issue  issuer  or type of instrument 
the securities in our investment portfolio are not leveraged 
the securities classified as available for sale are subject to interest rate risk 
the modeling technique used measures the change in fair values arising from an immediate hypothetical shift in market interest rates and assumes that ending fair values 
table of contents include principal plus accrued interest  dividends and reinvestment income 
if market interest rates were to increase by basis points from december  and levels  the fair value of the available for sale portfolio would decline by approximately million 
this sensitivity analysis on our available for sale portfolio excludes the underlying investments to our interest rate swaps discussed above  as the interest rate risk related to those investments has been effectively hedged 
for more information see note to our consolidated financial statements 
these amounts are determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on our interest rate swap agreements and available for sale and held to maturity investment portfolios 
this analysis does not consider the effect of credit risk as a result of the reduced level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment 
in april  we entered into a synthetic lease with a substantive lessor totaling approximately million related to office space utilized for our corporate headquarters 
payments under this synthetic lease are indexed to a variable interest rate libor plus a margin 
based upon our interest rate exposure under this synthetic lease at december   a basis point change in the current interest rate would have an immaterial effect on our financial position and results of operations 
in addition to interest rate exposure  if the fair value of our headquarters building in fort lauderdale  florida were to significantly decline  there could be a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition
