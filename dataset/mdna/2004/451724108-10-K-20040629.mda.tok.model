industry trends we see several emerging industry trends in the web conferencing and audio conferencing industries that we believe make us well positioned to take advantage of the predicted market growth 
first  the industries that have embraced web conferencing to a large degree continue to be the financial services sector  high technology sector and professional services sector 
according to a recent report by the analyst group frost and sullivan  these two segments represented of the total web conferencing revenues in and will continue to be the largest single markets for web conferencing revenue by frost sullivan has also identified professional service agencies as a large adopter of the web conferencing from now until to that end  we now have more than professional service companies that have chosen our web conferencing solution as their tool of choice  including some of the larger organizations inside the fortune a second notable trend is that specific features and licensing options are becoming increasingly important to the financial services sector  high technology and professional service markets 
this has created what we believe to be unique opportunities for ilinc 
frost sullivan expects that desktop videoconferencing and voice over ip integration will be heavily utilized features among high technology companies in the immediate future and that web conferencing vendors offering these functionalities within their solution will likely find numerous successes within this vertical market 
unlike many of our competitors  our video and voice over ip can be throttled for high bandwidth users or for low bandwidth users allowing anyone from a dial up connection to utilize these features 
frost sullivan also expects that the financial services vertical market offers significant growth opportunities for those web conferencing vendors offering a behind the firewall solution 
ilinc is the only carrier class web conferencing solution that offers both a behind the firewall solution installation combined with the strength of its feature set as well as its use of the latest advanced encryption standard aes security 
prominent organizations inside the financial services sector of the fortune have chosen our solution based upon these features 
third  we expect to see an increase in the demand for a single source for audio and web conferencing 
frost and sullivan have noted in a separate report on audio conferencing that the demand for integrated audio  web  and video conferencing solutions continues to surge as end user needs for easy to use  single source solutions swell 
developing and proving a truly converged user environment and experience  including the integration of audio  web and video conferencing technologies is essential 
with our acquisition of glyphic communications we are now able to provide a single source for deeply integrated web  audio  video as well as voice over ip 
increasingly  the vendor selection made for web conferencing determines the selection made for audio conferencing 
ilinc has already made significant progress in selling web conferencing products to the glyphics customer base as well as selling audio conferencing to the ilinc customer base 
we believe that another benefit of the integrated conferencing approach is customer retention 
according to the same frost and sullivan report  when web conferencing and audio conferencing are sold together as an integrated package there is a significant increase in retention of the audio conferencing service 
we have also found from customer surveys  this to be true and continuing to create incentives for our audio customers to be web and audio customers to drive this retention 
market position differentiators we view our position in the market as the appropriate solution for the enterprise wide buyer in mature markets that have already adopted web conferencing and collaboration 
our goal is to specialize so that we might reach the needs of target niches and be able to demonstrate specific value to these industries beyond the competition 
our target markets include financial services  high tech and professional services 
frost and sullivan noted in a recent report that these markets combined will deliver between to of the total web conferencing market revenues this year 
these vertical markets have been the early adopters of web and audio conferencing and have become what we term as mature conferencing buyers 
unlike other industries  the financial services  high technology and professional services markets have great familiarity with web conferencing products and importantly  they have different needs 
a growing number of these organizations have recognized that because the buying decision for web conferencing has traditionally not been centralized  and in our experience they are using five or more different vendors for web or audio conferencing services and therefore not realizing the economies of scale that consolidating to one or two vendors could provide 
there are also other important considerations revolving around web conferencing such as security and bandwidth availability that are inducing the buying decision for web and audio conferencing out of the business units and into the it department 
we believe that our solution uniquely maps to critical it requirements among these mature buyers in five important distinctions 
first  we offer flexible licensing options that allow organizations to pay a one time license fee to install the software inside of their environment  or organizations can contract with us annually to use our web and audio conferencing services through an asp arrangement 
we also offer the ability for organizations to purchase perpetual licenses and then  have provided hosting in our co location facility 
we find this flexibility to be an important differentiator for customers making an enterprise wide decision 
as frost sullivan notes  in many instances  web conferencing is a migratory technology from asp to installed software new users tend to first utilize web conferencing asp services as they offer much more flexibility in terms of usage  ability to utilize multiple solutions  and require less up front investment  and are less burdensome on enterprise resources 
therefore  a majority of new users that adopt web conferencing prior to  are expected to initially adopt an asp service based solution  and then migrate to the purchase of a perpetual license 
second  as noted earlier we provide a completely integrated web  audio  video and voice over ip conferencing solution with what we believe to be a rich feature set 
according to web conferencing analyst  as the industry moves beyond the boundaries imposed by the term web conferencing to more of a rich media communications environment  those vendors that are ahead of the curve in terms of features and functionality will be around for the long term survival 
vendors offering a me too solution are not expected to be active long term competitors and are expected to disappear in the form of consolidation  acquisitions  or all together exit the market because of shrinking profits 
third  we offer the highest level of data security commercially available 
we are the only web conferencing provider that offers a customer hosted solution with a purchase license option and true point to point security with our unique combination of aes and secure socket layer ssl 
all information within a session can be transmitted between meeting attendees securely without any reduction in performance 
fourth  our solution is suitable and scalable for enterprise wide deployment 
the ilinc suite addresses most common needs for business collaboration within the enterprise 
we offer virtual classroom software with our learnlinc product  software for presentation and sales demonstrations with meetinglinc  customer support with supportlinc  and software for web casts and marketing events with conferencelinc 
each of these products share a common interface enabling users of one product to easily understand any of our other products 
this reduces the learning curve for web conferencing enterprise wide roll out and we believe increases adoption success 
fifth  we provide what we believe to be an exceptional total cost of ownership value 
our software and services are very competitively priced and also importantly  the customer s installation of our product is a very short and non labor intensive process and maintenance of our software requires minimal attention from an it perspective 
we believe that all of these factors make our solution compelling to our target markets  but we also recognize that in order to grow our market share within the financial services  high technology and professional services verticals we need to develop products that address their specific needs 
to that end  we have aligned our sales  marketing and product development efforts to build web and audio conferencing functionality that delivers and addresses specific pains within each of our identified markets 
for example  in the financial services community  companies are being mandated to secure and document every communication that happens inside and outside of their organization 
we currently offer our aes data encryption solution that delivers this needed security and this year we plan to release enhanced communication and document management functionality that will completely fulfill these requirements 
in the high tech community  web conferencing is predominantly used for software or technology demonstrations 
we arguably have the best application sharing technology in the industry with the ability to throttle bandwidth up or down to increase speed and performance 
in the professional services community  the predominate use for web conferencing is for training 
our product was originally built for training and we believe that it continues to be the best virtual classroom tool on the market 
we believe our focus on gaining market share in our target markets correctly positions us for significant growth over future quarters 
our strategy has also been validated by industry experts in our space some who have noted ilinc as one of the first real time collaboration vendors that understands the need to move up the food chain to it and wisely focus on three markets 
sales and marketing focus to leverage these advantages  our organization has launched a marketing and sales campaign inside these vertical markets with the goal of achieving growth in market share within the financial services  high tech and professional services markets 
our ability to attract and maintain these specific types of customers has given us a base of existing customers that we hope will enable us to further grow within these sectors and others 
as to maintaining the existing customer base  our client services group is frequently praised in survey and online by our customers who also use our competitor s products as competitive 
our emphasis in client service has allowed us to strengthen the existing ilinc customer base while maintaining almost all of the previously existing clients in the months since we acquired the software 
the ability to maintain our customer base provides recurring maintenance revenues as well as opportunities for up sales of our new ilinc products and services within those organizations 
we recently added a new senior vice president of sales who brings to us sales experience specifically in senior level sales positions with placeware and genesys conferencing 
the ilinc sales and marketing team has now grown a staff of including an inside sales team focusing on the small to middle business market  a major regional account team focused on enterprise sales  and an events services sales team that focuses on selling high touch professionally managed large web and audio events 
results of operations as of march   we provide integrated web and audio conferencing software and services with what we believe to be a very robust feature set that includes integrated video and voice over ip 
our name change is reflective of our focus in terms of research  development  sales and marketing on our award winning suite of web conferencing and collaboration software known as the ilinc suite 
the ilinc suite includes learnlinc permits live instructor led training and education over the internet to remote students replicating the instructor led environment  meetinglinc facilitates more effective and economical communication through online meetings using voice over ip technology to avoid the expense of travel and long distance charges  conferencelinc delivers your message more consistently in a one to many format replicating professionally managed conferencing events  and supportlinc gives customer service organizations the ability to provide remote  hands on support for products  systems  or software applications 
the ilinc suite is available in both an asp and perpetual license purchase model 
since its beginnings in  learnlinc and meetinglinc have been installed and operational in corporate  government  and educational organizations in the united states and internationally 
learnlinc  the flagship of ilinc s four product ilinc suite  won first place at the synchronous e learning shootout held at online learning s conference in the fall of  winning by a vote of training professionals over such other notable companies as webex  placeware now microsoft live  and centra 
our ilinc suite of products includes the ability to use integrated voice over ip and two way live video 
we have also completely integrated together audio conferencing services into the web conferencing products 
these services supplement the web product but can also be purchased separately

on june   the company acquired certain assets of quisic corporation quisic  a california based private e learning company in an asset purchase and common stock purchase transaction that involved the issuance of  common shares to certain shareholders of quisic together with an additional  shares that were placed into escrow to secure a revenue performance requirement 
that revenue performance target was not achieved and the company demanded the return of the shares of common stock 
the shareholders of quisic do not dispute the right of the company to obtain those shares 
however  since the claims of the plaintiffs in the kepner tregoe litigation matter assert potential rights to those shares  the shares were instead tendered to the registry of the trial court pending resolution of the party s respective claims please refer to item legal proceedings 
those  shares are not counted as shares outstanding nor as treasury shares as the performance contingency associated with those shares was not met 
the operating results of quisic have been included in the consolidated operations of the company commencing june  the purchase agreement requires that the company pay certain contingent compensation to the seller if during the year period following the closing certain sales to pbs and others occur 
through december   the company had collected funds subject to this contingent provision  which resulted in required contingent payments totaling  on december   the seller agreed to convert the entire amount then due instead into  common shares the company s common stock at the fair market price of per share 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company had invoiced for but not received additional funds subject to this contingent provision  which resulted in accrued contingent payments totaling  due at march  effective november   the company acquired certain assets of mentergy  inc mentergy that included the learnlinc web collaboration and web conferencing software that is the foundation for the ilinc suite of products the learnlinc assets 
in exchange for the learnlinc assets  the company paid  with one half due at closing and the remaining payment due in a note that was due december   assumed scheduled liabilities equal to  and agreed to provide a royalty earn out payment due upon sales of the learnlinc product 
the royalty earn out is equal to for all revenues collected by the company from the sale or license of learnlinc software over a three year period beginning with the closing date  with the first  of collected revenues not subject to the royalty  and the maximum amount due under the agreement is  the company accounts for any such amounts to be paid as additional purchase consideration in accordance with eitf no

the company has accrued learnlinc royalties totaling  during fiscal year the operating results are included with the company s as of november  on june   the company executed an agreement to acquire substantially all of the assets of and assume certain liabilities of glyphics communications  inc  a utah based private company 
the acquisition had a stated effective date of june  and was fully consummated on june  the purchase price  which is expected to total million  is based on a multiple of the glyphics estimated annual audited net audio conferencing business revenues 
the purchase price will be paid with the assumption of approximately million in specific liabilities  with the balance paid using the company s common stock at the fixed price of per share  or an estimated million shares 
the actual purchase price to be paid  and the resulting number of shares to be issued will be based upon the audited results that are expected to be obtained within sixty days of the closing date 
twenty percent of the consideration due is being held in escrow 
amounts held in escrow will be available to the company to satisfy contingent claims and seller s indemnification obligations 
amounts held in escrow also may be returned to the company in the event that audio conferencing revenue performance measures required to be obtained by the company during the calendar year are not met 
individuals and entities participating in this transaction who are shareholders receiving the company s common stock have the right to demand registration of the common stock issued therefrom upon written notice  one year from the date of the transaction  to the company and also have piggy back registration rights should the company file a registration statement before the shares are otherwise registered 
the operations of the company involve many risks  which  even through a combination of experience  knowledge and careful evaluation  may not be overcome 
these risks include the fact that the market for e learning products and services is in the early stages of development and may not grow to a sufficient size or at a sufficient rate to sustain the company s business 
the company also faces intense competition from other e learning providers and may be unable to compete successfully 
many of the company s existing and potential competitors have longer operating histories and significantly greater financial  technical and other resources and therefore may be able to more quickly respond to changing opportunities or customer requirements 
new competitors are also likely to enter this market in the future due to the lack of significant barrier to entry in the market share

    critical accounting policies and estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the more significant areas requiring use of estimates relate to revenue recognition  accounts receivable and notes receivable valuation reserves  realizability of intangible assets  realizability of deferred income tax assets  and the evaluation of contingencies and litigation 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of such estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may materially differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition our revenues are generally classified into two main categories license revenue and service and maintenance revenue 
license revenue is generated from the sale of our ilinc suite of web conferencing software on a purchase model perpetual license basis and from the sale of our off the shelf courseware  primarily the online bridge mini mba program 
the service revenue aspect of our service and maintenance revenue is primarily generated from the sale of our ilinc web conferencing software on a periodic license basis ie  asp or per minute  as well as  all service contracts that might include hosting  and training services 
service and maintenance revenue also includes all revenue arising from maintenance and upgrade contracts that are sold with our ilinc web conferencing software purchases 
included in our service and maintenance revenue are the revenues associated with our custom content development services 
sales of software licenses we earn our revenues from the sale of software licenses and service and maintenance agreements related to those software license sales 
we offer our software and services in one of two forms  the first being a purchase model that permits the purchase of a perpetual license  and the second being an asp or per minute model that permits the purchase of a periodic term license 
the ilinc suite of web conferencing products is sold utilizing both the purchase model and the asp model with separate revenue recognition policies applicable to each model 
with each sale of our products and services  we execute contracts that govern the terms and conditions of each software license sale  hosting agreement  maintenance and support agreement and other services arrangements 
in connection with the company s sales of software licenses  the company adopted statement of position sop as issued by the american institute of certified public accountants 
in accordance with sop  the company recognizes revenue from the sale of software licenses if all of the following conditions are met first  there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement with the customer  second  the product has been delivered to the customer  third  the amount of the fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable  and  fourth  collection of the fee is probable 
each of these factors  particularly the determination of whether a fee is fixed and determinable and the collectability of the resulting receivable  requires the application of the judgment and the estimates of management 
therefore  significant management judgment is utilized and estimates must be made in connection with the revenue we recognize in any accounting period 
we analyze various factors  including a review of the nature of the license or product sold  the terms of specific transaction  the vendor specific objective evidence of the elements required by sop  any contingencies that may be present  our historical experience with like transactions or with like products  the creditworthiness of the customer  and other current market and economic conditions 
changes in our judgment based upon these factors and others could impact the timing and amount of revenue that we recognize  and ultimately the results of operations and our financial condition 
therefore  the recognition of revenue is a key component of our results of operations 
at the time of the sale of our perpetual software license  we assess whether the fee associated with the transaction is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction before recording immediate revenue recognition  assuming all other elements of revenue recognition are present 
billings to our customers are generally due within to days  with payment terms up to days available to certain credit worthy customers 
we believe that we will have sufficient history of collecting all amounts within these normal payment terms and to conclude that the fee is fixed or determinable at the time of the perpetual license sale 
under certain circumstances  we have offered payment terms greater than days and up to as much as twelve months to certain customers  for sales involving our web conferencing perpetual license products where license revenue would normally be recognized upon delivery of the product 
however  we currently do not believe that we have sufficient history of selling the ilinc suite of products under perpetual license arrangements with extended payment terms exceeding days  and therefore will record revenue when the payments from the customer are due  rather than immediately upon delivery of the product and collection is probable  assuming all other elements of revenue recognition are present 
beginning in fiscal  we began offering payment terms of days and anticipate continuing using those day payment terms related to sales of our perpetual license products 
while we do not at this time believe that we have sufficient history of selling perpetual licenses with day payment terms to determine that such fees are fixed and determinable  we do expect to consider those day payment terms to be normal payment terms for certain well capitalized customers when we have such a history  and accordingly  at that time will include those sales in revenue when the perpetual license sale occurs again assuming all other aspects of revenue recognition are present 
we consider all arrangements with payment terms longer than days not to be fixed or determinable and for arrangements involving the extended payment terms exceeding days  revenue recognition occurs when payments are due and collection is probable  assuming all other elements of revenue recognition are present 
in addition  in assessing whether collection is probable or not for a given transaction  and therefore whether we should recognize the revenue  we make estimates regarding the creditworthiness of the customer 
initial creditworthiness is assessed through internal credit check processes  such as credit applications or third party reporting agencies 
creditworthiness for transactions to existing customers primarily relies upon a review of their prior payment history 
we do not request collateral or other security from our customers 
if we determine that collection of a fee is not reasonably assured  we defer the fee and recognize revenue at the time collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon the receipt of payment or other change in circumstance 
sales of concurrent licenses asp and per minute basis historically  a majority of our license revenue has been generated under the purchase model with revenue recognized based on a one time sale of a perpetual license 
in addition to that purchase model  we also offer a more flexible monthly  fixed fee subscription pricing model asp model and a per minute usage based model 
under our subscription or asp model  a customer may subscribe to a certain number of concurrent connections or seats for a fixed period  often a year 
under this asp method  we recognize the revenue associated with these monthly  fixed fee subscription arrangements each month on a straight line basis over the term of the agreement 
other customers choose to avoid annual commitments and instead use our web conferencing and audio conferencing products and services based upon a per minute or usage based pricing model 
per minute customers may also include those customers on an asp model that incur overage fees for usage in excess of the permitted number of seats or minutes in excess of the minimum commitment 
the per minute fees that include overage fees are charged at the end of each month and recorded as revenue at the end of each month as the services are provided 
customers with contractually established minimum per minute fees are assessed the greater of the established minimum or the actual usage at the end of each month 
customers wishing to avoid monthly commitments may use the e commerce portion of our web site that permits the use our web conferencing services on a pay per use basis  with no monthly minimum  purchasing the services and paying for those services online by credit card 
sales of maintenance  hosting and other related services the company offers with each sale of its software products a software maintenance  upgrade and support arrangement 
these contracts may be elements in a multiple element arrangement or may be sold in a stand alone basis 
revenues from maintenance and support services are recognized ratably on a straight line basis over the term that the maintenance service is provided 
maintenance contracts typically provide for month terms with maintenance contracts available up to months 
revenues from consulting  training and education services are recognized either as the services are performed  ratably over a subscription period  or upon completing a project milestone if defined in the agreement 
these consulting  training and education services  are not considered essential to the functionality of our products as these services do not alter the product capabilities  do not require specialized skills  and are often performed by the customer or our var s customers without access to those services 
implementation  consulting  training  translation  and other event type services may also be sold in conjunction with the sale of our software products 
those services are generally recognized as the services are performed or if earlier when all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
although the company may provide implementation  training and consulting services on a time and materials basis  a significant portion of these services have been provided on a fixed fee basis 
should the sale of our software involve an arrangement with multiple elements for example  the sale of a software license along with the sale of maintenance and support to be delivered over the contract period  we allocate revenue to each component of the arrangement using the residual value method based on the fair value of the undelivered elements 
we defer revenue from the arrangement equivalent to the fair value of the undelivered elements and recognize the remaining amount at the time of the delivery of the product or when all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
fair values for the ongoing maintenance and support obligations are based upon separate sales of renewals of maintenance contracts 
fair value of services  such as training or consulting  is based upon separate sales of these services to other customers 
thus  these types of arrangements require us to make judgments about the fair value of undelivered arrangements 
sales of custom content development services a component of our service and maintenance revenue is derived from custom content development services 
the sale of custom content development services often involves the execution of a master service agreement and corresponding work orders describing the deliverable due  the costs involved  the project milestones and the payments required 
for contracts and revenues related exclusively to custom content development services  the company recognizes revenue and profit as work progresses on custom content service contracts using the percentage of completion method 
this method relies on estimates of total expected contract revenue and costs as each job progresses throughout the relevant contract period 
the company follows this method since reasonably dependable estimates of the costs applicable to various stages of a custom content service contract can be made 
recognized revenues and profit are subject to revisions as the custom content service contract progresses to completion 
revisions in profit estimates are charged to income in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
customers sometimes request modifications to projects in progress which may result in significant revisions to cost estimates and profit recognition  and the company may not be successful in negotiating additional payments related to the changes in scope of requested services 
should this arise  the provision for any estimated losses on uncompleted custom content service contracts are made in the period in which such losses become evident 
there were no such losses at march  for any custom content development services 
for arrangements requiring customer acceptance  revenue is deferred until the earlier of the end of the acceptance period or until written notice of acceptance is received from the customer 
sales by var s and agents the company has engaged organizations within the united states of america and in twelve other countries that market and sell its products and services through their sales distribution channels that are value added resellers var s 
the var s primarily sell  on a non exclusive basis  our ilinc suite of web conferencing products and predominately sell purchase model perpetual licenses for installation and hosting by the var s customer 
the company s var contracts have terms of one to two years and are automatically renewed for an additional like term unless either party terminates the agreement for breach or other financial reasons 
each var purchases the product from the company and resells the product to its customers 
under those var agreements  the company records only the amount paid by the var as revenue and recognizes revenue when all revenue recognition criteria have been met 
the company also engages organizations that act as mere agents or distributors of its products agents  without title passing to the agent and with the agent only receiving a commission on the consummation of the sale to our customer 
the company records revenue on sales by agents on a gross basis before commissions due to the agent and only when all revenue recognition criteria are met as would be with a sale by the company directly to a customer not involving an agent 
sales reserves the sales reserve is an estimate for losses on receivables resulting from customer credits  cancellations and terminations and is recorded  if at all  as a reduction in revenue at the time of the sale 
increases to sales reserve are charged to revenue  reducing the revenue otherwise reportable 
the sales reserve estimate is based on an analysis of the historical rate of credits  cancellations and terminations 
the accuracy of the estimate is dependent on the rate of future credits  cancellations and terminations being consistent with the historical rate 
if the rate of actual credits  cancellations and terminations is different than the historical rate  revenue would be different from what was reported 
as of march   we did not believe that an accrual for sales reserves was appropriate  but continue to assess the adequacy of the sales reserve account balance on a quarterly basis 
allowance for doubtful accounts we record an allowance for doubtful accounts to provide for losses on accounts receivable due to customer credit risk 
increases to the allowance for doubtful accounts are charged to general and administrative expense as bad debt expense 
losses on accounts receivable due to financial distress or failure of the customer are charged to the allowance for doubtful accounts 
the allowance estimate is based on an analysis of the historical rate of credit losses 
the accuracy of the estimate is dependent on the future rate of credit losses being consistent with the historical rate 
if the rate of future credit losses is greater than the historical rate  then the allowance for doubtful accounts may not be sufficient to provide for actual credit losses 
the allowance for doubtful accounts for ilinc web collaboration product sales is  as of march    and is based on our historical collection experience 
any adjustments to these accounts are reflected in the income statement for the current period  as an adjustment to revenue in the case of the sales reserve and as a general and administrative expense in the case of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
software development costs the company accounts for software development costs in accordance with statements of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed  whereby costs for the development of new software products and substantial enhancements to existing software products are expensed as incurred until technological feasibility has been established  at which time any additional costs are capitalized 
technological feasibility is established upon completion of a working model 
costs of maintenance and customer support are charged to expense when related revenue is recognized or when those costs are incurred  whichever occurs first 
software development costs incurred subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility have not been significant to date  and all software development costs have been charged to research and development expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
intangible assets on april   the company adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets and as a result  the company s goodwill is no longer amortized 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill be tested annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise for impairment 
upon initial application of sfas no 
 the company determined there was no impairment of goodwill 
the company has established the date of march on which to value its goodwill 
the company has made acquisitions of companies having operations or technology in areas within its strategic focus and has recorded goodwill and other intangible assets associated with its acquisitions 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of the underlying acquired operations could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the goodwill and other intangible assets thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
as of march   the company has identified no such impairment 
debt issuance costs are amortized using the effective interest rate method over the ten year term of the related debt obligations 
other intangibles primarily consist of the quisic and learnlinc purchase consideration that was allocated to purchased software and customer relationship intangibles 
such other intangible are amortized over their expected benefit period of twenty four to thirty six months 
income taxes the company utilizes the liability method of accounting for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred taxes are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted marginal tax rates currently in effect when the differences reverse 
the company has recorded a full valuation allowance to reduce the carrying value of its net deferred tax assets because it has concluded that it is more likely than not that it will not be realized 
the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
in the event the company was to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase net income in the period such a determination was made 
stock based compensation in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment to sfas no 
sfas no 
provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method on accounting for stock based employee compensation 
the company has adopted the disclosure provisions of sfas no 
and accordingly the implementation of sfas no 
did not have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
guarantees and indemnifications in november  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation fin no 
guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others an interpretation of fasb statements no 
 and and rescission of fin the following is a summary of the company s agreements that the company has determined are within the scope of fin no 
the company provides a day warranty for certain of its products 
historically  the company s performance under the warranty has been minimal  and as such  no warranty accrual has been provided for in the company s consolidated financial statements 
under its bylaws  the company has agreed to indemnify its officers and directors for certain events or occurrences arising as a result of the officer s or director s serving in such capacity 
the term of the indemnification period is for the officer s or director s lifetime 
the maximum potential amount of future payments the company could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited 
however  the company has a director and officer liability insurance policy that limits its exposure and enables it to recover a portion of any future amounts paid 
as a result of its insurance policy coverage  the company believes the estimated fair value of these indemnification agreements is minimal and has no liabilities recorded for these agreements as of march  the company enters into indemnification provisions under i its agreements with other companies in its ordinary course of business  typically with business partners  contractors  and customers  landlords and ii its agreements with investors 
under these provisions the company generally indemnifies and hold harmless the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party as a result of the company s activities or  in some cases  as a result of the indemnified party s activities under the agreement 
the maximum potential amount of future payments the company could be required to make under these indemnification provisions is unlimited 
the company has not incurred material costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to these indemnification agreements 
as a result  the company believes the estimated fair value of these agreements is minimal 
accordingly  the company has no liabilities recorded for these agreements as of march  recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued sfas no

additional risk factors that may affect our operating results and the market price of our common stock you should carefully consider the risks described below 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
in that case  the trading price of our common stock could be adversely affected 
we have a limited operating history  which makes it difficult to evaluate our business 
we have a limited operating history in the web conferencing e learning business 
while the organizations that we have acquired have been engaged in the their respective business for over five years  we only recently acquired those assets and have undertaken to integrate their assets into our operations at varying levels 
over the past months  we have made significant changes to our product mix and service mix  our growth strategies  our sales and marketing plans  and other operational matters 
as a result  it may be difficult to evaluate an investment in our company 
given our recent investment in technology  we cannot be certain that our business model and future operating performance will yield the results that we intend 
in addition  the competitive and rapidly changing nature of the e learning and web conferencing markets makes it difficult for us to predict future results 
our business strategy may be unsuccessful and we may be unable to address the risks we face 
we face risks inherent in internet related businesses and may be unsuccessful in addressing these risks 
we face risks frequently encountered by early stage companies in new and rapidly evolving markets such as e learning and web conferencing 
we may fail to adequately address these risks and  as a consequence  our business may suffer 
to address these risks among others  we must successfully introduce and attract new customers to our products and services  successfully implement our sales and marketing strategy to generate sufficient sales and revenues to achieve or sustain operations  foster existing relationships with our existing customers to provide for continued or recurring business and cash flow  and  successfully address and establish new products and technologies as new markets develop 
as an early stage company  we may not be able to sufficiently access  address and overcome risks inherent in our business strategy 
our quarterly operating results are uncertain and may fluctuate significantly 
our operating results have varied significantly from quarter to quarter and are likely to continue to fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors  many of which we cannot control 
factors that may adversely affect our quarterly operating results include the size and timing of product orders  the mix of revenue from custom services and software products  the market acceptance of our products and services  our ability to develop and market new products in a timely manner and the market acceptance of these new products  the timing of revenues and expenses relating to our product sales  and  the timing of revenue recognition 
expense levels are based  in part  on expectations as to future revenue and to a large extent are fixed in the short term 
to the extent we are unable to predict future revenue accurately  we may be unable to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall 
we have significant operating losses  have limited financial resources  and may not become profitable 
we have incurred substantial operating losses and have limited financial resources at our disposal 
we have and long term obligations that we will not be able to satisfy without additional debt and or equity capital and ultimately generating profits and cash flows from our e learning and web conferencing operations 
if we are unable to achieve profitability in the near future  we will face increasing demands for capital and liquidity 
we may not be successful in raising additional debt or equity capital and may not become profitable in the short term or not at all 
as a result  we may not have sufficient financial resources to satisfy our obligations as they come due in the short term 
our auditors have expressed substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern 
our consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a basis which assumes that we will continue as a going concern and which contemplates the realization of our assets and the satisfaction of our liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business 
we have a significant working capital deficiency  and have historically suffered substantial recurring losses and negative cash flows from operations 
these factors  among others  and the limited operating history as an e learning and web collaboration company have caused our auditors to conclude in their report that there is substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern 
our plans with regard to these factors include continued development  marketing and licensing of our web conferencing and e learning products and services through both internal growth and acquisition 
although we continue to pursue these plans  there is no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining sufficient revenues from our products and services to provide adequate cash flows to sustain operations 
our continuation is dependent on our ability to raise additional equity or debt capital  to increase our e learning revenues  to generate positive cash flows from operations and to achieve profitability 
the consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability of assets and classification of liabilities that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty 
listing qualifications may not be met 
the american stock exchange s continued listing standards require that the company maintain stockholder s equity of at least million if the company has losses from continuing operations and or net losses in three of its four most recent fiscal years 
while the company has sustained losses in three of its four most recent fiscal years  and had less than million of stockholder s equity at march   the company raised approximately million in additional equity capital  converted certain other debt to equity and completed an acquisition subsequent to the fiscal year end and therefore has as of the date of this report stockholder s equity in excess of the million requirement 
if in the future  the company fails to maintain a sufficient level of stockholder s equity in compliance with those and other listing standards of the american stock exchange then the company would be required to submit a plan to the american stock exchange describing how it intended to regain compliance with the requirements 
dilution to existing stockholders is likely to occur upon issuance of shares we have reserved for future issuance 
on march    shares of our common stock were issued  of which  were held in treasury  and  additional shares of our common stock were reserved for issuance 
the issuance of these additional shares will reduce the percentage ownership of existing stockholders in the company 
the following shares were reserved for issuance as of march  o issued and outstanding stock options to purchase common shares totaling  o issued and outstanding warrants to purchase common shares totaling  o issued and outstanding warrant to purchase  of convertible redeemable subordinated notes with detachable warrants for  common shares  all of which are exercisable for or convertible into an aggregate  common shares  o issued and outstanding warrant to purchase  shares of convertible preferred stock with detachable warrants for  common shares  all of which are exercisable for or convertible into an aggregate  common shares  o a restricted stock grant to receive shares totaling approximately  and o shares issuable upon the conversion of convertible redeemable subordinated notes and preferred stock totaling a potential aggregate of  common shares 
the existence of these reserved shares coupled with other factors  such as the relatively small public float  could adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock and our ability to raise capital through an offering of equity securities 
the loss of the services of our senior executives and key personnel would likely cause our business to suffer 
our success depends to a significant degree on the performance of our senior management team 
the loss of any of these individuals could harm our business 
we do not maintain key person life insurance for any officers or key employees other than on the life of james m 
powers  jr  our chairman  president and ceo  with that policy providing a death benefit to the company of million 
our success also depends on the ability to attract  integrate  motivate and retain additional highly skilled technical  sales and marketing  and professional services personnel 
to the extent we are unable to attract and retain a sufficient number of additional skilled personnel  our business will suffer 
our intellectual property may become subject to legal challenges  unauthorized use or infringement  any of which could diminish the value of our products and services 
our success depends in large part on our proprietary technology 
if we fail to successfully enforce our intellectual property rights  the value of these rights  and consequently the value of our products and services to our customers  could diminish substantially 
it may be possible for third parties to copy or otherwise obtain and use our intellectual property or trade secrets without our authorization  and it may also be possible for third parties to independently develop substantially equivalent intellectual property 
currently  we do not have patent protection in place related to our products and services 
litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights  to protect trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others 
while we have not received any notice of any claim of infringement of any of our intellectual property  from time to time we may receive notice of claims of infringement of other parties proprietary rights 
such claims could result in costly litigation and could divert management and technical resources 
these types of claims could also delay product shipment or require us to develop non infringing technology or enter into royalty or licensing agreements  which agreements  if required  may not be available on reasonable terms  or at all 
competition in the web conferencing services market is intense and we may be unable to compete successfully  particularly as a result of recent announcements from large software companies 
the market for web conferencing services is relatively new  rapidly evolving and intensely competitive 
competition in our market will continue to intensify and may force us to reduce our prices  or cause us to experience reduced sales and margins  loss of market share and reduced acceptance of our services 
many of our competitors have larger and more established customer bases  longer operating histories  greater name recognition  broader service offerings  more employees and significantly greater financial  technical  marketing  public relations and distribution resources than we do 
we expect that we will face new competition as others enter our market to develop web conferencing services 
these current and future competitors may also offer or develop products or services that perform better than ours 
in addition  acquisitions or strategic partnerships involving our current and potential competitors could harm us in a number of ways 
future regulations could be enacted that either directly restrict our business or indirectly impact our business by limiting the growth of internet based business and services 
as commercial use of the internet increases  federal  state and foreign agencies could enact laws or adopt regulations covering issues such as user privacy  content and taxation of products and services 
if enacted  such laws or regulations could limit the market for our products and services 
although they might not apply to our business directly  we expect that laws or rules regulating personal and consumer information could indirectly affect our business 
it is possible that such legislation or regulation could expose companies involved in providing internet based services to liability  which could limit the growth of web use generally and thereby reduce demand for our products and services 
such legislation or regulation could dampen the growth in web usage and decrease its acceptance as a medium of communications and commerce 
we depend largely on one time sales to grow revenues 
a high percentage of our revenue is attributable to one time purchases by our customers rather than long term recurring asp type contracts 
as a result  our inability to continue to obtain new agreements and sales may result in lower than expected revenue  and therefore  harm our ability to achieve or sustain operations or profitability on a consistent basis  which could also cause our stock price to decline 
further  because we face competition from larger better capitalized companies  we could face increased downward pricing pressure that could cause a decrease in our gross margins 
our operating results may suffer if we fail to develop and foster our value added reseller or distribution relationships 
we have an existing channel and distribution network that provides growing revenues and contributes to our high margin software sales 
these distribution partners are not obligated to distribute our services at any particular minimum level 
as a result  we cannot accurately predict the amount of revenue we will derive from our distribution partners in the future 
the inability of our distribution partners to sell our products to their customers and increase their distribution of our products could result in significant reductions in our revenue  and therefore  harm our ability to achieve or sustain profitability on a consistent basis 
sales in foreign jurisdictions by us and our international distributor network may cause costs that are not anticipated 
we continue to expand internationally through our value added reseller network and oem partners 
we have limited experience in international operations and may not be able to compete effectively in international markets 
we face certain risks inherent in conducting business internationally  such as o our inability to establish and maintain effective distribution channels and partners  o the varying technology standards from country to country  o our inability to effectively protect our intellectual property rights or the code to our software  o our inexperience with inconsistent regulations and unexpected changes in regulatory requirements in foreign jurisdictions  o language and cultural differences  o fluctuations in currency exchange rates  o our inability to effectively collect accounts receivable  or o our inability to manage sales and other taxes imposed by foreign jurisdictions 
the growth of our business substantially depends on our ability to successfully develop and introduce new services and features in a timely manner 
we acquired our web collaboration  web conferencing and virtual classroom software in november of with our focus upon that product suite our growth depends on our ability to continue to develop new features  products and services around the ilinc suite and line of products 
we may not successfully identify  develop and market new products and features in a timely and cost effective manner 
if we fail to develop and maintain market acceptance of our existing and new products to offset our continuing development costs  then our net losses will increase and we may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability on a consistent basis 
if we fail to offer competitive pricing  we may not be able to attract and retain customers 
because the web conferencing market is relatively new and still evolving  the prices for these services are subject to rapid and frequent changes 
in many cases  businesses provide their services at significantly reduced rates  for free or on a trial basis in order to win customers 
due to competitive factors and the rapidly changing marketplace  we may be required to significantly reduce our pricing structure  which would negatively affect our revenue  margins and our ability to achieve or sustain profitability on a consistent basis 
we have an existing channel and distribution network that provides growing revenues and contributes to our high margin software sales 
these distribution partners are not obligated to distribute our services at any particular minimum level 
as a result  we cannot accurately predict the amount of revenue we will derive from our distribution partners in the future 
our inability of our distribution partners to sell our products to their customers and increase their distribution of our products could result in significant reductions in our revenue  and therefore  harm our ability to achieve or sustain profitability on a consistent basis 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the following discusses our exposure to market risk related to changes in interest rates  equity prices and foreign currency exchange rates 
market risk generally represents the risk of loss that may result from the potential change in the value of a financial instrument as a result of fluctuations in interest rates and market prices 
we have not traded or otherwise bought and sold derivatives nor do we expect to in the future 
we also do not invest in market risk sensitive instruments for trading purposes 
we provide our products and services to customers in the united states  europe and elsewhere throughout the world 
sales are predominately made in us dollars  however  we have sold products that were payable in euros and canadian dollars 
a strengthening of the us dollar could make our products and services less competitive in foreign markets 
the primary objective of the company s investment activity is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  the company maintains its portfolio of cash equivalents in a variety of money market funds 
as of march   the carrying value of our outstanding convertible redeemable subordinated notes was approximately million at fixed interest rates of to 
in certain circumstances  we may redeem this long term debt 
our other components of indebtedness bear fixed interest rates of to 
because the interest rates on these instruments are fixed  a hypothetical change in interest rates would not have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition  revenues or operations 
increases in interest rates could  however  increase the interest expense associated with future borrowings  if any 
we do not hedge against interest rate increases
