item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following review of the trust s financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto 
the discussion of net production attributable to the hugoton and san juan properties represents production volumes that are to a large extent hypothetical as the trust does not own and is not entitled to any specific production volumes 
see note to the financial statements 
any discussion of actual production volumes represents the hydrocarbons that were produced from the properties in which the trust has a net profits overriding royalty interest 
critical accounting policies the financial statements of the trust are prepared on the following basis a royalty income recorded for a month is the amount computed and paid by the working interest owners to the trustee for such month rather than either the value of a portion of the oil and gas produced by the working interest owners for such month or the amount subsequently determined to be the trust s proportionate share of the net proceeds for such month  b interest income  interest receivable and distributions payable to unitholders include interest to be earned on short term investments from the financial statement date through the next date of distribution  and c trust general and administrative expenses  net of reimbursements  are recorded in the month they accrue 
this basis for reporting distributable income is considered to be the most meaningful because distributions to the unitholders for a month are based on net cash receipts for such month 
however  these statements differ from financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america because  under such principles  royalty income for a month would be based on net proceeds from production for such month without regard to when calculated or received and interest income for a month would be calculated only through the end of such month 
liquidity and capital resources as discussed under description of the trust in item of this form k  the trust s source of cash is the royalty income received from its share of the net proceeds from the royalty properties 
reference is made to note in the notes to financial statements under item of this form k for estimates of future royalty income attributable to the royalty 
in accordance with the provisions of the conveyance  generally all revenues received by the trust  net of trust administrative expenses and the amount of established reserves  are distributed currently to the unitholders
