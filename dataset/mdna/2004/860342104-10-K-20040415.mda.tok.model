business segment table in thousands  except percentages sales fiscal fiscal fiscal tactical vehicle systems power products engineered products distributed energy solutions airline products total sales operating profit loss fiscal fiscal fiscal tactical vehicle systems power products engineered products distributed energy solutions airline products corporate total operating profit loss interest expense interest and investment income earnings loss from continuing operations before taxes operating profit loss as a percentage of sales fiscal fiscal fiscal tactical vehicle systems power products engineered products distributed energy solutions airline products consolidated results of operations overview fiscal was a year of disappointing financial performance  as all but one of our business segments reported an operating loss for the second consecutive year 
it was also a year marked by many strategic actions and events throughout all of our business segments  as well as within our corporate headquarters 
these events represent important steps toward improving the overall financial performance of the company 
as we enter fiscal  we plan to continue our execution of the management action plans required to achieve acceptable financial returns throughout all of our operating segments 
some of the more significant events in fiscal are identified in the following table by consolidated statement of operations line item and resulted in the following significant charges in fiscal in millions gross profit selling and administrative costs impairment of assets pension curtailment total power products inventory impairment goodwill impairment employee separation costs legal expenses total power products engineered products inventory impairment costs associated with manufacturing consolidation long lived asset impairment total engineered products distributed energy solutions inventory impairment customer contract issues costs associated with manufacturing consolidation long lived asset impairment total distributed energy solutions airline products inventory impairment corporate employee separation costs pension curtailment expense self insurance reserves total corporate corporate during the second half of fiscal and early fiscal  a number of significant management changes took place 
max lukens was named president and chief executive officer in february  after serving in such capacity on an interim basis since september don kyle joined the company as president of the power products division in january shortly thereafter  mark whitman joined the company as president of the engineered products division and pete defronzo was named president of the distributed energy solutions segment 
in addition  several corporate positions were eliminated 
soon after mr 
lukens was appointed interim president and chief executive officer in september  we initiated a strategic review of all of our primary businesses 
as a part of this review  we refocused our primary operating metrics and management incentive measurements to emphasize the need to improve our return on shareholder invested capital 
using the company s total weighted average cost of capital which we currently believe to be approximately per annum as the threshold for acceptable return  we are reviewing each business segment s performance and potential for achieving this threshold 
within each business segment  we are taking the actions that we believe will help us achieve and sustain an acceptable return on invested capital 
depending upon the circumstances and our assessment of the long term potential for a given business activity or product offering  such actions might include headcount reductions and other cost control measures  the realignment or restructuring of sales or distribution channels  or the orderly exit of the business activity via sale  closure or wind down 
as a result of this ongoing review  strategic actions were taken within the distributed energy solutions and power products segments during the second half of fiscal these actions are described in more detail below 
additionally  to reduce ongoing operating costs and improve our competitive position  we froze the benefits earned under our defined benefit pension plan  our defined benefit supplemental executive retirement plan and our postretirement medical plan effective july  excluding one time  non cash pension curtailment expenses of million  these changes reduced our pension and postretirement expense by approximately million in fiscal from what they otherwise would have been  based on actuarial projections 
further  these changes are expected to reduce our pension and postretirement expense significantly in future years from what they otherwise would have been  based on actuarial projections 
tactical vehicle systems in april  the us army awarded us the fmtv a competitive rebuy acr production contract 
the acr contract includes the production of  fmtv trucks and trailers over a five year period  with an option for  additional trucks and trailers 
full rate production under the acr contract is expected to begin in november in december  we announced an agreement with daimlerchrysler ag that grants us the exclusive right to market the mercedes benz gelandew gen g wagen series of military vehicles to us government authorities  including all federal  state and local government agencies 
this marketing agreement expires in december the g wagen is available in several configurations with a maximum payload of approximately two metric tons 
power products during the fourth quarter of fiscal  several significant actions have been taken to improve profitability of this segment  including the decision to exit the thermo king product offering  and the sale of related assets in texas and louisiana 
the closure of four under performing branch locations 
reduction of approximately employees in order to improve the segment s cost structure 
implementation of programs to liquidate slow moving inventory in order to reduce capital investment in the business 
subsequent to our fiscal year end  we also sold the assets of our wheelchair lift manufacturing and mercruiser distribution product offerings  for aggregate cash proceeds of million and no material gain or loss 
we intend to continue to evaluate the many activities in this business segment in fiscal and take the appropriate actions in order to improve the segment s contribution to the company s return on invested capital 
engineered products during fiscal  we completed our manufacturing operations consolidation project  which was approved by management in january this project included the relocation of the houston fabrication facility for the distributed energy solutions segment  along with the railcar mover and snow blower manufacturing operations from the utilities equipment business into an existing engineered products facility in houston  texas 
total capital expenditures related to this project were million and total operating expenses were million  all of which were incurred during fiscal distributed energy solutions subsequent to our review of all primary businesses in the third quarter of fiscal  we announced the decision to exit the turnkey engineering  procurement and construction epc activities of our distributed energy solutions segment  which had operations in sacramento  california and houston  texas 
this plan was approved by management in october airline products in an effort to reduce invested working capital in this business segment  we initiated a plan to expedite the liquidation of certain inventory in the current market environment 
fiscal vs 
fiscal fiscal sales were unchanged from fiscal at  million 
a sales increase in the engineered products segment in fiscal was offset by sales declines in the power products  distributed energy solutions  and tactical vehicle systems segments of   and  respectively  compared to fiscal gross profit decreased million to million in fiscal from fiscal this decline reflects a gross profit margin decrease to  compared to in fiscal the decline in gross profit margin is primarily attributable to the distributed energy solutions segment  which generated million of the decline and the power products segment  which contributed an additional million of gross profit margin deterioration 
to a lesser extent  the airline products and engineered products segment also contributed to the decline  generating a million and million profit margin deterioration  respectively 
the remainder of the variance is primarily due to a change in sales mix between business segments 
the fiscal gross profit includes million of non cash charges associated with inventory impairment charges resulting from management actions taken in the second half of the year 
the breakdown of these inventory impairment charges are identified below in segment data 
fiscal results include million of asset impairment charges pursuant to analyses prepared in accordance with sfas no 
and sfas no 
within the engineered products  distributed energy solutions  and power products segments 
fiscal results include a million asset impairment charge within the airline products segment 
these asset impairment charges are described further in the segment data section below 
selling and administrative expenses increased by million  or  to million in fiscal from fiscal selling and administrative expenses in fiscal include the million of significant charges associated with key management actions noted above  which are described in more detail in the segment data below 
the remainder of the change from fiscal is attributable to increases in certain operating expenses  which were largely offset by cost reduction actions 
as mentioned above  the employee benefits earned under our defined benefit pension plan  defined benefit supplemental executive retirement plan and our postretirement medical plan were frozen effective july  these changes resulted in a one time non cash charge of million to write off previously unamortized prior service costs pension curtailment expense during the first quarter of fiscal net interest expense decreased by million from fiscal to million in fiscal the decrease in interest expense is primarily attributable to the scheduled payment of million on long term borrowings that was made in may the effective tax rate was for fiscal compared to for fiscal the lower fiscal effective tax rate is primarily the result of the unusually large impact of federal tax credits in proportion to the relatively small pre tax income figure  along with state and foreign income tax benefits which did not recur in fiscal in fiscal  we do not expect that tax benefits or credits will represent a significant portion of pre tax income  and as such  we anticipate that the effective tax rate will remain relatively consistent with fiscal discontinued operations generated an after tax loss of million in fiscal  compared to an million loss in fiscal these losses in fiscal primarily represent costs associated with retained contracts  warranty and legal claims and obligations associated with our discontinued blowout preventer and controls  valve and drilling riser business  which was sold during fiscal in addition  in the second quarter of fiscal  we recognized a loss from disposal of this business of million  net of tax  resulting from the sale of these operations 
we do not anticipate any future significant losses from the retained obligations of this discontinued business  with the possible exception of the diamond offshore litigation discussed in item above and in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we are presently unable to determine whether a material liability has been incurred in the diamond offshore matters or to reasonably estimate the amount or range of any loss that may result from such matters 
in the first quarter of fiscal  we recognized  as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle  a charge of million net of tax  or per diluted share  upon adoption of new accounting standards related to the valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets 
net loss from continuing operations recognized in fiscal was million  or per diluted share 
this represented a million change from the million of earnings  or per diluted share recorded in fiscal including discontinued operations and the cumulative effect of change in accounting  the net loss in fiscal was million  or per diluted share  compared to a million net loss  or per diluted share  in fiscal tactical vehicle systems the tactical vehicle systems segment  which manufactures tactical vehicles for the us army and others  recorded sales of million in fiscal  down million or from fiscal the segment delivered  trucks and trailers in fiscal  compared to  trucks and trailers in fiscal by comparison  the quantities included a lower proportion of larger vehicles  which have a higher unit sales price 
as a result  fiscal sales of equipment were down to million from fiscal engineering and service sales were down to million in fiscal from the previous year  primarily due to lower activity associated with a us army project to retrofit existing tactical vehicles with certain product enhancements 
this decline in service sales was partially offset by an increase in parts sales  which approximately doubled to million  primarily attributable to the increased replacement needs for vehicles deployed in iraq 
operating profit for this segment in fiscal was million operating margin  down from million operating margin in fiscal this slight decline in operating profit is primarily attributable to the lower sales volume in fiscal selling and administrative expenses were relatively flat from fiscal to fiscal as a decrease in costs associated with bid and proposal activities was offset by increased costs in some expense categories 
full rate production under the acr contract is scheduled to begin in november the delivery schedule at the outset of the acr contract is expected to result in a decline in sales volume during the fourth quarter of fiscal the total sales volume for fiscal  however  is currently expected to exceed fiscal sales levels due to higher unit volumes during the first three quarters of fiscal as a result of the acr contract  our profit margins in this segment are expected to be lower than historical margin levels achieved with the current fmtv contract  which we believe to have been substantially higher than those typically achieved by defense contractors 
actual future margins of this segment will  however  be dependent upon a number of factors including our ability to achieve efficiencies and other materials and labor cost control measures  the actual quantities and variations of vehicles purchased by the us army under the acr contract  the potential for additional contracts  bid and proposal activities and other factors 
the operating margin this segment will achieve in total may also be impacted by additional sales  if any  to other allied governments and the level of engineering and service provided 
the us government is the primary customer of the tactical vehicle systems segment  accounting for nearly all of the sales of the segment 
the fmtv contracts are subject to termination at the election of the customer and provide for termination charges that would reimburse us for allowable costs  but not necessarily all costs incurred 
the loss of this customer would have a material adverse effect on our future financial condition and results of operations 
the fmtv incorporates engines  transmissions  axles and a number of other components that are specified by the us army and are available only from the source or sources selected by the us army 
in addition  we use other suppliers for certain components of the fmtv  some of which are small businesses that are not well capitalized 
interruption of the supply of any of these components  for any reason  could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations of the tactical vehicle systems segment 
we believe that the us army would compensate us for any delays arising from the interruption in the supply of source specified components under the fmtv contracts 
in september  we submitted an amended bid to the united kingdom s ministry of defence uk mod  for their multi year production contract for over  trucks 
we anticipate that the uk mod will announce the preferred bidder in  however  we cannot reliably predict when the uk mod will make its decision as to the final award of the production contract or whether we will be named the preferred bidder 
power products the power products segment sells and rents various industrial equipment  sells components  replacement parts  accessories and other materials supplied by independent manufacturers  and provides in shop and on site repair services for industrial  transportation  marine  construction  power generation and material handling equipment 
sales for the power products segment in fiscal were million  a million decrease from the million recorded in fiscal this decline is largely attributable to lower equipment sales  as a reduction in marine application projects resulted in approximately million decline in sales 
additionally we experienced approximately million in lower equipment sales due to lower capital spending from customers in other markets we serve  including oil and gas exploration and commercial trucking 
a breakdown of power products segment sales follows in millions fiscal fiscal equipment sales parts sales service and rental sales operating loss for this segment in fiscal was million  a million deterioration from the million operating loss posted in fiscal the lower sales volume contributed million to the operating loss  partially due to the relatively fixed cost structure in the service and rental departments 
additionally  increased employee compensation and benefits contributed approximately million to the operating loss 
we also incurred increased legal expenses related to defense and settlement of certain legal claims against the company totaling million  million of employee separation costs related to headcount reductions  and higher bad debt expense of million  partially due to economic weakness in the markets that we serve 
lower margin product sales  partially due to efforts to dispose of slow moving inventory  along with higher ongoing operating expenses contributed an additional million to the fiscal loss 
as mentioned above  due to the deteriorating performance of the power products segment  our management took several actions in the fourth quarter of fiscal to improve the operating results of this segment 
these actions resulted in additional charges to the segment  which further deteriorated the fiscal operating loss 
most notably  the segment incurred a million charge for the disposal and impairment of inventory related to the implementation of programs to liquidate slow moving inventory in the current market environment in order to reduce working capital investment in the business 
additionally  the decision to exit the thermo king product line prompted a test of recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
as a result of this analysis  we impaired the goodwill by million 
further  the strategic review performed in the second half of fiscal led to the closure of four under performing branch locations in texas and louisiana  as well as the planned exit of the thermo king product offering in texas  louisiana and northern california 
additionally  we decided to sell the assets of our wheelchair lift manufacturing and mercruiser distribution product offerings  both of which sales were completed subsequent to our fiscal year end 
we also initiated a significant cost reduction program which included the reduction of more than employees during the second half of fiscal as a result of these exit and restructuring activities  we incurred million of costs in fiscal  nearly all of which related to employee termination costs 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we entered into new contracts with detroit diesel corporation for the distribution and servicing of its diesel engine products 
the new distribution agreement consists of two separate sets of contracts 
one set  which expires in december  is with detroit diesel corporation and covers the on highway products and services 
under the terms of the new on highway agreements with all of its distributors  detroit diesel will allow its affiliated freightliner  sterling and western star dealers collectively  the freightliner dealers to purchase their on highway detroit diesel parts directly from the freightliner parts distribution centers  rather than purchasing them from a detroit diesel distributor such as the company  as was previously required 
we expect this to result in lower sales by us to these dealers 
although we believe we may still receive business from some freightliner dealers because of our substantial service capabilities and availability of stock parts  we will not know the impact of the change until we have actually operated under the new agreements for some period of time 
our sales of on highway detroit diesel parts to freightliner dealers in the past have contributed less than million of our annual total sales 
additionally  because these same dealers will be allowed to purchase their parts directly from the manufacturer at the same pricing levels as we do and sell those parts to the same on highway customers as we do  we expect to face increased competition for sales of detroit diesel on highway parts to other customers in fiscal and thereafter 
our previous agreements with detroit diesel also provided us with direct compensation from detroit diesel for dealer support 
we expect that this compensation arrangement could be phased out during the contract period  the impact of which we estimate to be a reduction in gross profit of million per year 
the second set of detroit diesel agreements is with daimlerchrysler off highway holding gmbh  and covers off highway products and services 
this contract expires in december and includes terms similar to the previous distribution agreement 
at present  we are unable to predict the effect of the new off highway contract arrangements on future operations or whether they will be renewed and  if so  on what terms upon their expiration 
in fiscal  we intend to continue our strategic review of the various business activities within the power products segment and take the actions appropriate to restore this segment to an acceptable level of financial return 
as a result of the many actions taken in the power products segment  we anticipate that this segment will generate positive operating profit and cash flow during fiscal although the product and facility exits in this segment will result in approximately million of revenue reduction  we believe these activities will largely be replaced by a higher quality revenue stream as we readdress the markets we serve with our existing product and service offerings and our current operating locations 
some economic improvement in the markets we serve  including commercial trucking  marine transportation  and oil and gas exploration may also occur  as suggested by recent improvement in key economic indicators related to these industries 
due to the many uncertainties involved with this business  however  we cannot confidently predict when this segment will achieve our targeted level of financial return 
engineered products the engineered products segment consists of two primary product lines  petroleum equipment and utilities equipment 
the petroleum equipment business manufactures equipment primarily for the well stimulation segment of the oil service industry 
its products include coil tubing systems and acidizing and fracturing systems 
the utilities equipment business manufactures mobile railcar movers  snow blowers  and off road seismic vehicles 
the engineered products segment recorded sales of million in fiscal  a million increase from the fiscal sales of million 
the petroleum equipment business generated approximately million of this sales increase through higher equipment sales both domestically and internationally  as capital spending increased somewhat in the oil services industry from fiscal additionally  this segment generated higher sales in utility equipment products of million primarily attributable to a three year production contract awarded in december to provide off road seismic vehicles for input output  inc production under this contract began during the second quarter of fiscal this segment posted an operating loss of million in fiscal  an million change from the million operating loss in fiscal despite the increased sales volume  which would have generated a million improvement to operating profit at prior year operating margins  the petroleum equipment sales had a much larger mix of lower margin sales to international customers 
as a result of this change in customer mix  the increased petroleum equipment volume contributed only million of incremental operating profit to this segment 
as mentioned above  we completed the consolidation of our manufacturing operations which included relocating the houston fabrication facility for the distributed energy solutions segment  along with the railcar movers and snow blower manufacturing operations from the utilities equipment business into an existing engineered products manufacturing facility in houston  texas 
the engineered products segment incurred million of costs associated with this consolidation project  all in fiscal subsequent to executing this consolidation project  continued poor operational performance led to a decision to exit the turnkey epc activities of our distributed energy solutions segment  as discussed below 
since the engineered products segment and the distributed energy solutions segment share the same manufacturing facility  this decision to exit the turnkey epc activities created a change of events that required a test of recoverability of long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
as a result of this analysis  we impaired the long lived assets of our manufacturing operations by million  reducing their carrying value to fair market value 
the engineered products segment incurred million of this long lived asset impairment charge  and the distributed energy solutions segment incurred the remaining million 
additionally  the segment recorded a million charge to write down specific inventory in conjunction with management s efforts to liquidate certain types of inventory in the current market environment to reduce working capital invested in the business 
further  higher operating expenses partially due to under utilization of the expanded manufacturing facility and other cost increases contributed approximately million to the operating loss 
backlog in this segment decreased from million at january  to million at january   reflecting the significant volume of international orders that was shipped in fiscal a significant portion of petroleum equipment sales are derived from customers outside the united states  principally in china  india and russia 
these sales are difficult to predict and typically come in large volume orders and require long lead times to complete 
the sales derived from customers in the united states are primarily driven by the capital spending budgets of the oilfield service companies we serve and  to some extent  the internal capacity of some customers to package their own equipment 
although oil and gas prices  drilling permits  work over rig utilization and drilling rig count are indicators of the overall condition of the markets we serve  changes in these indicators do not necessarily directly correlate to our order rate 
we are much more dependent on the timing of large international orders and the capital spending patterns of the individual customer base we serve 
in addition  we encounter significant price competition  especially in the case of international sales  which can significantly impact our success rate in gaining new orders 
sales levels in fiscal are expected to be relatively flat as lower petroleum equipment sales are expected to be offset by higher utilities equipment sales  specifically resulting from the continued production of the off road seismic vehicles 
operating margins are expected to be above break even levels in fiscal  due to the anticipated sales levels  the nature of certain charges in fiscal that are not likely to recur and continued cost efficiencies from the consolidation project 
distributed energy solutions the distributed energy solutions segment packages reciprocating diesel and natural gas engine generator sets and markets power generation solutions in domestic and certain international markets 
as mentioned above  we announced the decision to exit the turnkey epc activities within this segment during the third quarter of fiscal with respect to such epc activities  we are not quoting any new business but we continue to perform under existing contracts 
sales in this segment were million in fiscal  a million decrease from the million of sales recorded in fiscal this decrease is primarily due to the substantial completion of a large project in fiscal to provide the us navy with standby power units for its new nuclear powered aircraft carrier 
this segment posted an operating loss of million in fiscal  a million change from the million operating loss in fiscal the increased operating loss in fiscal was largely attributable to losses incurred on several turnkey epc projects in fiscal and the impact of a profitable us navy contract in fiscal  which factors combined to account for approximately million of the change 
also  the manufacturing consolidation project mentioned above resulted in million of expenses to the distributed energy solutions segment in fiscal during the third quarter of fiscal  we incurred million of charges  including million of increased costs to complete existing customer obligations and million of inventory valuation adjustment to reduce engine inventory to net realizable value based on current market conditions and the circumstances surrounding our exit of the epc activities 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded an additional million of charges associated with satisfying remaining contractual obligations and executing the exit plan of this business 
the charges primarily consisted of million of additional writedowns to reduce the carrying values of existing engine inventory to net realizable values  and million attributable to additional estimated costs to complete remaining fixed price epc contracts and to address other customer issues 
in connection with certain existing epc contracts  we have received a written notice of dispute from a customer regarding equipment and services to be provided to several sites operated by the customer 
in the dispute notice  the customer alleged various contractual claims  including claims for liquidated damages 
the customer acknowledged the expectation of continuing negotiations  but indicated that if the parties were unable to resolve the dispute  it would seek relief in arbitration 
additional issues have been raised by the customer  and issues exist with respect to the engines and the engine supplier 
accordingly  we are reviewing issues regarding this situation 
in fiscal  we incurred substantial losses on the contracts that are in dispute based on estimated costs to complete the contracts and to otherwise address customer issues on the contracts 
we are continuing to work with the customer on these contracts in dispute to resolve the customer s issues 
at present  we are unable to predict the outcome of this situation or even the aggregate amount of claims  if any  that may ultimately be asserted by the customer 
we are presently unable to determine whether any additional liability has been incurred in this matter beyond that which has been recorded or to reasonably estimate any amount or range of any further losses that may result from these contracts 
we intend to vigorously assert our positions in any arbitration of this matter should it not be resolved with the customer before any formal arbitration is initiated 
the epc contractual obligations are expected to be substantially completed by the end of fiscal we will  however  retain and execute obligations under certain fixed price operation and or maintenance contracts related to epc projects  which have terms ranging from two to nine years 
nearly all costs associated with the epc exit plan relate to the termination of employees 
total estimated exit costs are million  all of which are expected to be paid in fiscal no liability was established for these exit activities as of january   as these costs do not meet the criteria set forth under sfas no 
while the ultimate financial outcome of the operation and maintenance contracts is largely dependent upon the performance and durability of the related equipment  we do not expect that future losses on these contracts will be material in any given year 
further  we will continue to have risk as to performance obligations for installed equipment under epc contracts  which may generate losses in fiscal  as we continue to wind down our epc activities 
sales levels in fiscal are expected to be in the same range as fiscal as we continue to complete projects and liquidate inventory 
this segment is expected to continue to operate below breakeven levels  however  partially due to the exit costs to be incurred in fiscal as well as the ongoing loss expected to be incurred on operation and maintenance contracts 
we will continue our evaluation of the remaining business activities in the distributed energy solutions segment and take additional actions needed to improve the return in this business 
we anticipate that the sales  marketing and engineering activities related to the large generator set product offerings of this segment will be transferred to the power products segment in early fiscal airline products the airline products segment manufactures internal combustion and electric propulsion aircraft ground support equipment that includes aircraft tow tractors  gate pushback tractors  baggage tow tractors  beltloaders  air start units and air conditioning units 
sales in the airline products segment were million in fiscal  a million increase over the million of sales recorded in fiscal this improvement in sales is largely attributable to improved economic conditions in the airline industry  specifically among regional airlines  stronger sales to governmental customers  as well as million of sales in the davco product line  which was acquired in december this segment recorded an operating loss in fiscal of million  an improvement of million from the million incurred in fiscal this improvement is primarily attributable to the million impairment to the net carrying value of property  plant and equipment  and goodwill and other intangible assets  which was recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal in accordance with sfas no 
and sfas no 
the improvement related to this asset charge was partially offset by the impact of management actions taken during fiscal as part of our strategic review performed during the third quarter of fiscal  we recorded a million non cash charge to reduce this segment s inventory to net realizable value in connection with management s decision to liquidate certain inventory in the current market environment 
the remainder of the change in operating loss is attributable to an unfavorable product mix higher mix of low margin equipment as well as higher operating expenses 
during fiscal  we expect that the continued recovery of the commercial airline industry  as well as our continued efforts to expand our sales into military and industrial sectors  will generate increased sales volumes from fiscal in connection with these efforts to expand our customer base  we were awarded contracts in late fiscal and in fiscal by the us navy  naval air warfare center to deliver tow tractors and air conditioning units 
the initial contract award of million covers the design and testing of pilot production units along with associated technical data and training and pilot production testing 
this contract is expected to be executed in the second and third quarters of fiscal pending successful completion of the initial award  the contracts include four individual option years beginning in late fiscal or early fiscal which have a total contract value of approximately million  if all options are fully exercised 
operating margins in fiscal are expected to improve somewhat due to the nature of the inventory liquidation charges in fiscal as well as other operating expenses incurred in fiscal that we do not believe will recur 
these improvements might be offset  however  by the impact of recent increases in the cost of steel and other components required to build equipment 
we do not expect this segment to return to breakeven performance in fiscal the airline products segment has historically been highly dependent upon the economic well being of the airline industry  which was severely adversely impacted by the difficulties arising following the terrorist attacks on the united states in september while conditions in the airline industry have shown some signs of recovery during fiscal  the increased threat or future occurrence of terrorist attacks in the united states and abroad or the outbreak of a viral epidemic or other similar event such as sars could slow recovery or trigger another severe downturn in the airline industry 
corporate corporate expenses consist of costs incurred by the corporate headquarters group  which cannot be directly attributed to the activities of the business segments 
such costs include the facility related costs of maintaining the corporate office  as well as the operating expenses of the office of the chief executive  legal  finance  internal audit  investor relations  and other similar costs 
in fiscal  total corporate expenses were million  a million increase over the preceding fiscal year 
this increase was largely attributable to million of employee separation expenses and million of pension curtailment expense 
in addition to the elimination of several corporate positions  the employee separation expenses were largely associated with the resignation of our president and chief executive officer in september  including a million cash payment in exchange for the cancellation of stock options held by him 
as of january   million of accrued separation costs were recorded in liabilities  nearly all of which are expected to be paid in fiscal as a result of our decision to freeze the benefits earned under our defined benefit pension plan  our defined benefit supplemental executive retirement plan and our postretirement medical plan effective july   we recorded a one time non cash charge of million to write off previously unamortized prior service costs pension curtailment expense  which was required under accounting rules to reflect the plan changes 
corporate expenses were further increased in fiscal by the impact of a change in our general liability insurance coverage  which resulted in a million charge to increase our accrual for estimated self insurance costs 
these cost increases were partially offset by lower corporate spending and the impact of corporate staff reductions 
in fiscal  corporate expenses are anticipated to decline from fiscal levels  partially due to the expected absence of certain separation expenses and the pension curtailment expense incurred in fiscal  as well as the benefits achieved through various corporate headquarters staff reductions incurred during fiscal fiscal vs 
fiscal fiscal sales totaled  million  representing a decrease compared to fiscal sales of  million 
net earnings from continuing operations for fiscal were million  or per diluted share  compared to million  or per diluted share for fiscal  which included a one time gain of million after tax associated with settlements with the us army related to our tactical vehicle systems segment 
after the effect of discontinued operations and the cumulative effect of a change in accounting  the net loss for fiscal was million  or per diluted share  compared to net earnings for fiscal of million  or per diluted share 
tactical vehicle systems the tactical vehicle systems segment sales in fiscal increased to million  compared to million in fiscal total operating profit for fiscal was million compared to fiscal operating profit of million  which included million pre tax settlement of claims  net of expenses  with the us army 
the increase in sales in fiscal was primarily due to an increase in the volume of trucks delivered during the year 
in fiscal   trucks were shipped compared to  trucks during fiscal operating profit for fiscal was million  or of sales  compared to million  or of sales  in fiscal  excluding the impact of the one time settlements of claims with the us army 
this increase in sales  operating profit and operating profit percentage was largely due to the increased volume of truck shipments  which contributed million to operating profit  and improved operating efficiencies  partially due to the expansion of our fabrication facility and the resulting material cost savings  which contributed million to operating profit 
power products sales for the power products segment in fiscal decreased to million  compared to million in fiscal throughout fiscal  we continued to operate in a challenging marketplace characterized by a relatively weak economy 
both equipment and parts sales were lower in fiscal due to the relatively weak economic conditions in the various customer industries we serve 
as a result of these lower sales levels and an unfavorable mix between equipment sales  rentals  parts and service  operating profits declined by million in fiscal from fiscal further  inflationary impacts on employee salaries and employee benefits  as well as higher operating expenses contributed an additional decline in operating profits of million 
also  fiscal results included a credit of million to cost of sales due to a lower lifo inventory reserve  compared to a million credit in fiscal as a result  fiscal operating loss was million  compared to the fiscal operating profit of million 
distributed energy solutions sales for the distributed energy solutions segment decreased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal during fiscal  we experienced higher than normal demand for our large scale power generation products as a result of power shortages in california 
despite the lower sales volume  this segment s operating loss in fiscal was reduced to million compared to a million loss in fiscal fiscal results included a credit of million to cost of sales due to a lower lifo inventory reserve  compared to a charge of million in fiscal fiscal results also included the substantial completion of a large  profitable project to provide the us navy with standby power units for its new nuclear powered aircraft carrier 
engineered products sales for the engineered products segment totaled million for fiscal compared to million in fiscal the segment reported a million operating loss in fiscal compared to a million operating loss for fiscal this decline in sales and operating margin is nearly all attributable to the activities in the petroleum equipment product line 
during the first half of fiscal  the continuing operations of this segment were disrupted by the sale of the blowout preventer and controls  valve and drilling riser business discussed above 
during the second half of fiscal  however  a comparatively large number of profitable international orders were filled 
airline products sales in the airline products segment for fiscal were million  compared to million in fiscal the operating loss for fiscal was million  which included an asset impairment charge of million  compared to an operating loss of million in fiscal excluding the asset impairment charge  the operating loss improved by million in fiscal despite the lower sales volume  reflecting a reduction of fixed expenses  largely attributable to the consolidation of manufacturing facilities in georgia in the second half of fiscal corporate in fiscal  total corporate expenses were million  a million increase from the million of expenses incurred in fiscal this change was primarily attributable to an insurance settlement which resulted in a million one time gain in fiscal the impact of this item was partially offset by cost reduction programs initiated in fiscal liquidity and capital resources our sources of cash liquidity include cash and cash equivalents  short term investments and cash from operations 
we believe that these sources will provide sufficient capital to fund our working capital requirements  capital expenditure needs  dividends and other financial commitments 
total cash and short term investments have increased since january  to approximately million at march   largely as a result of customer receipts on large equipment orders in the engineered products segment that were shipped in late fiscal and early fiscal we anticipate that we will use cash during fiscal to fund the construction of additional expected orders in the engineered products segment and to satisfy our production requirements under the expiring fmtv contract in the tactical vehicle systems segment  which are expected to result in a decrease in billings in excess of costs on our consolidated balance sheet 
we believe that these activities could consume approximately million of cash during the second half of fiscal in addition  we anticipate that capital expenditures in fiscal will total approximately million  primarily to expand the fabrication facility in the tactical vehicle systems segment  to upgrade and maintain certain existing facilities and to support existing contracts 
we had a million unsecured revolving credit facility  which expired on january  no borrowings were outstanding under the facility at any time during the past three fiscal years 
based on non usage of the revolving credit facility combined with the increase in cash and cash equivalents subsequent to the end of fiscal and the expected cash from operations for the foreseeable future  we elected not to renew the facility 
to provide additional financial flexibility  we intend to negotiate a smaller revolving credit facility during fiscal there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully negotiate such a facility or  if we do  that such facility will include terms and conditions similar to the expired facility 
failure to negotiate a new facility on terms acceptable to us could restrict our future ability to make acquisitions and fund working capital  capital expenditures  common stock dividends or other financial obligations 
during fiscal  we entered into letter of credit facilities totaling million with financial institutions  to allow us to issue letters of credit as needed to support our commercial operations 
approximately million of letters of credit under these facilities were outstanding as of january  we have million in unsecured senior notes outstanding  which bear interest at a rate of and are due and payable in may additionally  million of such unsecured senior notes were paid when due in may the senior notes agreement limits sales of assets and other items and contains a maximum debt to total capitalization covenant 
based on our financial condition as of january   the restrictions imposed by our senior notes do not currently restrict our ability to meet our obligations or to declare and pay dividends at historical levels 
for additional information  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in fiscal  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement  which expires in fiscal  with a notional amount of million related to million of the senior notes due in this transaction  which is designated as a fair value hedge  effectively converts million of fixed rate debt with an interest rate of into floating rate debt with an interest rate of libor plus basis points 
the applicable floating interest rate as of january  was approximately 
the net interest received or paid as a result of the interest rate swap is included in interest expense on the consolidated statements of operations 
the recorded value of the swap and the related fair value adjustment to the debt are carried on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value 
in addition  our international subsidiaries had foreign currency bank notes payable totaling million and million at january  and  respectively 
such notes payable consist of renewable  secured loans for the purpose of financing our south american operations 
these loans are denominated in local currency colombian pesos and venezuelan bolivars and are secured by letters of credit issued by us and principally bear market based variable rates of interest 
we use foreign denominated debt to offset the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on our south america operations 
in the event that any acquisition of additional operations  growth in existing operations  settlements of lawsuits or disputes  changes in inventory levels  accounts receivable  tax payments or other working capital items create a permanent need for working capital or capital expenditures in excess of the existing cash and cash equivalents and committed lines of credit  we may seek to borrow under other long term financing instruments or seek additional equity capital

fiscal during fiscal  working capital decreased by million to million 
this decrease in working capital is primarily attributable to the million provision for excess and obsolete inventory and million of accrued losses on uncompleted contracts recorded in the second half of fiscal net cash provided by operating activities decreased by million to million in fiscal compared to fiscal this decrease is primarily attributable to the million decline in net earnings from continuing operations adjusted for non cash items  partially offset by million improvement in net operating assets and liabilities and million improvement in cash flow from discontinued operations 
net cash used in investing activities increased by million to million in fiscal compared to fiscal this increased usage is the result of a million cash inflow during fiscal primarily related to the sale of a discontinued operation  along with a million outflow during fiscal for short term investments with original maturities in excess of days 
capital expenditures increased million to million in fiscal  primarily as a result of million of capital additions at a houston facility shared by the engineered products and distributed energy solutions segments as part of our manufacturing consolidation effort 
net cash used in financing activities increased by million to million in fiscal compared to fiscal this increase is primarily attributable to the repayment of million in senior notes  which were due and paid on may  fiscal vs 
fiscal during fiscal  working capital decreased by million to million 
this decrease in working capital is primarily the result of the reclassification of million of senior notes due in may of from non current to current liabilities 
net cash provided by operating activities increased by million to million in fiscal compared to fiscal the decline in net earnings of million from fiscal was offset by a million cash flow change associated with accounts receivable collections and progress payments along with other changes in operating assets and liabilities 
net cash used in investing activities decreased by million to million in fiscal compared to fiscal this decreased usage is primarily attributable to higher capital expenditure levels in fiscal  specifically related to the construction of a new power products facility in dallas  texas  as well as the expansion of the fabrication facility in sealy  texas 
net cash used in financing activities decreased by million to million in fiscal compared to fiscal this decreased usage was the result of the million repayment of long and short term borrowings during fiscal contractual obligations and commercial commitments we occasionally enter into certain financing arrangements in the ordinary course of business  including non cancelable operating leases  letters of credit and debt guarantees 
we enter into operating leases for some of our facility and equipment needs 
such lease arrangements enable us to conserve cash by paying monthly lease rental fees for the applicable assets rather than purchasing them 
at the end of the lease period  we have no further obligation to the lessor 
if we decide to cancel or terminate a lease prior to the end of its term  we are typically obligated to pay the remaining lease payments over the term of the lease  and in certain cases may be allowed to sublet the asset to another party 
we are occasionally required to issue performance indemnities or to post letters of credit  generally issued by a bank  to collateralize certain insurance programs  to secure credit facilities or to ensure performance under contracts 
a letter of credit commits the issuer to remit specified amounts to the holder  if the holder demonstrates that we have failed to meet our obligations under the letter of credit 
if this were to occur  we would be obligated to reimburse the issuer for any payments the issuer was required to remit to the holder of the letter of credit 
generally  a letter of credit is released when we have satisfied the obligations that the letter of credit is securing 
our contractual obligations at january   excluding interest on debt balances  are summarized as follows in thousands less than one year fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal thereafter total long term debt obligations notes payable operating leases total contractual cash obligations in addition  our other commercial commitments expire as follows in thousands less than one year fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal thereafter total letters of credit contingent performance indemnities in addition to the above  we have noncontributory defined benefit pension plans that covered substantially all of our full time employees and a defined benefit postretirement medical plan 
effective july   we froze the benefits earned under these plans  with the exception of a small transition group 
we anticipate funding requirements during fiscal of million under the defined benefit pension plans and approximately million under the postretirement medical plan 
employee defined benefit plans in an effort to reduce ongoing operating costs and improve our competitive position  we froze the benefits earned under our defined benefit pension plan  our defined benefit supplemental executive retirement plan and our postretirement medical plan effective july   with the exception of a small transition group 
these plan changes are expected to significantly reduce our future costs and required contributions under these plans 
we have a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan that covered substantially all of our full time employees and an unfunded defined benefit supplemental executive retirement plan covering certain highly compensated employees 
the pension benefits are based on years of service  limited to years  and the employee s highest consecutive five year average compensation out of the last years of employment 
we fund pension costs in conformity with the funding requirements of applicable government regulations 
since our accumulated benefit obligation exceeds the fair value of our plan assets  we were required to reflect on our balance sheet a minimum pension liability for the difference totaling million as of january   million of which was recorded in fiscal minimum pension liability adjustments are non cash adjustments that are reflected as an increase in pension liability with an offsetting charge to shareholders equity net of income tax through other comprehensive income rather than net income 
the calculation of expense associated with our pension plans is dependent on key assumptions  including the discount rate  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets  and the assumed rate of compensation increases 
during fiscal  we lowered the assumed discount rate used for this calculation from in fiscal to  based on the change in the moody s aa long term corporate bond yield from january  to january  during fiscal  we reduced our expected long term rate of return on plan assets from in fiscal to in fiscal in determining the expected long term rate of return on plan assets  we considered the current level of expected returns on risk free investments primarily government bonds  the historical level of risk premiums associated with other asset classes and the expectations of future returns over a year time horizon on each asset class  based on the views of leading financial advisors and economists 
the expected return for each asset class was then weighted based on the plan s target asset allocation 
we also gave consideration to the returns being earned by the plan assets in the fund and the rates of return expected to be available for reinvestment using capital market projections  an estimated long term asset allocation strategy based on the plan s statement of investment policy  objectives and guidelines and an estimate of annual administrative  investment management and trading expenses 
consistent with the prior year  we used in fiscal as the assumed rate of compensation increase for our employee population  based on historical trends and the expectation that long term rates of compensation increase should approximate growth in overall gross domestic product 
we intend to use an expected long term rate of return assumption of for fiscal  based on the targeted asset mix of our invested plan assets 
we continuously review all assumptions used in the pension calculations and may revise them in the future 
if we were to decrease the expected long term rate of return on plan assets assumption by basis points  the pension expense we recognized in fiscal would have increased by million 
if we were to decrease the discount rate by basis points  the pension expense we recognized in fiscal would have increased by approximately million 
during fiscal  and we recognized million  million and million  respectively  of expense associated with our defined benefit pension plans 
during those same three years  we contributed million  million and million of funding  respectively to our pension plans 
based on the best available information we have at this time  we expect that in fiscal we will contribute at least million to our defined benefit pension plans and recognize approximately million of pension expense 
these pro forma estimates include a discount rate of  an expected long term rate of return on plan assets of and a rate of compensation increase 
increases in future pension funding requirements could occur if the actual return on plan assets in future periods does not approximate the long term rate of return assumed by us  and the amount of such increases could be material 
in addition to our defined benefit pension plans  we have a defined benefit postretirement medical plan  which provides for the payment of medical costs of eligible employees and dependents upon retirement 
the plan is currently not funded 
we expect to continue paying postretirement medical costs as covered claims are incurred 
effective july   we decided that postretirement medical benefits will not be provided to future retirees  with the exception of a small transition group 
in addition  plan participants will pay a higher portion of total plan costs in future years 
like the pension plans discussed above  the defined benefit postretirement medical plan is dependent on key assumptions  including the discount rate and future healthcare cost trend rates 
for this actuarial calculation  we used a discount rate of and assumed an annual rate of increase of approximately in the per capita cost of covered healthcare benefits in  eventually and gradually decreasing to by and remaining at that level thereafter 
a one percentage point change in the healthcare cost trend rate assumption in each future year would impact the postretirement benefit obligation by approximately million and would have an immaterial impact on total service and interest cost 
on december   president bush signed into law the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of the act 
the act introduces a medicare prescription drug benefit as well as a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree healthcare benefit plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to the medicare benefit 
as allowed by fasb staff position  accounting and disclosure requirements related to the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of  we have elected to defer recognizing the effects of the act on our accumulated postretirement benefit obligation and net periodic postretirement benefit cost in the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto until authoritative guidance on the accounting for the federal subsidy is issued 
when the authoritative guidance is issued  which is expected later in  we may be required to change previously reported information 
critical accounting policies preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and related disclosures during the period 
we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis  based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by us  additional adjustments to reserve items might be required 
we consider the following policies to be the most critical and pervasive accounting policies we use  and the areas most sensitive to material change from external factors 
revenue recognition revenue on equipment and parts sales is recognized when contract terms are met  collectibility is reasonably assured and a product is shipped or risk of ownership has been transferred to and accepted by the customer 
cash discounts or other incentives to customers are recorded as a reduction of revenues 
revenue from service agreements is recognized as earned  when services have been rendered 
revenue from rental agreements is recognized over the rental period 
with respect to long term construction contracts  revenue is recognized using the percentage of completion method 
the majority of our long term construction contracts are fixed price contracts  and measurement of progress toward completion is based on units of production for the fmtv contracts in the tactical vehicle systems segment  and typically based on direct labor hours for other percentage of completion contracts 
changes in estimates for revenues  costs to complete and profit margins are recognized in the period in which they are reasonably determinable 
any anticipated losses on uncompleted contracts are recognized whenever evidence indicates that the estimated total cost of a contract exceeds its estimated total revenue 
with respect to cost plus fixed fee contracts  we recognize the fee ratably as the actual costs are incurred  based upon the fee amounts expected to be realized upon completion of the contracts 
bid and proposal costs are expensed as incurred 
we frequently sell equipment together with start up services  which typically involve adding fuel to the engine  starting the equipment for the first time  and observing it to ensure that it is operating properly 
in cases where start up services are required on an equipment sale  the estimated start up costs are accrued when revenue from the equipment sale is recognized 
warranty costs based on historical experience and contract terms  we provide for the estimated cost of product and service warranties at the time of sale or  in some cases  when specific warranty problems are identified 
accrued warranty costs are adjusted periodically to reflect actual experience 
certain warranty and other related claims involve matters of dispute that ultimately are resolved by negotiation  arbitration or litigation 
occasionally  a material warranty issue can arise that is beyond our historical experience 
we provide for any such warranty issues as they become known and estimable 
should actual product failure rates or repair costs differ from our current estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
allowance for doubtful accounts we extend credit and credit enhancements to customers and other parties in the normal course of business and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability or unwillingness of customers to make required payments 
we base such estimates on our historical experience  existing economic conditions and any specific customer collection issues we have identified 
uncollectible accounts receivable are written off when a settlement is reached for an amount less than the outstanding balance or when we determine that the balance will not be collected 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we might not continue to experience the same credit loss rates we have in the past 
circumstances in some of the industries in which our customers operate may affect their operating performance and cash flows  which in turn might affect our ability to collect our accounts receivable 
as circumstances develop  the financial condition of specific customers changes or additional information becomes available  adjustments to the allowance for doubtful accounts may be required 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  with cost primarily determined on a last in  first out lifo basis  and market determined on the basis of estimated realizable values  less related customer deposits 
we purchase a considerable amount of our inventory for resale from independent manufacturers pursuant to distribution agreements 
cost represents invoice or production cost for new items and original cost less allowance for condition for used equipment inventory 
production cost includes material  labor and manufacturing overhead 
when circumstances dictate  we write inventory down to its estimated realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand  technological innovations  market conditions  plans for disposal and the physical condition of products 
if circumstances change  causing us to reduce our estimate of realizable value for specific inventory items or categories  additional provisions to cost of sales may be required 
asset impairment we assess the valuation of components of our property  plant and equipment and other long lived assets whenever events or circumstances dictate that the carrying value might not be recoverable 
we base our evaluation on indicators such as the nature of the assets  the future economic benefit of the assets  any historical or future profitability measurements and other external market conditions or factors that may be present 
if such factors indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable  we determine whether impairment has occurred by analyzing an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows exist 
if our estimate of undiscounted future cash flows during the estimated useful life of the asset is less than the carrying value of the asset  we recognize a loss for the difference between the carrying value of the asset and its estimated fair value  measured by the present value of estimated future cash flows or other means  as appropriate under the circumstances 
deferred income tax assets we record deferred tax assets and liabilities for differences between the book basis and tax basis of our net assets 
we record a valuation allowance  when appropriate  to adjust deferred tax asset balances to the amount we expect to realize 
we consider  as applicable  the amount of taxable income available in carryback years  future taxable income and potential tax planning strategies in assessing the potential need for a valuation allowance 
we will require future taxable income in order to fully realize our net deferred tax assets 
should we determine that we will not likely realize all or part of our net deferred income tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset balance would be charged to the income tax provision in the period such determination is made 
stock based compensation as permitted under sfas no 
 we use the intrinsic value method of accounting to account for our employee stock options and other stock based compensation programs 
accordingly  no compensation expense is recognized when the exercise price of an employee stock option is equal to or greater than the market price of our common stock on the grant date 
had we used the fair value method of accounting for stock based compensation prescribed by sfas no 
 net earnings would have been negatively impacted by million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
insurance we maintain a variety of insurance for our operations that we believe to be customary and reasonable 
although we believe we currently maintain insurance coverage that is adequate for the risks involved  there is always a risk that our insurance may not be sufficient to cover any particular loss or that our insurance may not cover all losses 
for example  it is possible that an adverse product liability claim could arise in excess of our coverage 
in addition  insurance rates and availability are subject to wide fluctuation  and changes in our coverage and the insurance industry could result in increases in our insurance cost and higher deductibles and retentions 
we are self insured up to certain levels in the form of deductibles and retentions for general liability  vehicle liability  group medical and workers compensation claims 
other than normal business and contractual risks that are not insurable  our risk is commonly insured against and the effect of a loss occurrence is not expected to be significant 
we accrue for estimated self insurance costs and uninsured exposures based on estimated development of claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported 
we regularly review estimates of reported and unreported claims and provide for losses accordingly 
although we believe that adequate reserves have been provided for expected liabilities arising from our self insured obligations  uninsured claims and exposures  our estimates of these liabilities may change as claims develop  and adjustments to reserves may be required 
pensions and other postretirement benefits we account for our defined benefit pension plan and our defined benefit postretirement medical plan in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions and sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions  respectively 
these standards require that amounts recognized in the financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis 
significant assumptions involved in determining our pension and other postretirement benefit expense include the expected return on plan assets  expected healthcare cost trend rates and expected compensation increases  and the discount rate for calculating future liability

factors that may affect future results certain of the statements contained in this document  including those made under the captions business  legal proceedings  and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  are forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of other than statements of historical fact included herein  all statements herein  including in particular  but not limited to  statements regarding potential future products and markets  our future financial position or results of operations  business strategy  other plans and objectives for future operations  relating to trends  expressing our belief  referring to expectations  relating to future margins  relating to expected cost of capital  referring to backlogs as to future product deliveries  relating to long term contracts in progress or using the words should  could  may  and words of similar import and prospective focus  are forward looking statements 
we can give no assurance that any forward looking statement of ours will prove to have been correct and such statements are not guarantees of future performance 
they involve certain risks  uncertainties  and assumptions that are difficult to predict  and actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecasted or implied in such forward looking statements 
we undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
specific important factors that could cause actual results  performance  or achievements to differ materially from our forward looking statements  and that otherwise may affect our operations  are identified below 
all written and oral forward looking statements attributable to us or to persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by such factors 
risks of dependence on government and failure to obtain new government contracts because the us government is one of our key customers  decreased government spending or termination of significant government programs could adversely affect our business 
our tactical vehicle systems segment depends largely on us government expenditures 
in recent years  government contracts in such segment have accounted for substantial percentages of our annual revenues and operating income 
we are currently in the final production year of our second multi year contract with the us army for production of the fmtv that provides for continued production of the fmtv through december including currently exercised option years 
in november  we expect to begin full rate production under a third multi year contract the us army that provides for continued production of the fmtv through september at an initial contract value of billion  excluding the exercise of any production options 
the funding of the fmtv contracts is subject to the inherent uncertainties of congressional appropriations 
as is typical of multi year defense contracts that may be canceled or adjusted by the government  the fmtv contracts must be funded annually by congressional action and may be terminated at any time for the convenience of the government 
if either fmtv contract is terminated  other than for our default in which event there could be serious adverse consequences and claims made against us  including repayment of amounts billed and received from the us army in excess of costs incurred and profits accrued classified as current liabilities on our balance sheet and other monetary exposures  the contracts include a provision under which we will be reimbursed for certain allowable costs  but not necessarily for all costs incurred 
as of april   funding in the amount of billion for the current fmtv contract had been authorized and appropriated by the us congress  million of which is allocated to future production 
in addition  the us congress has authorized and appropriated million for production under the third multi year contract 
we anticipate lower margins and production levels under the third multi year contract than under the current fmtv contract 
there can be no assurance as to whether future governmental spending will adequately support our business in this area  and substantial decreases in government spending  the loss of the us government as a customer or the cancellation of key significant government programs could materially and adversely affect our operations 
even if government spending in general continues at current levels  we are not assured that we can compete effectively as to the receipt of specific government orders and contract awards or as to the timing thereof 
the us army is the predominant customer of our tactical vehicle systems segment  accounting for practically all of the sales of this segment 
the loss of this customer would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
in our forward looking statements  we have assumed that we will continue to have satisfactory performance in our government contracting business 
inherent risks of government contracts government contracts present us with numerous special risks that are inherent in their nature and that could adversely affect our operations 
major contracts for military systems are often fixed price contracts that are performed over extended periods of time and are subject to changes in scope of work and delivery schedules 
pricing negotiations on changes and settlement of claims often extend over prolonged periods of time 
our ultimate profitability on such contracts may depend in actual circumstances on the eventual outcome of an equitable settlement of contractual issues with the us government as to scope changes and other factors 
moreover  estimates as to percentage of completion accounting on large government contracts can prove to have been incorrect 
variances between actual results and such estimates could be material 
furthermore  there are significant risks in projecting actual costs on multi year fixed price government contracts because of unforeseen factors  including price and wage inflation and supply shortages 
while we attempt to negotiate supply contracts with key suppliers that are synchronized with our long term fixed price obligations  we are not able to do that with a precision that eliminates risks that our actual costs of necessary items will not exceed the costs taken into account in the original contract pricing 
further  as to some suppliers and some items we do not have contracts that are synchronized at all with our long term fixed price obligations 
as to such items  which include raw materials such as steel as to which there have been recent substantial price increases  we are at continuous risk that we will have cost increases that were not taken into account in our contract pricing 
our government contracting operations are subject to us government investigations of business practices and cost classifications from which legal administrative proceedings can result 
based on government procurement regulations  under certain circumstances a contractor can be fined  as well as suspended or debarred from government contracting 
suspension or debarment could prevent us from selling equipment or services to customers that depend on loans or financial commitments from the export import bank  overseas private investment corporation and similar government agencies during a suspension or debarment 
in such events we might otherwise not be able to receive the benefits of federal assistance payments during a suspension or debarment 
we have been advised that the us customs service and the department of justice are investigating potential violations by us of laws relating to the export of controlled military vehicles  weapons mounting systems and firearms 
this investigation could result in the filing of criminal  civil or administrative sanctions against us and or individual employees and  in addition to the potential negative consequences described in the preceding sentences  could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
in our forward looking statements  we have assumed our reasonable management of risks inherent in our government contracting business  and that we will not experience a materially adverse outcome in any investigations 
risks of supply interruptions to tactical vehicle systems segment the fmtv incorporates engines  transmissions  axles and a number of other components that are specified by the us army and are available only from the source or sources selected by the us army 
identifying additional or replacement suppliers approved by the us army for any of the numerous components used in the fmtv may not be accomplished quickly or on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
in addition to suppliers specified by the us army  we use other suppliers for certain components of the fmtv  some of which are relatively small businesses that are not well capitalized 
interruption in the supply of any of these components  whether from a source specified by the us army or otherwise  for any reason  including insolvency of a supplier  work stoppages at suppliers and transportation interruptions  could involve significant additional costs and result in delays in production and product deliveries and could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations of the tactical vehicle segment 
in our forward looking statements  we have assumed that we will not experience significant supply interruptions in the tactical vehicle systems segment 
risks associated with distributed energy solutions segment we are in the process of exiting the turnkey epc activities of our distributed energy solutions segment 
we recently incurred substantial losses in the distributed energy solutions segment attributable to long term turnkey contracts  which we continue to manage as we complete the exit activities 
we continue to have substantial risk with respect to the performance on such contracts  including performance obligations with respect to equipment sold and installed in connection with such contracts 
further  we will retain and execute certain long term obligations with respect to the operation and maintenance of equipment installed under epc contracts as to which we expect to incur losses 
while we are not now able to estimate whether we will have additional losses associated with long term contracts or to estimate losses in the future from on going operation and or maintenance contracts  we do believe that there is a risk as to losses with respect to such matters that could in turn result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations in future periods 
we have assumed in our forward looking statements that we will be able to manage this circumstance in an overall satisfactory manner  having already taken significant charges with respect to these matters in fiscal risks of fixed price contracts many of our equipment sales contracts are fixed price contracts as to which the original price may be set at any early stage of the process 
the terms of these contracts require us to guarantee the price of products and services we provide and to assume the risk that the costs to provide such products and services will be greater than anticipated 
the profitability of these contracts is therefore dependent on the ability to reasonably predict the costs associated with performing the contracts 
these costs may be affected by a variety of factors  some of which are beyond our control 
for example  us manufacturers and distributors of steel products  which are used in many of our products  have recently experienced difficulties with the pricing and availability of steel 
the volatility of steel prices and recent increase in steel demand is expected to negatively affect our expected costs under certain of our fixed price contracts in the near future 
our failure to accurately estimate the resources required for a project  or our failure to complete our contractual obligations in a manner consistent with the project plan upon which our fixed price contract was based  could adversely affect our profitability and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in recent periods  as a result of incurring greater costs than were taken into account in original contract pricing  we have been required to commit unanticipated additional resources to complete existing epc projects in the distributed energy solutions segment  in turn resulting in losses on those contracts 
we may experience similar situations in the future in that segment or in other segments 
in our forward looking statements  we have assumed that fixed price contracts will have no further material adverse impact on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
risks as to cost controls as a manufacturing and service company operating within tight margins and with substantial facilities and inventories and a large workforce  our operations have been  and can be  adversely affected by our inability to control costs and to accurately estimate and plan our costs on an exacting basis 
as a manufacturing and service company it is particularly important for us to estimate and control our costs and expenses  and we continuously endeavor to implement cost identification  estimation and savings measures in our operations 
our forward looking statements assume that we will be able to contain our costs and expense increases at reasonable levels consistent with expected revenues 
risks of general economic conditions our commercial operations are cyclical and dependent for success on the general economic well being of the united states and certain international markets 
a general economic downturn could adversely affect demand for our products and services 
in and  there was a marked period of economic slowdown  and although economic activity increased in  general economic conditions remain uncertain  particularly in light of the war in iraq and related factors 
if the united states or world economies decline or fail to further recover  the demand for  and price of  our products and services could be adversely affected  thus adversely affecting our revenues  results of operations and cash flow 
further  other general market conditions such as increased inflation and higher interest rates could also adversely impact our revenues and results of operations 
in our forward looking statements  we have assumed that general market conditions will not worsen in fiscal and that we are not entering a down cycle in our markets or a period of significantly increasing inflation and interest rates 
risks of oil and gas industry economic conditions our engineered products segment  as well as certain aspects of our power products and distributed energy solutions segments  are closely tied to the oil and gas industry in general and  in particular  to capital expenditures by oil and gas companies and companies providing services and manufactured products to the oil and gas industry 
capital expenditures by oil and gas companies have tended in the past to follow trends in the price of oil and natural gas  which have fluctuated widely in recent years 
a sustained period of substantially reduced capital expenditures by oil and gas companies and oil and gas service and manufacturing companies  as we have experienced in some recent years  will likely lead to a drop in demand for products and services in our engineered products segment as well as in our distributed energy solutions and power products segments  which also provide products and services used in connection with the exploration for and production of oil and gas 
any such drop will have an adverse effect on our revenues  results of operations and cash flow during the affected period  as it did during fiscal  and to a lesser extent  fiscal the oil and gas industry has rebounded from low levels in recent years  however  we cannot assure you that the industry will continue to rebound or stabilize  that industry capital spending will be robust in future periods or that industry capital spending will increase proportionally with price increases for oil and gas 
we have assumed in our forward looking statements that economic conditions and capital spending in such industry will stabilize at least at present levels or improve 
risks of airline industry economic conditions our airline products segment is highly dependent upon the economic well being of the airline industry and was adversely affected in fiscal and to a lesser extent in fiscal by serious difficulties in that industry  including difficulties arising following the terrorist attacks on the united states in september capital and other general expenditures by airline companies are the principal source of demand for the products of our airline products segment 
should there be a sustained period of substantially reduced capital expenditures by airline companies and other companies that cater to the airline industry  the demand for our products in our airline products segment will drop and there will likely be an adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flow during the affected period  as there was during the last three fiscal years 
further  the increased threat or future occurrence of terrorist attacks in the united states and abroad or the outbreak of a viral epidemic or other similar event such as sars could slow recovery or trigger another severe downturn in this industry 
in our forward looking statements  we do not anticipate a major downturn in the airline industry from its current levels  but we continue to be cautious as to the recovery of economic conditions in the airline and related industries and do not anticipate quick and or complete recovery 
risks as to distributorships our power products  distributed energy solutions and engineered products segments are  in particular  dependent upon a number of distribution agreements with third party manufacturers 
all of our distribution agreements either have expiration dates or are terminable upon certain notifications 
even those with expiration dates are also terminable based on other factors  including changes in our control or in our principal management 
while our principal distribution agreements have been renewed on a regular basis in the past  there can be no assurance that any particular distribution agreement will be renewed in the future on favorable terms or at all  or that  on the whole  our principal distribution agreements will continue to be renewed 
the termination of  or a failure to renew on favorable terms or at all  key distribution agreements could have a material adverse impact on our operations 
we have assumed in our forward looking statements that our principal distribution agreements will not be terminated and or will be renewed as they come up for renewal 
in addition  and in particular  we have new distributorship arrangements with affiliates of daimlerchrysler that we do not yet have operational experiences under 
we are at risk under such contracts as to whether our operational results will be materially less satisfactory than in past arrangements with a daimlerchrysler affiliate 
we have assumed in our forward looking statements that our operational results will be mildly impacted by the new daimlerchrysler arrangements 
risks as to licenses our power products and engineered products segments are dependent upon and subject to certain texas state motor vehicle licensing requirements 
generally  such licenses are renewed annually 
we are currently in discussions with the motor vehicle division of the texas department of transportation as to issues that have been raised concerning licenses necessary for the sale  distribution  installation and warranty repair of certain large engines and transmissions 
although no enforcement action is currently pending against us in such situation  our licenses have not been renewed pending the resolution of the licensing issues that have been raised 
while these licenses have historically been renewed on a regular basis  there can be no assurance that any particular license will be renewed in the future 
the termination of  or failure to renew  key licenses could have a material adverse impact on our operations 
we have assumed in our forward looking statements that our principal licenses will not be terminated and or will be renewed as they come up for renewal and that we will resolve satisfactorily the texas licensing matters 
risk of competition our international and domestic competitors may use their resources and product and service offerings to increase competition  both in prices and products and services offered  and thereby reduce our market shares and or sales and profitability 
some of our existing and potential competitors have substantially greater marketing  financial  and technical resources than we have  and these resources may be used in effective competition with us 
we have assumed in our forward looking statements that we will continue to be a reasonably effective competitor in our markets 
risks relating to technology our business will suffer if we are unable to keep up with rapid technological change and product development 
our success will depend on our ability to anticipate changes in technology and industry requirements and to respond to technological developments on a timely basis  either internally or through strategic alliances 
we will likely be constantly threatened by current competitors or new market entrants who may develop new technologies or products or establish new standards that could render our products less marketable or obsolete 
thus  we can offer no assurances that we will be successful in developing and marketing  on a timely and cost effective basis  products or product enhancements that respond to our competition  to technological developments  to changing industry standards  and to marketplace acceptability 
we have assumed in our forward looking statements that we can reasonably keep pace with our competitors in technology changes and product development 
risks as to terrorist attacks on the us and their impact on the us economy since the terrorist attacks on the us in september  the threat of future terrorist incidents may continue to adversely affect our business and the us economy in ways that we cannot yet identify 
however  threats of future terrorist attacks may adversely affect the demand for our products and services generally in addition to their specific impact on our segments that serve the oil and gas and airline industries 
our forward looking statements at present assume no further material impacts of such circumstances on the us economy or further deterioration on our affected businesses 
risks relating to personnel labor shortages and our inability to recruit and retain key employees and workers could limit our operations and increase our labor costs and  in turn  adversely affect our results of operations 
our manufacturing and service operations are substantially dependent upon our ability to recruit and retain key managers and qualified machinists  mechanics  factory workers and other laborers 
a strong labor market can adversely impact us by limiting our manufacturing capacity or resulting in significantly increased wages and other benefits to attract additional key employees and workers 
we have assumed in our forward looking statements that we will continue to be able to recruit and retain necessary personnel at overall costs that are comparable with our ability to produce revenues 
risks of claims and litigation outcomes of pending litigation and governmental proceedings and future unexpected litigation and legal disputes could have a material adverse impact on our operations 
if we experience materially adverse outcomes or other unexpected results in our existing litigation and government proceedings  which in turn have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  the accuracy of our forward looking statements would be affected 
similarly  if we experience in the future new  unexpected litigation or adverse results from new  unexpected litigation  there could also be a material adverse effect on our results  again affecting the accuracy of our forward looking statements 
our forward looking statements assume that there will be no materially adverse unexpected outcomes or results that we have not already adequately provided for 
risks of product defects our customers often require demanding specifications for product performance and reliability 
because many of our products are complex and often use state of the art components  processes  and techniques  undetected errors and design flaws may occur 
product defects result in higher product service and warranty and replacement costs and may cause damage to our customer relationships and industry reputation  all of which may negatively impact our results of operations 
we have assumed in our forward looking statements that we will not in the future incur material difficulties with respect to product defects and warranty claims 
risks of no credit facility we allowed our revolving credit facility to expire on january  and  consequently  we have no significant borrowing capacity under existing credit facilities or other committed sources of capital 
to the extent capital resources are insufficient to meet future capital requirements  we will have to raise additional funds 
we intend to negotiate a new revolving credit facility during fiscal  but there can be no assurance that such a facility will be available on favorable terms  or at all 
our failure to negotiate a new facility on terms acceptable to us would limit our financial flexibility and could restrict our ability to make acquisitions and fund working capital  capital expenditures  dividend payments and other financial obligations 
we have assumed in our forward looking statements that the absence of a credit facility at the present time will not significantly impact our ability to manage our business 
risks as to foreign sales and global trade matters foreign sales are subject to special risks inherent in doing business outside of the us  including the risk of war  terrorist activities  civil disturbances  embargoes  and government activities  all of which may disrupt markets 
foreign sales are also generally subject to the risk of compliance with additional laws  including tariff regulations and import and export restrictions 
sales in certain foreign countries require prior us government approval in the form of an export license 
we cannot assure you that we will not experience difficulties in connection with future foreign sales 
moreover  changes in global trade policies in our markets could impact our operations in these markets 
recent events concerning the adoption by the us of certain tariffs on foreign imported steel and other products could cause other countries to retaliate and other disruptions in global trade policies 
we have assumed in our forward looking statements that there will be no material changes in global trade policies  such as embargoes  new and large tariffs or other tax assessments and the like or other new and material restrictions on trade that apply in particular to our businesses 
risks as to information technology in recent years  we have added  at substantial costs  new information processing systems designed to assist us in cost controls  reporting and other operations areas 
we anticipate the need to make additional expenditures to increase the efficiency and usefulness of such systems and have not yet enjoyed the full benefits of implementation of such systems 
accordingly  we are at risk as to further costs and implementation problems on our relatively new information technology systems that could adversely affect our results of operations 
we have assumed in our forward looking statements that we will control the costs of such systems in line with our expectations for such systems and that we will implement them satisfactorily 
risks as to acquisitions and restructuring activities our success is dependent upon the integration of newly acquired businesses with our existing businesses 
our success is also dependent upon executing our restructuring plans in such a manner that we extricate value from facility closures and product offering and business exits  and that we structure continuing business activities in an efficient and tactical manner 
this process involves some amount of realignment and reintegration of business activities and may result in changes to our segment reporting 
there can be no assurance as to the ultimate success of our integration and realignment efforts 
our forward looking statements assume the successful integration of acquired businesses and realigned business activities and their future contribution to our operations 
risks as to currency fluctuations a material change in currency exchange rates in our markets could affect our future results as well as affect the carrying values of certain of our assets 
world currencies have been subject to much volatility in recent years 
the us dollar has weakened somewhat against other key currencies the euro and  in recent periods  the japanese yen 
our forward looking statements assume no material impact from future changes in currency exchange rates 
risks as to environmental and safety matters our operations and products  and the use thereof  are regulated under a number of federal  state  local and foreign environmental laws and regulations  which govern  among other things  the discharge of hazardous materials into the air and water as well as the handling  storage and disposal of hazardous materials 
compliance with these environmental laws is a major consideration in the manufacturing of our products and in their servicing and distribution  as we use and generate hazardous substances and wastes in our manufacturing operations and as we may be subject to material financial liability for any investigation and clean up of such hazardous materials 
in addition  many of our current and former properties are or have been used for industrial purposes 
accordingly  we also may be subject to financial liabilities relating to the investigation and remediation of hazardous materials resulting from the action of previous owners or operators of industrial facilities on those sites 
liability in many instances may be imposed on us regardless of the legality of the original actions relating to hazardous or toxic substances or whether or not we knew of  or were responsible for  the presence of those substances 
we are also subject to various federal  state  local and foreign laws and regulations relating to safety and health conditions in our manufacturing facilities and with respect to our products and the use thereof and our service operations 
those laws and regulations may also subject us to material financial penalties or liabilities for any noncompliance  as well as potential business disruption if any of our facilities or a portion of any facility is required to be temporarily closed as a result of any violation of those laws and regulations 
any financial liability or business disruption from environmental or health and safety issues could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our forward looking statements assume no material adverse impact from environmental and safety issues 
credit risks we believe that our allowance for bad debts at january   is adequate in light of our collectibility and write off experience  existing economic conditions and specific customer collection issues we have identified 
we cannot  however  give assurance that additional amounts of uncollectible receivables and bad debt write offs will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations 
a number of our customers have suffered from lower revenues and experienced liquidity challenges resulting from economic difficulties in certain industries we have served in recent periods 
we have in the past incurred write offs in our accounts receivable due to customer credit problems 
we have also extended trade credit and credit enhancements to customers from time to time where some risks of nonpayment or late payment exist 
substantial unanticipated collection issues stemming from prolonged periods of economic downturn in one or more industries we serve could adversely affect our results of operations 
we have assumed in our forward looking statements that our current reserves and allowances will be sufficient to avoid future material impacts on our results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our market risk results from volatility in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
this risk is monitored and managed 
our exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to our debt portfolio 
during fiscal  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement in the aggregate notional amount of million converting a portion of our fixed rate debt to a floating rate of interest 
see liquidity and capital resources in item above 
the table below provides information about our market sensitive financial instruments and constitutes a forward looking statement 
principal amount by expected maturity in thousands  except interest rate data fiscal years ending january  thereafter total fair value at january  fixed rate long term debt average interest rate floating rate notes payable average interest rate a industrial revenue bonds average interest rate a interest rate swap notional amounts fixed to variable b average pay rate a average receive rate a represents weighted average rate at january  b fair value represents a liability asset on the consolidated balance sheet 
our earnings and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
generally  our contracts provide for payment in us dollars and we do not maintain significant foreign currency cash balances 
international subsidiaries in venezuela and colombia have in country working capital loans  which limit the exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
certain suppliers bill in foreign currencies  particularly the euro 
we occasionally enter into foreign exchange forward contracts with maturities of up to months to hedge these specific purchase commitments and anticipated transactions but not for speculative or trading purposes 
at january   we had approximately million of euro forward contracts outstanding at a net unrealized gain of million recorded on the consolidated balance sheet 
based on our average net foreign currency positions during fiscal  a adverse change in average annual foreign currency exchange rates would not have had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements
