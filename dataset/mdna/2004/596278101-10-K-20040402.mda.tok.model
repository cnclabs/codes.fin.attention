critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses as well as related disclosures 
on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates its estimates and judgments based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
property and equipment 
property and equipment are depreciated or amortized on a straight line basis over their useful lives based on management s estimates of the period over which the assets will be utilized to benefit the operations of the company 
the useful lives are estimated based on historical experience with similar assets  taking into account anticipated technological or other changes 
the company periodically reviews these lives relative to physical factors  economic factors and industry trends 
if there are changes in the planned use of property and equipment or if technological changes were to occur more rapidly than anticipated  the useful lives assigned to these assets may need to be shortened  resulting in the recognition of increased depreciation and amortization expense in future periods 
long lived assets 
long lived assets including goodwill and other intangibles are reviewed for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
in assessing the recoverability of the company s long lived assets  the company considers changes in economic conditions and makes assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors 
estimates of future cash flows are judgments based on the company s experience and knowledge of operations 
these estimates can be significantly impacted by many factors including changes in global and local business and economic conditions  operating costs  inflation  competition  and consumer and demographic trends 
if the company s estimates or the underlying assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to record impairment charges 
warranty 
in the normal course of business the company issues product warranties for specific product lines and provides for the estimated future warranty cost in the period in which the sale is recorded 
the estimate of warranty cost is based on contract terms and historical warranty loss experience that is periodically adjusted for recent actual experience 
because warranty estimates are forecasts that are based on the best available information  claims costs may differ from amounts provided 
adjustments to initial obligations for warranties are made as changes in the obligations become reasonably estimable 
lease obligations 
in and  the company established reserves associated with lease obligations for manufacturing facilities that were exited in conjunction with manufacturing consolidation efforts related to the acquisition of blodgett 
the terms of the leases associated with the two facilities in shelburne  vermont and quakertown  pennsylvania extend through december the company currently has a subtenant for the quakertown  pennsylvania facility for a portion of the lease term 
the company is actively searching for a subtenant for the other facility 
the recorded reserves are established for the future lease obligations net of an estimate for anticipated sublease income 
the forecast of sublease income could differ from actual amounts  which are subject to the occupancy by a subtenant and a negotiated sublease rental rate 
if the company s estimates or underlying assumptions change in the future  the company would be required to adjust the reserve amount accordingly 
litigation 
from time to time  the company is subject to proceedings  lawsuits and other claims related to products  suppliers  employees  customers and competitors 
the company maintains insurance to cover product liability  workers compensation  property and casualty  and general liability matters 
the company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of accrual required  if any  for these contingencies is made after assessment of each matter and the related insurance coverage 
the required accrual may change in the future due to new developments or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters 
the company does not believe that any such matter will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations 
income taxes 
the company operates in numerous foreign and domestic taxing jurisdictions where it is subject to various types of tax  including sales tax and income tax 
the company s tax filings are subject to audits and adjustments 
because of the nature of the company s operations  the nature of the audit items can be complex  and the objectives of the government auditors can result in a tax on the same transaction or income in more than one state or country 
as part of the company s calculation of the provision for taxes  the company establishes reserves for the amount that it expects to incur as a result of audits 
the reserves may change in the future due to new developments related to the various tax matters

certain risk factors that may affect future results future transactions 
the company periodically reviews potential transactions related to products or product rights and businesses complementary to its business 
such transactions could include mergers  acquisitions  or licensing agreements 
in the future  the company may choose to enter into such transactions at any time 
the impact of transactions on the market price of a company s stock is often uncertain  but may cause substantial fluctuations to the market price 
consequently  you should be aware that any announcement of any such transaction could have a material adverse effect upon the market price of middleby s common stock 
moreover  depending upon the nature of any transaction  the company may experience a charge to earnings  which could be material  and could possibly have an adverse impact upon the market price of middleby common stock 
financing related exposure 
the company has significant debt  which it incurred in conjunction with the blodgett acquisition 
a portion of this debt is subject to fluctuation in interest rates  which could have a negative impact on the company s interest costs 
additionally  terms of the senior bank agreement limit the paying of dividends  capital expenditures and leases  and require  among other things  a minimum amount  as defined  of stockholders equity  certain ratios of indebtedness and fixed charge coverage 
noncompliance by the company to satisfy any one of these requirements could result in a significant increase in the company s financing costs and have a material adverse impact to the company s financial results and condition 
the financing agreements also provide that if a material adverse change in the company s business operations or conditions occurs  the lender could declare an event of default 
under terms of the agreement a material adverse effect is defined as a a material adverse change in  or a material adverse effect upon  the operations  business properties  condition financial and otherwise or prospects of the company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole  b a material impairment of the ability of the company to perform under the loan agreements and to avoid any event of default  or c a material adverse effect upon the legality  validity  binding effect or enforceability against the company of any loan document 
quarterly variations in operating results 
results of the company s operations have fluctuated from quarter to quarter in the past  and may fluctuate significantly in the future 
such fluctuations may result from a variety of factors  including the timing of orders from major customers  the timing of new product introductions  the loss of any of its significant customers or distributors  currency fluctuations  disruption in the supply of components for the company s products  changes in product mix or capacity utilization  personnel changes  production delays  seasonality  general economic conditions and other factors affecting sales and results of operations 
international exposure 
the company has manufacturing operations located in asia and distribution operations in asia  europe  and latin america 
the company s operations are subject to the impact of economic downturns  political instability  and foreign trade restrictions  which may adversely affect the financial results 
the company anticipates that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of consolidated net sales in the foreseeable future 
some sales by the foreign operations are in local currency and an increase in the relative value of the us dollar against such currencies would lead to the reduction in consolidated sales and earnings 
additionally  foreign currency exposures are not fully hedged and there can be no assurances that the company s future results of operations will not be adversely affected by currency fluctuations 
dependence on key customers 
the company s growth is strongly influenced by the growth of its key customers  many of which are large restaurant chains 
the number of new store openings by these chains can vary from quarter to quarter depending on internal growth plans  construction  seasonality and other factors 
if these chains were to conclude that the market for their type of restaurant had become saturated  they could open fewer restaurants 
in addition  during an economic downturn  key customers could both open fewer restaurants and defer purchases of new equipment for existing restaurants 
either of these conditions could have a material adverse effect on the company s future results of operations 
competition 
the cooking and warming segment of the foodservice equipment industry is highly competitive and fragmented 
within a given product line  the industry remains fairly concentrated  with typically a small number of competitors accounting for the bulk of the industry wide sales 
industry competition includes companies that manufacture a broad line of commercial foodservice equipment products and those that specialize in a particular product line 
some of the company s competitors have greater financial and marketing resources than the company 
in addition  some competitors have different pricing structures and may be able to deliver their products at lower prices 
although the company believes that the performance and price characteristics of its products will provide competitive solutions for its customers needs  there can be no assurance that its customers will choose the company s products over products offered by competitors 
further  the market for the company s products is characterized by changing technology and evolving industry standards 
the company is aware of other companies that are developing  and in some cases have introduced  new equipment based on high speed heating methods and technologies 
accordingly  the company s ability to compete successfully will depend  in large part  on its ability to enhance and improve its existing products 
product liability matters 
the company is engaged in a business that could expose it to possible liability claims from others  including foodservice operators and their staff  as well as from consumers  for personal injury or property damage due to alleged design or manufacturing defects in the company s products 
the company maintains an umbrella liability insurance policy to cover claims up to million per occurrence and in aggregate 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company s insurance will be sufficient to cover potential claims or that an adequate level of coverage will be available in the future at reasonable cost 
a partially insured or a completely uninsured successful claim against the company could have a material adverse effect on the company 
risks relating to intellectual property 
the company holds numerous patents covering technology and applications related to various products  equipment and systems  and numerous trademarks and trade names registered with the us patent and trademark office and in various foreign countries  including the names blodgett  blodgett combi  blodgett range  ctx  magikitch n  middleby marshall  pitco frialator  southbend  steammaster  and toastmaster 
there can be no assurance as to the breadth or degree of protection that existing or future patents or trademarks may afford the company 
dependence on key personnel 
the company depends significantly on certain of its executive officers and certain other key personnel  many of whom could be difficult to replace 
the incapacity  inability or unwillingness of certain of these people to perform their services may have a material adverse effect on the company 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to attract  motivate and retain personnel with the skills and experience needed to successfully manage the company s business and operations
