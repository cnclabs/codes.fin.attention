item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a leading builder of high quality homes in central ohio primarily the columbus metropolitan statistical area and louisville  kentucky 
in late  we expanded our presence in kentucky by entering the lexington market 
our customer driven focus targets entry level and move up home buyers 
we offer a variety of homes that are differentiated by price  size  standard features and available options 
our homes range in price from approximately  to more than  and in size from approximately  to  square feet 
our net income for increased to a record million  or per diluted share  from million  or per diluted share  for the positive operating results are due in part to the continued development of our entry level or independence series  which we introduced in in  closings from our independence series homes increased to over of our total closings versus approximately in our market share in central ohio  based on new homes delivered  has increased to in from in and the majority of the increase was due to the expansion of the independence series 
also during  the percentage of closings generated by our louisville  kentucky division increased from approximately in to approximately in we continue to expand our investment in this market and expect to see continued growth 
the weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding during the twelve months ended december  increased to  from  shares during the twelve months ended december  due to the full year impact of our secondary public offering completed in june on february   we announced that our board of directors had authorized the repurchase of up to  of our common shares 
the repurchase plan ended on december  during the first quarter of  we purchased  common shares at an aggregate purchase price of million 
in  we intend to continue our three point growth strategy  which is to increase market share in central ohio  begin sales in lexington  kentucky and expand our overall market share in kentucky  and review new markets for potential expansion 
central ohio is our strongest market providing over of our closings 
we expect to add additional communities during in order to expand this market 
we opened our louisville  kentucky operations in and  while closing information is not yet available  we believe that we have become the largest single family homebuilder in this market 
in late  we expanded into the lexington  kentucky market 
we expect to begin selling homes in lexington during the second quarter of and to have our first closings in the fourth quarter of as with our other markets  our goal is to become the dominant homebuilder in lexington  kentucky 
in evaluating potential new markets  we look for a market that has many of the following characteristics a potential for economies of scale  a highly fragmented homebuilder market  a relatively stable and diverse economy  demographics similar to our current markets  and compatibility with our existing product offerings 
effective december   we expanded and extended our unsecured credit facility 
the facility was expanded from million to million and the maturity date was extended through may we intend to use this expanded credit facility to fund our growth 
the year will be a transition year for dominion homes 
during  the company sold out of several of its communities faster than anticipated due to strong demand for our products combined with an attractive interest rate environment 
during  we also experienced delays in the development of replacement communities due to municipalities becoming more restrictive 
as a result  the number of communities at december  in which we were actively selling homes was comparable to the number at december  through expansion into lexington  kentucky and the development of new communities in central ohio and louisville  kentucky  we expect to increase our number of new communities by up to by the end of barring a significant change in market conditions  we anticipate a marginal increase in earnings in and a significant increase in year end backlog  which we expect will put the company in a position for strong earnings growth in business risks we desire to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of the pslra 
this annual report on form k contains various forward looking statements within the meaning of the pslra and other applicable securities laws 
such statements can be identified by the use of the forward looking words anticipate  estimate  project  believe  intend  expect  hope or similar words 
these statements discuss future expectations  contain projections regarding future developments  operations or financial conditions  or state other forward looking information 
these forward looking statements involve various important risks  uncertainties and other factors which could cause our actual results for and beyond to differ materially from those expressed in the forward looking statements 
included among such important risks  uncertainties and other factors are the following we are particularly affected by changes in national and local economic  business and other conditions 
our financial position and results from operations are affected by changes and cycles in national and local economic  business and other conditions  most of which are beyond our control 
these conditions include short and long term interest rates  changes in governmental regulations  employment levels  availability and affordability of mortgage financing for home buyers  availability and cost of building lots  availability and cost of materials and labor  fluctuating lumber prices and shortages  adverse weather conditions and natural disasters  consumer confidence and housing demand  competitive overbuilding  changing demographics  cost overruns  changes in tax laws  changes in local government fees  and availability and cost of rental property and resale prices of existing homes 
in addition  domestic terrorist attacks and the threat or the involvement of the united states in international armed conflict may also adversely affect general economic conditions  consumer confidence and the homebuilding markets 
interest rate increases or changes in federal lending programs could adversely affect sales of our homes 
virtually all purchasers of our homes finance their purchase through third party lenders who offer conventional  fha and va mortgage financing 
a material increase in mortgage interest rates or unfavorable changes to these lending programs would adversely affect the ability of prospective home buyers  particularly our targeted entry level home buyers  to obtain mortgage financing 
we also depend upon the availability and cost of mortgage financing for buyers of the current homes owned by potential purchasers of our homes 
prior to purchasing our homes  some of our home buyers must sell their current homes  and these sales depend on the availability and cost of mortgage financing 
in addition  because the majority of our home buyers use fha mortgage financing  a material reduction in the scope or funding of fha mortgage programs could have a material adverse effect on our sales 
in particular  a substantial number of our home buyers use down payment assistance programs  which allow home buyers to receive gift funds from non profit corporations to be used as a down payment 
at one time  hud proposed rules which would have prohibited the use of gift fund programs in conjunction with fha insured mortgage loans 
hud subsequently withdrew these proposed rules  but has continued to increase its regulation of gift fund programs 
if hud were to prohibit or make materially unfavorable changes to the use of gift fund programs  we would expect to offer  as we have in the past  a different type of down payment program 
there can be no assurance  however  that any such replacement program would be as attractive to home buyers as the programs offered today and that our sales would not suffer 
our business is subject to substantial government regulation which could cause delays  increase costs  and restrict or prohibit homebuilding activity in certain regions 
we are subject to substantial local  state and federal requirements concerning zoning  resource protection  building design and construction  and similar matters 
these requirements include local regulations  which impose restrictive zoning and density requirements to limit the number of homes that can eventually be built within the boundaries of a particular location 
particularly in the case of local political subdivisions  anti growth sentiments can lead to ballot measures that can interfere with or impede our ability to develop land or build homes 
candidates for local office who favor restrictions on growth and development are being elected with greater frequency in certain communities in which the company conducts business 
restrictive measures can also affect construction activities  including construction materials  which must be used in home construction  as well as sales activities and other dealings with home buyers 
we also must obtain licenses  permits and approvals from various governmental agencies for our development activities  the granting of which are beyond our control 
obtaining acceptable zoning and overcoming objections of neighborhood groups and citizen activists is becoming more difficult  time consuming and expensive 
there can be no assurance that these issues will not adversely affect the company in the future 
we also are subject to a variety of local  state and federal requirements concerning the protection of health and the environment 
the particular environmental laws  which apply to any given project  vary greatly according to the project site and the present and former uses of the property 
these environmental laws may result in delays and cause us to incur substantial compliance costs  including substantial expenditures for pollution and water quality control 
these laws may prohibit or severely restrict development in certain environmentally sensitive regions 
in an effort to avoid major environmental issues in our developments  we have a general practice of requiring environmental reports from qualified  independent professionals and resolution of identified environmental issues prior to purchasing land 
however  there is no assurance that we will not incur material liabilities relating to the removal of toxic wastes or other environmental matters affecting land we have acquired 
building moratoria may result in periodic delays or may preclude us from developing certain projects 
these moratoria generally result from insufficient water supplies or sewer facilities  delays in utility hookups  inadequate road capacity  environmental concerns  school system overcrowding or financial difficulties  or anti growth sentiment within a specific market area or community 
time limited moratoria or restrictions on zoning changes  building permit issuance and extensions of utilities in certain areas have been adopted by several communities in which the company develops land and builds homes  and similar restrictive measures have been considered by other communities in which the company conducts business 
these moratoria can occur before or after we start our operations and without notice or recourse 
our success depends on the availability of undeveloped land that is suitable for our development 
we currently are the developer in approximately of the communities in which we are build homes 
therefore  our short and long term financial success depends and will continue to depend on our ability to acquire land  adjust our strategy for purchasing land  address changing market conditions and develop communities successfully 
we commit substantial financial and managerial resources to acquire land and develop the streets  utility services and other infrastructure before any revenue is generated from the community 
we may acquire and develop land upon which we cannot  or choose not to  build or sell homes 
the market value of undeveloped land and building lots fluctuates 
we also build some homes before we obtain non cancelable sale contracts for those homes 
we may have to hold these unsold inventory homes for an indefinite time prior to a sale 
in addition  because market prices fluctuate  we may have to sell inventory homes at a loss 
adverse weather conditions may prevent or delay the construction of homes and reduce the number of home sales 
poor weather conditions can hinder our construction and development activities  and thereby increase the cost of constructing our homes and delay the closing of our homes and our recognition of revenue from such closings 
in addition  in cases of prolonged severe weather  potential home buyers may delay or forgo the purchase of a home 
delays in construction of our homes could cause mortgage commitments to expire 
delays in the construction of a home could cause the mortgage commitment to expire and could require us  if mortgage interest rates have increased  to pay significant amounts to the mortgage lender to extend the original mortgage interest rates 
we are significantly leveraged and depend on the availability of financing 
we incur significant up front expenditures for land acquisition  development and construction costs 
we have traditionally financed these costs with bank borrowings  internally generated funds and joint venture arrangements 
although we have not in recent years experienced problems in obtaining financing  we cannot be sure that continued financing will be available to us in the future  or that any financing available to us will be on favorable terms 
our ability to make payments of principal or interest on  or to refinance our indebtedness  will depend on our future operating performance and successful execution of our business strategy 
we operate in a limited number of geographic areas 
our operations include central ohio and louisville  kentucky  and we have recently entered the lexington  kentucky market 
our lack of geographic diversity means that adverse general economic or weather conditions in one or more of these markets could have a material adverse impact on our operations 
our expansion strategies may adversely effect our operations 
we continually evaluate opportunities to expand into new markets  whether through acquisitions or start up operations 
any expansion strategy involves many risks 
new markets may prove to be less stable than our current markets and may result in delays  problems and expenses not typically encountered in our current markets 
regulations in various states may prohibit or impede us from using some of our community development strategies  such as those utilized with the independence series  that require condominium or other high density housing 
we may fail to identify suitable acquisition candidates or complete acquisitions on acceptable terms 
the magnitude  timing and nature of acquisitions will depend upon various factors  including the availability of suitable acquisition candidates  financial resources and skilled employees to manage the acquired companies  the negotiation of acceptable terms  and general economic and business conditions 
the likelihood of our success in establishing start up operations also depends on similar factors  including identification of suitable start up markets  availability of financial resources and skilled employees and subcontractors  and general economic and business conditions 
in addition  start up operations may require significant lead time before they generate sufficient revenues to be profitable 
expansion through acquisitions or start up operations will require substantial attention from our management team 
the diversion of management s attention  as well as any other difficulties that may be encountered in the transition and integration process  could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
our new product offerings may not be attractive to customers 
we continue to introduce new home designs and new community concepts as part of our product offerings 
there are significant risks that we may not accurately predict the tastes or preferences of potential home buyers 
a failure to predict these tastes or preferences could have a material adverse effect on our sales 
the loss of certain key personnel could adversely effect our operations 
we have several key executive officers  the loss or prolonged absence of whom could have an adverse effect on our operations 
in particular  the loss of the services or prolonged absence of douglas borror  our chairman and chief executive officer  or jon donnell  our president and chief operating officer  could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
our future success will depend on our continued ability to attract and retain highly skilled and qualified personnel  of which there can be no assurance 
our operating results vary on a quarterly basis 
our business is significantly affected by changes in economic cycles  and our revenues and earnings vary with the level of general economic activity in the markets where we build homes 
we historically have experienced  and expect to continue to experience  variability in revenues and reported earnings on a quarterly basis 
a significant percentage of our sales contracts are executed during the first and second quarters of the year 
closing on a home occurs approximately three to six months after the date of the sales contract but  with weather and other delays  may take longer 
we do not recognize any revenue on the sale of a home until the closing occurs 
as a result  we historically have experienced higher closings and revenues during the second half of the year 
we are subject to warranty claims arising in the ordinary course of business that could be costly 
as a homebuilder  we are subject to construction defect and home warranty claims arising in the ordinary course of business 
these claims are common in the homebuilding industry and can be costly 
we provide warranties on our homes for periods as long as thirty years 
in the event that we experience greater warranty claims than we anticipate  we could incur significant expenses which could affect future earnings 
litigation related to construction defects could adversely affect our business 
litigation related to construction defects has increased significantly in recent years 
the homebuilding industry has experienced both an increase in the number of individual claims for construction defects as well as increased costs of insuring against such claims 
our financial results are subject to inflation and other cost increases 
we are not always able to reflect all cost increases in the prices of our homes because competitive pressures and other factors sometimes require us to maintain or discount those prices 
while we attempt to maintain costs with subcontractors from the date a sales contract with a customer is accepted until the date construction is completed  we may incur unanticipated costs which cannot be passed on to the customer 
material or labor shortages can adversely affect our business 
during periods of increased construction activity  the homebuilding industry has faced shortages in the availability of skilled labor 
waiting for skilled labor to become available may result in construction delays 
the use of less skilled labor to satisfy a skilled labor shortage may cause quality standards to suffer 
increases in the demand for skilled labor also can result in increases in the cost of skilled labor 
the principal raw materials used in the homebuilding industry are lumber  brick and concrete as well as plumbing and electrical supplies 
while these materials are generally available from a variety of sources  they are subject to periodic price fluctuations 
in particular  the homebuilding industry has experienced occasional lumber shortages which produced significant price increases 
because we may not be able to pass on to our customers price increases in raw materials or labor  future price increases in these items could have a material adverse effect on our operating margins and earnings 
the homebuilding industry is highly competitive 
we compete in each of our geographic markets with national  regional and local homebuilders  some of which have greater financial  marketing  land acquisition and sales resources than we do 
we compete not only for home buyers  but also for desirable properties  financing  raw materials and skilled labor 
we also compete with the resale market for existing homes  which some home buyers may prefer over new homes 
additionally  there are many other national and regional homebuilders  many of which have greater financial  marketing  land acquisition and sales resources than we do  that do not currently have a significant presence in our current markets 
a concerted effort by these homebuilders to enter or expand their current operations in our markets could have a material adverse effect on our sales 
covenants in our bank credit facility restrict our ability to engage in certain activities 
our bank credit facility imposes restrictions on our operations and activities 
some of the more significant restrictions limit the amount we may borrow under the bank credit facility based upon borrowing base limitations  maintenance of interest coverage  net worth and leverage ratios  the amount of our uncommitted land holdings and unzoned land purchases  the amount that we may borrow outside of the bank credit facility and the amount of contingent obligations that we can assume  the amount we may invest in homebuilding operations in markets other than central ohio or kentucky  speculative and model home inventory  leases  and the payment of dividends 
application of critical accounting policies requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that may impact our future financial results 
in preparing our financial statements  management is required to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the annual and quarterly reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and disclosures about contingent assets and liabilities 
our actual results could be different from these estimates and assumptions 
some of our more critical accounting policies include reserves to reduce our real estate inventories to net realizable values  estimates for construction costs for homes closed  reserves for the estimated warranty cost of homes  estimates of the costs to complete land development  estimates of the annualized capitalization rate for indirect overhead and other expenses  estimates of self insured worker s compensation claims  and estimates of the annual effective tax rate in interim periods 
seasonality and variability in quarterly results we experience significant seasonality and quarter to quarter variability in our homebuilding activity 
typically  closings and related revenues increase in the second half of the year 
we believe this seasonality reflects the tendency of home buyers to shop for a new home in the spring with the goal of closing in the fall or winter 
weather conditions can also accelerate or delay the scheduling of closings

we recognize revenue and cost of real estate sold at the time of closing 
closings or deliveries occur when we deliver the deed to the home buyer and we receive payment for the home 
we include a home in backlog when a home buyer signs our standard sales contract  but the closing has not occurred as of the end of the period 
homes included in sales contracts in the foregoing table are net of cancellations 
most cancellations occur when home buyers cannot qualify for financing 
while most cancellations occur prior to the start of construction  some cancellations occur during the construction process 
the cancellation rates for homes in backlog as of december    and were   and  respectively 
we annually incur a substantial amount of indirect construction costs  which are essentially fixed in nature 
for purposes of quarterly financial reporting  we capitalize these costs to real estate inventories based on the ratio of estimated annual indirect costs to direct construction costs to be incurred 
thus  variations in construction activity cause fluctuations in interim and annual gross profits 
compared to revenues 
our revenues for increased by to million from the delivery of  homes compared to revenues for of million from the delivery of  homes 
this million increase in revenues was primarily due to the delivery of more homes 
as expected  the average price of homes delivered in decreased or  to  from  in the lower average price of delivered homes in was the result of closing a larger percentage of our entry level series of homes 
included in revenues are other revenues  consisting principally of fees from the company s mortgage financing services subsidiary 
during  these other revenues increased to million from million for we expect that the changes we are making in our mortgage financing services subsidiary will increase these other revenues in the future 
gross profit 
our gross profit for increased by to million from million for the primary reason for the increase in gross profit was the larger number of homes delivered during selling  general and administrative expenses 
our selling  general and administrative expenses for increased by to million from million for the primary reasons for the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses for were higher variable costs associated with delivering more homes 
these higher variable costs included variable incentive compensation  sales commissions  advertising expenses and administrative expenses related to the mortgage financing services subsidiary

compared to revenues 
our revenues for increased by to million from the delivery of  homes compared to revenues for of million from the delivery of  homes 
this million increase in revenues was primarily due to the delivery of more homes resulting from an overall improvement in build times in all series of homes 
included in the  homes delivered in were homes  with a sales value of million that we sold to unaffiliated third parties and leased back for use as model homes and sales offices 
we did not sell and leaseback any homes in as expected  the average price of homes delivered in decreased or  to  from  in the lower average price of delivered homes in was the result of closing a larger percentage of our new entry level series of homes

during  these other revenues increased by to million from million for gross profit 
our gross profit for increased by to million from million for the primary reasons for the increase in gross profit were the larger number of homes delivered during  the reduced cost associated with mortgage financing contributions due to falling interest rates and increased mortgage financing service fees 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
our selling  general and administrative expenses for increased by to million from million for the primary reasons for the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses for were the higher sales commissions associated with the sale of more homes  payment of higher compensation due to improved profits and general and administrative expenses of our mortgage financing services subsidiary

the weighted average rate of interest under the revolving line of credit was for compared to for provision for income taxes 
our income tax expense for increased to million from million for the company s estimated annual effective tax rate decreased to for  from for liquidity and capital resources historically  our capital needs have depended on sales volume  asset turnover  land acquisition and inventory levels 
our traditional sources of capital have been internally generated cash  bank borrowings and seller financing 
at times  we also have sold our common shares in the public market 
we have incurred indebtedness in the past and expect to incur indebtedness in the future to fund our operations and our investment in land 
we expect the cash flow from our sales in backlog and funds from our senior unsecured revolving credit facility to allow us to meet our short term cash obligations 
the primary reasons that we could require additional capital are an expansion in our existing markets  expansion into new markets  expansion of our mortgage subsidiary  or a purchase of a homebuilding company 
we believe that our current borrowing capacity and anticipated cash flows from operations are sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future 
sources and uses of cash for the three year period ended december  during  we generated million of cash flow from operations before expenditures on real estate inventories 
our real estate inventories increased by million because homes under construction increased by million and land and land development and other costs increased by million 
we invested significantly in land and land development in order to replace communities that had sold out earlier than anticipated  to expand our presence in louisville  kentucky and to enter the lexington  kentucky market 
we used cash from operations together with borrowings under our bank credit facility to finance the increase in real estate inventories 
during  we generated million of cash flow from operations before expenditures on real estate inventories 
we also raised approximately million in cash from the sale of  common shares  and we used this cash to reduce debt under our bank credit facility 
our real estate inventories increased by million because homes under construction increased by million and land and land development and other costs increased by million 
we used cash from operations together with borrowings under our bank credit facility to finance the increase in real estate inventories 
during  we generated million of cash flow from operations before expenditures on real estate inventories 
our real estate inventories increased by million because homes under construction grew by million and land and land development and other costs increased by million 
we used cash from operations together with borrowings under our bank credit facility to finance the increase in real estate inventories 
real estate inventories our real estate inventories at december  increased million to million compared to million at december  real estate inventories include land and land development costs  homes under construction and other building materials 
as of december   land and land development costs increased to million from million as of december   homes under construction increased to million from million on december  and other building material inventories increased to million from million as of december  our land and land development costs increased principally due to the increased number of sales communities 
we develop approximately of the communities in which we build homes and generally do not purchase land for resale 
we attempt to maintain a land inventory that is sufficient to meet our anticipated lot needs for the next three to six years 
at december   we owned lots or land that we estimate could be developed into  lots  including  lots in louisville  kentucky 
at december   we controlled  through option agreements or contingent contracts  land that we estimate could be developed into  additional lots  including  lots in louisville  kentucky 
we hold additional contingent agreements for land that may allow us to develop additional lots that are not included in these totals 
however  based on our land review process  we have concluded that it is unlikely that all of the contingencies contained in these other agreements will be satisfied in the near future 
consequently  we did not consider these contingent agreements when estimating the total amount of land or number of lots that we potentially may control 
the option agreements that we determined were more than likely to have the contingencies satisfied expire at various dates through during  we exercised options to purchase lots or unimproved land that could be developed into  lots  including  lots in louisville  kentucky 
we decide whether to exercise any particular option or otherwise acquire additional land based upon our assessment of a number of factors  including our existing land inventory at the time  the status of purchase contingencies and our evaluation of the future demand for our homes 
on december   we had single family inventory homes  including in louisville  kentucky  in various stages of construction  representing an aggregate investment of million  compared to single family inventory homes  including in louisville  kentucky  in various stages of construction  representing an aggregate investment of million on december  we do not include inventory homes in sales or backlog 
contractual obligations notes payable banks 
on december   we entered into a second amended and restated million senior unsecured revolving credit facility the facility 
the facility amends and restates the previous amended and restated credit agreement dated december  the facility was amended to increase the amount of the facility to million from million and to extend the maturity date to may  from may  several of the loan restrictions were also changed to reflect our growth and to allow us additional flexibility in our operations 
as of december   we were in compliance with the facility covenants and had million available under the facility  after adjustment for borrowing base limitations 
borrowing availability under the facility could increase  depending on our use of the proceeds of borrowings under the facility 
the facility provides for a variable rate of interest on our borrowings 
the variable rate is the three month libor rate plus a margin based on our interest coverage ratio that ranges from to and is determined quarterly 
the margin was during in order to reduce the risks caused by interest rate fluctuations  we have entered into interest rate swap contracts that fix the interest rate on a portion of our borrowings under the facility 
the weighted average interest rates for borrowings under the facility for the years ended december  and were and  respectively 
these rates include the cost of our interest rate swaps 
interest rates for decreased compared to due to a lower average borrowing rate 
additional information regarding the interest rate swap contracts we have entered into is set forth under the heading quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in item a below 
for a more detailed description of the facility  including restrictions on our business activities  see note note payable  banks to the consolidated financial statements included herein 
seller financing 
we purchased land for development that was partially financed with seller provided term debt that has an outstanding balance of million at december  capital and operating leases 
we believe the best use of our facility is to finance direct investments in our homebuilding operations 
assets that support our homebuilding operations are generally financed through capital and operating lease obligations 
these assets include office facilities  model homes  vehicles and equipment 
we analyze each lease and determine whether the lease is a capital lease  in which case the asset and related obligation is included on our balance sheet  or an operating lease  in which case the asset and obligation is not included on our balance sheet 
we do not retain a residual financial interest in leased assets 
our capital lease obligations were million at december  we believe our operating leases are properly classified as off balance sheet transactions 
our minimum rental commitment under such non cancelable operating leases was million at december  for further information on our leases  see note operating lease commitments and note related party transactions to the consolidated financial statements included herein 
during  we vacated commercial space that we leased and moved into our new office building 
the commercial space had a lease obligation of approximately  at december  we recognized an expense of  related to the remaining lease obligation  net of estimated sublease rental income 
we also recognized an impairment loss of approximately  related to the abandonment of leasehold improvements in connection with the termination of these leases 
land purchase commitments 
on december   we had non cancelable obligations to purchase residential lots and unimproved land at an aggregate cost of million 
we intend to purchase this land over the next year 
the following is a summary of our contractual obligations at december  in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years after years term obligations note payable  banks term debt capital lease obligations operating leases land purchase commitments total contractual cash obligations off balance sheet arrangements performance bonds and irrevocable letters of credit 
we are liable for performance bonds of million and irrevocable letters of credit of million at december  these instruments were issued to municipalities and other individuals to ensure performance and completion of certain land development activities and as collateral for contingent land purchase commitments 
we do not anticipate incurring any liability with respect to these instruments 
variable interest entities 
we selectively enter into joint ventures with other homebuilders to own and develop communities 
through the creation of joint venture partnerships and limited liability companies  these joint ventures engage in land development activities for the purpose of developed lot distribution to partners in the entity 
these partners in the joint ventures acquire substantially all of the lots developed by the joint ventures and fund the development costs in proportion to their equity interests 
we receive our percentage interest in the lots developed in the form of capital distributions 
our equity interest in these joint ventures varies from to 
these joint ventures generally do not hold debt securities  except for seller requested financing arrangements upon purchasing the land for the joint ventures 
in certain cases  we may be liable under debt commitments within the particular joint venture 
as of december   we were party to one joint venture that finances its own development activities 
we have guaranteed the obligations under the joint venture s loan agreement up to million  representing our one half interest 
at december   the joint venture had  in loans outstanding and the portion guaranteed by us was  we have determined that our land development joint ventures do not qualify as variable interest entities that would require consolidation in our financial statements 
see note land development joint ventures to the consolidated financial statements included herein 
in managing our land inventories  we enter into land option and contingent purchase contracts with third parties to acquire unimproved land and developed lots  which may qualify as variable interest entities 
these contracts may be with individual land owners or entities that hold land for sale and generally require us to pay refundable or non refundable deposits or letters of credit 
we have determined that certain of these contracts are with variable interest entities 
our analysis of these entities indicates that we are not the primary beneficiary  as defined in fin r  of the land option contracts or contingent purchase contracts  and  therefore  we do not intend to consolidate any of them in our financial statements 
we do not have legal title to the land subject to these contracts and our maximum exposure to loss is limited to option deposits of approximately million at december  we continually evaluate our land option and contingent purchase contracts to purchase unimproved land and developed lots 
cancelable obligations consist of options under which we have the right  but not the obligation  to purchase land and contingent purchase contracts under which our obligation to purchase land is subject to the satisfaction of zoning  utility  environmental  title or other contingencies 
on december   we had million of cancelable contractual obligations for which we had determined it is reasonably likely that we will execute the land or lot purchase 
our good faith deposits on these contracts were million at december  assuming that the contingencies are actually satisfied and that no other significant obstacles to development arise  we expect to purchase most of the residential lots and unimproved land that are subject to these cancelable contractual obligations 
we expect to fund our land acquisition and development obligations from internally generated cash and from the borrowing capacity under our facility 
we are in the process of evaluating an additional million of cancelable contractual obligations for which we have not yet determined whether it is reasonably likely that we will execute the land or lot purchase 
on december   good faith deposits on these contracts were million 
we own a interest in an unconsolidated title insurance agency that provides closing services for our homes 
our maximum exposure to loss in this entity is limited to the amount invested  which is approximately  at december  we have determined that this entity is a variable interest entity requiring consolidation effective in the first quarter of we do not expect the consolidation to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in  we entered into an agreement with an unaffiliated third party to sell and lease back certain model homes 
at december   we had eleven model homes subject to month to month leases under this agreement 
we have determined that these leases are not with a variable interest entity and rental obligations are properly classified as operating leases in our schedule of contractual obligations 
during  we built an office building that was sold to brc on october  and leased back for a term of fifteen years 
we have no residual financial interest in properties leased from brc 
we analyzed this transaction and other leasing arrangements with brc and determined that brc was not a variable interest entity requiring consolidation in our financial statements 
the following is a summary of our commercial commitments under off balance sheet arrangements at december  in thousands amount of commitment expiration per period total amounts committed less than year years years after years other commercial commitments letters of credit performance bonds guarantees cancelable land contracts total commercial commitments inflation and other cost increases we are not always able to reflect all of our cost increases in the prices of our homes because competitive pressures and other factors sometimes require us to maintain or discount those prices 
while we attempt to maintain costs with subcontractors from the date a sales contract with a customer is accepted until the date construction is completed  we may incur unanticipated costs which cannot be passed on to the customer 
for example  delays in construction of a home can cause the mortgage commitment to expire and can require us  if mortgage interest rates have increased  to pay significant amounts to the mortgage lender to extend the original mortgage interest rate 
in addition  during periods of high construction activities  we may incur additional costs to obtain subcontractors when certain trades are not readily available  which additional costs can result in lower gross profits 
periods of rapid price increases can result in lower gross profits 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in january  the financial accounting standards board the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of arb no 
fin clarifies the application of accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements  to certain entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
fin explains how to identify a variable interest entity and how an enterprise assesses its interests in a variable interest entity to decide whether to consolidate that entity 
fin requires existing unconsolidated variable interest entities to be consolidated by their primary beneficiaries if the entities do not effectively disperse risks among the parties involved 
fin applies immediately to variable interest entities created after january   and to variable interest entities in which an enterprise obtains an interest after that date 
in december  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
r fin r  which supercedes fin fin r must be adopted no later than the end of the first interim or annual reporting period ending after march   for variable interest entities in which an enterprise holds a variable interest that it acquired before february  we have evaluated our interests in land development joint ventures  land option contracts  sale and leaseback arrangements and alliance title agency  ltd 
alliance for possible variable interests acquired before february  alliance provides title insurance for most of our home closings in ohio and is an ohio limited liability company of which we own  the maximum allowable under ohio law 
based on our evaluation  we anticipate that we will consolidate alliance for the purposes of fin r effective in the first quarter of  but that we will not consolidate the land development joint ventures or entities with which we have land option contracts 
sale and leaseback arrangements are not with variable interest entities and therefore are appropriately accounted for as operating leases 
we have determined that we are not the primary beneficiary  as defined in fin r  of the land option contracts and therefore have not consolidated any of our option contracts entered into after january  consolidation of alliance is not expected to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations

 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas no 
establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas no 
generally requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability 
sfas no 
applies to three types of freestanding financial instruments  other than outstanding shares 
one type is mandatory redeemable shares  which the issuing company is obligated to buy back in exchange for cash or assets  a second type of financial instrument subject to sfas no 
includes put options and forward purchase contracts that require or may require the issuer to buy back some of its shares in exchange for cash or other assets  the third type of financial instrument subject to sfas no 
is obligations that can be settled with shares  the monetary value of which is fixed  ties solely or predominantly to a variable such as a market index  or varies inversely with the value of the issuers shares

critical accounting policies the foregoing management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  including the related notes  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates including those related to real estate inventories  warranty obligations  and construction costs for homes closed 
we base these estimates on historical trends and experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements reserves to reduce our real estate inventories to net realizable value are recorded using several factors  including management s plans for future operations  recent operating results and projected cash flows 
these projected cash flows reflect assumptions related to expected future demand and market conditions 
the adequacy of our reserves could be materially affected by changes in market conditions 
estimates for construction costs for homes closed are recorded in the period when the related home is closed 
these estimates are based on detailed budgets for each home and historical experience and trends 
if actual costs change  significant variances may be encountered 
reserves for the estimated cost of homes under warranty are recorded in the period in which the related home is closed and are based on historical experience and trends in actual warranty costs 
should actual warranty experience change  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
estimates for the costs to complete land development are recorded upon completion of the related land development project 
estimates for land and land development costs are allocated to development phases based on the total number of lots expected to be developed within each community and are based on detailed budgets for the land development project and historical experience and trends 
if actual costs or the total number of lots developed changes  significant variances may be encountered 
estimates for capitalized overhead and interest costs are recorded in real estate inventories for interim financial reporting purposes 
annualized capitalization rates for indirect overhead and interest are determined by estimating the total current year projected development costs  indirect construction costs  interest  closings and ending inventory 
if actual costs  closings or inventory levels change  significant variances to quarterly results may be encountered 
self insurance accruals are made for certain claims associated with workers compensation and medical benefits 
these accruals include estimates that may be based on assumptions about historical loss development factors and actual benefit costs 
differences in estimates and assumptions could result in an accrual requirement materially different from the calculated amounts 
we record income tax liabilities utilizing known obligations and estimates of potential obligations 
a deferred tax asset or liability is recognized whenever there are future tax effects from existing temporary differences and tax credit carryforwards 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the balance that is more likely than not to be realized 
we use an estimate of the annual effective tax rate at each interim period based on the facts and circumstances available at that time  while the actual effective tax rate is calculated at year end 
if circumstances change  our estimated annual effective tax rate could change  creating variances in quarterly results 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of december   we were a party to nine interest rate swap contracts with an aggregate notional amount of million  as reflected in the table below 
we enter into swap contracts to minimize earnings fluctuations caused by interest rate volatility associated with our variable rate debt 
the swap contracts allow us to have variable rate borrowings and to select the level of fixed rate debt for the company as a whole 
under the swap contracts  we agree with other parties to exchange  at specified intervals  the difference between fixed rate and floating rate amounts calculated by reference to an agreed notional amount 
our intention is to maintain approximately of our debt on a fixed interest rate basis 
at any time  this percentage may be more or less depending on specific circumstances 
at december   our level of fixed rate debt under the facility  after considering the effect of the interest rate swaps  was 
in early  million of interest rate swaps matured and our outstanding borrowings increased  primarily due to the purchases of land for development 
the combination of these two events caused our level of fixed rate debt to return to the range 
we do not enter into derivative financial instrument transactions for speculative purposes

 the following table presents descriptions of the financial instruments and derivative instruments that we held at december  for the liabilities  the table presents principal calendar year cash flows that exist by maturity date and the related average interest rate 
for the interest rate derivatives  the table presents the notional amounts and expected interest rates that exist by contractual dates 
interest on our variable rate liabilities is libor plus a variable margin ranging from to 
cash flows for interest on million of the variable rate liabilities subject to interest rate derivatives is the contractual average pay rate plus the variable margin at december  
the notional amount is used to calculate the contractual payments to be exchanged under the contract 
the fair value of the variable rate liabilities at december  and was million and million  respectively 
the fair value of the derivatives at december  was a liability of million and at december  a liability of million 
we do not expect a loss to be realized because we expect to retain the swap contracts to maturity
