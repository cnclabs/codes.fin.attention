critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of the company s financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
the company believes its estimates and assumptions are reasonable  however  actual results and the timing of the recognition of such amounts could differ from those estimates 
the company has identified the following critical accounting policies and estimates utilized by management in the preparation of the company s financial statements revenue recognition  accounting for long lived assets  allowance for doubtful accounts  accounting for employee benefits and income taxes 
any deviation from these policies or estimates could have a material impact on the financial statements of the company 
revenue recognition the company recognizes customer services revenue as services are performed for our clients in accordance with staff accounting bulletin sab no 
revenue recognition 
client contracts generally require that clients be billed for the company s services on the basis of time spent by company representatives providing services 
the company s services are also occasionally priced on a pay for performance basis  pursuant to which the company typically receives fees that are a combination of base rate plus fee per sale 
the company is often subject to performance standards  such as sales per hour  average handle time  occupancy rate and abandonment rate 
the company s performance against such standards may provide bonus opportunities or conversely may subject the company to penalties  which are recognized as earned or incurred 
accounting for long lived assets the company s long lived assets consist primarily of property and equipment  capitalized software and intangible assets 
in addition to the original cost of these assets  their recorded value is impacted by a number of policy elections made by the company  including estimated useful lives and salvage values 
in addition  any decision by the company to reduce capacity by closing customer interaction centers or to abandon software may result in a write off of the net book value of the affected assets 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  the company records impairment charges on long lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying amount of those assets 
in this circumstance  the impairment charge is determined based upon the amount the net book value of the assets exceeds their fair market value 
in making these determinations  the company utilizes certain assumptions  including  but not limited to  the estimated fair market value of the assets  which are based on additional assumptions such as asset utilization  length of time the asset will be used in the company s operations and estimated salvage values 
the company adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other tangible assets  in fiscal and  therefore  ceased amortizing goodwill in accordance with this standard 
as part of this adoption  the previously recorded intangible asset for assembled workforce of million was reclassified to goodwill 
goodwill amortization in fiscal  as defined under this standard  was approximately million 
had this standard been implemented in fiscal  net income loss and earnings loss per share for the years ended december   december   and december   would have been impacted as follows net income loss as reported    plus amortization expenses  pro forma net income loss    earnings loss per diluted share as reported plus amortization expense pro forma earnings loss per diluted share the annual amortization expense related to intangible assets recorded in was million 
annual amortization expense is expected to be million for fiscal years through and million in fiscal allowance for doubtful accounts the company records an allowance for doubtful accounts based on a quarterly assessment of the probable estimated losses in trade accounts receivable 
this estimate is based on specific allowances for identified problem receivables and an additional allowance for estimated losses on all other receivables based on their age and the company s collection history 
accounting for employee benefits the company records an accrued liability for group health and workers compensation claims based on an estimate of claims incurred  but not reported  as well as asserted claims at the end of the period 
this estimate is derived from an analysis performed by actuaries hired by the company who have expertise in this area 
although these estimates are generally reliable  changes in the employee mix and unforeseen events could result in an adjustment to these estimates 
the balances of these accounts at december   and december   were group health insurance   workers compensation   income taxes the company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability approach 
under the asset and liability method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
valuation allowances are recorded when management believes it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized in the future 
the company records a reserve for tax contingencies until management believes it is probable that the deductions giving rise to these contingencies will not be successfully challenged 
liquidity and capital resources the following table sets forth consolidated statements of cash flow data for the company for years ended december   december   and december   respectively 
net cash provided by operating activities net cash used by investing activities net cash used by financing activities net decrease in cash cash from operating activities decreased million in fiscal versus fiscal  primarily due to a million reduction in accounts receivable that occurred in fiscal versus a million reduction in fiscal the decrease in accounts receivable in fiscal was primarily due to lower volumes 
cash generated from operations was also lower in fiscal due to lower operating margins and a reduction in depreciation and amortization 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company received an million tax refund that partially offset these reductions 
in early october  the company received an million cash tax refund as a result of carrying back against prior years taxable income a million loss reported on its tax return  which is subject to audit 
this loss resulted from the company taking a million deduction to write off  for tax purposes  its remaining investment in iti holdings  inc for book purposes the company recorded appropriate impairment charges related to iti in previous fiscal years 
the total combined liquidity benefit to the company from this deduction is expected to be million  which includes the million cash tax refund  million of cash tax savings related to the tax year and the release of million of tax credits generated and utilized in prior years to be used in current and future periods 
the potential income statement benefit of this deduction will not be recognized and the associated income tax liability eliminated until the company believes it is probable the deduction will not be successfully challenged

the credit agreement is secured principally by a grant of a security interest in all personal property and fixtures of the company 
under the terms of the credit agreement  the company is also required to maintain certain financial covenants which limit the company s ability to incur additional indebtedness  repurchase outstanding common shares  create liens  acquire  sell or dispose of certain assets  engage in certain mergers and acquisitions and to make certain restricted payments 
borrowings under the credit agreement incur a floating interest rate usually based on the libor index rate  although the company has the option of using an alternate base rate defined in the agreement

inflation the company does not believe that inflation has had a significant impact on its consolidated operations 
quarterly results the company s operating results in any single period should not be viewed as indicative of future operating results  as the services offered by the company are subject to variations in profitability 
the company could experience variations in net revenue and income as a result of many factors  including the timing of clients marketing campaigns and customer service programs  the timing of additional selling  general and administrative expenses to acquire and support such new business and changes in the company s revenue mix among its various clients and service offerings 
in connection with certain contracts  the company could incur costs in periods prior to recognizing revenue under those contracts 
in addition  the company must plan its operating expenditures based on revenue forecasts  and a revenue shortfall below such forecast in any quarter would likely adversely affect the company s operating results for that quarter 
the company does not believe that its business is significantly affected by seasonality

this report on form k and other documents that the company files with the sec contain forward looking statements that reflect the company s current views with respect to future events and financial performance 
these forward looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties  which could cause future results to differ materially from historical results or those anticipated 
the words believe  expect  anticipate  intend  estimate  goals  would  could  should  and other expressions which indicate future events and trends identify forward looking statements 
readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements  which speak only as of their dates 
if no date is provided  such statements speak only as of the date of this report on form k 
except as required under the federal securities laws and rules and regulations of the sec  the company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements in connection with new information or future events or otherwise 
factors that could cause future results to differ materially from historical results or those anticipated include  but are not limited to  reliance by the company on a small number of principal clients for a substantial proportion of its total revenue  possible changes in or events affecting the business of the company s clients  including changes in customers interest in  and use of  clients products and services  fluctuations in quarterly results of operations due to timing of clients initiation and termination of large programs  risks in conducting business internationally  changes in competitive conditions affecting the company s industry  the ability of the company s clients to terminate contracts with the company on a relatively short notice  changes in the availability and cost of qualified employees  variations in the performance of the company s automated system and other technological factors  changes in government regulations affecting the teleservices and telecommunications industries  and competition from other outside providers of customer interaction solutions and in house customer interaction operations 
in addition to the risks and uncertainties of ordinary business operations  the forward looking statements of the company contained in this report on form k are also subject to the following risks and uncertainties client concentration  contract terms  client industries as noted in item  business clients  of the company s revenues are accounted for by ten clients 
two clients each constituted more than of the company s net revenues  one of these clients is expected to account for less than of the company s revenues in fiscal there can be no assurance that the company will be able to retain any of its larger clients or that the volumes of its most profitable or larger programs will not be reduced  or that the company would be able to replace such clients or programs with clients or programs that generate a comparable amount of revenue or profits 
consequently  the loss of one or more of its significant clients could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
as noted in item  business client contracts  the company provides services to its clients pursuant to contracts  many of which may be terminated for convenience and most of which do not have minimum volume requirements 
there can be no assurance that the company s clients will not terminate their contracts before their scheduled expiration date or that the volumes of their programs will not be reduced 
in any of these events  there can be no assurance that the company would be able to replace a client or program with any other client or program that would generate a comparable amount of revenue or profits 
consequently  the loss of one or more of its significant clients  or the substantial reduction of the amount of services performed by the company for a significant client  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
as noted in item  business client contracts  the company has historically been paid on a contracted price per hour by the majority of its clients 
the trend away from per hour pricing to other types of contracted pricing  such as per phone minute  per call or per transaction  shifts greater execution responsibility to the company and could lead to lower revenues or profitability 
many of the company s clients are concentrated in the communications  financial services  insurance  health care  logistics and travel and hospitality industries 
a significant downturn in any of these industries or a trend in any of these industries not to use  or to reduce their use of  telephone based sales  marketing or customer management solutions could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
pressure on gross profit margin the convergence of several factors are causing clients and prospects to place pressure on the company s pricing levels the market is moving from hourly pricing to other pricing models  including per call  per transaction  per minute and per sale  offshore capacity  which is rapidly increasing  offers lower pricing than domestic capacity  largely due to the cost of labor differential  there are many competitors  many of whom have unutilized capacity  and clients and potential clients are increasingly utilizing the services of call center procurement consultants in the bidding process  who are very focused on price and terms and in leveraging existing capacity across the marketplace 
in addition certain factors  including increased benefits costs  increased state unemployment tax rates  increases in minimum wage laws  and the need to reward performing employees with wage increases in an increasingly competitive economy  all provide challenges to the company s ability to reduce its labor costs in its domestic operations 
see dependence on labor force below 
such factors when combined may cause the company to increasingly encounter the choice between retaining and winning business or agreeing to price and terms that result in lower profit margins 
government regulation congress  the fcc  ftc and most states have enacted laws and promulgated regulations that govern telephone solicitations and sales 
the company believes that its operating procedures currently comply in all material respects with such laws and regulations 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company will not be subject to agency or state proceedings alleging violation of such rules 
future laws and regulations may require the company to modify its operations or service offerings in order to effectively meet its clients service requirements  and there can be no assurance that additional regulations would not limit the activities of the company or significantly increase the cost of regulatory compliance 
for further discussion of regulatory issues  see item business government regulation 
the restrictions imposed by applicable state and federal telemarketing regulations will generally adversely impact the telemarketing industry 
the registry  states do not call lists and the fcc s company specific do not call lists together with other regulations that decrease efficiency and effectiveness of the company s services have a cumulative effect of reducing the effectiveness of the telephone sales channel 
this may cause clients to reduce the amount of customer services provided by the company 
the company  however  cannot predict the impact state and federal regulations may have on its business or whether such impact may adversely affect or limit its operations 
several of the industries in which the company s clients operate are subject to varying degrees of government regulation  particularly in the telecommunications  insurance and financial services industries 
the company could be subject to a variety of enforcement or private actions for its failure or the failure of its clients to comply with such regulations 
there is increasing federal and state interest in privacy protection  some aspects of which could impose additional regulatory pressure on the business of the company s clients and  less directly  on the company s business 
the results of the company s operations could be impacted by such pressure if it has the effect of reducing the demand for our services or exposes us to potential liability 
federal and state interest in regulating the movement of service jobs offshore could increase the company s costs of operations 
sales of certain client products and services may also be subject to federal and state regulation  thus requiring the company to comply with the regulations 
for example  the company s telephone representatives who sell insurance products are required to be licensed by various state insurance commissions 
the company also employs licensed pharmacists and maintains licenses required for the gaming industry 
changes in the licensing regulations or their implementation could materially increase the company s operating costs 
competitors  international capacity  potential future competing technologies and trends as noted in item  business competition  the industry in which the company competes is extremely competitive and highly fragmented 
a number of the company s competitors have capabilities and resources equal to  or greater than  the company s  and there can be no assurance that additional competitors with greater resources than the company will not enter the industry or particular segments of the industry 
these include small firms  large publicly traded firms operating in the business process outsourcing field  and clients or potential clients that expand their existing capabilities and market services to other companies 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully 
a number of the company s competitors have opened  or have announced the opening of  customer interaction centers in canada  the caribbean  india  the philippines or other offshore locations in order to provide services to north american clients at reduced cost 
it is uncertain whether these offshore capabilities will be as effective on a large scale basis as the same competitors united states facilities or what the demand for those offshore services may be 
in addition  there is increasing political concern regarding the movement of service jobs off shore which could result in legislation 
nonetheless  the potential movement of business offshore at reduced prices may result in pressure on the company s gross profit margin or a loss of business to such competitors 
the development of new forms of direct sales and marketing techniques  such as interactive home shopping through television  computer networks and other media  could have an adverse effect on the demand for the company s customer acquisition services 
in addition  the increased use of new telephone based technologies  such as interactive voice response systems and increased use of the internet  could reduce the demand for certain of the company s customer care offerings 
moreover  the effectiveness of marketing by telephone could also decrease as additional technologies and service devices to screen calls from marketers are developed and become available to consumers 
although the company attempts to monitor industry trends and respond accordingly  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to anticipate and successfully respond to all such trends in a timely manner 
reliance on technology the company has invested in sophisticated and specialized telecommunications and computer technology  and has focused on the application of this technology to provide customized solutions to meet its client s needs 
the company anticipates that it will be necessary to continue to select  invest in and develop new and enhanced technology on a timely basis in the future in order to maintain its competitiveness 
the company s future success will depend in part on its ability to continue to develop information technology solutions which keep pace with evolving industry standards and changing client demands 
in addition  the company s business is highly dependent on its computer and telephone equipment and software systems  and the temporary or permanent loss of such equipment or systems  through casualty or operating malfunction  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
dependence on key personnel the success of the company depends in large part upon the abilities and continued service of its executive officers and other key employees 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to retain the services of such officers and employees 
the loss of key personnel could have a materially adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the company has entered into employment agreements with some of its executive officers and other key employees  however  these agreements do not ensure their continued employment 
the company also has non competition agreements with each of its existing key personnel 
however  courts are at times reluctant to enforce such agreements 
additionally  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to attract and retain additional qualified management personnel as needed  which could adversely affect the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
dependence on labor force the company s industry is very labor intensive and has experienced high personnel turnover 
many of the company s employees receive modest hourly wages and  although the company employs a significant number of full time employees  many are nevertheless employed on a part time basis 
a higher turnover rate among the company s employees would increase the company s recruiting and training costs and decrease operating efficiencies and productivity 
some of the company s operations  particularly insurance product sales and technology based inbound customer service  require specially trained employees 
growth in the company s business will require it to recruit and train qualified personnel at an accelerated rate from time to time 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to hire  train and retain a sufficient labor force of qualified employees 
a significant portion of the company s costs consists of wages to hourly workers 
an increase in hourly wages  costs of employee benefits  employment taxes or recruiting and training costs could have a materially adverse effect on the company s business results of operations and financial condition 
dependence on telephone service the company s business is materially dependent on telephone and data service provided by various local and long distance telephone companies telcos 
because of this dependence  any change to the telecommunications market that would disrupt these services or limit the ability of the company to obtain services or favorable rates could adversely affect the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the company has taken steps to mitigate its exposure to the risks associated with rate fluctuations and service disruption by entering into long term contracts with multiple telcos 
there is no obligation  however  for any of the company s telco vendors to renew their contracts with the company or to offer the same or lower rates in the future  and such contracts are subject to termination or modification for various reasons outside of the company s control  including bankruptcy or insolvency of the telecommunications service provider or rate increases imposed by governmental authorities 
a significant increase in the cost of telephone services that is not recoverable through an increase in the price of the company s services  or any significant interruption in telephone services  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
potential fluctuations in quarterly operating results the company could experience quarterly variations in revenue and operating income as a result of many factors  including the timing of clients marketing campaigns and customer service programs  the timing of additional selling  general and administrative expenses to acquire and support such new business and changes in the company s revenue mix among its various service offerings 
in connection with certain contracts  the company could incur costs in periods prior to recognizing revenue under those contracts 
in addition  the company must plan its operating expenditures based on revenue forecasts  and a revenue shortfall below such forecast in any quarter would likely adversely affect the company s operating results for that quarter 
the company does not believe that its business is significantly affected by seasonality 
risks inherent in conducting business internationally the company intends to continue to expand and pursue opportunities for its offshore customer interaction center in the philippines 
there are certain risks inherent in conducting business internationally  including exposure to currency fluctuations  the necessity to comply with foreign laws  unexpected changes in foreign laws and regulations  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  foreign political instability  changes in clients sourcing preferences and potentially adverse tax consequences 
there can be no assurance that one or more such factors will not have a material adverse effect on the company s international operations and  consequently  on its business  results of operations and financial condition 
business interruptions the company s success is dependent on the operation of its customer interaction centers 
in the event of fire  power loss  telecommunications interruption or failure  weather related or other natural disasters and other similar events  the operation of one or more centers could be temporarily or permanently interrupted 
in the event the company experiences a temporary or permanent interruption at one or more of its customer interaction centers through casualty  operating malfunction or otherwise  the company s business could be materially adversely affected and the company may be required to allow some clients to terminate or renegotiate their contracts with the company 
the company maintains property and business interruption insurance  however  such insurance may not adequately compensate for any losses the company may incur 
war and terrorist attacks could disrupt operations the risks of war and potential terrorist attacks on the company s operations cannot be estimated 
war and terrorist attacks could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
volatility of stock price the market price of the company s common shares has fluctuated over a wide range during the past several years and may continue to do so in the future 
for further discussion  see item  market for registrant s common equity and related share owner matters 
the market price of the common shares could be subject to significant fluctuations in response to various factors or events  including among other things  the depth and liquidity of the trading market of the common shares  quarterly variations in actual liquidity of the trading market of the common shares  quarterly variations in actual and anticipated operating results  growth rates  changes in estimates by analysts  loss of analyst coverage  market conditions in the industry in which the company competes  announcements by competitors  the loss of a significant client or a significant change in the company s relationship with a significant client  regulatory actions  litigation  including class action litigation  and general economic conditions 
control by principal share owner mr 
schwartz  the company s chairman  beneficially owns approximately of the outstanding common shares 
in addition  two trusts  established by mr 
schwartz  each beneficially own approximately of the outstanding common shares 
as a result  mr 
schwartz is able to exercise significant control over the outcome of substantially all matters requiring action by the company s shareholders 
such voting concentration may have the effect of discouraging  delaying or preventing a change in control of the company 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk historically  the company has been exposed to the impact of us interest rate changes directly related to its normal operating and funding activities 
from time to time  the company has entered into derivatives in order to minimize these risks  but not for trading purposes 
the company does not have any derivative agreements due to the low levels of current borrowings 
the company prepared a sensitivity analysis of its average debt for fiscal assuming a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates 
holding all other variables constant  the hypothetical adverse change would not significantly increase interest expense 
the sensitivity analysis assumes no changes in the company s financial structure
