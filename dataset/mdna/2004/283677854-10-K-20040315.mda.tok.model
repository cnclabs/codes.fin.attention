the palo verde participants have contracts in place that will furnish of palo verde s operational requirements for uranium concentrates  conversion services and enrichment services through such contracts could also provide of enrichment services in and the palo verde participants have a contract for fabrication services through for each palo verde unit 
nuclear fuel financing 
pursuant to the anpp participation agreement  the company owns an undivided interest in nuclear fuel purchased in connection with palo verde 
the company has available a total of million under a revolving credit facility that provides for both working capital and up to million for the financing of nuclear fuel

index to financial statements natural gas the company manages its natural gas requirements through a combination of a long term supply contract and spot market purchases 
the long term supply contract provides for firm deliveries of gas at market based index prices 
in  the company s natural gas requirements at the rio grande power station were met with both short term and long term natural gas purchases from various suppliers 
interstate gas is delivered under a firm transportation agreement which expires in but which is expected to continue beyond the company anticipates it will continue to purchase natural gas at spot market prices on a monthly basis for a portion of the fuel needs for the rio grande power station for the near term 
the company will continue to evaluate the availability of short term natural gas supplies versus long term supplies to maintain a reliable and economical supply for the rio grande power station 
natural gas for the newman and copper power stations was primarily supplied pursuant to an intrastate natural gas contract that expires in the company will also continue to evaluate short term natural gas supplies to maintain a reliable and economical supply for the newman and copper power stations 
coal aps  as operating agent for four corners  purchases four corners coal requirements from a supplier with a long term lease of coal reserves owned by the navajo nation 
aps  on behalf of the company and the other four corners participants  has extended the four corners coal contract with the supplier to to coincide with the four corners plant lease with the navajo nation 
based upon information from aps  the company believes that four corners has sufficient reserves of coal to meet the plant s operational requirements for its useful life 
purchased power to supplement its own generation and operating reserves  the company engages in firm and non firm power purchase arrangements which may vary in duration and amount based on evaluation of the company s resource needs and the economics of the transactions 
the company purchased mw of firm energy in and will continue to purchase an identical annual amount through based on a purchase agreement entered into in this agreement includes demand  energy and transmission charges

index to financial statements regulation general in  both the texas and new mexico legislatures enacted electric utility industry restructuring laws requiring competition in certain functions of the industry and ultimately in the company s service area 
in texas  the company is exempt from the requirements of the texas restructuring law  including utility restructuring and retail competition  until the expiration of the freeze period in august in april  the new mexico restructuring act was repealed and as a result  the company s operations in new mexico will continue to be fully regulated 
the company cannot predict at this time the full effects the repeal of the new mexico restructuring act will have on the company as it prepares for retail competition in texas 
however  the company believes that the new mexico commission will have to approve the separation of the company s operations if and when the company implements utility restructuring and retail competition for compliance with the texas restructuring law 
federal regulatory matters federal energy regulatory commission 
the ferc has been conducting an investigation into potential manipulation of electricity prices in the western united states during and on august   the ferc initiated a federal power act fpa investigation into the company s wholesale power trading in the western united states during and to determine whether the company engaged in misconduct and  if so  to determine potential remedies 
the company reached settlements with the ferc and other parties in and under the terms of the settlements  the company agreed to refund a total of million of revenues it earned on wholesale power transactions 
in july  the ferc approved the settlements and on august   the company deposited the million into an interest bearing escrow account to consummate the settlements 
the company believes the ferc s order resolved all issues between the ferc and the other parties to this investigation 
under the settlements  the company has agreed to make wholesale sales pursuant to its cost of service rate authority rather than its market based rate authority for the period december  through december  this agreement allows the company to sell power into wholesale markets at its incremental cost plus per mwh 
to the extent that wholesale market prices exceed these agreed upon amounts  the company will forego the opportunity to realize these additional revenues 
although this provision has not had a significant impact on the company s revenues through december   the company is unable to predict the effect  if any  this will have on the company s revenues 
rtos 
ferc s rule order on regional transmission organizations rtos strongly encourages  but does not require  public utilities to form and join rtos 
the company is an active participant in the development of westconnect  formerly known as the desert southwest transmission and reliability operator 
as a participating transmission owner  the company will ultimately transfer operational authority of its transmission system to westconnect subject to receiving any necessary regulatory approvals 
on october   ferc issued an order indicating that the company s westconnect proposal satisfied  or with certain modifications would satisfy  the ferc requirements for an rto under order westconnect will continue to work with the ferc and two other proposed rtos in the west to achieve a seamless market structure 
the company  however  is anticipated to be 
table of contents 
index to financial statements no more than a participant in westconnect and cannot control the terms or timing of its establishment 
westconnect will not be operational before the end of the freeze period 
the establishment of an rto in the company s service area is an important factor in the company s ability to establish a qualified power region as defined in the texas restructuring law and the timing of the operations of westconnect could affect when and whether the company s texas service territory participates in the texas deregulated market 
department of energy 
the doe regulates the company s exports of power to the cfe in mexico pursuant to a license granted by the doe and a presidential permit 
the doe has determined that all such exports over international transmission lines shall be made in accordance with order no 
 which established the ferc rules for open access 
the doe is authorized to assess operators of nuclear generating facilities a share of the costs of decommissioning the doe s uranium enrichment facilities and for the ultimate costs of disposal of spent nuclear fuel 
see facilities palo verde station spent fuel storage for discussion of spent fuel storage and disposal costs 
nuclear regulatory commission 
the nrc has jurisdiction over the company s licenses for palo verde and regulates the operation of nuclear generating stations to protect the health and safety of the public from radiation hazards 
the nrc also has the authority to conduct environmental reviews pursuant to the national environmental policy act 
texas regulatory matters the rates and services of the company are regulated in texas by municipalities and by the texas commission 
the largest municipality in the company s service area is the city of el paso 
the texas commission has exclusive appellate jurisdiction to review municipal orders and ordinances regarding rates and services within municipalities in texas and original jurisdiction over certain other activities of the company 
the decisions of the texas commission are subject to judicial review 
deregulation 
the texas restructuring law required certain investor owned electric utilities to separate power generation activities from transmission and distribution activities by january   and on that date  retail competition for generation services was instituted in some parts of texas 
the texas restructuring law  however  specifically recognized and preserved the company s texas rate stipulation and texas settlement agreement by  among other things  exempting the company s texas service area from retail competition until the end of the freeze period 
the texas commission recently opened a project project no 
to evaluate the readiness of the company s service area in texas for retail competition for generation services 
in this project  the texas commission may specify in advance the factors that are important in deciding when and whether to open the company s service area in texas to customer choice 
one of the key factors that will likely be utilized by the texas commission in its determination is the progress that has been made in developing an rto in the company s service area 
public hearings to discuss the readiness of the company s service area were held on march  in el paso and will be held in austin in april there is substantial uncertainty about both the regulatory framework and market conditions that will exist if and when retail competition is implemented in the company s service territory and the company may incur substantial preparatory  restructuring and other costs that may not ultimately be recoverable 
there can be no assurance that

fuel 
although the company s base rates are frozen in texas  pursuant to texas commission rules and the texas rate stipulation  the company can request adjustments to its fuel factor to more accurately reflect projected energy costs associated with providing electricity and seek recovery of past undercollections of fuel revenues  subject to periodic final review by the texas commission in fuel reconciliation proceedings 
on march   the texas commission announced its decision in puc docket no 
 a case in which the company sought to reconcile its texas jurisdictional fuel costs for the period january  through december  at issue was the company s request to recover an additional million  before interest  from its texas customers as a surcharge because of fuel undercollections from january through december the texas commission disallowed approximately million of texas jurisdictional expenses  before interest  consisting primarily of i approximately million of purchased power expenses which the texas commission characterized as imputed capacity charges  and ii approximately million in fees which were deemed to be administrative costs  not recoverable as fuel 
in texas  capacity charges are not eligible for recovery as fuel expenses  but are to be recovered through the company s base rates 
as the company s base rates were frozen during the time period in question  the million of imputed capacity charges would be permanently disallowed  and hence not recoverable from its texas customers 
the texas commission s decision modifies the proposal for decision issued september  by the administrative law judges aljs 
the aljs had recommended that approximately million of the company s purchased power expense should be disallowed as imputed capacity charges and not recovered from texas jurisdictional customers 
the company has incurred similar purchased power costs for the fuel reconciliation period beginning january  the company believes that it has accounted for its purchased power costs during the reconciliation period beginning january in a manner consistent with the texas commission s decision in puc docket no 
however  the texas commission has indicated its desire to conduct a generic rulemaking proceeding to determine a statewide policy for the appropriate pricing of capacity in purchased power contracts 
there can be no assurance  however  as to the outcome of such rulemaking and the potential impact on the company with respect to fuel recovery in future reconciliation periods if the texas commission adopts a different methodology in a subsequent rulemaking proceeding 
the texas commission s decision is subject to appeal by the various parties and the company is unable to predict the ultimate outcome of any appeals that may be filed in this case 
palo verde performance standards 
the texas commission established performance standards for the operation of palo verde pursuant to which each palo verde unit is evaluated annually to determine whether its three year rolling average capacity factor entitles the company to a reward or subjects it to a penalty 
the capacity factor is calculated as the ratio of actual generation to maximum possible generation 
if the capacity factor  as measured on a station wide basis for any consecutive month period  should fall below  the texas commission can also reconsider the rate treatment 
table of contents 
index to financial statements of palo verde  regardless of the provisions of the texas rate stipulation and the texas settlement agreement 
the removal of palo verde from rate base could have a significant negative impact on the company s revenues and financial condition 
under the performance standards as modified by the texas fuel settlement  the company has calculated the performance awards for the reporting periods ending in  and to be approximately million  million and million  respectively 
these rewards will be included  along with energy costs incurred and revenues billed  as part of the texas commission s review during a future periodic fuel reconciliation proceeding as discussed above 
performance rewards are not recorded on the company s books until the texas commission has ordered a final determination in a fuel proceeding or comparable evidence of collectibility is obtained 
performance penalties are recorded when assessed as probable by the company 
texas renewable energy requirement 
chapter of the public utility regulatory act pura  implemented by senate bill in the legislative session  requires that  by january   an additional  mw of generating capacity from renewable energy technologies be installed in the state 
the renewable energy requirement is to be added in increments with the cumulative installed renewable capacity in texas totaling  mw by january    mw by january   and  mw by january  the requirements of this goal are placed on retail electric providers reps  who provide competitive retail electric service in the state of texas 
utilities that have not implemented retail competition may have renewable energy requirements based on orders of the texas commission 
until the end of the freeze period  the company is exempt from pura chapter and texas commission rules implementing the renewable requirements 
however  once the freeze period ends  any renewable energy requirement applicable to the company could be based on the percentage of the competitive retail load that will be served by the company or the company s rep in relation to the total competitive retail load served in texas 
it is not clear when the company will need to meet a renewable energy requirement in texas or what the obligation will be 
the company is currently reviewing the outcome of its new mexico rfps  for renewable energy to assess possible scenarios for meeting possible future texas requirements  which includes the purchase of renewable power and or credits
