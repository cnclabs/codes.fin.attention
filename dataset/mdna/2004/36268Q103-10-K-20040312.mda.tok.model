available information our corporate website at www 
gaiam 
com corporate provides information about gaiam  its history  goals and philosophy  as well as certain financial reports and corporate press releases 
our www 
gaiam 
com website features a library of information and articles on personal development  healthy lifestyles and environmental issues  along with an extensive offering of products and services 
we believe our website provides us with an opportunity to deepen our relationships with our customers and investors  educate them on a variety of issues  and improve our service 
as part of this commitment  we have added a link on our corporate website to our securities and exchange commission filings  including our reports on form k  q and k and all amendments to such reports 
those reports are available through our website  free of charge  as soon as reasonably practicable after these reports are filed with the securities and exchange commission 
we have included our website addresses only as inactive textual reference  and the information contained on our website is not incorporated by reference into the form k 
factors that may affect future results we wish to caution you that there are risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to be materially different from those indicated by forward looking statements that we make from time to time in filings with the securities and exchange commission  news releases  reports  proxy statements  registration statements and other written communications as well as oral forward looking statements made from time to time by our representatives 
these risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to  those risks described below 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or those we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations and historical results are not necessarily an indication of the future results 
the cautionary statements below discuss important factors that could cause our business  financial condition  operating results and cash flows to be materially adversely affected 
changes in general economic conditions could have a material impact on our business our results of operations could be impacted by changes in overall economic conditions that impact consumer spending 
future economic conditions affecting disposable income such as employment levels  consumer confidence  business conditions  stock market volatility  weather conditions  acts of terrorism  threats of war  and interest and tax rates could reduce consumer spending or cause consumers to shift their spending to our competitors 
if the current economic conditions and performance of the retail and media environment do not improve  or worsen  we may experience material adverse impacts on our business  operating results and financial condition 
increased competition could impact our financial results we believe that the lohas market has thousands of small  local and regional businesses 
some smaller businesses may be able to more effectively personalize their relationships with customers  thereby gaining a competitive advantage 
although we believe that we do not compete directly with any single company that offers our entire range of merchandise  within each merchandise category we have competitors and we may face competition from new entrants 
some of our competitors or our potential competitors may have greater financial and marketing resources 
in addition  larger  well established and well financed entities may acquire  invest in or form joint ventures with our competitors 
increased competition from these or other competitors could negatively impact our business 
changing consumer preferences may have an adverse effect on our business our business is targeted at consumers who assign high value to personal development  healthy lifestyles  responsible media  renewable energy and the environment 
a decrease of consumer interest in purchasing goods and services that promote the values we espouse would materially and adversely affect our customer base and sales revenues and  accordingly  our financial prospects 
further  consumer preferences are difficult to predict 
our future success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and respond to changes in consumer preferences and we may not respond in a timely or commercially appropriate manner to such changes 
failure to anticipate and respond to changing consumer preferences could lead to  among other things  lower sales of our products  increased merchandise returns and lower margins  which would have a material adverse effect on our business 
we may face quarterly and seasonal fluctuations that could harm our business our revenue and results of operations have fluctuated and will continue to fluctuate on a quarterly basis as a result of a number of factors  including the timing of catalog offerings  timing of orders from retailers  recognition of costs or net sales contributed by new merchandise and catalog offerings  fluctuations in response rates  fluctuations in paper  production and postage costs and expenses  merchandise returns  adverse weather conditions that affect distribution or shipping  shifts in the timing of holidays and changes in our merchandise mix 
in particular  our net sales and profits have historically been higher during the fourth quarter holiday season 
we believe that this seasonality will continue in the future 
our strategy of offering branded products could lead to inventory risk and higher costs an important part of our strategy is to feature branded products 
these products are sold under our brand names and are manufactured to our specifications 
we expect our reliance on branded merchandise to increase 
the use of branded merchandise requires us to incur costs and risks relating to the design and purchase of products  including submitting orders earlier and making longer initial purchase commitments 
in addition  the use of branded merchandise limits our ability to return unsold products to vendors  which can result in higher markdowns in order to sell excess inventory 
our commitment to customer service typically results in us keeping a high level of merchandise in stock so we can fill orders immediately 
consequently  we run the risk of having excess inventory  which may also contribute to higher markdowns 
our failure to successfully execute a branded merchandise strategy or to achieve anticipated profit margins on these goods  or a higher than anticipated level of overstocks  may materially adversely affect our revenues 
we offer our customers liberal merchandise return policies 
our consolidated financial statements include a reserve for anticipated merchandise returns  which is based on historical return rates 
it is possible that actual returns may increase as a result of factors such as the introduction of new merchandise  changes in merchandise mix or other factors 
any increase in our merchandise returns will correspondingly reduce our revenues 
acquisitions may harm our financial results acquisitions have been part of our growth and may continue to be part of our growth in the future 
these acquisitions may be of entire companies  controlling interests in companies or of minority interests in companies where we intend to invest as part of a strategic alliance 
if we are not successful in integrating companies that we acquire or are not able to generate adequate sales from the acquired entities  our business could be materially and adversely affected the loss of the services of our key personnel could disrupt our business we depend on the continued services and performance of our senior management and other key personnel  particularly jirka rysavy and lynn powers 
our strategy of allowing the management teams of some acquired companies to continue to exercise significant management responsibility for those companies makes it important that we retain key employees  particularly the sales and creative teams  of the companies we might acquire 
our founder and chief executive officer jirka rysavy controls gaiam mr 
rysavy holds of gaiam s  outstanding shares of class b common stock and also owns  shares of class a common stock 
the shares of class b common stock are convertible into shares of class a common stock at any time 
each share of class b common stock has ten votes per share  and each share of class a common stock has one vote per share 
consequently  mr 
rysavy is able to vote a majority of our stock  and will be able to exert substantial influence over gaiam and to control matters requiring approval by the shareholders of gaiam  including the election of directors  increasing our authorized capital stock  or a merger or sale of our assets 
as a result of mr 
rysavy s control  no change of control of gaiam can occur without mr 
rysavy s consent 
our success depends on the value of the gaiam brand because of our reliance on sales of proprietary products  our success depends on the gaiam brand 
building and maintaining recognition of the gaiam brand are important to attracting and expanding our customer base 
if the value of the gaiam brand were adversely affected  we cannot be certain that we will be able to attract new customers  retain existing customers or encourage repeat purchases  and if the value of our brand were to diminish  our revenues  results of operations and prospects would be adversely affected 
disputes concerning media content and intellectual property may adversely affect us most of our media content is subject to arrangements with third parties pursuant to which we have licensed certain rights to use and distribute media content owned by third parties or have licensed to third parties certain rights to use and distribute media content that we own 
in addition  we have a number of agreements with third parties concerning the use of our media content and intellectual property  including agreements regarding royalties  distribution  duplication  etc 
allegations that we do not have rights to use media content and other disputes arising from such arrangements can be costly and may have a material adverse impact on our results 
we are dependent on third party suppliers for the success of our proprietary products we are dependent on the success of our proprietary products  and we rely on a select group of manufacturers to provide us with sufficient quantities to meet our customer s demands in a timely manner  produce these products in a humane and safe environment for both their workers and the planet  maintain quality standards consistent with the gaiam brand  and meet certain pricing guarantees 
our sourcing of these products overseas continues to increase  and these arrangements carry risks associated with relying on products manufactured outside of the us  including political unrest and trade restrictions  currency fluctuations  transportation difficulties  work stoppages  and other uncertainties 
in addition  a number of our suppliers are small companies  and some of these vendors may not have sufficient capital  resources or personnel to increase their sales to us or to meet our needs for increased commitments from them 
the failure of our suppliers to provide sufficient quantities of our proprietary products could decrease our revenues  increase our costs  and damage our customer service reputation 
we rely on communications and shipping networks to deliver our products given our emphasis on customer service  the efficient and uninterrupted operation of order processing and fulfillment functions is critical to our business 
to maintain a high level of customer service  we rely heavily on a number of different outside service providers  such as printers  telecommunications companies and delivery companies 
any interruption in services from our principal outside service providers  including delays or disruptions resulting from labor disputes  power outages  human error  adverse weather conditions or natural disasters  could materially adversely affect our business 
in addition  products that we source overseas must be shipped to our distribution center by freight carriers  and a work stoppage or political unrest could adversely affect our ability to fulfill our customer orders 
information systems upgrades or integrations may disrupt our operations or financial reporting we continually evaluate and upgrade our management information systems  which are critical to our business 
these systems assist in processing orders  managing inventory  purchasing and shipping merchandise on a timely basis  responding to customer service inquiries  and gathering and analyzing operating data by business segment  customer  and sku a specific identifier for each different product 
we are required to continually update these systems 
furthermore  if we acquire other companies  we will need to integrate the acquired companies systems with ours  a process that could be time consuming and costly 
if our systems cannot accommodate our growth or if they fail  we could incur substantial expenses 
additionally  our success in e commerce will depend upon our ability to provide a compelling and satisfying shopping experience 
to remain competitive  we must continue to enhance and improve the responsiveness  functionality and features of our online technology 
a material security breach could cause us to lose sales  damage our reputation or result in liability to us our computer servers may be vulnerable to computer viruses  physical or electronic break ins and similar disruptions 
we may need to expend significant additional capital and other resources to protect against a security breach or to alleviate problems caused by any breaches 
our relationships with our customers may be adversely affected if the security measures that we use to protect personal information such as credit card numbers are ineffective 
we currently rely on security and authentication technology that we license from third parties 
we may not prevent all security breaches 
our systems may fail or limit user traffic  which would cause us to lose sales we support most of our business through our call center in broomfield  colorado 
even though we have back up arrangements  we are dependent on our ability to maintain our computer and telecommunications equipment in this center in effective working order and to protect against damage from fire  natural disaster  power loss  telecommunications failure or similar events 
in addition  growth of our customer base may strain or exceed the capacity of our computer and telecommunications systems and lead to degradations in performance or systems failure 
we have experienced capacity constraints and failure of information systems in the past that have resulted in decreased levels of service delivery or interruptions in service to customers for limited periods of time 
although we continually review and consider upgrades to our technical infrastructure and provide for system redundancies and backup power to limit the likelihood of systems overload or failure  substantial damage to our systems or a systems failure that causes interruptions for a number of days could adversely affect our business 
additionally  if we are unsuccessful in updating and expanding our infrastructure  including our call center  our ability to grow may be constrained 
if the protection of our internet domain names is inadequate  our brand recognition could be impaired and we could lose customers we currently hold various internet domain names relating to our brand  including www 
gaiam 
com and www 
gaia 
com 
the acquisition and maintenance of domain names is regulated by governmental agencies and their designees 
the regulation of domain names in the us and in foreign countries is changing and is expected to continue to change in the future 
as a result  we may not be able to acquire or maintain the domain names we want in all countries in which we seek to conduct business 
furthermore  we may be unable to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names whose similarity decreases the value of our trademarks and proprietary rights 
loss of our internet domain names could adversely affect our ability to develop brand recognition 
government regulation of the internet and e commerce is evolving and unfavorable changes could harm our business we are subject to general business regulations and laws  as well as regulations and laws specifically governing the internet and e commerce 
such existing and future laws and regulations may impede the growth of the internet or other online services 
these regulations and laws may cover taxation  user privacy  pricing  content  copyrights  distribution  consumer protection  the provision of online payment services and quality of products and services 
there is lack of clarity on how existing laws governing issues such as property ownership  sales and other taxes and personal privacy apply to the internet and e commerce 
unfavorable resolution of these issues may harm our business 
we may face legal liability for the content contained on our website we could face legal liability for defamation  negligence  copyright  patent or trademark infringement  personal injury or other claims based on the nature and content of materials that we publish or distribute on our website 
if we are held liable for damages for the content on our website  our business may suffer 
further  one of our goals is for www 
gaiam 
com to be a trustworthy and dependable provider of information and services 
allegations of impropriety  even if unfounded  could therefore have a material adverse effect on our reputation and our business 
relying on our centralized fulfillment center could expose us to losing revenue prompt and efficient fulfillment of our customers orders is critical to our business 
our facility in cincinnati  ohio handles our fulfillment functions and some customer service related operations  such as returns processing 
a majority of our orders are filled and shipped from the cincinnati facility 
the balance is shipped directly from suppliers 
because we rely on a centralized fulfillment center  our fulfillment functions could be severely impaired in the event of fire  extended adverse weather conditions  transportation difficulties or natural disasters 
because we recognize revenue only when we ship orders  interruption of our shipping would diminish our revenues 
postage and shipping costs may increase and therefore increase our expenses we ship our products  catalogs  and lifestyle publications to consumers and the cost of shipping is a material expenditure 
postage and shipping prices increase periodically and can be expected to increase in the future 
any inability to secure suitable or commercially favorable prices or other terms for the delivery of our merchandise and catalogs could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our business is subject to reporting requirements that are currently evolving and  once established  could substantially increase our operating expenses 
because our common stock is publicly traded  we are subject to certain rules and regulations of federal  state and financial market exchange entities charged with the protection of investors and the oversight of companies whose securities are publicly traded 
these entities  including the public company accounting oversight board  the sec and the nasdaq  have recently issued new requirements and regulations and are currently developing additional regulations and requirements in response to recent laws enacted by congress  most notably the sarbanes oxley act of as certain rules are not yet finalized  we do not know the level of resources we would have to commit in order to be in compliance 
our compliance with current and proposed rules  such as section of the sarbanes oxley act  is likely to require the commitment of significant financial and managerial resources and additional expense to gaiam

overview and outlook gaiam is a multi channel lifestyle company providing information  goods and services to customers who value personal development  healthy living  ecological lifestyles and responsible media 
gaiam was incorporated in boulder  colorado in to support conscious commerce  the practice of making purchasing decisions based on lifestyle and personal values 
in  gaiam began to expand nationally 
in  gaiam made a large investment in infrastructure and operating systems to support rapid growth 
from to  gaiam s revenues increased from million to million  representing a compound annual growth rate of 
gaiam s revenues declined to million in  as compared to million in the decline in revenues was primarily attributable to a decline of  or million  in sales to retailers 
during  sales to distributors declined million as a result of the exclusion of our healing arts branded accessories in the fitness pallet in costco for holiday  and the transition of bed  bath and beyond from a distributor relationship to direct 
this required gaiam to take back inventory from our distributor and reset the floor for bed  bath and beyond 
additionally  gaiam s sales to mall based stores  such as the discovery channel stores  declined approximately million 
these declines took place in our business segment  which has had higher operating contributions in prior years than our direct to consumer segment 
with more of the revenue contributed by those divisions with lower gross margins  the overall gross margin declined to 
gaiam used as a transition year in order to make adjustments to our business strategy by doubling our sales force  adding new product categories  launching sales to additional retail chains within the business segment  and consolidating our operations and reducing expenses in order to focus on profitability in all segments in the future 
although gaiam reported a net loss of approximately thousand in  its first net loss since becoming a public company  gaiam generated million in cash provided by operations  compared to million cash provided by operations in  when gaiam had net income of million 
gaiam has increased its focus on its media and national retailer channels  which strategically provides increased branding opportunities  higher operating contribution and greater mainstream penetration 
in  our business segment was of total revenues  up from in during  gaiam will focus on selling directly to retailers through the store within store concept and building this segment through a combination of new media releases and new product opportunities in soft goods and spa products  along with an expansion in mass market retailers and bookstores  and new launches into the grocery and the professional markets 
as part of our strategy to grow the business segment  in gaiam acquired a interest in leisure systems international lsi  a distributor of wellness products based in the uk total consideration for the acquisition was approximately  in cash and  shares of gaiam class a common stock 
results from operations of lsi are included in the consolidated financial statements of gaiam from the effective acquistion date of january  it is anticipated that lsi will be able to launch our media and employ a sales strategy in the uk retail market that is similar to gaiam s store within store presentation in the us the direct to consumer segment continues to be an integral part of gaiam s outreach 
this segment accounted for  or approximately million  of gaiam s revenues during revenues for the gaiam s catalog and website operations remained relatively flat as compared to although this segment did not see much growth in  it remains the base for gaiam 
circulation of million catalogs provides branding  a sounding board for new product testing  promotional opportunities and customer feedback on gaiam s and the lohas industry s focus and future 
even with the shift to our business segment  gaiam s gross margin remained strong at primarily because of our continued focus on higher margin proprietary products 
in  over of our sales were comprised of proprietary products  up from in gaiam anticipates both a return to positive internal growth and a return to profitability in the negative internal growth experienced during has subsided and we anticipate that the internal growth rate will be approximately to in the first quarter of and finish the year around 
gaiam s revenues will continue to be heavily weighted to the second half of the calendar year  so the majority of our earnings will continue to be generated during the third and fourth quarters 
please see quarterly and seasonal fluctuations 
critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require management to make judgments  estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in gaiam s consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k summarizes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of gaiam s consolidated financial statements 
management believes the following to be critical accounting policies whose application has a material impact on gaiam s financial presentation  and involve a higher degree of complexity  as they require management to make judgments and estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain 
provision for doubtful accounts gaiam records a provision for doubtful accounts for all receivables not expected to be collected 
gaiam generally does not require collateral 
gaiam evaluates the collectibility of the accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances when we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations eg bankruptcy filings  gaiam records a specific reserve for bad debts against amounts due 
for all other instances  gaiam recognizes reserves based on historical experience and review of individual accounts outstanding 
inventory inventory consists primarily of finished goods held for sale and is stated at the lower of cost first in  first out method or market 
gaiam identifies its inventory items to write down for obsolescence based on the item s current sales status and condition 
if the item is discontinued or slow moving  it is written down based on an estimate of the markdown to retail price needed to sell through its current stock level 
investments investments for which gaiam does not have the ability to exercise significant influence  are accounted for under the cost method 
under the cost method of accounting  investments in private companies are carried at cost and are adjusted only for other than temporary declines in fair value 
investments under the cost method are included on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet in investments 
capitalized production costs capitalized production costs include costs incurred to produce informational media products marketed by gaiam to retail marketers and direct mail customers 
these costs are deferred for financial reporting purposes until the media is released  then amortized over succeeding periods on the basis of estimated sales 
historical sales statistics are the principal factor used in estimating the amortization rate 
revenues revenue from the sale of products is recognized at the time merchandise is shipped to the customer 
revenue for services provided  such as design consultation for solar installations  is recognized when the services are rendered 
licensing revenue is recognized upon delivery of the media licensed 
amounts billed to customers for postage and handling charges are recognized as revenue at the time that the revenues on the product shipments are recognized 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the purchase consideration over the fair value of assets acquired less liabilities assumed in a business acquisition 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill is no longer amortized but is reviewed for impairment annually  or more frequently if impairment indicators arise  on a reporting unit level 
the fair value of a reporting unit is compared with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss 
gaiam has allocated goodwill to two reporting units  and uses a market value method for the purposes of testing for potential impairment 
the annual review requires extensive use of financial judgment and estimates 
application of alternative assumptions and definitions  such as a change in the composition of a reporting unit  could yield significantly different results results of operations the following table sets forth certain financial data as a percentage of revenues for the periods indicated for the year ended december  net revenue cost of goods sold gross profit expenses selling and operating corporate  general and administrative total expenses income loss from operations other income expense  net income loss before income taxes and minority interest income tax benefit expense minority interest in net income loss of consolidated subsidiary  net of tax net income loss year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues declined to million in from million in the decrease is primarily attributable to a decline in sales to distributors of million for  which is more fully discussed above under overview and outlook 
as a result  business segment revenues declined to million in from million in the direct to consumer segment revenues remained flat at million for compared to million in gross profit  which consists of revenue less cost of sales primarily merchandise acquisition costs and in bound freight  decreased to million in from million in as a percentage of revenue  gross profit was in compared to in this was primarily attributable to a shift in sales composition to our lower margin divisions  and from margin contraction in the business segment primarily due to a product shift to accessories 
selling and operating expenses  which consist primarily of sales and marketing costs  commissions and fulfillment expenses decreased to million in from million in as a percentage of revenues selling and operating expenses increased to in from in primarily due to the lower revenue base  coupled with the cost of doubling the business segment sales force  which is expected to add incremental value in gaiam also completed its requisite warehouse management system conversion and the majority of its fulfillment consolidation from outside providers into its distribution facility in ohio 
corporate  general and administrative expenses decreased to million for from million in  as a result of staffing reduction implemented in the first half of as a percentage of revenues  general and administrative expenses increased to in from in due to the lower sales base 
as a result of the factors described above  gaiam posted an operating loss of million for  as compared to operating income of million for gaiam recorded thousand in other income during  as compared to other expense of thousand in in  other income resulted primarily from a gain on the purchase of stock rights and interest income generated on available cash 
minority interest expense  net of income taxes  increased from thousand in to thousand in primarily due to positive operating results generated by leisure systems international  in which gaiam purchased a interest in january gaiam recorded an income tax benefit of thousand on a pretax loss of thousand for  as compared to income tax expense of million on pretax income of million in was a year in which gaiam focused on consolidating and improving its operations  refocused and restructured its sales efforts in its business segment  and positioned its media and product offerings for expansion into new markets 
as a result of the above factors  gaiam recorded a net loss of thousand in despite this loss  gaiam s cash generated by operations grew to million in  from million in  when gaiam recorded net income of million 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues increased to million in from million in increased sales to national retail chains and proprietary products contributed towards gaiam s internal growth rate of for the year 
the closure of some catalog operations and the multi store retail operation we acquired in connection with the real goods transaction lowered our year over year sales growth comparison even after factoring in acquisition contribution 
during fiscal we reduced catalog circulation as planned 
business segment revenues increased to million or of sales in  up from million or in during gaiam converted some distribution arrangements to licensing agreements and expanded licensing of its visual media assets for broadcast and pay per view in order to increase brand exposure and generate revenues 
in fiscal  gaiam recognized approximately million in licensing revenues from universal studios  koch  conscious media and discovery channel 
our canadian distributor koch was converted to a media licensee 
if we had not converted koch to a licensee  we would have recognized approximately million in additional revenues in fiscal costs to convert our visual media library for broadcast and licensing  including international conversion and formatting  and the cost to repurchase rights from universal for europe and asia were expensed 
gross profit increased to million in from million during as a percentage of revenue  gross profit was in compared to in the decline in gross profit percentage was primarily attributable to product mix diversification in our business segment and as a result of the business segment representing a greater percentage of total sales

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks  which include changes in us interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
we do not engage in financial transactions for trading or speculative purposes 
any borrowings we might make under our bank credit facility would bear interest at the lower of prime rate less basis points or libor plus basis points 
gaiam does not have any amounts outstanding under its credit line  so any unfavorable change in interest rates would not have a material impact on gaiam s results from operations or cash flows unless gaiam made borrowings in the future 
gaiam purchases a significant amount of inventory from vendors outside of the us in transactions that are primarily us dollar transactions 
a small percentage of our international purchases are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
any currency risks related to these transactions are immaterial to gaiam 
a decline in the relative value of the us dollar to other foreign currencies could  however  lead to increased purchasing costs 
in order to mitigate this exposure  gaiam makes virtually all of its purchase commitments in us dollars 
in  gaiam purchased a interest in leisure systems international limited  a uk based distributor 
because leisure systems revenues are primarily denominated in foreign currencies  this investment exposes gaiam to accounting risk associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
however  we have determined that there was no material market risk exposure to our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows as of december
