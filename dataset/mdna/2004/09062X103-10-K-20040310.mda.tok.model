the business combination was treated as an acquisition of biogen  inc by idec pharmaceuticals corporation for accounting purposes 
in connection with the merger  idec pharmaceuticals corporation changed its name to biogen idec inc biogen idec combines the complementary strengths of each company to create new standards of care in oncology and immunology 
as a global leader in the development  manufacture  and commercialization of novel therapies  we transform scientific discoveries into advances in human healthcare 
the merger provides diversification of our product portfolios and revenue bases  strengthens our research and development capabilities  and diversifies our product pipeline in key therapeutic areas 
additionally  we believe our manufacturing capacity will make us an attractive partner for companies seeking to partner on promising biologic products in development 
we currently have four commercial products avonex interferon beta a for the treatment of relapsing multiple sclerosis  or ms  rituxan rituximab and zevalin ibritumomab tiuxetan  both of which treat certain b cell non hodgkin s lymphomas  or b cell nhls  and amevive alefacept for the treatment of adult patients with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy 
we acquired avonex and amevive from biogen  inc we also receive revenues from royalties on sales by our licensees of a number of products covered under patents that we control including sales of rituxan outside the us rituxan is the trade name in the us  canada and japan for the compound rituximab 
in this form k  we refer to rituximab  rituxan and mabthera collectively as rituxan  except where we have otherwise indicated 
in addition  we have a pipeline of development stage products and a number of research programs in our core therapeutic areas and in other areas of interest 
as a result of the merger  biogen  inc stockholders received shares of biogen idec common stock for each share of biogen  inc common stock 
as a result  biogen idec issued approximately million shares at a fair value of approximately billion based on the average of the closing price of idec pharmaceuticals corporation s common stock for the period from two days before through two days after the public announcement of the merger on june

globally over  patients have chosen avonex as their treatment of choice 
our results of operations for include sales of avonex for the period from november  through december  during that period  sales of avonex generated worldwide revenues of million  of which million was generated in the united states and million in the rest of the world  primarily the european union  or eu 
product sales from avonex represent approximately of our total revenues in in february  zevalin became the first radioimmunotherapy approved by the fda for the treatment of certain b cell nhls 
zevalin is approved as a treatment for relapsed or refractory low grade  follicular  or transformed b cell nhl including patients with rituxan refractory follicular nhl 
we launched zevalin in the us in april in  sales of zevalin generated revenues of million in the us as compared to million in outside the us  we have licensed our marketing rights in zevalin to schering ag 
in january  the european agency for the evaluation of medicinal products  or emea  the regulatory authority in the eu  granted marketing approval of zevalin in the eu for the treatment of adult patients with cd follicular b cell nhl who are refractory to or have relapsed following treatment with rituxan 
product sales from zevalin represented approximately of our total revenues in and  respectively 
amevive was approved in the us in for the treatment of adult patients with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy 
our results of operations for include sales of amevive for the period from november  through december  during that period  sales of amevive generated revenues of million  substantially all in the us in february  the european committee for proprietary medicinal products  or cpmp  the scientific advisory board of the emea  determined that more information was required to approve amevive in the eu 
we withdrew our application for approval 
we plan to develop the additional information necessary to obtain approval of amevive for the treatment of psoriasis in the eu 
developing the data and re filing the application may take several years 
product sales from amevive represent approximately of our total revenues in 
table of contents we anticipate that our total product sales in will be substantially higher than  since revenues from sales of avonex and amevive will be included in our results of operations for all of as opposed to when revenues from sales of avonex and amevive were included in our results of operations only for the period from november  through december  see also the risks affecting revenues described in forward looking information and risk factors that may affect future results our revenues rely significantly on a limited number of products 
unconsolidated joint business revenue rituxan was the first monoclonal antibody approved by the fda for a cancer therapy indication 
rituxan is approved for the treatment of various b cell nhls 
rituxan is marketed in the us in collaboration with genentech  inc all us sales of rituxan and associated costs and expenses are recognized by genentech and we record our share of the pretax copromotion profits on a quarterly basis 
our share of copromotion profits from us sales was million in compared to million in and million in f 
hoffman la roche ltd 
sells rituximab outside the us  except in japan  where it copromotes rituxan in collaboration with zenyaku kogyo co 
ltd  or zenyaku 
we received royalties on sales of rituximab outside of the us of million in as compared to million in and million in  which we include under unconsolidated joint business revenue 
revenues from unconsolidated joint business arrangement for the years ended december   and  consist of the following in thousands copromotion profits reimbursement of selling and development expenses royalty revenue on sales of rituximab outside the us  including royalties received directly from roche rituxan clinical data purchased from roche columbia patent royalty and interest payment under our agreement with genentech  our current pretax copromotion profit sharing formula has two tiers 
we earn a higher percentage of the pretax copromotion profits at the upper tier once a fixed pretax copromotion profit level is met 
the profit sharing formula resets annually at the beginning of each year to the lower tier 
we began recording our profit share at the higher percentage during the first quarter of  and rituxan net sales to third party customers in the us recorded by genentech for amounted to billion compared to billion in and million in the increase in and was primarily due to increased market penetration in treatments of b cell nhls and chronic lymphocytic leukemia and increases in the wholesale price of rituxan effective march  and march our royalty revenue on sales of rituximab outside the us is based on roche and zenyaku s net sales to third party customers and is recorded with a one quarter lag 
the increase in royalty revenues in is due to higher sales of rituxan outside the us resulting from increased penetration of foreign markets  including canada and japan 
during  genentech purchased certain clinical data from roche related to rituxan supporting potential label expansion 
additionally  in genentech and idec agreed that payments were owed to columbia university for royalties related to past sales of rituxan in the us as a result  we recognized million in royalty payments and  in interest charges related to these royalties 
total unconsolidated joint business revenue represented  and of our total revenues in  and  respectively 

table of contents royalty revenue we receive revenues from royalties on sales by our licensees of a number of products covered under patents that we control 
during  we received approximately million in royalty revenues representing of total revenues 
our royalty revenues on sales of rituximab outside the us are included in unconsolidated joint business revenue 
we receive royalties from schering plough corporation on sales of its alpha interferon products in the us and italy under an exclusive license to our alpha interferon patents and patent applications 
schering plough sells its intron a interferon alfa b brand of alpha interferon in the us for a number of indications  including the treatment of chronic hepatitis b and hepatitis c 
schering plough also sells other alpha interferon products for the treatment of hepatitis c  including rebetron combination therapy containing intron a and rebetol ribavirin  usp  peg intron peginterferon alfa b  a pegylated form of alpha interferon  and peg intron in combination with rebetol 
we hold several important patents related to hepatitis b antigens produced by genetic engineering techniques 
these antigens are used in recombinant hepatitis b vaccines and in diagnostic test kits used to detect hepatitis b infection 
we receive royalties from sales of hepatitis b vaccines in several countries  including the us  from glaxosmithkline plc and merck and co 
inc we have also licensed our proprietary hepatitis b rights  on an antigen by antigen and nonexclusive basis  to several diagnostic kit manufacturers  including abbott laboratories  the major worldwide marketer of hepatitis b diagnostic kits 
we also receive ongoing royalties on sales of the recombinant human growth hormone product  genotropin  by pfizer  inc in the us  canada and japan  and on sales of angiomax bivalirudin by the medicines company  also known as tmc 
tmc sells angiomax in the us for use as an anticoagulant in combination with aspirin in patients with unstable angina undergoing percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty 
tmc sells angiomax through distributors in europe  canada and latin america 
we anticipate that total royalties revenues we will record in will be substantially higher compared to our royalty revenues recorded in  since we will be reporting the full year s worth of royalty revenues from former biogen  inc operations in as opposed to royalty revenues for only the period of november  through december  as are included in our results of operations 
corporate partner revenues corporate partner revenues consist of contract revenues and license fees 
corporate partner revenues totaled million in compared to million in and million in corporate partner revenues represented less than  approximately and approximately of total revenues in  and  respectively 
the decrease in corporate partner revenues in and is primarily due to decreased research and development funding in under our collaborations with taisho pharmaceutical co 
ltd 
of tokyo  or taisho  as a result of the termination of our collaboration with taisho in  and under our collaborations with seikagaku corporation  or seikagaku 
additionally  in  we recognized a million payment received from schering ag when the emea accepted for filing the submission of an application for approval of zevalin in the eu and million of revenues resulting from the implementation of sab contract revenues and license fees are  in part  dependent upon the achievement of certain research and development and commercialization objectives and  accordingly  may vary from year to year 
in the first quarter of  we expect to receive a million payment from schering ag for the emea grant of marketing approval of zevalin in the eu 

table of contents operating costs and expenses in thousands cost of sales research and development selling  general and administrative write off of acquired in process research and development amortization of acquired intangibles total operating costs and expenses cost of sales in  total cost of sales was million and consisted of product cost of sales of million and cost of royalty revenues of million 
in november  we recorded the inventory that we acquired from biogen  inc at its estimated fair value 
product cost of sales consisted of million related to avonex  million related to zevalin and million related to amevive 
in  included in product cost of sales was approximately million in fair market value purchase accounting adjustments related to avonex and amevive 
we expect that approximately million in fair market value purchase accounting adjustments related to avonex and amevive will be included in product cost of sales in the increase to fair market value was recognized as cost of product sales when the acquired inventory was sold or written down 
included in product cost of sales were write downs of commercial inventory that did not meet quality specifications or became obsolete due to dating expiration  in all cases this product inventory was written down to its net realizable value 
in  we wrote down million related to avonex  million related to amevive and million related to zevalin 
avonex was written down from fair market value when it was determined that the inventory did not meet quality specifications 
we have encountered problems in manufacturing our pre filled syringe formulation of avonex 
if these problems continue we are likely to have to incur additional charges and could potentially experience an interruption in the supply of avonex 
in cost of sales consisted primarily of contractual royalties owed on zevalin sales 
pre launch production of zevalin antibodies manufactured prior to fda approval in february were recognized as research and development expenses 
zevalin sales to date have solely consisted of zevalin antibodies produced prior to fda approval in february gross margin on product sales  which includes inventory written down to its net realizable value  was approximately in gross margin on product sales was approximately in during  we recorded the inventory that we acquired from biogen  inc at its estimated fair value 
the increase in fair market value was recognized as cost of product sales when the acquired inventory was sold or written down 
as a result  gross margin on product sales decreased significantly from we expect that gross margins will increase significantly during as the inventory acquired from biogen  inc at its estimated fair value is sold 
excluding the increase in fair market value related to purchase accounting and the effects of writedowns of commercial inventory to net realizable value  gross margins of product sales would have been in we expect that gross margins will fluctuate in the future based on changes in product mix  write downs of excess or obsolete inventories and new product initiatives 
gross margin on royalty revenues were approximately in we expect that gross margins on royalty revenues will fluctuate in the future based changes in sales volumes for specific products from which we receive royalties 
research and development expenses research and development expenses totaled million in compared to million in and million in the increase in research and development expenses in over primarily related to the acquisition of biogen  inc which contributed million in research and development 
table of contents expenses for the period from november  through december   a million payment to genentech in conjunction with entering into an amended and restated collaboration agreement in june  a million increase in personnel expenses resulting from the expansion of our manufacturing and research functions  a million increase in contract research and manufacturing expenses primarily related to oncology development and a million increase in manufacturing costs recorded as research and development expense 
we did not manufacture zevalin bulk inventory in in  our manufacturing facilities were primarily used to support products in development which caused the majority of the costs of our manufacturing operations to be recorded as research and development expense in such costs were capitalized into inventory in to the extent they related to the manufacture of zevalin 
the increase in research and development expenses in over was primarily due to upfront fees incurred under new collaborations  one time license fees incurred for technology rights related to our products  increased personnel expenses and expansion of our facilities to support our ongoing basic research and clinical development programs  partially offset by capitalization of manufacturing costs for the production of commercial inventory of zevalin antibodies and decreased clinical testing and development costs for zevalin as a result of the fda s approval of zevalin 
research and development expenses will increase significantly in as a result of the merger 
we expect to continue incurring additional research and development expenses due to preclinical and clinical testing of our various products under development  the expansion or addition of research and development programs  technology in licensing  and regulatory related expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses totaled million in compared to million in and million in the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  primarily related to the acquisition of biogen  inc which contributed million in selling  general and administrative expenses for the period from november  through december   including million related to restructuring costs associated with the relocation of our european headquarters  a million increase in personnel expenses resulting from the expansion in sales and marketing expenses to support the commercialization of zevalin  a million increase in legal fees to protect our intellectual property rights  a million increase in insurance expenses due to higher premiums  a million increase in travel expenses primarily related to integration efforts associated with the merger with biogen  inc  and a million increase in information technology expenses with the remaining increase due to the expansion of our administrative function to support growth in manufacturing and research 
we anticipate that total selling  general  and administrative expense that we record in will be substantially higher compared to what we recorded in  since we will be reporting the full year s worth of selling  general and administrative expenses related to supporting avonex and amevive in as opposed to only for the period of november  through december  in our results of operations 
selling  general and administrative expenses in increased compared to primarily due to increased sales and marketing expenses related to the commercial launch of zevalin  sales expenses to support the commercialization of rituxan  increased legal fees to protect our intellectual property rights for zevalin and increases in general and administrative expenses to support overall organizational growth 
selling  general and administrative expenses are expected to increase in the foreseeable future to support the following marketing and administration related to the commercialization of zevalin  manufacturing capacity expansion  clinical trials  research and development  and protection and enforcement of our intellectual property rights for zevalin and our product candidates 

table of contents other income expense  net december  in thousands interest income interest expense other expense total other income expense  net interest income totaled million in compared to million in and million in the decrease in interest income in is primarily due to lower rates of return on securities available for sale 
the average yields earned on our investments in decreased from the average yields earned on our investments in as a result of declining market interest rates 
interest income levels that may be achieved in the future are  in part  dependent upon market conditions 
interest expense totaled million in compared to million in and million in the decrease in interest expense in compared to is due to the capitalization of million in and million in of interest costs largely related to the development of a consolidated west coast research and development and administration campus in san diego  california and our large scale manufacturing facility in oceanside  california  offset by higher noncash interest expense from our senior notes issued in april and may other expenses as set forth in the preceding table included the following december  in thousands donation to biogen idec foundation settlement of patent disputes miscellaneous total other expense in october  biogen  inc established the biogen foundation  a private  us based  non profit philanthropic organization 
in december  biogen  inc made a charitable contribution of million to fund the biogen foundation 
as a result of the merger  we changed the name of the foundation to the biogen idec foundation and  in december contributed an additional million 
the foundation is to operate exclusively for the benefit of charitable  educational and scientific purposes 
certain executive officers and other employees serve as directors and officers of the foundation 
we classify charitable contributions to other income expense 
in december  we recorded charges of million and million related to the final settlement of patent infringement disputes with apoxis sa and corixa corporation  respectively 
these payments for settlement of litigation were charged to other expense in the fourth quarter of acquired in process research and development in the fourth quarter of  we incurred a charge of million related to the write off of acquired in process research and development  or ipr d  related to the merger with biogen  inc the amount expensed as ipr d represents the estimated fair value of purchased in process technology for projects that  as of the acquisition date  had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use 
the estimated fair value of these projects was determined based on the use of a discounted cash flow model 
for each project  the estimated after tax cash flows were probability weighted to take into account the stage of completion and the risks surrounding the successful development and commercialization 
these cash flows were then discounted to present value using a discount rate of 
as of november   we estimated future r d costs of 
table of contents approximately million  million  and million  respectively  would be incurred to complete the neurology  dermatology  and rheumatology research projects 
these estimates are net of any research and development costs that were shared under collaborations with corporate partners 
the research projects  which were in various stages of development  from preclinical through stage clinical trials  are expected to reach completion at various dates ranging from through the major risks and uncertainties associated with the timely and successful completion of these projects consist of the risk that we will not be able to confirm the safety and efficacy of the technology with data from clinical trials and the risk that we will not be able to obtain necessary regulatory approvals 
no assurance can be given that the underlying assumptions used to forecast the cash flows or the timely and successful completion of such projects will materialize  as estimated 
for these reasons  among others  actual results may vary significantly from the estimated results 
amortization of intangible assets in  we recorded amortization expense of million related to the intangible assets of billion acquired in the merger with biogen  inc intangible assets consist of billion in core technology  million in patents and million in trademarks 
amortization of the core technology is provided over the estimated useful lives of the technology ranging from to years 
amortization of the patents is provided over the remaining lives of the patents of years 
trademarks have an indefinite life and  as such  are not amortized 
income tax provision our effective tax rate in was approximately compared to percent in and in our effective tax rate for varied substantially from the us federal statutory rate primarily due to the pre tax loss resulting from the write off of non deductible ipr d and other costs in connection with the merger with biogen  inc which was not deductible for income tax purposes 
excluding the effect of our write off of ipr d  our effective tax rate would have been approximately 
our effective tax rate for was higher than the federal statutory rate primarily because of state taxes 
we have net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for federal and state income tax purposes available to offset future taxable income 
the utilization of our net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits may be subject to an annual limitation under the internal revenue code due to a cumulative change of ownership of more than in prior years 
however  we anticipate that this annual limitation will result only in a slight deferral in the utilization of our net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits 
during  we decreased our valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to zero as  based upon the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods that our deferred tax assets are deductible  we believe it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefits of our deferred tax assets 
in the event that actual results differ from our estimates of future taxable income or we adjust our estimates in future periods  we may need to establish a valuation allowance which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
net income loss in  results of operations provided a net loss of million compared to net income of million and million for and  respectively 
the decrease in net income from is primarily attributable to the writedown of acquired ipr d  the recognition of product cost of sales at fair market value on sales of avonex and amevive  and the amortization of intangible assets 
financial condition we have financed our operating and capital expenditures principally through profits and other revenues from our joint business arrangement with genentech related to the sale of rituxan  sales of avonex  amevive and zevalin  sales of equity securities  royalty revenues  corporate partner revenues  lease financing transactions  debt financing transactions and interest income 
we expect to finance our current and planned operating requirements principally through cash on hand  which includes the proceeds from the april 
table of contents and may issuance of our senior notes  funds from our joint business arrangement with genentech related to the sale of rituxan  funds from commercial sales of avonex  amevive and zevalin  and funds from royalties and funds from existing collaborative agreements and contracts 
we believe that these funds will be sufficient to meet our operating requirements for the foreseeable future 
however  we may  from time to time  seek additional funding through a combination of new collaborative agreements  strategic alliances and additional equity and debt financings or from other sources 
our working capital and capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors  including the continued commercial success of avonex and rituxan  the commercial success of amevive and zevalin  timing and expense of obtaining regulatory approvals for new products  funding and timing of payments related to several material capital projects  the progress of our preclinical and clinical testing  fluctuating or increasing manufacturing requirements and research and development programs  levels of resources that we need to devote to the development of manufacturing  sales and marketing capabilities  including resources devoted to the marketing of avonex  rituxan  amevive  zevalin and future products  technological advances  status of products being developed by competitors  our ability to establish collaborative arrangements with other organizations  and working capital required to satisfy the put options related to our senior notes and subordinated notes

on september   corixa  glaxo and the university of michigan filed a lawsuit in the federal district court in the district of delaware against us for patent infringement 
the lawsuit claims that we infringe the patents that are the subject of our declaratory judgment action against corixa 
the lawsuit seeks damages and to permanently enjoin us from commercializing zevalin 
this action has been transferred to san diego and was consolidated with our lawsuit 
on february  the parties entered into a memorandum of agreement for settlement of all outstanding disputes 
the terms of the memorandum include mutual releases and dismissal with prejudice of all claims and counterclaims in the current litigation between the parties  with each party bearing their own costs  expenses and fees 
in addition  the parties will enter into worldwide  non exclusive licenses  with a right to sublicense  under the patents in suit for the life of such patents 
we will pay million in settlement of all outstanding claims in the litigation upon execution of a definitive settlement and license agreement  which is expected to be concluded by the end of march 
in addition  we will pay royalties on us net sales of zevalin and may pay a one time payment in the future subject to the attainment of a certain net sales level of zevalin in the us on may   another patent in the family of kaminski patents  or the patent  was issued to the university of michigan 
the patent is licensed by the university of michigan to corixa 
on june   we filed a lawsuit in the federal district court in the southern district of california against corixa  glaxo and the university of michigan seeking declaratory judgment that zevalin and its use in the treatment of various b cell nhls does not infringe the patent and a further declaration that the patent is invalid 
on december   we filed a voluntary notice of dismissal without prejudice of this lawsuit based on a covenant by the defendants that they would not sue us for infringement as to any claim of the patent based upon zevalin  or the zevalin therapeutic regimen  as currently approved by the fda  or for any current or past off label use 
the dispute related to the patent is included in the memorandum agreed to by the parties on february  on february   we filed an additional complaint against corixa and glaxo in the federal district court in the southern district of california 
the complaint alleges that corixa s and glaxo s conduct since recommendation by the oncologic drugs advisory committee for approval of bexxar constitutes  or will constitute  infringement of a patent owned by us 
the complaint seeks available remedies under patent laws  including monetary damages and permanent injunctive relief 
all claims and counterclaims related to this lawsuit included in the memorandum agreed to by the parties on february  on july   biogen  inc  along with genzyme corporation and abbott bioresearch center  inc  filed suit against trustees of columbia university in the city of new york in the united states district court for the district of massachusetts  contending that we no longer have any obligation to pay royalties to columbia on sales of our products under a license agreement between us and columbia related to us patent nos 
  and  also referred to as the original patents  or under a newly issued patent  us patent no 
 also referred to as the patent

columbia has taken the position that we still owe it royalties under the license agreement on the basis of the patent which was issued on september   over two years after the expiration of the original patents 
in the event that we are unsuccessful in the present litigation  we may be liable for damages suffered by columbia with respect to withheld royalties and such other relief as columbia may seek and be granted by the court 
as a result of our assessment of the invalidity of the patent  we determined that it was probable that no additional amounts are payable to columbia 

table of contents along with most other major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  biogen  inc was named as a defendant in a lawsuit filed by each of the county of suffolk  new york  the county of westchester  new york  and the county of rockland  new york 
all three cases are pending in the us district court for the district of massachusetts 
the complaints allege that the defendants overstated the average wholesale price for drugs for which medicaid provides reimbursement  also referred to as covered drugs  marketed and promoted the sale of covered drugs to providers based on the providers ability to collect inflated payments from the government and medicaid beneficiaries that exceeded payments possible for competing drugs  provided financing incentives to providers to over prescribe covered drugs or to prescribe covered drugs in place of competing drugs  and overcharged medicaid for illegally inflated covered drugs reimbursements 
the complaints further allege that the defendants failed to accurately report the best price on the covered drugs to new york s medicaid program 
under medicaid  pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies agree to pay medicaid programs a rebate for each product reimbursed by medicaid 
the amount of the rebate is often the difference between the average manufacturers price and the best price reported by companies to the medicaid program 
plaintiffs claim that they were harmed because they could have allotted the dollars that they wrongfully spent on medicaid to other public needs 
plaintiffs have brought the actions under the racketeering influence and corrupt organizations act rico  and for breach of contract  unjust enrichment  unfair trade practices  medicaid fraud  common law fraud  and violation of each of the federal medicaid statute  the new york social services law and the new york department of health regulations 
in september  biogen  inc joined other named defendants in filing with the us district court for the district of massachusetts a motion to dismiss the amended suffolk county complaint 
in december  the plaintiffs withdrew the rico claims from the suffolk county case 
we intend to vigorously defend ourselves against all of the allegations and claims in these lawsuits 
as a result  an estimate of any potential loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time 
on june   prior to the effective date of the merger  a suit was filed in the superior court of california  county of san diego  on behalf of a purported class of biogen  inc stockholders against biogen  inc  idec pharmaceuticals corporation and certain members of biogen  inc s board of directors alleging  among other things  that the members of biogen  inc s board of directors breached their fiduciary duties of candor  loyalty  due care  independence  good faith and fair dealing by allegedly tailoring the structural terms of the merger to meet the specific needs of idec pharmaceuticals corporation rather than attempting to obtain the highest price reasonably available for biogen  inc an agreement in principal to resolve the suit has been reached based upon the disclosure of certain additional information in the joint proxy statement prospectus in the registration statement on form s filed by idec pharmaceuticals corporation in connection with the merger and the payment of attorneys fees in an amount to be determined by the court 
we do not expect the settlement and related attorney fees to be material 
in addition  we are involved in certain other legal proceedings generally incidental to our normal business activities 
while the outcome of any of these proceedings cannot be accurately predicted  we do not believe the ultimate resolution of any of these existing matters would have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that may affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition and bad debts  marketable securities  inventories  income taxes  impairment for intangible assets and goodwill  research and development  pensions  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents revenue recognition and accounts receivable sec staff accounting bulletin no 
or sab  superceded in part by sab  provides guidance on the recognition  presentation  and disclosure of revenue in financial statements 
sab establishes the sec s view that it is not appropriate to recognize revenue until all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  collectibility is reasonably assured  and requires that both title and the risks and rewards of ownership be transferred to the buyer before revenue can be recognized 
we believe that our revenue recognition policies are in compliance with sab revenues from product sales are recognized when product is shipped and title and risk of loss has passed to the customer 
revenues are recorded net of applicable allowances for returns  rebates and other applicable discounts and allowances 
the timing of distributor orders and shipments can cause variability in earnings 
we prepare our estimates for sales returns and allowances  discounts and rebates quarterly based primarily on historical experience updated for changes in facts and circumstances  as appropriate 
if actual future results vary  we may need to adjust our estimates  which could have an impact on earnings in the period of adjustment 
in the past  our estimates based on historical experience have not materially differed from actual results 
revenues from unconsolidated joint business arrangement consist of our share of the pretax copromotion profits generated from our copromotion arrangement with genentech  reimbursement from genentech of our rituxan related sales force and development expenses and royalties which are paid to genentech for sales of rituximab outside the us by roche and zenyaku 
under the copromotion arrangement  all us sales of rituxan and associated costs and expenses are recognized by genentech and we record our share of the pretax copromotion profits on a quarterly basis  as defined in our collaborative agreement with genentech 
pretax copromotion profits under the copromotion arrangement are derived by taking us net sales of rituxan to third party customers less cost of sales  third party royalty expenses  distribution  selling and marketing expenses and joint development expenses incurred by genentech and us 
our profit sharing formula with genentech has two tiers  we earn a higher percentage of the pretax copromotion profits at the upper tier once a fixed pretax copromotion profit level is met 
the profit sharing formula resets annually at the beginning of each year to the lower tier 
we record our royalty revenue with a one quarter lag 
in february  the fasb emerging issues task force or eitf released eitf issue no 
or eitf  accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products 
eitf states that cash consideration including a sales incentive given by a vendor to a customer is presumed to be a reduction of the selling prices of the vendor s products or services and  therefore  should be characterized as a reduction of revenue when recognized in the vendor s income statement  rather than a sales and marketing expense 
we have various contracts with distributors that provide for discounts and rebates 
these contracts are classified as a reduction of revenue 
we also maintain select customer service contracts with distributors and other customers in the distribution channel 
in accordance with eitf  we have established the fair value of these contracts and  as provided by eitf  classified these customer service contracts as sales and marketing expense 
if we had concluded that sufficient evidence of the fair value did not exist for these contracts  we would have been required to classify these costs as a reduction of revenue 
we receive royalty revenues under license agreements with a number of third parties that sell products based on technology developed by us or to which the we have rights 
the license agreements provide for the payment of royalties to us based on sales of the licensed product 
we record these revenues based on estimates of the sales that occurred during the relevant period 
the relevant period estimates of sales are based on interim data provided by licensees and analysis of historical royalties paid to us adjusted for any changes in facts and circumstances  as appropriate 
we maintain regular communication with our licensees in order to gauge the reasonableness of our estimates 
differences between actual royalty revenues and estimated royalty revenues are reconciled and adjusted for in the period which they become known  typically the following quarter 
historically  adjustments have not been material based on actual amounts paid by licensees 
there are 
table of contents no future performance obligations on our part under these license agreements 
under this policy  revenue can vary due to factors such as resolution of royalty disputes and arbitration 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required  which could affect future earnings 
biogen  inc purchase price allocation the purchase price related to the merger with biogen  inc was allocated to tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the estimated fair market values as of the acquisition date 
an independent third party valuation firm was engaged to assist in determining the fair values of in process research and development  identifiable intangible assets  inventory and certain property  plant and equipment  and in determining the useful lives of such tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired 
such a valuation requires significant estimates and assumptions including but not limited to determining the timing and expected costs to complete the in process projects  determining the product life and term of estimated future cash flows  and developing appropriate costs  expenses  depreciation and amortization assumptions  tax rates  discount rates and probability rates by project 
we believe the fair values assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on reasonable assumptions 
these assumptions are based on the best available information that we had at the time 
additionally  certain estimates for the purchase price allocation including inventory and taxes may change as subsequent information becomes available 
marketable securities as part of our strategic product development efforts  we invest in equity securities of certain biotechnology companies with which we have collaborative agreements 
statement of financial accounting standards or sfas no 
or sfas  accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  addresses the accounting for investment in marketable equity securities 
as a matter of policy  we determine on a quarterly basis whether any decline in the fair value of a marketable security is temporary or other than temporary 
unrealized gains and losses on marketable securities are included in other comprehensive income in shareholders equity  net of related tax effects 
if a decline in the fair value of a marketable security below our cost basis is determined to be other than temporary  such marketable security is written down to its estimated fair value with a charge to current earnings 
the factors that we consider in our assessments include the fair market value of the security  the duration of the security s decline  prospects for the company  including favorable clinical trial results  new product initiatives and new collaborative agreements 
any future determinations that unrealized losses are other than temporary could have an impact on earnings 
in connection with our assessment at december   million of unrealized losses related to these marketable securities were determined to be temporary 
the fair market value of these marketable securities totaled million at december  we also invest in equity securities of certain companies whose securities are not publicly traded and fair value is not readily available 
these investments are recorded using the cost method of accounting and  as a matter of policy  we monitor these investments in private securities on a quarterly basis  and determine whether any impairment in their value would require a charge to current earnings  based on the implied value from any recent rounds of financing completed by the investee  market prices of comparable public companies  and general market conditions 
at december   we included approximately million of investments in private securities in other assets 
there were no charges to current earnings in   or for impairments of these investments 
recognition of impairments for these securities may cause variability in earnings 

table of contents inventory capitalization inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined under the first in  first out fifo method 
included in inventory are raw materials used in the production of pre clinical and clinical products  which are expensed as research and development costs when consumed 
we capitalize inventory costs associated with certain products prior to regulatory approval  based on management s judgment of probable future commercialization 
we could be required to expense previously capitalized costs related to pre approval inventory upon a change in such judgment  due to  among other potential factors  a denial or delay of approval by necessary regulatory bodies 
we recognized zevalin antibodies manufactured prior to fda approval in february as research and development expenses 
we write down obsolete or otherwise unmarketable inventory to its estimated net realizable value 
if the actual realizable value is less than that estimated by us  additional inventory write downs may be required 
we wrote down million of unmarketable inventory during  which was charged to cost of product revenues and consisted of million related to avonex  million related to amevive and million related to zevalin 
avonex was written down to net realizable value when it was determined that the inventory did not meet quality specifications 
included in the avonex writedown was million in fair market value adjustments related to purchase accounting 
zevalin was written down to net realizable value due to product expiration 
income taxes income tax expense includes a provision for income tax contingencies which we believe is adequate and appropriate 
in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we estimate our income tax liability in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate by estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and financial statement purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
significant management judgment is required in assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets 
in performing this assessment  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
we consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
our estimates of future taxable income are derived from  among other items  our estimates of future deductions related to stock options 
in the event that actual results differ from our estimates or we adjust our estimates in future periods  we may need to establish a valuation allowance which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
research and development expenses research and development expenses are comprised of costs incurred in performing research and development activities including salaries and benefits  facilities costs  overhead costs  clinical trial and related clinical manufacturing costs  contract services and other outside costs 
research and development costs  including upfront fees and milestones paid to collaborators  are expensed as incurred 
the timing of upfront fees and milestone payments in the future may cause variability in future research and development expense 
clinical trial costs include costs associated with contract research organizations  or cros 
the invoicing from cros for services rendered can lag several months 
we accrue the cost of services rendered in connection with cro activities based on our estimate of management fees  site management and site monitoring costs  and data management costs 
we maintain regular communication with our cro vendors to gauge the reasonableness of our estimates 
differences between actual clinical trial costs and estimated clinical trial costs have not been material and are adjusted for in the period which they become known 
under this policy  research and development expense can vary due to accrual adjustments related to clinical trials 

table of contents contingencies and litigation there has been  and we expect there may be significant litigation in the industry regarding commercial practices  regulatory issues  pricing  and patents and other intellectual property rights 
certain adverse unfavorable rulings or decisions in the future  including in the litigation described under legal matters  could create variability or have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial position
