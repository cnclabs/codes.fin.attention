item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations except for the historical information contained herein  the following discussion contains forward looking statements that are based upon current expectations 
forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties and include statements related to our strategy  the progress of our research programs  including clinical testing  sufficiency of our cash resources  revenues from existing and new collaborations  product development  and our research and development and other expenses 
when used herein  the words believe  anticipate  expect  estimate  plan and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward looking statements 
there can be no assurance that these statements will prove to be correct 
our actual results and the timing of events could differ significantly from those discussed here 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed in risk factors  as well as those discussed elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
rigel undertakes no obligation to update any of the forward looking statements contained herein to reflect any future events or developments 
overview rigel s mission is to become a source of novel  small molecule drugs to meet large  unmet medical needs 
we have three initial development programs allergy asthma  hepatitis c and rheumatoid arthritis 
we have begun clinical testing of our first two product candidates  r for allergic rhinitis and r for hepatitis c  and plan to begin clinical trials of two additional product candidates  for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and asthma  by the end of we own the economic and commercial rights to these product candidates 
our business model is to develop a portfolio of product candidates and to take these through phase ii clinical trials  after which we intend to seek partners for completion of clinical trials  regulatory approval and marketing 
we believe that our approach to drug discovery will enable us to commence clinical trials with one to two lead compounds each year 
over the last year  we have matured into a drug development company with two product candidates in clinical trials and additional products expected to enter the clinical in following is the status of our first four product candidates 
r product candidate for allergic rhinitis 
we completed a phase i clinical trial of r in patients in december  a single dose phase i ii clinical trial of patients in june and a multi dose safety trial of patients in december we are planning to initiate in the second quarter of a phase ii clinical trial that will measure allergic symptom improvement and treatment 
we expect to receive the results of this trial in the second half of r anti hepatitis c virus product candidate 
we completed our initial phase i clinical trial of r in january in the united kingdom and the results will be part of the us ind package that we expect to file with the fda in the first quarter of we plan to commence a phase i ii clinical trial of r in the us during the second quarter of with initial results measuring viral titer reduction available in the second half of r product candidate for rheumatoid arthritis 
in january  we selected r as our lead product candidate for initial clinical trials in rheumatoid arthritis 
we expect to file an ind application with the fda for the indication of rheumatoid arthritis in the second half of product candidate for asthma 
we are evaluating a number of compound candidates in order to select a lead product candidate 
we expect to choose the lead candidate later in and anticipate initiating clinical trials in asthma late in corporate collaborations in addition to the preceding programs in which we retain all commercial and economic rights  we also carry on research and development programs in connection with our corporate collaborations 
we currently have collaborations with four major pharmaceutical companies  including one with janssen pharmaceutica nv  a division of johnson johnson  relating to oncology therapeutics and diagnostics  one with pfizer inc relating to asthma and allergy therapeutics  one with novartis pharma ag with four different programs relating to immunology  oncology and chronic bronchitis and one with daiichi pharmaceuticals co  ltd 
in the area of oncology 
these collaborations all have or had a research phase during which we receive or received funding based on the level of headcount allocated to a program 
after the research phase concludes  we are entitled to certain milestones and royalties 
currently  only the novartis oncology and chronic bronchitis programs and the daiichi program are in the research phase of the agreements 
in addition  we have a number of scientific collaborations with academic institutions and biotechnology companies under which we have in licensed technology 
we are exploring new opportunities with existing and new potential collaborators 
our earliest partnerships focused on the early stages of drug discovery  specifically on target discovery and validation  while our collaboration with johnson johnson has been expanded to also include both chemistry and compound hts 
our recent collaboration with daiichi focuses on drug discovery and development 
we currently anticipate that in order to support our current research programs we will need to self fund  at an increased rate of spending  our own research programs to later stages of development prior to partnering with collaborative partners 
therefore  it is expected that future collaborative partnerships may have an expanded focus and could include hts  combinatorial and medicinal chemistry  preclinical evaluations and or clinical development 
for some programs  we may also seek to enter into collaborations for the development of compounds that we have discovered 
for example  we have received preliminary human efficacy data for our lead compound r  for the treatment of allergic rhinitis 
we expect that this program could be the focus of our next corporate collaboration which we anticipate arranging in recent developments on june   we effected a one for nine reverse stock split of our outstanding common stock after our stockholders approved the proposal for a reverse split at our annual meeting of stockholders held on june  immediately following the reverse split  we had a total of  shares of common stock outstanding 
on june   we completed a private placement with net proceeds of million led by mpm capital that included frazier healthcare  alta partners and hbm bioventures 
in the private placement  we issued  shares of our common stock at a price of per share and warrants to purchase an additional  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share 
as a result of their then combined approximate ownership without giving effect to the exercise of the warrants and based on  shares outstanding as of june   the investors obtained control over rigel 
on june   we initiated a rights offering pursuant to which non transferable rights to purchase up to an aggregate of  shares of our common stock at a purchase price of per share were offered to our stockholders of record as of april   other than certain stockholders affiliated with the investors in the private placement completed on june  each such stockholder of record received one basic subscription right to purchase of a share of rigel common stock at per share for each share owned as of the record date 
by july   the expiration of the rights offering period  our stockholders had elected to purchase an aggregate of million shares of our common stock for net proceeds to us of million 
the purchased shares were issued to the participating stockholders on july  on june  we initiated an offer to exchange options  which was approved by our stockholders at our annual meeting on june   to purchase shares of our common stock with exercise prices equal to or greater than per share currently outstanding under our equity incentive plan  or plan  non officer equity incentive plan and non employee directors stock option plan  for replacement options to purchase shares of our common stock to be granted under the plan 
there were outstanding eligible options to purchase an aggregate of  shares of our common stock as of june  only officers  employees not on certain leaves of absence  consultants and non employee members of rigel s board of directors as of june   who continued to be employed through the offer expiration date of july   were eligible to participate in the offer 
we offered to conduct the exchange with respect to eligible options on a one for one basis 
on july   we accepted for cancellation options to purchase an aggregate of  shares of our common stock 
on july   we granted replacement options to purchase an aggregate of  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share  the fair market value on the date of grant 
subject to the continuation of the optionholders employment  service as a consultant or service as a non employee member of our board of directors  the replacement options will vest as follows one fifth of the shares covered by the replacement options will vest on the six month anniversary of the date of grant  one fifth of the shares covered by the replacement options will vest on the twelve month anniversary of the date of grant  and three fifths of the shares covered by the replacement options will vest in equal monthly installments over the following two years 
the replacement options will expire  at the latest  on the day three years and five business days after the date of grant if they have not been forfeited earlier due to the optionholders termination of employment  service as a consultant or service as a non employee member of our board of directors 
all replacement options  as well as the eligible options that were not surrendered under the original offer to exchange  are being treated for financial reporting purposes as variable awards 
therefore  we are recording a non cash charge  generally for the intrinsic value of the options  reflecting increases and decreases down to  but not below  the exercise price in the price of our common stock  as compensation expense in connection with the replacement options and the eligible options that were not exchanged 
we will continue to reflect increases and decreases in the price of our common stock in our statement of operations with respect to these options until they are exercised  forfeited or terminated 
the higher the market value of our common stock  the greater the compensation expense 
for the year ended december   we recorded a non cash compensation charge of million related to all options eligible for the replacement 
on february   we completed a follow on offering in which we sold  shares and selling stockholders sold  shares of our common stock at a price of per share 
we received net proceeds of approximately  from the sale of shares offered by us  net of underwriting discounts and commissions and related expenses 
we did not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares by the selling stockholders 
critical accounting policies and the use of estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to terms of the research collaborations  investments  stock compensation  impairment issues  the estimated useful life of assets and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
we believe that there have been no significant changes in our critical accounting policies during the year ended december  as compared to those previously disclosed in our annual report on form k  as amended  for the year ended december  revenue recognition non refundable  up front payments received in connection with research and development collaboration agreements  including technology access fees  are deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the relevant periods of continuing involvement  generally the research term 
revenues related to collaborative research with our corporate collaborators are recognized as research services are performed over the related funding periods for each contract 
under these agreements  we are required to perform research and development activities as specified in each respective agreement 
the payments received are not refundable and are generally based on a contractual cost per full time equivalent employee working on the project 
research and development expenses under the collaborative research agreements approximate or exceed the revenue recognized under such agreements over the term of the respective agreements 
deferred revenue may result if we were not to incur the required level of effort during a specific period in comparison to funds received under the respective contracts 
milestones are recognized pursuant to collaborative agreements upon the achievement of these specified at risk milestones 
royalties will be recognized as earned in accordance with the contract terms when the third party results are reliably measurable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
stock based compensation we recorded no deferred stock compensation with respect to options granted to employees for the years ended december  and we recorded deferred stock compensation with respect to options granted to employees of approximately million in the year ended december   representing the difference between the fair value of our common stock for financial reporting purposes on the date these options were granted and the exercise price 
these amounts have been reflected as components of stockholders equity  and the deferred expense is being amortized to operations over the vesting period of the options  generally four to five years  using the graded vesting method 
as a result of our reduction in force on january   we recognized approximately  of stock based compensation recovery associated with the unvested and cancelled options of the terminated employees that had previously been recognized under the graded vesting method of deferred compensation amortization 
we amortized deferred stock compensation of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
at december   we had a total of million remaining to be amortized over the remaining vesting periods of the stock options 
in addition to the amortization of the deferred stock compensation  we also record charges associated with the stock options eligible for repricing under the tender offer initiated on june  all replacement options  as well as the eligible options that were not surrendered under the original offer to exchange  are being treated for financial reporting purposes as variable awards 
therefore  we are recording a non cash charge  generally for the intrinsic value of the options reflecting increases and decreases down to  but not below  the exercise price in the price of our common stock as compensation expense in connection with the replacement options and the eligible options that were not exchanged 
we will continue to reflect increases and decreases in the price of our common stock in our statement of operations with respect to these options until they are exercised  forfeited or terminated 
the higher the market value of our common stock  the greater the compensation expense 
for the year ended december   we recorded a non cash compensation charge of million related to all options eligible for the replacement 
we also record charges associated with options granted to consultants reflecting the periodic revaluation of outstanding unvested consultant options based upon the current market value of our common stock and other assumptions  including the expected future volatility of our stock price 
we recognized stock based compensation for revaluation of consultant options of million for the year ended december  we recognized stock based compensation recovery for revaluation of consultant options of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
even though the number of unvested outstanding options issued to consultants continues to decline  we expect to see continued fluctuations in the future as a portion of these options are revalued based on the changes in current market price of our common stock through the application of the graded vesting method 
years ended december   and aggregate change years ended december  from from in thousands contract revenues from collaborations    revenues by collaborator were aggregate change years ended december  from from in thousands daiichi   novartis      johnson johnson     pfizer   total     revenues 
contract revenues from collaborations in  and consisted primarily of research support and amortization of upfront fees from the continuation of our collaborations with pfizer  johnson johnson  novartis and  in and only  daiichi 
revenues in all years also included milestone payments from certain collaborators for targets delivered and accepted 
the decrease in revenues of million was primarily due to the termination of the research phase of the novartis t cell and b cell programs offset by a million milestone payment from daiichi for the completion of a certain screening phase of the collaboration 
revenue was flat in as compared to primarily due to a combination of the end of the research phase of the pfizer collaboration  offset by a full year of the angiogenesis program with novartis and the commencement of the collaboration with daiichi 
currently  only the novartis oncology program and the daiichi program are in the research phase of their agreements  and novartis and daiichi are obligated to pay us approximately million in research funding for we expect contract revenues from collaborations to be a significant component of our total revenues for the foreseeable future 
aggregate change years ended december  from from in thousands research and development expenses    research and development 
even though research and development expenses were essentially flat from to  there was a change in the mix of the respective costs 
in  there was a substantial increase in our facility costs associated with the move to our new building in february offset by reductions in contract chemistry  lab supplies  research headcount and costs associated with our intellectual property 
our clinical and preclinical costs increased as we continued to move our three development programs forward 
the increase in of million reflected primarily the continued expansion of our drug development infrastructure  the addition of both drug development and research headcount  increased outside contract efforts  increased preclinical activities  and the commencement of clinical trials 
we expect our preclinical and clinical costs to increase substantially in as we plan to initiate a phase ii clinical trial for r  a phase i ii clinical trial for r  a clinical trial for r and a clinical trial for a lead candidate from our asthma program 
the scope and magnitude of future research and development expenses are difficult to predict at this time given the number of studies that will need to be conducted for any of our potential products as well as our limited capital resources 
in general  biopharmaceutical development involves a series of steps beginning with identification of a potential target and including  among others  proof of concept in animals and phase i  ii and iii clinical studies in humans each of which is typically more expensive than the previous step 
success in development therefore results in increasing expenditures 
our research and development expenditures currently include costs for scientific personnel  supplies  equipment  consultants  patent filings  sponsored research  allocated facility costs and costs related to clinical trials 
because of the number of research projects we have ongoing at any one time  and the ability to utilize resources across several projects  the majority of our research and development costs are not directly tied to any individual project and are allocated among multiple projects 
our project management is based primarily on scientific data and supplemented by these cost allocations  which are based primarily on human resource time incurred on each project 
as a result the costs allocated to a project do not necessarily reflect the actual costs of the project 
accordingly  we do not maintain actual cost incurred information for our projects on a project by project basis 
aggregate change years ended december  from from in thousands general and administrative expenses    general and administrative expenses 
the decrease in general and administrative expenses of million in was primarily attributable to a reduction in employee costs as a result of cost cutting measures that were initiated in september and january offset by higher facility costs 
the increase in of million was primarily attributable to higher employee costs and greater infrastructure costs to support the growing research and development activities 
we expect that general and administrative expenses will increase modestly in to support growing clinical development activities 
years ended december  aggregate change from from in thousands loss on sale of property and equipment loss on sale of property and equipment 
in conjunction with our move to our new facilities in february  we sold to the new tenant of our previous facility certain furniture and equipment that would no longer be needed at our new location 
this sale resulted in cash proceeds of approximately  and a loss on sale of  the loss represents the remaining net book value of those assets less the cash received on the sale 
aggregate change years ended december  from from in thousands net interest expense income   net interest expense 
interest income results from our interest bearing cash and investment balances  whereas interest expense is the result of our capital lease obligations associated with fixed asset purchases 
in and  interest expense exceeded interest income due primarily to a reduction in interest rates on our owned securities 
in  interest income exceeded interest expense due to higher interest rates earned on investment balances 
effect of new accounting standards in november of  the financial accounting standards board issued emerging issues task force referred to as eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
eitf issue no 
addresses certain aspects of the accounting by a company for arrangements under which it will perform multiple revenue generating activities 
eitf issue no 
addresses when and how an arrangement involving multiple deliverables should be divided into separate units of accounting 
eitf issue no 
provides guidance with respect to the effect of certain customer rights due to company nonperformance on the recognition of revenue allocated to delivered units of accounting 
eitf issue no 
also addresses the impact on the measurement and or allocation of arrangement consideration of customer cancellation provisions and consideration that varies as a result of future actions of the customer or the company 
finally  eitf issue no 
provides guidance with respect to the recognition of the cost of certain deliverables that are excluded from the revenue accounting for an arrangement 
the provisions of eitf issue no 
were applied to revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june  our adoption of the recognition requirements in july of of eitf issue no 
did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in january  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued interpretation no 
 or fin  consolidation of variable interest entities 
fin requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity s activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns or both 
a variable interest entity is a corporation  partnership  trust or any other legal structure used for business purposes that either a does not have equity investors with voting rights or b has equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities 
a variable interest entity often holds financial assets  including loans or receivables  real estate or other property 
a variable interest entity may be essentially passive or it may engage in research and development or other activities on behalf of another company 
however  the fasb deferred the effective date for variable interest entities created before february  to the period ending march  for calendar year end companies 
certain of the disclosure requirements apply to all financial statements issued after january   regardless of when the variable interest entity was established 
our adoption of the initial requirements in january of did not have an impact on our financial position and results of operations 
the adoption of the remaining requirements of fin on january  is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in may  the fasb issued statements of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity fas 
fas establishes standards for the classification and measurement of financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
fas is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may  except for certain mandatorily redeemable financial instruments for which the fasb announced on november  deferred effective dates for certain provisions of fas the adoption of fas and the subsequent deferred effective dates did not and are not expected to have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
liquidity and capital resources cash requirements we have financed our operations from inception primarily through sales of equity securities  contract payments payable to us under our collaboration agreements and equipment financing arrangements 
we believe that our existing capital resources  including the net proceeds to us from the recently completed offering in february of our common stock and anticipated proceeds from current and future collaborations  will be sufficient to support our current operating plan through the second quarter of our operations will require significant additional funding in large part due to our research and development expenses  future preclinical and clinical testing costs  the expansion of our facilities and the absence of any meaningful revenues for the foreseeable future 
the amount of future funds needed will depend largely on the success of our collaborations and our research activities  and we do not know whether additional financing will be available when needed  or that  if available  we will obtain financing on terms favorable to our stockholders or us 
we have consumed substantial amounts of capital to date  and operating expenditures are expected to increase over the next several years as we expand our research and development activities 
to the extent we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities  our stockholders would at that time experience substantial dilution 
to the extent that we raise additional funds through collaboration and licensing arrangements  we may be required to relinquish some rights to our technologies or product candidates  or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us 
our future funding requirements will depend upon many factors  including  but not limited to the progress and scope of research programs carried out at rigel  our ability to establish new collaborations and to maintain our existing collaboration partnerships  the progress of the research and development efforts of our collaborators  our ability to meet the milestones identified in our collaborative agreements that trigger payments  our ability to maintain and establish new corporate relationships and research collaborations  the progress and success of preclinical studies and clinical trials of our product candidates conducted by us or our collaborative partners or licensees  our ability to acquire or license other technologies or compounds that we seek to pursue  any changes in the breadth of our research and development programs  our ability to manage our growth  competing technological and market developments  the costs and timing of obtaining  enforcing and defending our patent and intellectual rights  the costs and timing of regulatory approvals  and expenses associated with unforeseen litigation 
insufficient funds may require us to delay  scale back or eliminate some or all of our research or development programs  to lose rights under existing licenses or to relinquish greater or all rights to product candidates at an earlier stage of development or on less favorable terms than we would otherwise choose or may adversely affect our ability to operate as a going concern 
as of december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities  as compared to million as of december   an increase of million 
the increase was attributable to net proceeds of million  after deducting offering costs  from the sale of  shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock to mpm capital  frazier healthcare  alta partners and hbm bioventures in a private placement completed in june  as well as net proceeds of million  after deducting offering costs  from the sale of  shares of our common stock to certain stockholders in a rights offering completed in july on february   we completed a follow on offering in which we sold  shares of our common stock at a price of per share  in which we received net proceeds of approximately  net of underwriting discounts and commissions and related expenses 
we also invested million in capital equipment and made debt service payments of million in conjunction with our equipment financing arrangements 
these payments were offset by million of proceeds from a lease financing and million from a cash advance from our landlord 
for the three and nine months ended september  and  we maintained an investment portfolio primarily in depository accounts and corporate commercial paper 
cash in excess of immediate requirements is invested with regard to liquidity and capital preservation 
wherever possible  we seek to minimize the potential effects of concentration and degrees of risk 
as of december   we had million in capital lease obligations associated with our financed purchase of equipment and leasehold improvements 
all existing equipment financing agreements as of december  are secured by the equipment financed  bear interest rates in a range of to and are due in monthly installments through on march   we amended an equipment lease agreement to allow for the buyout provision to be paid over a period of months rather than in a lump sum 
the buyout provision of this amendment relates to approximately million of original equipment and tenant improvement purchases 
as a result of this amendment  we were committed to an additional  of payments through january as of december   we had approximately  remaining to be paid on this commitment 
as of december   we had a total of million available for draw down under all financing agreements 
during  our office and research facility located at east grand in south san francisco was leased under an operating lease that terminated in conjunction with a year lease  signed in may  for our current office and research facilities located at veterans blvd 
in south san francisco 
under the terms of the lease signed in  we were to occupy our new facilities in late and were to concurrently terminate the lease of our former facility at east grand in south san francisco 
we determined that the lease for our current facility was an operating lease in accordance with fas in connection with the termination of the current east grand lease  we accelerated the amortization of tenant improvements and accrued rent charges over the expected remaining life of the lease and incurred minimal costs in connection with the terminated lease 
the veterans blvd 
research and office facilities were constructed as a build to suit facility 
under the original lease for this new facility  we were obligated to fund approximately million of the total tenant improvements 
in october  we amended this original lease to provide for a delay of the rent commencement date until february  and an increase in the tenant improvement allowance from the lessor to cover all of the expected remaining construction obligations on the facility 
the lease was also amended to increase the future rental commitments to compensate for the delay of the rent commencement and the increase in the tenant improvement allowance 
since the amendment was considered a material change to the original lease  we reviewed the accounting treatment for this amended lease and again determined the lease to be an operating lease 
we moved into the new facility during february prior to the signing of the amendment  we had been directly paying a portion of the pre construction and construction costs related to tenant improvements in the new facility 
these costs were being capitalized on our balance sheet as construction in progress 
per the terms of the amendment  we estimated that the landlord would be responsible for reimbursing to us all of the costs that we had previously capitalized 
therefore  we reclassified these costs into a short term asset receivable from landlord in our financial statements 
the amount outstanding as of december  has been fully paid in we continue to incur minor costs associated with the new facility that we expect to recover from the landlord 
the following are our contractual commitments by fiscal year as of december  associated with debt obligations and lease obligations total in thousands capital leases    facilities leases      total      on january   we implemented a restructuring plan to reduce the rate of our cash consumption and better align our operating structure with current and expected future economic conditions 
the restructuring plan included an immediate reduction in force of approximately percent  or employees  to employees with reductions occurring in all functional areas 
two of our officers were included in this reduction in force 
we also deferred a portion of certain officers salaries 
as of december   we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million to offset future taxable income 
we also had federal research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately million 
if not utilized  net operating loss and credit carryforwards will begin to expire in utilization of the net operating losses and credits may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to ownership change limitations provided by the internal revenue code of the annual limitation may result in the expiration of our net operating losses and credits before they can be used 
you should read note of the notes to our financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities in which we invest may have market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the fair value amount of the investment to fluctuate 
for example  if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the then prevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises  the market value amount of our investment will decline 
to minimize this risk in the future  we intend to maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  including commercial paper  money market funds and government and non government debt securities 
in  and  we maintained an investment portfolio primarily in depository accounts and corporate commercial paper 
due to the short term nature of these investments  we believe we do not have a material exposure to interest rate risk arising from our investments 
therefore  no quantitative tabular disclosure is provided 
we have operated primarily in the united states  and all funding activities with our collaborators to date have been made in us dollars 
accordingly  we have not had any exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations
