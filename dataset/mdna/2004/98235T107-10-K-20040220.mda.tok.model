executive summary company description 
we are a global orthopaedic medical device company specializing in the design  manufacture and marketing of reconstructive joint devices and biologics products 
reconstructive joint devices are used to replace knee  hip and other joints that have deteriorated through disease or injury 
biologics are used to replace damaged or diseased bone  to stimulate bone growth  and to provide other biological solutions for surgeons and their patients 
we have been in business for over fifty years and have built a well known and respected brand name and strong relationships with orthopaedic surgeons 
our corporate headquarters and us operations are located in arlington  tennessee  where we conduct our domestic manufacturing  warehousing  research and administrative activities 
outside the us  we operate manufacturing and administrative facilities in toulon  france  research  distribution and administrative facilities in milan  italy and sales and distribution offices in canada  japan and across europe 
our global distribution system consists of a sales force of approximately individuals that market our products to orthopaedic surgeons and hospitals 
we have approximately exclusive independent distributors and sales associates in the us  and approximately sales representatives internationally who are employed through a combination of our stocking distribution partners and direct sales offices 
in recent history  we have had several significant developments  including the following on december   an investment group led by warburg  pincus equity partners  lp warburg acquired majority ownership of our predecessor company  wright medical technology  inc  in a transaction that recapitalized our business 
on december   we acquired cremascoli ortho holding  sa cremascoli  an orthopaedic device company based in toulon  france 

table of contents on july   we completed our initial public offering ipo  issuing  shares of voting common stock at per share  the net proceeds of which were million after deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses 
on march   we  along with certain selling stockholders  completed a secondary offering of  shares  including the over allotment option of  shares  of voting common stock at per share 
of the  shares  we offered  shares in the secondary offering  the net proceeds of which were million  after deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses 
principle products and significant business trends 
our net sales primarily include sales of reconstructive joint devices and biologics products 
our reconstructive joint device net sales are derived from three primary product lines knees  hips and extremities 
our biologics sales encompass sales of products designed to stimulate and augment the natural regenerative capabilities of the human body 
additionally  we generate other net sales from various orthopaedic products not considered to be part of our knee  hip  extremity or biologics product lines 
during  our business experienced significant growth 
net sales in increased to million  compared to million in  representing growth of 
our biologics and extremity product lines  which have been significant contributors to our growth since our december reorganization  continued to contribute during additionally  in we experienced significant growth in our hip product line as a result of several new product introductions 
our biologics products focus on biological musculoskeletal repair and include synthetic and human tissue based materials 
our principle biologics products include our allomatrix line of injectable tissue based bone graft substitutes  our osteoset synthetic bone graft substitute  our miig family of minimally invasive injectable synthetic bone grafts  our graftjacket tissue repair and containment membranes  and in our international markets  our adcon gel anti adhesion product 
our biologics business grew in in  within biologics  we will be focusing on two key regulatory initiatives 
in  the fda officially notified us that our allomatrix line of products should be reviewed and regulated under the medical device premarket notification provisions 
in response  we promptly filed a k premarket notification for these products 
the fda has exercised enforcement discretion during the review process  and therefore our allomatrix line continues to be marketed and sold in the us while we work toward ultimate approval 
in the fourth quarter of  we submitted the final module of our premarket approval pma application for adcon gel to the fda 
we are currently awaiting the fda s review and response to that submission 
our adcon gel product is not currently available on the us market 
we offer extremity products for the hand  wrist  elbow  shoulder  foot and ankle in a number of markets worldwide 
our principle extremity products include the swanson line of finger and toe joint replacement products  the orthosphere carpometacarpal implant for repair of the basal thumb joint  the evolve modular radial head device  the locon t distal radius plating system  and a comprehensive system of foot and ankle implants 
we experienced sales growth of in in the extremities product line  principally the result of the continued success of our evolve modular radial head device and our foot and ankle products and pricing increases across our extremity product offerings 
we anticipate that evolve  along with our foot and ankle products  will be the growth drivers of our extremity business in our hip joint reconstruction product portfolio provides offerings in the areas of bone conserving implants  total hip reconstruction  revision replacement implants  and limb preservation 
our hip joint products include the conserve family of products  the lineage acetabular system  the perfecta hip system  the profemur modular hip system  and the anca fit hip system 
in early  the fda granted us approval to market our ceramic on ceramic bearing as part of the lineage acetabular system  placing us among the first companies to market ceramic on ceramic total hip solutions in the us our hip product line  which offers surgeons low wear ceramic on ceramic and metal on metal bearing surfaces  large diameter heads and our innovative modular necks  led to the growth in our hip business in we anticipate additional competition in ceramic on ceramic hip market in  however  we believe that our position as one of the few early entrants into this market  combined with our full continuum of successful hip products  will position us for continued 
table of contents success in our conserve plus resurfacing implant is available outside the us and is pending fda clearance for the us market 
with conserve plus  the surface of the patient s femoral head and the acetabular surface are replaced with minimal bone loss in a minimally invasive procedure 
our knee reconstruction products position us well in the areas of total knee reconstruction  revision replacement implants  and limb preservation products 
our principle knee products include the advance knee system  and the advance unicompartmental knee system 
our knee business was impacted in late when we transitioned certain domestic distributorships that did not fit with our long term objectives or business philosophies 
due to these transitions  was a challenging year in the domestic marketplace for our knee products 
however  we steadily improved our domestic knee growth rate throughout  bringing our overall worldwide growth rate to for the year 
we anticipate that our newer products and the continued favorable impact of our distributor changes will enable us to experience overall growth rates in our knee business during that are consistent with the market s overall procedure rate of growth 
significant industry factors 
our industry is impacted by numerous competitive  regulatory and other significant factors 
the growth of our business relies on our ability to continue to develop new products and innovative technologies  obtain regulatory clearance and compliance for our products  protect the proprietary technology of our products and our manufacturing processes  manufacture our products cost effectively  and successfully market and distribute our products in a profitable manner 
we  and the entire industry  are subject to extensive government regulation  primarily by the fda 
failure to comply with regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business 
additionally  our industry is highly competitive and our success is dependent on our ability to compete successfully against our competitors 
we devote significant resources to assessing and analyzing competitive  regulatory and economic risks and opportunities 
a detailed discussion of these and other factors is provided in the factors affecting future operating results section of our md a 
net sales and expense components net sales 
we derive our net sales primarily from the sale of reconstructive joint devices and biologics products 
an overview of our principle product lines and significant trends in our business is provided in the executive summary section of our md a 
cost of sales 
our cost of sales consists primarily of direct labor  allocated manufacturing overhead  raw materials and components  royalty expenses associated with licensing technologies used in our products or processes and certain other period expenses 
selling  general and administrative 
our selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries  sales commissions  royalty and consulting expenses associated with our medical advisors  marketing costs  facility costs  other general business and administrative expenses  and depreciation expense associated with surgical instruments that we loan to surgeons to use when implanting our products 
research and development 
research and development expense includes costs associated with the design  development  testing  deployment  enhancement and regulatory approval of our products 
amortization of intangible assets 
our intangible assets consist of purchased intangibles principally related to completed technology  distribution channels and trademarks primarily resulting from our acquisition of cremascoli 
we amortize intangible assets over periods ranging from months to years 
stock based expense 
we incur stock based expenses as a result of the amortization of non cash deferred compensation that is recorded in accordance with accounting principles board apb opinion no 
this deferred compensation resulted following the issuance of stock options to employees and the sale of equity securities when the estimated fair value of the securities was deemed  for financial reporting purposes  to have exceed their respective exercise or sales price 
additionally  for stock based incentives granted to consultants  we defer and amortize the fair value of such grants as calculated pursuant to sfas no 
deferred compensation is amortized on a straight line basis over the respective vesting periods of the stock based incentives  which is generally four years  and we immediately expense all stock based compensation associated with the issuance of 
table of contents equity where no vesting restrictions apply 
the substantial majority of our stock based expense relates to the issuance of shares and options prior to the completion of our ipo in july prior to our ipo  we generated approximately million of deferred stock based compensation related to stock grants  stock option grants and the sale of preferred stock to employees 
interest expense  net 
interest expense  net consists primarily of interest associated with borrowings outstanding under our senior credit facilities as well as non cash expenses associated with the amortization of deferred financing costs resulting from the origination of our senior credit facilities 
these expenses are offset by income earned on our invested cash balances 
other income expense  net 
other income expense consists primarily of net gains and losses resulting from foreign currency fluctuations 
provision for income taxes 
we record tax provisions for income taxes on earnings generated by both our domestic and international operations 
historically  our effective tax rates have varied from our statutory tax rates primarily due to research and development credits and changes to our valuation allowance and prior to  nondeductible goodwill amortization 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  our results of operations expressed as dollar amounts in thousands and as percentages of net sales year ended december  of of of amount sales amount sales amount sales net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses selling  general and administrative research and development amortization of intangible assets stock based expense acquired in process research and development costs arbitration settlement award total operating expenses income from operations interest expense  net other income expense  net income before income tax provision for income taxes net income loss 
table of contents comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december  net sales 
the following table sets forth our net sales by product line for the periods indicated expressed as dollar amounts year ended december  in thousands knee products hip products biologics products extremity products other total net sales the following graphs illustrate our product line sales as a percentage of total net sales for   and product sales as a percentage of total net sales pie chart pie chart pie chart our net sales growth in was attributable to the continued success of our biologics and extremity product lines  as well as significant growth in our hip product line 
geographically  our domestic net sales totaled million in and million in  representing of total net sales in both years and growth of 
our international sales totaled million in  increasing by over sales of million in our international sales include a favorable currency impact of approximately million  principally resulting from the performance of the euro against the us dollar 
our european and japanese operations continue to be the significant drivers of our sales growth in our international operations 
from a product line perspective  we experienced sales growth across all product lines in for  our hip product sales totaled million  representing a increase 
this increase is primarily attributable to demand for our higher priced conserve total implant with bfh technology  as well as our lineage acetabular system and our profemur stem products  both of which were positively influenced by the launch of our 
table of contents lineage ceramic on ceramic hip system in the first quarter additionally  continued growth in sales of our perfecta hip system and growth of our anca fit hip system  which is sold in our international markets  contributed to our hip performance in sales in of our biologics products totaled million  representing a year over year increase of 
our increase in net sales of biologics products was attributable to growth in all of our biologics product offerings 
for  we experienced the benefit of a full year of sales of our graftjacket tissue repair and containment membranes  which were introduced in the third quarter of additionally  sales growth of our osteoset resorbable bead kits  our miig minimally invasive injectable graft family of products  and the growth of our allomatrix line of bone graft substitutes led to increased biologics performance in international sales of our adcon gel products  which we began selling in certain international markets in the second quarter of  further contributed to our biologics performance in our extremity product sales increased to million in  representing growth of over increased sales of our higher priced extremity products  such as our evolve modular radial head system and our foot and ankle products  as well as pricing increases across our extremity product offerings  were the most significant factors contributing to our year over year growth 
sales of our knee products totaled million in  representing growth of 
our knee performance improved steadily throughout we attribute this increase to growth experienced by our advance knee product line and the favorable impact of changes in our domestic distribution network 
these increases were partially offset by decreased sales of certain of our more mature knee products  primarily our advantim knee line 
cost of sales 
cost of sales as a percentage of net sales decreased slightly to in this decrease is primarily a result of our ability to manage certain of our fixed manufacturing costs while our business significantly expanded during our cost of sales and corresponding gross profit percentages can be expected to fluctuate in future periods depending upon changes in our product sales mix and prices  distribution channels and geographies  manufacturing yields  period expenses and levels of production volume 
selling  general and administrative 
as a percentage of net sales  our selling  general and administrative expenses decreased by percentage points from in to 
within selling  general and administrative expenses  our expenses for sales commissions remained relatively flat versus prior year as a percentage of net sales 
in  we experienced increases in our royalty expenses as a percentage of sales  however  royalty expense includes the favorable impact of the resolution of a royalty matter of approximately  excluding this favorable benefit  year over year royalty expense  as a percentage of net sales remained constant 
on an overall basis  our reduction in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales was a result of our ability to control discretionary spending associated with those expenses  while significantly growing our business 
the benefits we realized from controlling spending despite our sales growth were partially offset by increases in product liability insurance expense 
product liability insurance costs have increased significantly in the past two years on an industry wide basis 
we anticipate that our selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales will continue to decrease in future periods as we control the growth of our existing infrastructure while continuing to expand our business 
however  these expenses will increase in absolute dollars to the extent that any additional growth in net sales results in increases in sales commissions and royalty expense associated with those sales and requires us to expand our infrastructure 
research and development 
our level of investment in research and development activities  as a percentage of net sales  increased by percentage points to in the overall profitability of our business in enabled us to increase our investment in research and development activities 
the increase in expense was attributable to heightened levels of clinical evaluations for pre market products and products already on the market  and continued investments in development opportunities for possible future products 
our key product launches in included our ceramic on ceramic bearing for use in our lineage acetabular system  our miig x high strength injectable graft  our cellplex tcp synthetic cancellous bone repair matrix and our graftjacket matrix for ulcer repair 

table of contents for  we anticipate that our research and development expenditures as a percentage of net sales will increase to approximately 
as our business continues to grow  we expect our research and development expenditures to increase in absolute dollars and potentially as a percentage of sales as we continue to increase our investment in product development initiatives and clinical studies 
amortization of intangible assets 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  effective january   we ceased amortizing goodwill and instead evaluate it at least annually for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
we performed our annual evaluation of goodwill for impairment during the fourth quarter of and determined that no impairment charges related to our recorded goodwill were required 
based on the intangible assets held at december   we expect to amortize approximately million in  million in and  million in and million in stock based expense 
we recognized million and million of stock based expense during and  respectively  resulting from the amortization of our deferred compensation 
based upon the stock based awards outstanding at december   we expect to recognize stock based expense totaling million in   in   in and a minimal amount in in process research and development cost 
upon consummation of the acquisition of certain adcon gel technology assets from gliatech inc gliatech  in march  we immediately recognized as expense approximately million representing the estimated fair value of purchased in process research and development iprd that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use see note to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
the value was determined by estimating the costs to develop the purchased in process research and development into commercially viable products  estimating the resulting net cash flows from this project  and discounting the net cash flows back to their present values 
an additional discount was applied to the project to take into account the uncertainty surrounding the successful development and commercialization of the purchased in process research and development 
the resulting net cash flows from the project were based on our management s best estimates of revenue  cost of sales  research and development costs  selling  general and administrative costs  and income taxes from the project 
a summary of the estimates used to calculate the net cash flows for the project is as follows year net cash in flows discount rate including expected factor to account for project to begin uncertainty of success acquired iprd adcon gel the adcon gel products are designed to reduce adhesion formation following lumbar spine adcon l gel and peripheral tendon nerve adcon t n gel procedures  thus reducing or eliminating post operative pain 
both adcon l gel and adcon t n gel are commercially available internationally  but are currently not available for sale in the us the adcon l gel product had previously received regulatory clearance from the fda in mid in december  the fda determined that the provisions of the fda application integrity policy aip would be applied to gliatech due to violations of good clinical practices in the conduct  analysis  and reporting of data specific to the us clinical study of adcon l gel 
in early  the fda lifted the aip status of gliatech  which subsequently allowed us  as the new owner of the technology  to present the fda with clinical data intended to support the return of adcon l gel to the us market 
the third and final module of our pma application related to adcon l gel was submitted to the fda in december of we are currently awaiting the fda s review and response to that submission 
we will be required to conduct a separate clinical study to enter the us market with adcon t n gel 

table of contents we anticipate that portions of our existing cash will be used to develop the purchased in process research and development into commercially viable products 
this development consists primarily of the completion of all clinical evaluation testing activities and regulatory approvals that are necessary to establish the safety and efficacy of the product and to market it in the us bringing the purchased in process research and development to market also includes testing the products for compatibility and interoperability with commercially viable products 
due to the history of the adcon gel products with the fda  we are unable to estimate the extent of research and development activities that will be necessary to develop these products into commercially viable products 
for adcon l gel  based on the timing of the submission of our pma application  we anticipate that adcon l gel will be available for sale in the us market no sooner than the second half of we expect to pursue necessary clinical studies to allow fda approval for additional applications outside of the spine  such as the peripheral tendon nerve 
we are unable to estimate at this time when such additional fda approvals would occur 
we are continuously monitoring our development projects 
we believe that the assumptions used in the valuation of purchased in process research and development represent a reasonably reliable estimate of the future benefits attributable to the purchased in process research and development 
no assurance can be given that actual results will not deviate from those assumptions in future periods 
interest expense  net 
as outlined in our net sales and expense components section of md a  interest expense  net consists primarily of interest associated with borrowings outstanding under our senior credit facilities 
interest expense is partially offset by interest income generated on our invested cash balances of approximately  and  in and  respectively 
our net interest expense includes non cash expense associated with the amortization of deferred financing costs resulting from the origination of our senior credit facilities of  during both and other income expense  net 
as noted above  our other income expense consists of net gains resulting from foreign currency fluctuations totaling million and million in and  respectively  partially offset by other non operating expenses 
we expect other income and expense to fluctuate in future periods depending upon our relative exposures to foreign currency risk and ultimate fluctuations in exchange rates 
provision for income taxes 
our effective tax rate for was approximately as compared to an effective tax rate of for prior to  we provided a valuation allowance against all of our net deferred tax assets for us income tax purposes and a portion of our net deferred tax assets for foreign tax purposes  because  given our prior history of operating losses  the realizability of those assets was uncertain 
during  our sustained history of profitability and the reduced debt burden following our july ipo  made the realization of certain deferred tax assets more likely than not  and we consequently reversed a significant portion of our valuation allowance against such net deferred tax assets for us income tax purposes 
this reduction resulted in an million non cash benefit to our provision for income taxes recorded in excluding this benefit  our effective tax rate for would have been approximately 
we estimate that our combined applicable statutory rates were approximately during both and excluding the benefit from the reduction of our valuation allowance in  the decrease in our effective tax rate on a year over year basis  reflects the effect of certain tax saving initiatives implemented in for  we expect our effective tax rate to increase from our level to a range of to  absent any incremental tax saving opportunities that might be identified and implemented 
at december   we have net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million domestically  which expire in through  and million internationally  which expire in through additionally  we have domestic general business credit carryforwards for approximately million  which expire in through  and alternative minimum tax credits which do not expire 
our us federal net operating loss carryforwards are subject to certain annual limitations  and due to these limitations  some of our net operating losses may expire unused 
the valuation allowance remaining at december  is for a portion of our deferred tax assets for us income tax purposes and a portion of our deferred tax assets for foreign income tax purposes 
we will continue to reassess the realization of the remainder of our deferred tax assets and adjust the related valuation allowance as necessary 

table of contents comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december  net sales 
our net sales increased to million for  representing growth of as compared to our net sales growth in was attributable to the continued success of our biologics and extremity product lines 
geographically  our domestic net sales totaled million and million  representing and of our total net sales  in and  respectively 
this represents growth of 
our international sales totaled million in  increasing by over sales of million in our international sales include a positive currency impact of approximately million  principally resulting from transactions denominated in the euro  when compared to international sales performance in was driven by growth in sales in our core european business and our initiatives in asia  particularly in japan 
with respect to product sales in  our net sales growth for was attributable to increases in sales across all of our product lines 
for  we experienced growth of   and  in our biologics  extremity  hip and knee product lines  respectively 
our most significant growth drivers in  were our biologics and extremities product lines 
during  our biologics sales growth was attributable primarily to the success of our allomatrix line of bone graft substitute products and the introduction of our miig minimally invasive injectable graft system in the second quarter of extremity sales growth of in was primarily the result of sales volume growth in our evolve modular radial head product and our foot and ankle products 
additionally  shifts to higher priced extremity product offerings contributed to the growth 
cost of sales 
our cost of sales as a percentage of net sales decreased percentage points from in to in this decrease was primarily due to improved margins resulting from moderate shifts in sales composition to higher margin product lines  such as biologics  and efficiency gains in our manufacturing process 
operating expenses 
our total operating expenses decreased  as a percentage of net sales  by percentage points to in operating expenses include selling  general and administrative expenses  research and development expenses  amortization of intangibles  stock based expenses and for  our million arbitration settlement award 
the decrease from was primarily attributable to favorable selling  general and administrative expenses  reductions in the amortization of intangible assets  and the favorable impact of the arbitration settlement award we received in as a percentage of net sales  our selling  general and administrative expenses decreased by percentage points to in this decrease was primarily attributable to favorable impacts of the resolution of a royalty matter of approximately  in the second quarter of and the resolution of a state business tax matter in the third quarter of during  commissions and sales and marketing expenses remained relatively constant as a percentage of net sales 
our selling  general and administrative expenses were unfavorably impacted by a non cash charge totaling approximately million  principally related to unamortized loan costs following the repayment of our euro denominated senior credit facility 
our non cash charges associated with the amortization of intangible assets decreased as a percentage of sales by percentage points in the decrease in amortization expense was primarily the result of the cessation of amortization of goodwill as required by sfas no 
which we implemented effective january  during the first quarter of  we received a favorable award totaling million in a commercial arbitration proceeding with a former business services provider 
the award was recognized as operating income in the first quarter of interest expense  net 
the significant decrease in our net interest expense from was the result of our use of the proceeds from our july ipo to repay our senior subordinated notes and to reduce our outstanding bank borrowings 
in addition  during the third quarter of  we repaid amounts outstanding under our previous euro denominated senior credit facility and renegotiated the terms of our current senior credit facility 
the renegotiation of our senior credit facility resulted in more favorable terms with regards to the interest rate charged on borrowings under the senior credit facility 
net interest expense was favorably impacted in as we invested the proceeds of our march secondary offering in interest bearing  investment grade securities resulting in the generation of additional interest income 

table of contents provision for income taxes 
our effective tax rate for was as compared to an effective tax rate of approximately for for  our effective tax rate was favorably impacted by our reduction of the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets which resulted in the recognition of a non cash benefit to the income tax provision of million 
our tax provisions in and resulted from taxes incurred related to earnings generated by certain of our international operations and changes to the valuation allowance on foreign deferred tax assets 
the differences between our effective tax rate and applicable statutory rates were primarily due to changes in the valuation allowance related to our deferred tax assets and  in  nondeductible goodwill 
seasonality our business is seasonal in nature 
historically  demand for our products has been the highest in the first and fourth quarters 
we traditionally experience lower sales volumes in the third quarter months than throughout the rest of the year as a result of the european holiday schedule during the summer months 
in addition to the seasonality of our net sales  our first quarter selling  general and administrative expenses include additional expenses that we incur in connection with the annual meeting held by the american academy of orthopaedic surgeons 
this meeting  which is the largest orthopaedic meeting in the world  features the presentation of scientific papers and instructional courses for orthopaedic surgeons 
during this day event  we display our most recent and innovative products for these surgeons 
liquidity and capital resources as of december  in thousands cash and cash equivalents working capital line of credit availability our cash and cash equivalents increased during by million  compared to an increase of million in our increase in cash and cash equivalents and working capital is primarily attributable to the generation of million of cash from operating activities during  partially offset by capital expenditures and the acquisition of adcon related assets 
our increase in cash and cash equivalents was primarily attributable to the million of net proceeds from our march secondary offering  as well as the generation of million of cash in operating activities in  partially offset by capital spending 
operating activities 
operating cash flows in benefited from the profitability of our business  as well as improved inventory management 
these factors were partially offset by a cash payment of million for us tax purposes related to alternative minimum tax 
operating cash flows for the year ended december  were favorably affected by the receipt of a million arbitration settlement award  and negatively affected by the payment of approximately million of costs associated with certain international distributorship transitions 
additionally  we made significant investments in new product inventory in which negatively impacted operating cash flows as compared to cash generated from operating activities totaled approximately  in investing activities 
our capital expenditures totaled approximately million in  million in  and million in our industry is capital intensive  particularly as it relates to surgical instrumentation 
historically  our capital expenditures have consisted of purchased manufacturing equipment  research and testing equipment  computer systems  office furniture and equipment  and surgical instruments 
we expect to incur capital expenditures of approximately million in total for  approximately million of which we anticipate will be used in the continued implementation of our enterprise computer system and million of which we anticipate will be used for routine recurring capital expenditures  including surgical instruments 
in  in addition to our routine capital expenditures  we paid million to complete the purchase of in process research and development  tangible assets  and intangible assets from gliatech  which were primarily related to the 
table of contents adcon gel technology 
we are continuously evaluating opportunities to purchase technology and other forms of intellectual property  and are therefore unable to predict the timing of future purchases 
financing activities 
during  we made million in payments related to borrowings under our senior credit facility 
additionally  we made approximately million in payments related to our long term capital leases 
also in  our operating subsidiary in italy entered in to a new agreement to factor portions of its accounts receivable balances 
the cash proceeds received from this factoring agreement are reflected as cash flows from financing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flow 
we recorded an obligation for the amount of the proceeds received under this agreement as of december  this obligation is included within our accrued expenses and other current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet 
the net proceeds received under the agreement in totaled approximately million 
in  we anticipate our debt payments to increase to million based on the terms of our senior credit facility 
additionally  we will make continued payments under our long term capital leases  including interest  of approximately million 
we anticipate that our factoring program in italy will continue  however  the level and extent of the amounts factored under the agreement and the ultimate amount of proceeds received under the program cannot be predicted 
therefore  we are unable to predict the ultimate amount of proceeds that will be received in related to this factoring agreement 
contractual cash obligations 
at december  we had contractual cash obligations and commercial commitments as follows payments due by periods total after amounts reflected in balance sheet long term debt capital lease obligations amounts not reflected in balance sheet operating leases purchase obligations royalty and consulting agreements total contractual cash obligations payments include amounts representing interest our senior credit facility  which we entered into on august   has a five year term and consists of million in term loans and a revolving loan facility of up to million 
borrowings under the senior credit facility are guaranteed by all of our subsidiaries and collateralized by all of the assets of wright medical technology  inc  our wholly owned subsidiary  and our other domestic subsidiaries 
the credit facility contains customary covenants including  among other things  restrictions on our ability to pay cash dividends  prepay debt  incur additional debt and sell assets 
the credit facility also requires us to meet certain financial tests  including a consolidated leverage or debt to equity ratio test and a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio test 
in the event that we violate these covenants  we would be required to repay the remaining balance of the debt 
additionally  we would incur a charge to operating income for unamortized financing costs 
at our option  borrowings under the credit facility bear interest either at a rate equal to a fixed base rate plus a spread of 
to or at a rate equal to an adjusted libor plus a spread of to  depending on our consolidated leverage ratio 
the amounts reflected in the table above for capital lease obligations represent future minimum lease payments under our capital lease agreements which are primarily for certain property and equipment 
the present value of the minimum lease payments are recorded in our balance sheet at december  the minimum lease payments related to these leases are discussed further in note to the consolidated financial statements contained in item of this report 

table of contents the amounts reflected in the table above for operating leases represent future minimum lease payments under noncancellable operating leases primarily for certain office space  computers and vehicles 
portions of these payments are denominated in foreign currencies and were translated in the tables above based on their respective us dollar exchange rates at december  these future payments are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk 
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us  our operating leases are not recognized in our consolidated balance sheet  however  the minimum lease payments related to these agreements are disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements contained in item of this report  as well as in the table above

none of these amounts are included in the table above 
other liquidity information 
we have funded our cash needs since through various equity and debt issuances and through cash flow from operations 
on july   we completed our ipo issuing  shares of voting common stock at per share  the net proceeds of which were million after deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses 
we used the net proceeds of our ipo to repay debt  which at the time consisted of amounts outstanding under our euro denominated senior credit facility  amounts outstanding under a dollar denominated senior credit facility  and subordinated notes plus accrued interest 
simultaneous with the closing of the ipo  all of our outstanding mandatorily redeemable  convertible preferred stock  plus accrued dividends  was converted into  shares of common stock 
also in connection with the ipo  senior subordinated notes totaling approximately million aggregate principal amount  which were held by warburg  were converted into  shares of non voting common stock 
on march   we  along with certain selling stockholders  completed a secondary offering of  shares  including the over allotment option of  shares  of voting common stock at per share 
of these  shares  we offered  resulting in net proceeds of million  after the underwriting discount and other public offering expenses  which were invested in short term  investment grade securities 
although it is difficult for us to predict future liquidity requirements  we believe that our current cash balance of approximately million  our existing available credit line of approximately million  and our expected cash flows from our operating activities  which  in totaled approximately million  will be sufficient for the foreseeable future to fund our working capital requirements and operations  permit anticipated capital expenditures in of approximately million  to meet our contractual cash obligations in of approximately million and to meet an anticipated increase in our estimated income tax payments 
critical accounting policies and estimates all of our significant accounting policies are described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
however  certain of our more critical accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates 
by their nature  these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
these judgments are based on our historical experience  terms of existing contracts  our observance of trends in the industry  information provided by our customers  and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 
different  reasonable estimates could have been used in the current period 
additionally  changes in accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period 
both of these factors could have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition  changes 
table of contents in financial condition or results of operations 
we believe that the following financial estimates are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require subjective or complex judgments 
further  we believe that the items discussed below are properly recorded in the financial statements for all periods presented 
management has discussed the development  selection  and disclosure of our most critical financial estimates with the audit committee and our independent auditors 
the judgments about those financial estimates are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements 
those financial estimates include allowances for doubtful accounts 
we make estimates related to the ultimate collection of our accounts receivable 
specifically  we analyze our accounts receivable  historical bad debt experience  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  and current economic trends  when evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts 
our provision for uncollectible accounts receivable has been less than of net sales for each of the years ended december   and  respectively 
our accounts receivable balance was million and million  net of allowances for doubtful accounts of million  at both december  and excess and obsolete inventories 
we value our inventory at the lower of the actual cost to purchase and or manufacture the inventory or its net realizable value 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on our estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements for the next twenty four months 
a significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the amount of excess inventory quantities on hand 
additionally  our industry is characterized by regular new product development that could result in an increase in the amount of obsolete inventory quantities on hand due to cannibalization of existing products 
also  our estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate  in which case we may be required to increase the provision needed for excess and obsolete inventory 
in the future  if additional inventory write downs are required  we would recognize additional cost of goods sold at the time of such determination 
regardless of changes in our estimates of future product demand  we do not increase the value of our inventory above its adjusted cost basis 
therefore  although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand  significant unanticipated decreases in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our reported operating results 
our provision for excess and obsolete inventory was million  million and million  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
product liability claims 
from time to time  claims arise involving the use of our products 
we make provisions for claims specifically identified for which we believe the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome is probable and estimable 
we have recorded at least the minimum estimated liability related to those claims where a range of loss has been established 
because of the uncertainties related to the likelihood and amount of loss on any other remaining pending claims  we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the liability that could result from an unfavorable outcome of those claims 
as additional information becomes available  we reassess the estimated liability related to our pending claims and make revisions as necessary 
future revisions in our estimates of the liability could materially impact our results of operation and financial position 
we maintain insurance coverage that limits the severity of any single claim as well as total amounts incurred per policy year  and we believe our insurance coverage is adequate 
we make every effort to use the best information available to us in determining the level of accrued product liabilities and we believe our accruals are adequate 
for each of the years ended december   and  operating expenses were not materially affected by our estimates of product liability claims 
our accrual for product liability claims was approximately  at december  and accounting for income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to determine our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing recognition of items for income tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this 
table of contents allowance in a period  we must reflect this increase as an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
management s judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we have recorded a valuation allowance of million and million as of december  and  respectively  due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize  before expiration  some of our deferred tax assets for both us and foreign income tax purposes  primarily consisting of the carry forward of certain net operating losses and general business tax credits 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to increase or decrease our valuation allowance which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
the increase in the valuation allowance during is based on our current projection of the amount of deferred tax assets that are more likely than not to be realized in the future based on operating results in recent years and our forecast of future operations 
during  certain deferred assets were created as a result of certain tax planning initiatives 
there are certain annual limitations related to the use of these assets 
we do not currently believe that it is more likely than not that a portion of these assets will be utilized as a result of these limitations  and therefore  we increased our valuation allowance by million 
the decrease in the valuation allowance during was based on our projection of the amount of deferred tax assets that were more likely than not to be realized in the future based on our operating results in recent years  our forecast of future operations  and our reduced debt burden following our ipo 
because a significant amount of our valuation allowance was recorded during our recapitalization  the subsequent decrease in this portion of the valuation allowance first reduced goodwill and then other intangible assets 
the reduction in the valuation allowance recorded subsequent to the recapitalization reduced our income tax provision 
as a result  for the year ended december   our provision for income tax was reduced by million  resulting in higher net income by this amount 
management will continue to monitor the realizability of its deferred tax assets and adjust the valuation allowance accordingly 
as of december   we had net deferred tax assets totaling million 
as of december   we had net deferred tax assets totaling million 
factors affecting future operating results in addition to the factors described above in this discussion and analysis  our future financial results could vary from period to period due to a variety of causes  including the following factors we are subject to substantial government regulation that could have a material adverse effect on our business the production and marketing of our products and our ongoing research and development  preclinical testing and clinical trial activities are subject to extensive regulation and review by numerous governmental authorities both in the us and abroad 
see government regulation in item of this form k for further details on this process 
us and foreign regulations govern the testing  marketing and registration of new medical devices  in addition to regulating manufacturing practices  reporting  labeling and record keeping procedures 
the regulatory process requires significant time  effort and expenditures to bring our products to market  and we cannot be assured that any of our products will be approved 
our failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements could result in these government authorities imposing fines and penalties on us  preventing us from manufacturing or selling our products  bringing civil or criminal charges against us  
table of contents delaying the introduction of our new products into the market  recalling or seizing our products  or withdrawing or denying approvals or clearances for our products 
even if regulatory approval or clearance of a product is granted  this could result in limitations on uses for which the product may be labeled and promoted 
further  for a marketed product  its manufacturer and manufacturing facilities are subject to periodic review and inspection 
subsequent discovery of problems with a product  manufacturer or facility may result in restrictions on the product  manufacturer or facility  including withdrawal of the product from the market or other enforcement actions 
we are currently conducting clinical studies of some of our products under an investigational device exemption ide 
clinical studies must be conducted in compliance with fda regulations  or the fda may take enforcement action 
the data collected from these clinical investigations will ultimately be used to support market clearance for these products 
there is no assurance that the fda will accept the data from these clinical studies or that it will ultimately allow market clearance for these products 
our biologics business is subject to emerging government regulations that can significantly impact our business the fda has statutory authority to regulate allograft based products  processing and materials 
the fda has been working to establish a more comprehensive regulatory framework for allograft based products  which are principally derived from cadaveric tissue 
the framework developed by the fda establishes criteria for determining whether a particular human tissue based product will be classified as human tissue  a medical device or biologic drug requiring premarket clearance or approval 
all tissue based products are subject to extensive fda regulation  including a requirement that ensures that diseases are not transmitted to tissue recipients 
the fda has also proposed extensive additional regulations that would govern the processing and distribution of all allograft products 
consent to use the donor s tissue must also be obtained 
the regulations for allograft based products are still developing 
from time to time  the fda reviews these products and may informally suggest to us how these products should be classified 
if a tissue based product is considered tissue  it does not require fda clearance or approval before being marketed 
if it is considered a device or biologic drug  then fda clearance or approval may be required 
additionally  our biologics business involves the procurement and transplantation of allograft tissue  which is subject to federal regulation under the national organ transplant act  or nota 
nota is a criminal statute that prohibits the sale of human organs for valuable consideration within the meaning of the act  including bone and other tissue 
nota permits the payment of reasonable expenses associated with the transportation  processing  preservation  quality control and storage of human tissue 
we currently charge our customers for these expenses 
in the future  if nota is amended or reinterpreted we may not be able to charge these expenses to our customers and  as a result  our business could be adversely affected 
our principal allograft based biologics offerings include allomatrix  graftjacket  and ignite products 
we are currently pursuing fda clearance of our allomatrix products on april   the fda sent us a warning letter stating that the fda believed that allomatrix injectable putty was a medical device subject to premarket clearance 
in march  the fda officially notified us that it concluded that allomatrix injectable putty should be reviewed and regulated under the medical device premarket notification provisions of the fdc act 
also  in march  the fda notified all other known manufacturers of similar products of requirements for bringing such products into compliance with the fdc act 
the fda indicated that it would exercise enforcement discretion for a reasonable period of time while companies bring their devices into compliance with the fdc act 
in response to the fda determination  we promptly filed a premarket notification for allomatrix injectable putty under section k of the fdc act 
on april   the fda notified us that the submission of our premarket notification for allomatrix injectable putty 
table of contents was an adequate response to the warning letter and that the fda considered the issues raised in the april  letter closed 
our premarket notification submission is still pending with the fda 
our allomatrix line of products continue to be marketed and sold pending the approval of the premarket notification submission 
the fda has not raised any objection to the continued marketing and sale of our allomatrix line of products pending the approval of the premarket notification submission 
there can be no assurance that the k premarket notification will be cleared by the fda in a timely manner or at all 
the fda could decide not to continue to exercise its enforcement discretion and decide to take enforcement action which could include  but not be limited to  seizing product inventory  obtaining a court injunction against further marketing of the product  or assessing civil money penalties 
additionally  until such time that our initial k is approved  we are unable to market any new allomatrix product offerings 
for the years ended december  and  our allomatrix products represented approximately and of our total net sales  respectively 
modifications to our marketed devices may require fda regulatory clearances or approvals or require us to cease marketing or recall the modified devices until such clearances or approvals are obtained when required  the products we market in the us have obtained premarket notification under section k or were exempt from the k clearance process 
we have modified some of our products and product labeling since obtaining k clearance but we do not believe these modifications require us to submit new k notifications 
however  if the fda disagrees with us and requires us to submit a new k notification for modifications to our existing products  we may be the subject of enforcement actions by the fda and be required to stop marketing the products while the fda reviews the k notification 
if the fda requires us to go through a lengthier  more rigorous examination than we had expected  our product introductions or modifications could be delayed or canceled  which could cause our sales to decline 
in addition  the fda may determine that future products will require the more costly  lengthy and uncertain pma application process 
products that are approved through a pma application generally need fda approval before they can be modified 
see government regulation in item of this form k 
if we lose one of our key suppliers  we may be unable to meet customer orders for our products in a timely manner or within our budget we rely on a limited number of suppliers for the components used in our products 
our reconstructive joint devices are produced from various surgical grades of titanium  cobalt chrome and stainless steel  various grades of high density polyethylenes  silicone elastomer and ceramics 
we rely on one supplier for the silicone elastomer used in our extremity products 
we are aware of only two suppliers of silicone elastomer to the medical device industry for permanent implant usage 
additionally  we rely on one supplier of ceramics for use in our hip products 
in addition to reconstructive joint devices  for our biologics products  we depend heavily upon a limited number of sources of demineralized bone matrix dbm and cancellous bone matrix cbm  and any failure to obtain dbm cbm from these sources in a timely manner will interfere with our ability to process and distribute allograft products 
two not for profit tissue banks supplied us with of the dbm cbm  a key component in the allograft products we currently produce  market and distribute  that we obtained in the us in we cannot be sure that our supply of dbm cbm will continue to be available at current levels or will be sufficient to meet our needs  or that our suppliers of dbm cbm will be free from fda regulatory action impacting their sale of dbm cbm 
since there is a small number of suppliers  if we cannot continue to obtain dbm cbm from these sources in volume sufficient to meet our needs  we may not be able to locate replacement sources of dbm cbm on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
this could have the effect of interrupting our business  which could adversely affect our sales 
further  we rely on one supplier for our graftjacket family of soft tissue repair and graft containment products  as well as one supplier for our adcon gel family of products 
suppliers of raw materials and components may decide  or be required  for reasons beyond our control to cease supplying raw materials and components to us 
fda regulations may require additional testing of any raw materials or components from new suppliers prior to our use of these materials or components and in the case of a device with a pma application  we may be required to obtain prior fda permission  either of which could delay or prevent our access or use of such raw materials or components 

table of contents if we fail to compete successfully in the future against our existing or potential competitors  our sales and operating results may be negatively affected and we may not achieve future growth the markets for our products are highly competitive and dominated by a small number of large companies 
we may not be able to meet the prices offered by our competitors  or offer products similar to or more desirable than those offered by our competitors 
see competition in item of this form k for more information about our competitors 
if we are unable to continue to develop and market new products and technologies  we may experience a decrease in demand for our products or our products could become obsolete  and our business would suffer we are continually engaged in product development and improvement programs  and new products represent a significant component of our growth rate 
we may be unable to compete effectively with our competitors unless we can keep up with existing or new products and technologies in the orthopaedic implant market 
if we do not continue to introduce new products and technologies  or if those products and technologies are not accepted  we may not be successful 
additionally  our competitors new products and technologies may beat our products to market  may be more effective or less expensive than our products or render our products obsolete 
see competition in item of this form k for more information about our competitors 
if our patents and other intellectual property rights do not adequately protect our products  we may lose market share to our competitors and be unable to operate our business profitably we rely on patents  trade secrets  copyrights  know how  trademarks  license agreements and contractual provisions to establish our intellectual property rights and protect our products 
these legal means  however  afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights 
in addition  we cannot be assured that any of our pending patent applications will issue 
the united states patent and trademark office the pto may deny or require significant narrowing of claims in our pending patent applications  and patents issuing from the pending patent applications  if any  may not provide us with significant commercial protection 
we could incur substantial costs in proceedings before the pto 
these proceedings could result in adverse decisions as to the priority of our inventions and the narrowing or invalidation of claims in issued patents 
in addition  the laws of some of the countries in which our products are or may be sold may not protect our products and intellectual property to the same extent as us laws  or at all 
we may be unable to protect our rights in trade secrets and unpatented proprietary technology in these countries 
in addition  we hold licenses from third parties that are necessary to utilize certain technologies used in the design and manufacturing of some of our products 
the loss of such licenses would prevent us from manufacturing  marketing and selling these products  which could harm our business 
we seek to protect our trade secrets  know how and other unpatented proprietary technology  in part  with confidentiality agreements with our employees  independent distributors and consultants 
we cannot be assured  however  that the agreements will not be breached  that adequate remedies for any breach would be available  or that our trade secrets  know how  and other unpatented proprietary technology will not otherwise become known to or independently developed by our competitors 
if we lose any existing or future intellectual property lawsuits  a court could require us to pay significant damages or prevent us from selling our products the medical device industry is litigious with respect to patents and other intellectual property rights 
companies in the medical device industry have used intellectual property litigation to gain a competitive advantage 
we are currently involved in an intellectual property lawsuit with howmedica osteonics corp  a subsidiary of stryker corporation  where it is alleged that our advance knee product line infringes one of howmedica s patents 
see legal proceedings in item of this form k for more specific information regarding this lawsuit 
if howmedica osteonics corp 
were to succeed in obtaining the relief it claims  the court could award damages to howmedica osteonics corp  and could impose an injunction against further sales of this product 
if a final judgment is rendered against us  we may be forced to raise or borrow funds  as a supplement to any available insurance claim proceeds  to pay the damages award 

table of contents in the future  we may become a party to other lawsuits involving patents or other intellectual property 
a legal proceeding  regardless of the outcome  could drain our financial resources and divert the time and effort of our management 
if we lose one of these proceedings  a court  or a similar foreign governing body  could require us to pay significant damages to third parties  require us to seek licenses from third parties and pay ongoing royalties  require us to redesign our products or prevent us from manufacturing  using or selling our products 
in addition to being costly  protracted litigation to defend or prosecute our intellectual property rights could result in our customers or potential customers deferring or limiting their purchase or use of the affected products until resolution of the litigation 
if product liability lawsuits are brought against us  our business may be harmed the manufacture and sale of medical devices exposes us to significant risk of product liability claims 
in the past  we have had a number of product liability claims relating to our products  none of which either individually  or in the aggregate  have resulted in a material negative impact on our business 
in the future  we may be subject to additional product liability claims  some of which may have a negative impact on our business 
additionally  we could experience a material design or manufacturing failure in our products  a quality system failure  other safety issues  or heightened regulatory scrutiny that would warrant a recall of some of our products 
our existing product liability insurance coverage may be inadequate to protect us from any liabilities we might incur 
if a product liability claim or series of claims is brought against us for uninsured liabilities or in excess of our insurance coverage  our business could suffer 
in addition  a recall of some of our products  whether or not the result of a product liability claim  could result in significant costs and loss of customers 
if we cannot retain our key personnel  we will not be able to manage and operate successfully and we may not be able to meet our strategic objectives our continued success depends  in part  upon key managerial  scientific  sales and technical personnel  as well as our ability to continue to attract and retain additional highly qualified personnel 
we compete for such personnel with other companies  academic institutions  government entities and other organizations 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in retaining our current personnel or in hiring or retaining qualified personnel in the future 
many of our existing management personnel have been employed by the company for five years or less  including our president and chief executive officer  who joined us in january  and our executive vice president and chief financial officer  who joined us in december our future success depends to a significant extent on the ability of our executive officers and other members of our management team to operate effectively  both individually and as a group 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to satisfactorily allocate responsibilities and that the new members of our executive team will succeed in their roles 
loss of key personnel or the inability to hire or retain qualified personnel in the future could have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate successfully 
we derive a significant portion of our sales from operations in international markets that are subject to political  economic and social instability we derive a significant portion of our sales from operations in international markets 
our international distribution system consists of direct sales offices and approximately stocking distribution partners  which combined  employ approximately sales representatives who sell in over countries 
most of these countries are  to some degree  subject to political  social and or economic instability 
for both of the years ended december  and  approximately of our net sales were derived from our international operations 
our international sales operations expose us and our representatives  agents and distributors to risks inherent in operating in foreign jurisdictions 
these risks include the imposition of additional foreign governmental controls or regulations on orthopaedic implants and biologics products  
table of contents new export license requirements particularly related to our biologics products  economic instability  including currency risk between the us dollar and foreign currencies  in our target markets  a shortage of high quality international salespeople and distributors  loss of any key personnel that possess proprietary knowledge  or who are otherwise important to our success in certain international markets  changes in third party reimbursement policy that may require some of the patients who receive our implant products to directly absorb medical costs or that may necessitate our reducing selling prices for our products  changes in tariffs and other trade restrictions  particularly related to the exportation of our biologics products  work stoppages or strikes in the health care industry  such as those that have previously affected our operations in france  canada  korea and finland in the past  a shortage of nurses in some of our target markets  particularly affecting our operations in france  and exposure to different legal and political standards due to our conducting business in over countries 
accordingly  any material decrease in our foreign sales would negatively impact our profitability 
our international sales are predominately generated in europe 
in europe  health care regulation and reimbursement for medical devices vary significantly from country to country 
this changing environment could adversely affect our ability to sell our products in some european countries 
our business could suffer if the medical community does not continue to accept allograft technology new allograft products  technologies and enhancements may never achieve broad market acceptance due to numerous factors  including lack of clinical acceptance of allograft products and related technologies  the introduction of competitive tissue repair treatment options that render allograft products and technologies too expensive and obsolete  lack of available third party reimbursement  the inability to train surgeons in the use of allograft products and technologies  the risk of disease transmission  and ethical concerns about the commercial aspects of harvesting cadaveric tissue 
market acceptance will also depend on the ability to demonstrate that existing and new allografts and technologies are attractive alternatives to existing tissue repair treatment options 
to demonstrate this  we rely upon surgeon evaluations of the clinical safety  efficacy  ease of use  reliability and cost effectiveness of our tissue repair options and technologies 
recommendations and endorsements by influential surgeons are important to the commercial success of allograft products and technologies 
in addition  several countries  notably japan  prohibit the use of allografts 
if allograft products and technologies are not broadly accepted in the marketplace  we may not achieve a competitive position in the market 

table of contents if adequate levels of reimbursement from third party payors for our products are not obtained  surgeons and patients may be reluctant to use our products and our sales may decline in the us  health care providers that purchase our products generally rely on third party payors  principally federal medicare  state medicaid and private health insurance plans  to pay for all or a portion of the cost of joint reconstructive procedures and products utilized in those procedures 
we may be unable to sell our products on a profitable basis if third party payors deny coverage or reduce their current levels of reimbursement 
our sales depend largely on government health care programs and private health insurers reimbursing patients medical expenses 
surgeons  hospitals and other health care providers may not purchase our products if they do not receive satisfactory reimbursement from these third party payors for the cost of the procedures using our products 
payors continue to review their coverage policies carefully for existing and new therapies and can  without notice  deny coverage for treatments that include the use of our products 
in addition  some health care providers in the us have adopted or are considering a managed care system in which the providers contract to provide comprehensive heath care for a fixed cost per person 
health care providers may attempt to control costs by authorizing fewer elective surgical procedures  including joint reconstructive surgeries  or by requiring the use of the least expensive implant available 
if adequate levels of reimbursement from third party payors outside of the us are not obtained  international sales of our products may decline 
outside of the us  reimbursement systems vary significantly by country 
many foreign markets have government managed health care systems that govern reimbursement for new devices and procedures 
canada  and some european and asian countries  in particular france  taiwan  and korea  have tightened reimbursement rates 
additionally  some foreign reimbursement systems provide for limited payments in a given period and therefore result in extended payment periods 
see third party reimbursement in item of this form k for more information regarding reimbursement in the us and abroad 
we will continue efforts to obtain market clearance for the re launch of the adcon gel products and the launch of the conserve plus implant in the us there can be no assurance that the sale of the adcon gel products in the us will be cleared by the fda in a timely manner  or at all  which could have a significant impact on the future growth of our biologics product line 
our conserve plus resurfacing implant is available outside the us and is pending fda clearance for the us market 
there can be no assurance that the sale of our conserve plus product in the us will be cleared by the fda in a timely manner  or at all  which could have a significant impact on the future growth of our hip product line 
if surgeons do not recommend and endorse our products  our sales may decline or we may be unable to increase our sales and profits in order for us to sell our products  surgeons must recommend and endorse them 
we may not obtain the necessary recommendations or endorsements from surgeons 
acceptance of our products depends on educating the medical community as to the distinctive characteristics  perceived benefits  clinical efficacy and cost effectiveness of our products compared to products of our competitors  and on training surgeons in the proper application of our products 
if a natural or man made disaster strikes our manufacturing facilities  we will be unable to manufacture our products for a substantial amount of time and our sales will decline we have relied to date principally on our manufacturing facilities in arlington  tennessee and toulon  france 
these facilities and the manufacturing equipment we use to produce our products would be difficult to replace and could require substantial lead time to repair or replace 
our facilities may be affected by natural or man made disasters 
in the event one of our facilities was affected by a disaster  we would be forced to rely on third party manufacturers or shift production to our other manufacturing facility 
although we believe we possess adequate insurance for damage to our property and the disruption of our business from casualties  such insurance may not be 
table of contents sufficient to cover all of our potential losses and may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms  or at all 
our business plan relies on certain assumptions about the market for our products  which  if incorrect  may adversely affect our profitability we believe that the aging of the general population and increasingly active lifestyles will continue and that these trends will increase the need for our orthopaedic implant products 
the projected demand for our products could materially differ from actual demand if our assumptions regarding these trends and acceptance of our products by the medical community prove to be incorrect or do not materialize  or if non surgical treatments gain more widespread acceptance as a viable alternative to orthopaedic implants 
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could result in declines in our reported sales and earnings since a majority of our international sales are denominated in local currencies and not in us dollars  our reported sales and earnings are subject to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
our international net sales were favorably affected by the impact of foreign currency fluctuations totaling million in and million in at present  we do not engage in hedging transactions to protect against uncertainty in future exchange rates between particular foreign currencies and us dollars 
efforts to acquire and integrate other companies or product lines could adversely affect our operations and financial results we may pursue acquisitions of other companies or product lines 
our ability to grow through acquisitions depends upon our ability to identify  negotiate  complete and integrate suitable acquisitions and to obtain any necessary financing 
even if we complete acquisitions  we may also experience difficulties in integrating any acquired companies  personnel and products into our existing business  delays in realizing the benefits of the acquired company or products  diversion of our management s time and attention from other business concerns  limited or no direct prior experience in new markets or countries we may enter  higher costs of integration than we anticipated  or difficulties in retaining key employees of the acquired business who are necessary to manage these acquisitions 
in addition  an acquisition could materially impair our operating results by causing us to incur debt or requiring us to amortize acquisition expenses and acquired assets 
our quarterly operating results are subject to substantial fluctuations and you should not rely on them as an indication of our future results our quarterly operating results may vary significantly due to a combination of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
these factors include demand for products  which historically has been highest in the first and fourth quarters  our ability to meet the demand for our products  increased competition  
table of contents the number  timing and significance of new products and product introductions and enhancements by us and our competitors  our ability to develop  introduce and market new and enhanced versions of our products on a timely basis  changes in pricing policies by us and our competitors  changes in the treatment practices of our surgeon customers  changes in distributor relationships and sales force composition  the timing of material expense or income generating events and the related recognition of their associated financial impact  the timing of significant orders and shipments  availability of raw materials  work stoppages or strikes in the health care industry  changes in fda regulatory policy  and general economic factors 
we believe that quarterly sales and operating results may vary significantly in the future and that period to period comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
we cannot assure you that our sales will increase or be sustained in future periods or that we will be profitable in any future period 
any shortfalls in sales or earnings from levels expected by securities or industry analysts could have an immediate and significant adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock in any given period 
we rely on our independent sales distributors and sales associates to market and sell our products our success depends largely upon marketing arrangements with independent sales distributors and sales associates  in particular their sales and service expertise and relationships with the customers in the marketplace 
independent distributors and sales associates may terminate their relationship with us  or devote insufficient sales efforts to our products 
we do not control our independent distributors and they may not be successful in implementing our marketing plans 
our failure to maintain our existing relationship with our independent distributors and sales associates could have an adverse effect on our operations 
similarly  our failure to recruit and retain additional skilled independent sales distributors and sales associates could have an adverse effect on our operations 
we have experienced turnover with some of our independent distributors in the past which adversely affected short term financial results while we transitioned to new independent distributors 
while we believe these transitions have been managed effectively  similar occurrences could happen in the future with different results which could have a greater adverse effect on our operations than we have previously experienced 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to interest rate risk arises principally from the variable rates associated with our credit facility 
on december   we had borrowings of million under our credit facility which are subject to a variable rate  with a current rate of 
the carrying value of these borrowings approximates fair value due to the variable rate 
an adverse change of in the interest rate of all such borrowings outstanding would cause us to incur an increase in interest expense of approximately  on an annual basis 
we currently do not hedge our exposure to interest rate fluctuations  but may do so in the future 
foreign currency rate fluctuations fluctuations in the rate of exchange between the us dollar and foreign currencies could adversely affect our financial results 
approximately and of our total net sales were denominated in foreign currencies during the years ended december  and  respectively  and we expect that foreign currencies will continue to represent a similarly significant percentage of our net sales in the future 
costs related to these sales are largely denominated in the same respective currencies  thereby limiting our transaction risk exposures 
however  for sales not denominated in us dollars  if there is an increase in the rate at which a foreign currency is exchanged for us dollars  it will require more of the foreign currency to equal a specified amount of us dollars than before the rate increase 
in such cases  and if we price our products in the foreign currency  we will receive less in us dollars than we did before the rate increase went into effect 
if we price our products in us dollars and competitors price their products in local currency  an increase in the relative strength of the us dollar could result in our prices not being competitive in a market where business is transacted in the local currency 
a substantial majority of our sales denominated in foreign currencies are derived from european union countries and are denominated in the euro 
additionally  we have significant intercompany receivables from our foreign subsidiaries which are denominated in foreign currencies  principally the euro and the japanese yen 
our principal exchange rate risk therefore exists between the us dollar and the euro and the us dollar and the yen 
fluctuations from the beginning to the end of any given reporting period result in the revaluation of our foreign currency denominated intercompany receivables and payables  generating currency translation gains or losses that impact our non operating income expense levels in the respective period 
we do not currently hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
we may  however  hedge such exposures in the future 
based on our overall exposure for foreign currency at december   an adverse change of in foreign currency rates would reduce our non operating income by approximately  product liability insurance expense fluctuations due to the nature of our industry  we incur significant product liability insurance premiums each year 
in recent years  our industry has experienced significant increases in product liability insurance premiums 
in  product liability insurance expense increased by million to million in comparison with if the costs of product liability insurance increase significantly in the future  our future operating results could be adversely impacted 
based on our current levels of product liability insurance and the associated premiums as of december   an adverse change of in premium rates would reduce our operating income by approximately
