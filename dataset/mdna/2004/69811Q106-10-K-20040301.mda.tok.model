item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive overview vitex is a development stage biotechnology company developing products designed to improve the safety of the world s blood supply 
our inactine pathogen reduction system for red cells the inactine system is designed to inactivate a wide range of viruses  bacteria  parasites and lymphocytes from red blood cells and to remove prion proteins 
prion proteins in their pathogenic forms are the agents that cause mad cow disease  or in humans  variant creutzfeldt jakob disease vcjd  which is fatal  and for which no diagnostic or therapy currently exists 
over million red cell units are transfused annually in north america  europe and japan making it one of the most frequently prescribed and important therapeutics in medicine 
a pathogen reduction product for both acute and chronic patients could represent a billion market opportunity with acute indications representing in excess of billion out of that total 
we currently do not have any fda approved products and we have not made any commercial sales of our products under development 
our lead product candidate  the inactine system  is currently in a phase iii clinical trial for patients requiring acute transfusions 
until november  we were also conducting a phase iii clinical trial with patients requiring chronic transfusions 
on the advice of an independent data safety monitoring committee dsmc  we stopped enrollment in the chronic trial and the continued testing of the inactine system for use in chronic patients is currently under review 
we are evaluating possible corrective actions to address the issues observed in the trial 
possible corrective actions might require us to significantly change the inactine system so as to enable us to continue to test the system for use with chronic patients 
if such significant changes were required  we may decide to pursue an indication for use of the existing process only in acute transfusions 
a analysis by an outside consultant estimated that over of the approximately million annual red cell transfusions in the us involved acute care patients 
we believe that the relative usage of transfusion red cells in the major international markets we are targeting is similarly proportioned between acute and chronic patients 
we also believe that pursuing an acute only indication would allow us bring the inactine system to market faster  taking advantage of substantial progress we have made in research  clinical  pathogen inactivation and toxicology studies 
we might then choose to address the combined acute and chronic markets in a second 
table of contents generation inactine system 
should we decide to pursue this approach  we would require fda concurrence 
at present we are not aware of any other pathogen reduction systems for red blood cells in human clinical trials 
the phase iii clinical trial in patients requiring acute transfusions is our most significant current activity 
we fund our operations primarily through sale of common stock  partner collaborations  research and development grants  short term debt and capital lease financing 
our burn rate is approximately million per month and may increase modestly during cash reserves of about million as of february  should be sufficient to fund operations during and into the first quarter of recent developments fundraising in february  we completed a private placement transaction with the sale to investors of  shares of our common stock plus warrants and options for total gross proceeds to us of million 
settlement of plasma operations receivables in january  we settled our outstanding receivables from precision pharma services  inc in the amount of million at december  in exchange for million in cash plus the return to us of million shares of our common stock held by precision  with a value of approximately million based on the market closing price of the nasdaq national market on the date prior to settlement 
critical accounting estimates and policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements as well as reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
our actual results could differ from these estimates 
the significant accounting policies that we believe are most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results and the accounting policies most critical to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements include the following research and development revenue and cost recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with staff accounting bulletin sab no 
sab  revenue recognition in financial statements 
we recognize revenues under research collaborations  including grants received from the government and minimum royalty payments  as we incur research costs eligible for reimbursement under the collaboration agreements 
non refundable up front and milestone payments related to license and distribution agreements are deferred and amortized over the period in which the licensee has distribution rights 
we continually review these estimates for any events which could result in a change in the deferral period 
amounts received in advance of the incurrence of reimbursable research expenses are deferred and recognized when the related expenses have been incurred 
research and development costs are charged to operations as incurred 
long lived assets our long lived assets  which consist of property and equipment and intangible assets  are recorded at cost and amortized over the estimated useful life of the asset 
we generally depreciate property and equipment using the straight line method over their economic life  which ranges from to years 
we amortize acquired intangible assets using the straight line method over their economic lives  which range from to years 
determining the 
table of contents economic lives of our long lived assets requires us to make significant judgments and estimates  and can materially impact our operating results 
our estimates of the useful lives of these assets are based on industry standards and our specific business 
we believe our estimates are accurate for all material purposes and that our estimates are not likely to change in the near future 
asset impairments we review the valuation of long lived assets  including property and equipment and intangible assets  under the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we are required to assess the recoverability of long lived assets on an interim basis whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important that could trigger an interim impairment review include the following significant changes in the manner of our use of the assets or the strategy of our overall business  significant decrease in the market value of an asset  significant adverse change in our business or industry  and significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period 
in accordance with sfas no 
 when we determine that the carrying value of applicable long lived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we evaluate whether the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of that asset 
if such a circumstance were to exist  we would measure an impairment loss to the extent the carrying amount of the particular long lived asset or group of assets exceeds its fair value 
we would determine the fair value based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
use of different estimates and judgments on any of these factors could yield materially different results in our analysis  and could result in significantly different asset impairment charges 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  during we invested million in build out costs for a  sq 
ft 
laboratory near boston  massachusetts intended for use as a processing site for inactine treated red blood cells 
at that time  the inactine system was in early development  was more labor intensive  and was expected to require a larger area for a given volume of red cells 
also  it was believed that a separate site might be required for our fda biologics license application 
since then  there has been significant progress in automating the system and reducing space requirements so that it currently can be implemented in community blood centers by blood center staff 
further  we concluded that the facility will not be required for our bla 
we have a smaller processing laboratory at the watertown facility for clinical trial support and to display the inactine process 
we have therefore concluded that the second site is not required and are taking steps to sublease the space or otherwise restructure our obligations under the lease 
the site has not been placed in service and  accordingly  most build out costs were not amortized 
due to this decision and reflecting our lease obligations  we recorded a non cash charge of million within research and development costs in fiscal year to write off our capitalized build out costs and to provide for estimated lease and associated carrying costs until the facility is sublet or the lease is terminated 
effective january   we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
under sfas no 
 goodwill is required to be tested for impairment annually in lieu of being amortized 
we have selected the fourth quarter as the period to perform the annual test 
furthermore  goodwill is required to be tested for impairment on an interim basis if an event or circumstance indicates that it is more likely than not that an impairment loss has been incurred 
an impairment loss shall be recognized to the extent that the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
impairment losses shall be recognized in operations 
we adopted sfas no 
during the first quarter of without a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 

table of contents during the fourth quarter of  we halted a phase iii clinical trial which we were conducting in a chronic population due to safety concerns of an independent data safety monitoring committee 
while there were no serious adverse events associated with the trial  we are evaluating our alternatives to deal with the issues which were observed 
this development triggered an impairment review of goodwill and long lived assets under sfas no 
and sfas no 
 respectively 
the results of our reviews indicated that an impairment charge was not required 
contingencies contingencies are addressed by assessing the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of losses 
a determination of the amount of reserves required  if any  for these contingencies is made after reviewing the relevant facts and circumstances  seeking outside professional advice of lawyers or accountants where appropriate  and then making and recording our best judgment of potential loss under the guidance of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 contingencies 
this process is repeated in each reporting period as circumstances evolve and are reevaluated 
any changes in our assumptions or estimates that impact our estimates of loss will be recorded in operations immediately in the period of the change 
as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  we had outstanding receivables from precision pharma services  inc totaling million at december  precision provides contract plasma fractionation services 
its largest customer  who is under contract with precision until the end of  recently announced that it is offering its plasma business for sale 
this created uncertainty about precision s business and ability to make payments of the amounts due to the company 
subsequent to year end  this uncertainty was resolved when we fully realized the outstanding receivables through a settlement in which we received million in cash proceeds and the return of million shares of our common stock with a value of approximately million based on the market closing price of the nasdaq national market on the date prior to settlement 
results of operations fiscal year as compared to fiscal year net revenues research funding fiscal year fiscal year increase decrease million million million the decrease in research funding is primarily a result of our august modification of the pall collaboration  under terms of which we assumed responsibility from pall for funding of the inactine red cell program 
prior to august  research funding received was principally from pall corporation 
also included within research funding is amortized revenue related to non refundable up front and milestone payments from amersham pharmacia biotech which are amortized over the life of the related agreement 
these amounts totaled million for each of fiscal years and in addition  we recorded minimal royalty payments from amersham pharmacia biotech of million and in fiscal years and  respectively 
finally  research funding includes grants received from governmental agencies in the amount of million and million in fiscal year and  respectively 
research and development fiscal year fiscal year increase decrease million million million our research and development activities all relate to the development of pathogen inactivation technologies for blood products of which our inactine chemistry is currently the core technology and our inactine 
table of contents system for red cells is the lead product candidate 
the inactine system has completed phase i and phase ii clinical trials in human subjects and is currently in a phase iii trial with patients requiring acute transfusions of red blood cells 
our research and development spending on pathogen inactivation technologies principally includes our internal research efforts  clinical trials conducted by medical institutions and scientific and development work under contract to independent vendors 
fiscal year includes a million non cash charge to write off capitalized build out and other costs of a processing facility which we have decided not to place in service 
in fiscal year  phase iii clinical costs were higher than the prior year by million as our phase iii trials commenced in january fiscal year includes a non recurring million royalty payment for engineering services on the inactine delivery system 
toxicology program costs were million higher in fiscal year than in fiscal year as our inactine system toxicology studies were significantly completed in fiscal year fiscal includes million higher spending than on a prion diagnostic research program which was phased out by the end of costs for laboratory supplies decreased by million from fiscal year to as our r d emphasis shifted toward clinical trials and away from the laboratory 
in the fourth quarter of  following the decision to halt our inactine system phase iii chronic clinical trial  we restructured our operations to reduce spending and to concentrate our efforts on the acute trial 
we reduced staffing by over  eliminating over positions  and curtailed non essential activities 
these actions lowered our spending rate in december into the range of approximately million per month from the previous per month  primarily related to research and development 
we expect fiscal research and development costs to be initially in the range of million per month and to increase modestly as the phase iii acute trial continues 
cumulatively  we have invested million in research and development on pathogen inactivation technologies for blood products since our inception in  including the cost of in process research and development resulting from our merger with pentose pharmaceuticals  inc our phase iii clinical trial program for the inactine system began in january the phase iii acute trial is ongoing 
we are evaluating our alternatives to deal with the issues identified in the phase iii chronic trial 
we are evaluating possible corrective actions to address the issues observed in the trial 
possible corrective actions might require us to significantly change the inactine system so as to enable us to continue to test the system for use with chronic patients 
if such significant changes were required  we may decide to pursue an indication for use of the existing process only in acute transfusions 
we believe that pursuing an acute only indication would allow us to bring the inactine system to market faster  taking advantage of substantial progress we have made in research  clinical  pathogen inactivation and toxicology studies 
we might then choose to address the combined acute and chronic markets in a second generation inactine system 
should we decide to pursue this approach  we would require fda concurrence 
at this point we are unable to assess what additional studies  if any  would be required by fda or the time or cost in completing the studies 
our work is designed to lead to the preparation and filing of a biologics license application bla for submission to the fda which initiates the final step of fda review  prior to a decision by the fda whether to grant approval to market the system in the us the time involved in this stage of the fda review is not within our control  and we cannot reasonably estimate this time period 
after we reach consensus with the fda on the us clinical and regulatory requirements for licensure  we will be developing and implementing a strategy to achieve marketing approval of the inactine system in the european community and japan 
we have not yet developed estimates of the timing and related cost for these markets 
the exact nature  timing and estimated costs of the efforts necessary to bring to market the product resulting from our pathogen inactivation research and development projects involve a number of key variables which are 
table of contents either unpredictable or outside our control  including the enrollment rates and results of the phase iii clinical trial  the extent of further studies which could be required for filing a bla with the fda  the length of the fda and foreign regulatory approval processes  the success of our fundraising efforts  our ability to establish and maintain relationships with marketing partners and strategic collaborators  and the timing of commencement of commercialization of our product 
these factors are also described in the section entitled risk factors in this report 
accordingly  we are unable to estimate  with any degree of precision  either the total future costs that will be required to continue and complete the commercialization of the inactine system  or the period in which we can expect material net cash inflows from the system 
general and administrative expenses fiscal year fiscal year increase decrease million million million the decrease is due to lower staffing needs  lower discretionary consulting expenditures and lower costs related to the protection of intellectual property 
plasma operations impairment fiscal year fiscal year increase decrease million credit million in  we recorded credits on the divestiture of our plasma operations primarily related to the million settlement of an ethanol tax dispute with the us bureau of alcohol  tobacco and firearms as well as the settlement of certain liabilities below recorded amounts

at december  and december   we established a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset positions of million and million  respectively 
realization of these net deferred tax assets will be based on  among other things  our ability to generate future taxable profits and utilize our net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits before they expire 
fiscal year as compared to fiscal year net revenues research funding fiscal year fiscal year increase decrease million million million research funding decreased as a result of our august modification of the pall collaboration

realization of these net deferred tax assets will be based on  among other things  our ability to generate future taxable profits and utilize our net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits before they expire 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources we finance our operations primarily through sales of our common stock  research and development grants  short term debt and capital lease financing 
at december   we had working capital of million  including cash of million  in comparison with working capital of million  including cash of million at the prior year end 
subsequent to fiscal year end  we settled term receivables related to the sale of our plasma operations for cash of million and for the return of million shares of our common stock 
also  in february  we completed a private placement of our common stock for gross proceeds of million 
as previously discussed  we restructured our operations in november to reduce our cash spending from million per month into the range of million per month 
we expect our monthly spending rate to continue in that approximate range in early and to increase modestly as we continue our clinical trials in the rate of enrollment in our clinical trial program will be the most significant factor in spending 
a combination of our opening cash balances and fundraising through february has resulted in available cash balances of approximately million as of february  these cash balances are invested with the primary objectives of safety of principal and liquidity 
we believe that these resources will be sufficient to fully meet our cash needs during and into the first quarter of our cash activity during was comprised of the following in millions net proceeds from equity transactions collection of receivables cash used in operating activities net repayment under revolving credit facility repayment on advances and capital lease obligations additions to property and equipment decrease in cash position our equity transactions included the issuance of common stock in connection with a million rights offering  a million equity milestone investment by pall corporation and a private placement of million in december in fiscal  we generated cash primarily from the receipt of partner research funding  drawdowns under a pall corporation revolving credit facility  and collection of outstanding receivables

risk factors our business faces significant risks 
these risks include those described below and may include additional risks of which we are not currently aware or which we do not currently believe are material 
if any of the events or circumstances described in the following risks actually occurs  our business  financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
these risks should be read in conjunction with the other information set forth in this report 
risks related to our business we have historically incurred operating losses and these losses will continue 
we have historically incurred substantial operating losses due to our research and development activities in blood safety and we expect these losses to continue for the foreseeable future 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
our fiscal year losses were million 
during the next several years  we expect to continue our inactine development efforts and other research activities 
the inactine red blood cell phase iii clinical trial program is being conducted in the us and clinical studies will likely occur in other geographic markets 
product commercialization activities will be at a higher level and our expenditures for research and development may increase after we will actively seek new financing from time to time and will seek marketing partners to provide financial support to our inactine red blood cell program 
however  at this time we are not able to assess the probability of success in our fundraising efforts or the terms under which we may secure financial support 
it is likely that we will continue to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future 

table of contents we will need additional capital in the future  but our access to such capital is uncertain 
our current resources are insufficient to fund all of our commercialization efforts 
as of february   we had cash on hand of approximately million 
at present  we are consuming approximately million in cash per month and expect this spending rate to increase modestly as we continue our clinical trial program in we believe that our present cash resources will be adequate to meet our requirements during and into the first quarter of our capital needs beyond fiscal will depend on many factors  including our research and development activities  the scope of our clinical trial program  the timing of regulatory approval for our products under development and the successful commercialization of our products 
our needs may also depend on the magnitude and scope of these activities  the progress and the level of success in our clinical trials  the costs of preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  competing technological and market developments  changes in or terminations of existing collaboration and licensing arrangements  the establishment of additional collaboration and licensing arrangements and the cost of manufacturing scale up and development of marketing activities  if undertaken by us 
we do not have committed external sources of funding  and we may not be able to obtain additional funds on acceptable terms  if at all 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of our development programs  obtain funds through arrangements with collaboration partners or others that may require us to relinquish rights to technologies  product candidates or products that we would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize ourselves  license rights to technologies  product candidates or products on terms that are less favorable to us than might otherwise be available  or seek a buyer for all or a portion of our business  or wind down our operations and liquidate our assets 
if we raise additional funds by issuing additional stock  further dilution to our stockholders may result  and new investors could have rights superior to existing stockholders 
if funding is insufficient at any time in the future  we may be unable to develop or commercialize our products  take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures 
our success depends on new products and systems which we are developing  but may be unable to commercialize due to numerous factors  including regulatory requirements on both us and our customers 
the success of our business depends on the successful development and commercialization of pathogen reduction products and systems  including products based on the inactine system 
successful commercialization of our products and systems under development depends  in significant part  on our ability to complete their development in a timely fashion  demonstrate their safety in clinical trials  obtain and maintain patents or other proprietary protections  obtain required regulatory approvals  implement efficient  commercial scale manufacturing processes  sell into relevant markets before competitors  obtain approval for reimbursement under health care systems  and establish and maintain sales  marketing  distribution and development collaborations 
our pathogen inactivated blood products are under development and have not been approved by the food and drug administration for marketing in the united states or by regulatory authorities in other countries 
the process of obtaining regulatory approvals is generally lengthy  expensive and uncertain 
satisfaction of pre market approval or other regulatory requirements of the fda  or similar requirements of non united states regulatory agencies  typically takes several years  depending upon the type  complexity  novelty and intended 
table of contents purpose of the product 
the regulatory process includes pre clinical animal studies and clinical human trials of each product to establish its safety and efficacy 
during fiscal years and  we spent approximately million and million on research and development  respectively 
we must provide the fda and foreign regulatory authorities with pre clinical and clinical data that demonstrate our products are safe and effective before they can be approved for commercial sale 
our lead product candidate  the inactine system  is currently in a phase iii clinical trial for patients requiring acute transfusions 
until november  we were also conducting a phase iii clinical trial with patients requiring chronic transfusions 
on the advice of an independent data safety monitoring committee dsmc  we stopped enrollment in the chronic trial and the continued testing of the inactine system for use in chronic patients is currently under review 
we are evaluating possible corrective actions to address the issues observed in the trial 
possible corrective actions might require us to significantly change the inactine system so as to enable us to continue to test the system for use with chronic patients 
if such significant changes were required  we may decide to pursue an indication for use of the existing process only in acute transfusions 
should we decide to pursue this approach  we would require fda concurrence 
we are unable to assess what additional studies the fda may require  if any  under this approach 
the acute study currently continues to enroll patients 
at this time we cannot ensure that the acute trial will complete enrollment in a timely manner or predict whether unanticipated events or circumstances  including antibody responses to inactine treated red cells observed in the chronic study  could prevent completion of the trial 
the results from pre clinical studies and early clinical trials conducted by us will not ensure that results obtained in our phase iii clinical trials will be satisfactory to the fda or foreign regulatory authorities 
data obtained from pre clinical and clinical activities are susceptible to varying interpretations  which could delay  limit or prevent regulatory approval 
our completion of clinical trials may also be delayed by slower than anticipated patient enrollment  negative or inconclusive clinical results or other adverse events occurring during the clinical trials 
therefore  we cannot ensure that clinical trials will demonstrate sufficient safety and efficacy to obtain required marketing approvals on a timely basis  if at all 
delays in our clinical testing or approval from government authorities will increase our product development costs and may impair our ability to commercialize our products and allow competitors to bring products to market before we do 
our clinical development plan for cellular products  including inactine  assumes that only data from laboratory studies  not from human clinical trials  will be required to demonstrate efficacy in reducing pathogens and that clinical trials for these products will instead focus on demonstrating therapeutic efficacy  safety and tolerability of treated blood components 
although we have held discussions with the fda concerning the proposed clinical plan for these products  this plan of demonstrating safety and efficacy may not ultimately be acceptable to the fda or the fda may reconsider any decision that this clinical plan is appropriate 
even if our products receive approval for commercial sale  their manufacture  storage  marketing and distribution are and will be subject to extensive and continuing regulation in the united states by the federal government  especially the fda  and state and local governments 
the failure to comply with these regulatory requirements could result in enforcement action  including  without limitation  withdrawal of approval  which would harm our business 
later discovery of problems with our product may result in additional restriction on the product  including withdrawal of the product from the market 
regulatory authorities may also require post marketing testing  which can involve significant expenses 
additionally  governments may impose new regulations  which could further delay or preclude regulatory approval of our products or result in significantly increased compliance costs 
in similar fashion to the fda  foreign regulatory authorities require demonstration of product quality  safety and efficacy prior to granting authorization for product registration which allows for distribution of the product for commercial sale 
international organizations  such as the world health organization  and foreign government agencies including those for the americas  middle east  europe  and asia and the pacific have laws  regulations 
table of contents and guidelines for reporting and evaluating the data on safety  quality and efficacy of new drug products 
although most of these laws  regulations and guidelines are very similar  each of the individual nations reviews all of the information available on the new drug product and makes an independent determination for product registration 
in addition to the regulatory requirements applicable to us and our products and systems  there are regulatory requirements applicable to our prospective customers  the blood banks that process and distribute both blood and blood products 
blood banks  such as the american red cross and the new york blood center  will be required to obtain approved license supplements from the fda before using products processed with our pathogen reduction systems 
fda delays in approving these supplements may deter some blood centers from using our products 
in addition  blood centers that do submit supplements may face disapproval or delays in approval that could in turn cause further delay or deter them from using our products 
if we fail to establish and maintain relationships with strategic collaborators and distributors  we may be unable to market our products 
we intend to enlist strategic collaborators for sales  marketing and distribution support and for financial support in the development of our inactine pathogen reduction system for red cells 
we will seek distribution partners for the commercialization of our inactine system for red cells 
if we fail to develop new strategic partnerships or to maintain existing alliances  the failure will delay or possibly inhibit the commercialization of our products 
for example  in order to effectively market our products outside the united states  we may need to secure foreign marketing partners who have a strong presence in such foreign markets 
securing new corporate collaborators is a time consuming process  and we cannot guarantee that the negotiations with new collaborators will yield positive results 
even if we find additional corporate collaborators to assist in the commercialization of existing or new product candidates  the terms of the arrangements may not be favorable or acceptable to us 
our technologies are new and unproven 
we will need to gain market acceptance to generate revenue 
we believe that market acceptance of our products and systems will depend on our ability to provide acceptable evidence of their safety  efficacy and cost effectiveness 
implementation of our systems will involve new investment by our customers  which we believe will result in significant improvements in safety and cost savings in health care 
we believe that market acceptance of our products and systems will also depend upon the extent to which physicians  patients and health care payers perceive that the benefits of using our products and systems justify the additional costs and processing requirements 
our products and systems may not gain any significant degree of market acceptance among blood centers  physicians  patients and health care payers  even if clinical trials demonstrate safety and efficacy and necessary regulatory approvals and health care reimbursement approvals are obtained 
if our products and systems fail to achieve market acceptance  we may never become profitable 
a small number of customers will determine market acceptance of our products 
a defined number of blood collection services will dominate any market for the inactine pathogen reduction system for red cells 
in the united states  the american red cross and the america s blood centers collect and distribute the vast majority of the nation s supply of blood and blood components 
major united states blood centers include the new york blood center and the united blood services  each of which distributes approximately percent of the nation s supply of blood and blood components 
in western europe and japan  various national blood transfusion services or red cross organizations collect  store and distribute virtually all of their respective nations blood and blood components supply 
failure to properly market  price or sell our products to any of these large customers could significantly diminish potential product revenue 

table of contents we rely on a limited number of suppliers to manufacture our inactivation compound and other components of our inactine pathogen reduction system for red cells 
our inactine system uses a small molecule compound known as pen to inactivate pathogens 
we have a contract with one manufacturer for pen and will seek to qualify additional manufacturers to produce this compound to meet our anticipated commercialization requirements 
if any of these additional manufacturers  which have not yet been identified  or our existing manufacturer cannot produce and deliver this compound in the required quantities  to the required standards  or in a timely manner we may face delays in the commercialization of the inactine system before we are able to identify alternate or additional manufacturers to meet these requirements 
the procedure for inactivating pathogens using the inactine system requires the use of an automated inactine system to deliver the compound into the red cell unit and a cell washing system to remove pen  cell debris and other impurities 
we worked with an engineering firm to develop the automated delivery system which is now being qualified for use in our clinical trials 
this system and related system disposables could be manufactured by several suppliers and we have not yet entered commercial supply agreements 
we are currently using a cell washing system manufactured by haemonetics  which we exclusively license from haemonetics pursuant to a development and manufacturing agreement 
when and if our inactine system is commercialized  haemonetics will provide contract manufacturing services for the cell washing equipment and associated disposables 
if haemonetics fails to deliver an adequate supply of the cell washing systems and disposables  we would be required to identify other third party manufacturers 
we may not be able to identify manufacturers for the delivery system and disposables or to replace haemonetics for the wash system and disposables on a timely basis or enter into contracts with such manufacturers on reasonable terms  if at all 
any delay in the availability of these systems and disposables could delay commercialization and subsequent sales of the inactine system 
furthermore  the inclusion of delivery and cell washing systems by new manufacturers could require us to seek new approvals from governmental regulatory authorities  which could result in delays in product delivery 
we may not be able to receive any such required regulatory approvals 
if we do not successfully distinguish and commercialize our technology  we may be unable to compete successfully or to generate revenue significant to sustain our operations 
the biotechnology industry  including the fields of transfusion medicine and therapeutic use of blood products  is highly competitive and subject to significant and rapid technological change 
accordingly  our success will depend  in part  on our ability to respond quickly to such change through the development and introduction of new products and systems 
many of our competitors or potential competitors  including our principal competitors cerus corporation and gambro  have substantially greater financial and other resources than we have and may also have greater experience in conducting pre clinical studies  clinical trials and other regulatory approval procedures as well as in marketing their products 
if we or our corporate partners commence commercial product sales  we or our corporate partners will be competing against companies with greater marketing and manufacturing capabilities 
our competitors may obtain patent protection  receive fda approval or commercialize products before we do 
our ability to compete successfully against currently existing and future alternatives to our pathogen reduction technology and competitors who compete directly with us in the pathogen reduction industry will depend  in part  on our ability to attract and retain skilled scientific and research personnel  develop technologically superior products  develop competitively priced products  
table of contents obtain patent or other required regulatory approvals for our products  be early entrants to the market  and manufacture  market and sell our products  independently or through collaborations 
third party reimbursement policies may adversely affect our ability to commercialize and sell our products and services 
our ability to successfully commercialize our products depends in part on the extent to which appropriate levels of reimbursement for our products and related treatments are obtained from government authorities  private health insurers  third party payers  and other organizations  such as managed care organizations  or mcos 
any failure by doctors  hospitals and other users of our products or systems to obtain appropriate levels of reimbursement could adversely affect our ability to sell these products and systems 
significant uncertainty exists about the reimbursement status of newly approved medical products and services 
reimbursement in the united states or foreign countries may not be available for any of our products  reimbursement granted may not be maintained  and limits on reimbursement available from third party payers may reduce the demand for  or negatively affect the price of  our products 
we anticipate that we will need to work with a variety of organizations to lobby government agencies for improved reimbursement policies for our products 
however  we cannot guarantee that such lobbying efforts will take place or that they will ultimately be successful 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property  we may not be able to operate our business profitably 
our success depends on our ability to develop proprietary products and technologies  to obtain and maintain patents  to protect trade secrets  and to prevent others from infringing on our proprietary rights 
we have exclusive patents  licenses to patents and patent applications covering critical components of our technologies 
we also seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes  in part  by confidentiality agreements with our employees and certain contractors 
our patents  pending patent applications and licensed technologies may not afford adequate protection against competitors  and any pending patent applications now or hereafter filed by or licensed to us may not result in patents being issued 
we cannot be certain that our confidentiality agreements will not be breached  that we will have adequate remedies for any breach  or that our trade secrets will not otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors 
to the extent that our employees  consultants or contractors use intellectual property owned by others  disputes may arise as to the rights related to or resulting from the know how and inventions 
in addition  the laws of certain non united states countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
medical technology patents involve complex legal and factual questions and  therefore  we cannot predict with certainty their enforceability 
our patents or patent applications  if issued  may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented  or may not provide protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar technology 
furthermore  our competitors may obtain patent protection or other intellectual property rights for technology similar to ours that could limit our ability to use our technology or commercialize products that we may develop 
litigation may be necessary to assert claims of infringement  to enforce patents issued to us  to protect trade secrets or know how or to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others 
litigation or interference proceedings could result in substantial additional costs and diversion of management focus 
if we are ultimately unable to protect our technology  trade secrets or know how  we may be unable to operate profitably 
if we are unable to operate our business without infringing upon intellectual property rights of others  we may not be able to operate our business profitably 
our success depends on our ability to operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others 
we are aware that patents have been applied for and or issued to third parties claiming technologies for decontamination 
table of contents of blood and blood products that may be similar to those needed by us 
we endeavor to follow developments in these fields and we do not believe that our technologies and or products infringe upon any proprietary rights of third parties 
to the extent that planned or potential products turn out to be covered by patents or other intellectual property rights held by third parties  we would need a license under such patents or other intellectual property rights to continue development and marketing of our products 
any required licenses may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
if we do not obtain such licenses  we may need to design around other parties patents or we may not be able to proceed with the development  manufacture or sale of our products 
litigation may be necessary to defend against claims of infringement or to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others 
litigation or interference proceedings could result in substantial additional costs and diversion of management focus 
if we are ultimately unsuccessful in defending against claims of infringement  we may be unable to operate profitably 
if we lose or are unable to hire and retain qualified personnel  we may not be able to develop our products and technology 
we are highly dependent on the members of our scientific and management staff but have no formal employment agreements with our employees 
although we believe we have been successful in attracting and retaining our employees  we may not be able to attract and retain personnel on acceptable terms  if at all  given the competition for such personnel among other companies and research and academic institutions 
if we lose an executive officer or certain key members of our clinical or research and development staff or are unable to hire and retain qualified personnel  then our ability to develop and commercialize our products and technology may be hindered 
we have not purchased any key man life insurance 
to date  no executive officer or key employee has notified us of any plans to terminate employment with us 
we use and generate hazardous materials in our research activities 
defending against any claims relating to the improper handling  storage  release or disposal of these materials could be time consuming and costly 
we are subject to federal  state and local laws  rules  regulations and policies governing the use  generation  manufacture  storage  air emission  effluent discharge  handling and disposal of certain materials  biological specimens and wastes 
there can be no assurance that we will not be required to incur significant costs to comply with environmental and health and safety regulations in the future 
our research and development activities  including development of the inactine pathogen reduction system for red cells  involve the controlled use of hazardous materials  including certain hazardous chemicals  viruses and radioactive materials 
although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of such materials comply with the standard prescribed by state and federal regulations  the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials cannot be eliminated 
in the event of such an accident  we could be held liable for any damages that result  and any such liability could exceed our insurance limits and our cash resources 
we may face exposure to product liability claims 
we may face exposure to product liability and other claims due to allegations that our products cause harm 
these risks are inherent in our phase iii clinical trials which are currently underway and in the testing  and future manufacturing and marketing of human blood products  including our inactine system 
although we currently maintain product liability insurance  such insurance may not be adequate and we may not be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage in the future at a reasonable cost  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain product liability insurance in the future at an acceptable cost or to otherwise protect against potential product liability claims  we could be inhibited in the commercialization of our products which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

table of contents risks related to our stock our stock price is volatile and you may not be able to resell your shares at or above the price you paid for them 
we first publicly issued common stock on june  at per share in our initial public offering 
between june  and february  the closing sale price has ranged from a high of per share to a low of per share 
the market price of our common stock could continue to fluctuate substantially due to a variety of factors  including quarterly fluctuations in results of operations  the announcement of new products or services by us or competitors  changes in or failure to meet earnings estimates by securities analysts  sales of common stock by existing stockholders or the perception that these sales may occur  adverse judgments or settlements obligating us to pay damages  negative publicity  loss of key personnel  developments concerning proprietary rights  including patents and litigation matters  and clinical trial or regulatory developments in both the united states and foreign countries 
in addition  overall stock market volatility has often significantly affected the market prices of securities for reasons unrelated to a company s operating performance 
in the past  securities class action litigation has been commenced against companies that have experienced periods of volatility in the price of their stock 
securities litigation initiated against us could cause us to incur substantial costs and could lead to the diversion of management s attention and resources  which could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and earnings 
the sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock could cause the market price of our common stock to decline and may impair our ability to raise capital through additional offerings 
on february   we completed a private placement financing in which we sold investors  shares of our common stock  warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of our common stock  and purchase options to purchase  shares of our common stock 
in addition  we issued warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of our common stock to the placement agent in the transaction 
we will issue warrants to purchase up to  shares of our common stock to the placement agent when investors exercise their purchase options 
we agreed to register for resale the common stock issued or issuable upon exercise of the warrants and purchase options that were issued in the financing 
all of those shares of common stock and the shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants and purchase options will be freely saleable once a registration statement covering the resale of such shares becomes effective 
we expect such a registration statement will become effective during the first quarter of these shares represent approximately of the total number of our shares of common stock that are currently issued and outstanding 
sales of these shares in the public market  or the perception that future sales of these shares could occur  could have the effect of lowering the market price of our common stock below current levels and make it more difficult for us and our shareholders to sell our equity securities in the future 
our executive officers  directors and holders of more than of our common stock collectively beneficially own approximately of the outstanding common stock as of february  in addition  approximately  shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of vested stock options could become available for immediate resale if such options were exercised 

table of contents sale or the availability for sale  of shares of common stock by stockholders could cause the market price of our common stock to decline and could impair our ability to raise capital through an offering of additional equity securities 
our executive officers and directors own sufficient shares of our common stock to significantly affect the results of any stockholder vote 
our executive officers and directors  including those directors representing ampersand ventures  beneficially own approximately of our common stock as of february  as a result  these executive officers and directors as a group might have the ability to significantly influence the outcome of matters requiring a stockholder vote 
anti takeover provisions may frustrate attempts to replace our current management and discourage investors from buying our common stock 
certain provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation and restated by laws in effect as of february   as well as the delaware general corporation law  reduce the power of stockholders generally  even those with a majority of the voting power in our company  to remove incumbent directors and to fill vacancies on the board of directors without the support of the incumbent directors 
in addition  our restated certificate of incorporation and restated by laws provide that stockholder action may not be effected without a duly called meeting 
our restated certificate of incorporation and restated by laws also do not permit our stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders 
this effectively limits the ability of our stockholders to conduct any form of consent solicitation 
provisions of the dgcl  our restated certificate of incorporation and restated by laws could discourage a third party from attempting to acquire  or make it more difficult for a third party to acquire  control of our company without approval of our board of directors  even if such acquisition were beneficial to other stockholders 
moreover  the provisions of the dgcl and our restated certificate of incorporation and restated by laws relating to the removal of directors and the filling of vacancies on the board of directors preclude a third party from removing incumbent directors without cause and simultaneously gaining control of the board of directors by filling  with its own nominees  the vacancies created by removal 
such provisions could also limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of the common stock 
such provisions also allow the board of directors to authorize the issuance of preferred stock with rights superior to those of the common stock 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our earnings and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to the effects of changes in interest rates on our investments of available cash balances in money market funds 
under our current policies  we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes
