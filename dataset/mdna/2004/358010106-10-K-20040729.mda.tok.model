item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations safe harbor statement under the private securities litigation reform act of the statements in this annual report on form k regarding future earnings and operations and other statements relating to the future constitute forward looking statements pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of forward looking statements inherently involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward looking statements 
factors that would cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  continued acceptance of the company s products in the marketplace  competitive factors  new products and technological changes  product prices and raw material costs  dependence upon third party vendors  competitive developments  changes in manufacturing and transportation costs  the availability of capital  and the outcome of certain litigation and arbitration proceedings 
by making these forward looking statements  the company undertakes no obligation to update these statements for revisions or changes after the date of this report 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company believes its most critical accounting policies to be the recognition of revenue and costs on production contracts and the valuation of inventory 
each of these areas requires the company to make use of reasoned estimates including estimating the cost to complete a contract  the realizable value of its inventory or the market value of its products 
changes in estimates can have a material impact on the company s financial position and results of operations 
revenue recognition revenues under larger  long term contracts  generally defined as orders in excess of  are reported in operating results using the percentage of completion method 
for us government and other fixed price contracts that require initial design and development of the product  revenue is recognized on the cost to cost method 
under this method  revenue is recorded based upon the ratio that incurred costs bear to total estimated contract costs with related cost of sales recorded as the costs are incurred 
each month management reviews estimated contract costs 
the effect of any change in the estimated gross margin percentage for a contract is reflected in revenues in the period in which the change is known 
provisions for anticipated losses on contracts are made in the period in which they become determinable 
on production type contracts  revenue is recorded as units are delivered with the related cost of sales recognized on each shipment based upon a percentage of estimated final contract costs 
changes in job performance may result in revisions to costs and income and are recognized in the period in which revisions are determined to be required 
provisions for anticipated losses on contracts are made in the period in which they become determinable 
for contracts in the company s gillam fei and fei zyfer segments  smaller contracts or orders in the other business segments and sales of products and services to customers are reported in operating results based upon shipment of the product or performance of the services pursuant to contractual terms 
when payment is contingent upon customer acceptance of the installed system  revenue is deferred until such acceptance is received and installation completed 
costs and expenses contract costs include all direct material  direct labor costs  manufacturing overhead and other direct costs related to contract performance 
selling  general and administrative costs are charged to expense as incurred 
inventory in accordance with industry practice  inventoried costs contain amounts relating to contracts and programs with long production cycles  a portion of which will not be realized within one year 
inventory reserves are established for slow moving and obsolete items and are based upon management s experience and expectations for future business 
any changes in reserves arising from revised expectations are reflected in cost of sales in the period the revision is made 
equity based compensation the company applies the disclosure only provisions of fas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure and continues to measure compensation cost in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
historically  this has not resulted in compensation cost upon the grant of options under a qualified stock option plan 
however  in accordance with fas no 
 the company provides pro forma disclosures of net earnings loss and earnings loss per share as if the fair value method had been applied beginning in fiscal the following table illustrates the effect on the company s consolidated statements of operations had compensation cost for stock option awards under the plans been determined based on the fair value at the grant dates consistent with the provisions of fas no 
in thousands  except per share data net income loss  as reported   cost of stock options  net of taxes net loss income pro forma  earnings loss per share  as reported basic diluted loss earnings per share pro forma basic diluted the weighted average fair value of each option has been estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes options pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions used for grants in each of the three years ended april   and  dividend yield of  expected volatility of in fiscal year  risk free interest rate of  and expected lives of ten years 
results of operations the table below sets forth for the fiscal years ended april the percentage of consolidated net sales represented by certain items in the company s consolidated statements of operations net sales commercial communications us government gillam fei fei zyfer cost of sales gross margin selling and administrative expenses restructuring charge goodwill impairment insurance reimbursement  net research and development expenses operating loss profit other income  net minority interest provision benefit for income taxes net income loss significant events as more thoroughly described elsewhere in this form k and in the notes to the financial statements  the company s fiscal year  and results of operations were materially impacted by several specific events 
during fiscal year  the company acquired the business and net assets of zyfer  inc in addition to the purchase price  the company invested an additional million of working capital to support the operations of fei zyfer until it could return to profitability 
also  in fiscal year  the company realized a  tax benefit as the result of the reversal of certain tax liabilities established in prior years 
in fiscal  the company determined that the goodwill associated with its investment in gillam fei had become impaired and wrote off the full amount of goodwill in the amount of million 
in fiscal year  the company recovered million from an insurance company related to expenses incurred in defense and settlement of the company s litigation with the us government 
see item legal proceedings and note to the financial statements 
without these significant events  the company s operating loss profit  pre tax earnings loss and net earnings loss would be materially different from that reported in the financial statements 
see note to the financial statements for pro forma presentation related to the acquisition of fei zyfer  inc operating loss the operating loss for the year ended april   decreased million to million from the operating loss of million reported in fiscal year the improvement is directly attributable to the year over year increase in sales volume during fiscal year as well as the significant fiscal year events which did not recur in fiscal year the million goodwill impairment and million in inventory adjustments see next paragraph 
these improvements were offset by the fiscal year operating loss of million recorded by fei zyfer 
much of the improvement in sales occurred in the second half of the fiscal year but these increases were not sufficient to overcome the operating losses recorded in the first half of the year 
during the first half of the year  the company continued to experience the effects of a slow down in the telecommunications industry  a trend which appears to have reversed itself in the latter half of fiscal year and is expected to show continued strength into fiscal year the operating loss for the year ended april   was million compared to an operating profit of  reported for fiscal year the primary causes of this decline were reduced revenues in fiscal year plus the million goodwill impairment and the write off or reserve against certain work in process and component inventory in the amount of million 
also  in fiscal year  the company obtained a million insurance reimbursement which was offset by million of inventory adjustments 
revenues declined by while gross margins decreased to of revenue from in fiscal year this includes the fiscal year inventory adjustments which reduced gross margins by of revenues compared to a effect in fiscal year these results reflect the low level of telecommunication related business during these fiscal years 
the company s response was to reduce costs in all categories  while maintaining its core operational capabilities and continuing to invest in new products  efficient manufacturing processes and development of non us manufacturing capacity 
net sales net sales for fiscal year increased by million to million from fiscal year revenues of million 
these revenues include million from fei zyfer or of the year over year increase while sales from the other segments increased by million over the prior year 
this increase is attributable to strong second half revenues in the commercial communications segment and in the gillam fei segment compared to both the first half of the fiscal year as well as to fiscal year revenues 
commercial communication revenues were up million over the prior year on the strength of increased capital spending on cellular network infrastructure and sales related to commercial satellites 
gillam fei revenues exclusive of million in intersegment sales related to a research and development program increased by over  from the prior year  benefiting primarily from the year over year increase in the value of the euro to the dollar 
fiscal year revenues from the us government segment declined by million from the prior year as the company worked on several developmental programs under us government contracts as compared to more production type contracts in the prior year 
net sales for fiscal year decreased by million to million from fiscal year net sales of million 
the principal cause for the decline was attributable to the world wide slowdown in capital spending in the telecommunications industry which the company serves 
revenues for the commercial communications segment decreased by million and gillam fei revenues decreased by million 
offsetting these declines  revenues for the us government segment almost doubled from the fiscal year levels  to million  as the company responded to the us government s need for more sophisticated secure communications and weaponry 
the telecommunications markets appear to be rebounding from a period of low activity 
world wide capital spending on commercial satellites  cellular network infrastructure and wireline synchronization systems is increasing 
accordingly  the company believes future sales in the commercial communications  gillam fei and fei zyfer segments will continue at the levels achieved in the second half of fiscal year the company anticipates revenues for its us government segment to also increase as more funding is provided by the government for such projects as secure radios  new communication satellites  unmanned aerial vehicles and weapons guidance systems 
gross margin rates the gross margin rate for fiscal year improved to of net sales compared to in fiscal year the fiscal year rate was reduced by due to the million inventory adjustment as previously discussed 
although fiscal year sales increased substantially over the prior year  the volume was insufficient to fully absorb the overhead  particularly in the first half of the current fiscal year when lower revenues were recorded 
in the second half of the year  the company experienced rising revenues but also built up its support structure to sustain the expected higher level of sales 
the company also reduced the value of its inventory by  as the result of an inventory revaluation 
the gross margin rate for fiscal year decreased to of net sales compared to in fiscal year as noted above  the fiscal year inventory adjustments reduced the gross margin rate by compared to a reduction for inventory adjustments in fiscal year the additional decline in the fiscal year gross margin rate were due to the lower level of sales which were unable to absorb a greater percentage of fixed overhead costs and the higher level of warranty expenses the company experienced which reduced gross margin rates by approximately 
the company s target is to achieve an overall gross margin rate of or better through greater sales volume  continued process improvements and utilization of lower cost manufacturing in russia and china 
during fiscal year  the company expects to realize gross margin rates approaching its targeted rate 
restructuring charge during fiscal year  the company s majority owned subsidiary in france substantially completed a restructuring of its operations as a result of the company s decision to convert it from a manufacturing facility to a regional sales office 
this resulted in a charge to earnings of  for the year ended april  the company does not expect to incur significant costs in the future related to this restructuring although it may recognize a gain upon the sale of the subsidiary s current manufacturing facility during fiscal year selling and administrative expenses selling and administrative costs in fiscal year increased by million to million from million in fiscal year the largest component of this increase is the approximately million of selling and administrative expenses incurred at newly acquired fei zyfer 
the additional million of expenses is commensurate with the increased volume of business that the company experienced in fiscal year costs such as commission expenses  salaries of additional marketing and support personnel and performance related compensation all contributed to increased selling and administrative expenses in fiscal year these increases were offset by declines in deferred compensation expenses 
in addition  the value of the euro to the us dollar continued to rise throughout fiscal year as a result  gillam fei s euro denominated selling and administrative costs declined by but  when converted to us dollars  reflected a increase over fiscal year selling and administrative costs in fiscal year decreased by million to million from million in fiscal year as the company responded to the lower level of business volume 
during the year  gillam fei lowered its administrative support costs by when denominated in euros but the savings were reduced to  when translated to us dollars due to the increase in the value of the euro to the us dollar during fiscal costs associated with the establishment of the company s fei asia facility were halved approximately  lower as less time was required by us based personnel to support that operation and more costs were borne in the china facility where operating expenses are much lower than in the us 
offsetting those cost reductions was an increase in the costs to support the new european sales office 
in the us subsidiaries  cost savings in fiscal of million were related to personnel reductions  lower charges to deferred compensation expense  reduced sales commissions and reduction in legal and other professional fees 
as a percentage of sales  selling and administrative expenses were in fiscal year  in fiscal year and in fiscal year the company targets selling and administrative expenses not to exceed of consolidated sales 
the lower level of sales in fiscal year and into the first half of fiscal year prevented the company from achieving its target 
as revenues improve in fiscal year  the company expects to achieve its targeted level of selling and administrative expenses 
research and development expenses research and development expenses in fiscal year increased by  to million from million in fiscal year this increase is entirely attributable to development costs incurred at fei zyfer which approximated  without fei zyfer  research and development expense would have declined by from fiscal year during fiscal year  those resources previously devoted to the company s internal research and development efforts were often redirected to funded research projects 
consequently  the costs of these resources are reflected in cost of sales rather than in research and development expenses 
internal development efforts during fiscal year were focused on completion of gillam fei s usg wireline synchronization system  developing a digital rubidium oscillator  further improving the performance of crystal oscillators  including low g gravity sensitivity crystal oscillators which have broad applications in both commercial and us government systems 
research and development expenses in fiscal year decreased million to million from million in fiscal during fiscal year  the company completed development of certain manufacturing process improvements and new product designs 
related personnel and other resources were refocused on production activities as development projects were concluded 
other research and development activities involved further product and process improvements  development of a common platform for time and frequency generators which will enable the interchange of a crystal or rubidium oscillator  and to maintain the company s competitive position in the markets it serves 
the company will continue to focus its research and development activities on those products which it expects will provide the best return on investment and greatest prospects for the future growth of the company 
for fiscal year  the company will complete development of gillam fei s usg wireline synchronization product and will make further investment in developing manufacturing process improvements 
additional funds will be invested in improving and miniaturizing the rubidium atomic clocks and further enhancing the capabilities of its line of crystal oscillators 
the company s target is to spend approximately of revenues on research and development activities  although the actual level of spending is dependent on new opportunites and the rate at which it succeeds in bringing new products to market 
internally generated cash and cash reserves will be adequate to fund these development efforts 
other income  expense other income expense  decreased by  to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year and increased by  in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year investment income during fiscal year increased by  over fiscal year  and fiscal year investment income decreased by  compared to fiscal year in all three years  the company recorded realized gains and losses on marketable securities 
in fiscal year  the company realized gains of  on the sale of certain marketable securities 
in fiscal year  realized losses on marketable securities of  were partially offset by realized gains of  similarly  during fiscal the company recorded a  writedown to market value of a certain marketable security whose decline in value was deemed to be other than temporary which loss was offset by realized gains on sales of marketable securities of  investment income also includes interest and dividends earned on marketable securities  including dividend income from its reit units 
interest income has declined in each of fiscal years and from that realized in prior years due to a combination of lower interest rates and a decreased level of invested assets as a result of the fei zyfer acquisition early in fiscal year the company anticipates that investment income in fiscal year will remain approximately the same as fiscal year as interest rate increases provide better earnings on interest sensitive investments but reduce the potential for larger realized gains on those securities 
interest expense for the year ended april  increased by  compared to fiscal year and decreased by  compared to fiscal the increase in fiscal is attributable to short term borrowings by the company to fund its working capital requirements 
rather than liquidating certain marketable securities  the company established a credit line with a financial institution and borrowed approximately million 
the interest rate on this line approximately half of what marketable securities are earning for the company plus similar short term financing in the european subsidiaries increased interest expense during fiscal year as the company retires its short and long term financing obligations  interest expense is expected to decline 
the company also incurs interest expense on the financing arrangement for the leaseback of the us manufacturing facility and for certain deferred compensation payments 
the company anticipates that interest expense in fiscal year will be lower than that recorded in fiscal year other  net was net expense of  in fiscal year compared to net income of  in fiscal year and net income of  in fiscal year the variances in this account were impacted primarily by costs and income recorded at the company s french subsidiary 
during fiscal year  this subsidiary incurred certain one time charges of approximately  whereas during fiscal year  the same subsidiary realized a gain of approximately  on the sale of a portion of real property and received a government agency subsidy of approximately  to support a development activity 
the company anticipates that in future years other  net  will not be a significant contributor to pretax earnings 
income taxes the company is subject to taxation in several countries
