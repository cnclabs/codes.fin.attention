forward looking information certain statements of other than historical fact that are contained in this document and in written material  press releases and oral statements issued by or on behalf of southside bancshares  inc  the company a bank holding company  may be considered to be forward looking statements as that term is defined in the private securities litigation reform act of these statements may include words such as expect  estimate  project  anticipate  could  should  may  intend  probability  risk  target  objective and similar expressions 
forward looking statements are subject to significant risks and uncertainties and the company s actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in the forward looking statements 
for example  certain market risk disclosures are dependent on choices about key model characteristics and assumptions and are subject to various limitations 
see item business and item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
by their nature  certain of the market risk disclosures are only estimates and could be materially different from what actually occurs in the future 
as a result  actual income gains and losses could materially differ from those that have been estimated 
other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from forward looking statements include  but are not limited to general economic conditions  either nationally or in the state of texas  legislation or regulatory changes which adversely affect the businesses in which the company is engaged  economic or other disruptions caused by military actions in iraq  haiti or other areas  changes in the interest rate environment which reduce interest margins and may impact prepayments on the mortgage backed securities portfolio  changes effecting the leverage strategy  significant increases in competition in the banking and financial services industry  changes in consumer spending  borrowing and saving habits  technological changes  the company s ability to increase market share and control expenses  the effect of compliance with legislation or regulatory changes  the effect of changes in accounting policies and practices and the costs and effects of unanticipated litigation 
critical accounting estimates the accounting and reporting estimates of the company conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and general practices within the financial services industry 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the company considers its critical accounting policies to include the following allowance for losses on loans 
the allowance for losses on loans represents management s best estimate of probable losses inherent in the existing loan portfolio 
the allowance for losses on loans is increased by the provision for losses on loans charged to expense and reduced by loans charged off  net of recoveries 
the provision for losses on loans is determined based on management s assessment of several factors reviews and evaluations of specific loans  changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio  current and anticipated economic conditions and the related impact on specific borrowers and industry groups  historical loan loss experience  the level of classified and nonperforming loans and the results of regulatory examinations 
the loan loss allowance is based on the most current review of the loan portfolio at that time 
the servicing officer has the primary responsibility for updating significant changes in a customer s financial position 
each officer prepares status updates on any credit deemed to be experiencing repayment difficulties which  in the officer s opinion  would place the collection of principal or interest in doubt 
an internal loan review officer from the company is responsible for an ongoing review of the company s entire loan portfolio with specific goals set for the volume of loans to be reviewed on an annual basis 
at each review of a credit  a subjective analysis methodology is used to grade the respective loan 
categories of grading vary in severity to include loans which do not appear to have a significant probability of loss at the time of review to grades which indicate a probability that the entire balance of the loan will be uncollectible 
if full collection of the loan balance appears unlikely at the time of review  estimates or appraisals of the collateral securing the debt are used to allocate the necessary allowances 
a list of loans or loan relationships of  or more  which are graded as having more than the normal degree of risk associated with them  is maintained by the internal loan review officer 
this list is updated on a periodic basis  but no less than quarterly in order to properly allocate necessary allowance and keep management informed on the status of attempts to correct the deficiencies noted in the credit 
in addition to maintaining an ongoing review of the loan portfolio  the internal loan review officer maintains a history of the loans that have been charged off without first being identified as problems 
this history is used to assist in gauging the amount of nonspecifically allocated allowance necessary  in addition to the portion which is specifically allocated by loan 
the internal loan review officer also uses the loan portfolio data collected to determine the allocation of the allowance for loan loss appropriate for the risk in each of the company s major loan categories 
loans are considered impaired if  based on current information and events  it is probable that the company will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
the measurement of impaired loans is generally based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the historical effective interest rate stipulated in the loan agreement  except that all collateral dependent loans are measured for impairment based on fair value of the collateral 
in measuring the fair value of the collateral  management uses assumptions eg discount rates and methodologies eg comparison to the recent selling price of similar assets consistent with those that would be utilized by unrelated third parties 
changes in the financial condition of individual borrowers  in economic conditions  in historical loss experience and in the conditions of the various markets in which collateral may be sold may all affect the required level of the allowance for losses on loans and the associated provision for loan losses 
as of december   the company s review of the loan portfolio indicates that a loan loss allowance of million is adequate to cover probable losses in the portfolio 
refer to item entitled loan loss experience and allowance for loan loss and notes to financial statements no 
 summary of significant accounting and reporting policies for a detailed description of the company s estimation process and methodology related to the allowance for loan losses 
estimation of fair value 
the estimation of fair value is significant to a number of the company s assets  including available for sale investment securities and other real estate owned 
these are all recorded at either fair value or at the lower of cost or fair value 
furthermore  accounting principles generally accepted in the united sates require disclosure of the fair value of financial instruments as a part of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
fair values are volatile and may be influenced by a number of factors  including market interest rates  prepayment speeds  discount rates and the shape of yield curves 
fair values for most available for sale investment securities are based on quoted market prices  where available 
if quoted market prices are not available  fair values are based on the quoted prices of similar instruments 
the fair values of other real estate owned are typically determined based on appraisals by third parties  less estimated costs to sell 
defined benefit retirement plan 
the plan obligations and related assets of the defined benefit retirement plan are presented in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
plan assets  which consist primarily of marketable equity and debt instruments  are valued using market quotations 
plan obligations and the annual pension expense are determined by independent actuaries and through the use of a number of assumptions 
key assumptions in measuring the plan obligations include the discount rate  the rate of salary increases and the estimated future return on plan assets 
in determining the discount rate  the company utilizes the yield on high quality  fixed income investments currently available with maturities corresponding to the anticipated timing of the benefit payments 
salary increase assumptions are based upon historical experience and anticipated future management actions 
asset returns are based upon the anticipated average rate of earnings expected on the invested funds of the plan 
at december   the weighted average actuarial assumption of the company s plan were discount rate  long term rate of return on plan assets  and assumed salary increases 
material changes in pension benefit costs may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions 
future annual amounts could be impacted by changes in the number of plan participants  changes in the level of benefits provided  changes in the discount rates  changes in the expected long term rate of return  changes in the level of contributions to the plan and other factors 
overview operating results during the year ended december   the company s net income increased  or to million  from million for the same period in the increase in net income was primarily attributable to an increase in noninterest income and a decrease in provision for loan losses 
noninterest income increased primarily due to the increases in deposit services income  mortgage servicing release fees income  gains on sales of securities available for sale and other noninterest income 
these increases were partially offset by an increase in noninterest expense  a decrease in net interest income and an increase in income taxes 
the majority of the increase in noninterest expense was a result of bank growth and the costs associated with the opening of six new branches during and and amortization expense related to expensing the unamortized origination cost associated with the redemption of southside capital trust i 
earnings per fully diluted share were for each of the years ended december  and financial condition total assets increased million or to billion at december  from billion at december  the increase was primarily attributable to a million increase in the securities portfolio and to a lesser extent a million increase in net loans 
the securities portfolio totaled million at december  compared to million at december  at december   net loans were million compared to million at december  the increase in securities and loans was funded by increases in deposits and fhlb advances 
nonperforming assets at december  decreased to million  and represented of total assets  compared to million or of total assets at december  nonaccruing loans decreased to million and the ratio of nonaccruing loans to total loans decreased to at december  as compared to million and at december  other real estate owned decreased to  at december  from  at december  loans days past due at december  decreased to  compared to  at december  restructured loans at december  decreased to  compared to  at december  overall  asset quality improved during deposits increased million to million at december  from million at december  fhlb advances were million at december   a million increase from million at december  short term fhlb advances increased million to million at december  from million at december  long term fhlb advances increased million to million at december  from million at december  other borrowings at december  and totaled million and million  respectively  and at december  consisted of million of short term borrowings and million of long term debt 
on november   the company through its wholly owned subsidiary  southside capital trust ii the trust ii issuer  sold  cumulative convertible preferred securities the junior subordinated convertible debentures at a liquidation amount of per convertible preferred security for an aggregate amount of  these securities had a convertible feature that allowed the owner to convert each security to a share of the company s common stock at an adjusted conversion price of per common share 
these securities had a distribution rate of per annum payable at the end of each calendar quarter 
on december   southside capital trust ii  a subsidiary of southside bancshares  inc  redeemed  shares of its cumulative convertible trust preferred securities and all of its common securities which totaled  prior to the redemption date  december   all other convertible trust preferred shares were converted into the company s common stock 
this increased the company s number of shares of common stock outstanding to  at december  on may   the company through its wholly owned subsidiary  southside capital trust the trust issuer  sold  preferred securities the junior subordinated debentures at a liquidation amount of per preferred security for an aggregate amount of  these securities had a distribution rate of per annum payable at the end of each calendar quarter 
on october   southside capital trust  a subsidiary of southside bancshares  inc  redeemed all of its cumulative trust preferred securities and trust common securities which totaled  southside bancshares funded the redemption through the issuance of  of trust preferred securities and  of trust common securities that adjust quarterly at a rate equal to the three month libor plus basis points 
the lower interest rate provided interest savings during the fourth quarter and should provide a better match for the overall interest rate sensitivity position of the company 
shareholders equity at december  totaled million compared to million at december  the increase primarily reflects the net income recorded for the year ended december   and the increase in the common stock issued of million as a result of conversions from the company s junior subordinated convertible debentures into the company s common stock and the company s incentive stock option and dividend reinvestment plans 
these increases were partially offset by the repurchase of  shares of the outstanding stock at an average price of per share  the payment of cash dividends and a decrease in the accumulated other comprehensive income of million 
during the economy in the company s market area appeared to show some signs of modest growth 
the two areas of concern are the slow rate of job growth in the local and national labor markets and the personal bankruptcy rate 
management anticipates these two events could have some effect on the company s net charge offs 
management of the company  however  cannot predict whether current economic conditions will improve  remain the same or decline 
key financial indicators management follows include but are not limited to  numerous interest rate sensitivity and risk  credit risk  operations risk  liquidity risk  capital risk  regulatory risk  competition risk  and economic risk 
leverage strategy in may the company implemented a leverage strategy designed with the potential to enhance its profitability by maximizing the use of the company s capital with acceptable levels of credit  interest rate and liquidity risk 
the leverage strategy consists of borrowing a combination of long and short term funds from the federal home loan bank of dallas the fhlb and investing the funds primarily in premium mortgage backed securities  and to a lesser extent  long term municipal securities 
although premium mortgage backed securities often carry lower yields than traditional mortgage loans and other types of loans the company makes  these securities generally increase the overall quality of the company s assets by virtue of the securities underlying insurance or guarantees  are more liquid than individual loans and may be used to collateralize the company s borrowings or other obligations 
in addition  in low interest rate environments the amortization expense for premium mortgage backed securities is associated with substantially higher prepayments experienced and reduces the overall yields of the premium mortgage backed securities portfolio 
while the strategy of investing a substantial portion of the company s assets in premium mortgage backed and municipal securities has resulted in lower interest rate spreads and margins  the company believes that the lower operating expenses and reduced credit risk combined with the managed interest rate risk of this strategy have enhanced its overall profitability over the last several years 
at this time  the company maintains the leverage strategy for the purpose of enhancing overall profitability by maximizing the use of the company s capital 
risks associated with the asset structure the company maintains are a lower net interest rate spread and margin when compared to its peers and increased interest rate risk 
the company s asset structure  spread and margin increases the need to monitor the company s interest rate risk 
an additional risk is the change in market value of the afs securities portfolio as a result of changes in interest rates 
significant increases in interest rates could impact the company s equity capital significantly 
the company will attempt to adopt a balance sheet strategy going forward to gradually reduce the securities portfolio as a percentage of earning assets assuming adequate quality loan growth is available in the company s market area 
if adequate quality loan growth is not available to achieve the company s goal of enhancing profitability by maximizing the use of the company s capital  as described above  then additional securities will be purchased 
during  sufficient quality loan growth was not available at a market price the company was willing to accept 
as a result  the securities portfolio as a percentage of total assets increased to at december  from at december  on the liability side  the company will continue to utilize a combination of advances and deposits to achieve its strategy of minimizing cost while achieving overall interest rate risk objectives as well as asset liability committee alco objectives 
during the low interest rate environment  long term deposits necessary to balance alco objectives  as a result of long term assets added to the balance sheet  have not been available in the company s market area at a market price the company was willing to accept 
as a result  fhlb borrowings as a percentage of deposits increased to at december  from at december  the intended net result of the overall balance sheet strategy is to increase the company s net interest spread 
the leverage strategy is dynamic and requires ongoing management 
as interest rates  funding costs and security spreads change  the company s determination of the proper securities to own and funding to obtain must be re evaluated 
management has attempted to design the leverage strategy so that in a rising interest rate environment the interest income earned on the premium mortgage backed securities may increase to help offset the increase in funding costs 
as interest rates decrease  the interest income on the premium mortgage backed securities may decrease due to increased prepayments on these securities as funding costs decrease 
due to the unpredictable nature of mortgage backed securities prepayments  the length of interest rate cycles  and the slope of the interest rate yield curve  net interest income could fluctuate more than simulated under the alco scenarios modeled 
results of operations the company s results of operations are dependent primarily on net interest income  which is the difference between the income earned on its loan  securities and investment portfolios and its cost of funds  consisting of the interest paid on deposits and borrowings 
results of operations are also affected by the company s noninterest income  provision for loan losses and noninterest expenses 
general economic and competitive conditions  particularly changes in interest rates  prepayment rates of mortgage backed securities and loans  repricings of loan relationships  government policies and actions of regulatory authorities  also significantly affect the company s results of operations 
future changes in applicable law  regulations or government policies may also have a material impact on the company 
comparison of operating results for the years ending december  compared to december  net interest income net interest income is one of the principal sources of a financial institution s earnings stream and represents the difference or spread between interest and fee income generated from interest earning assets and the interest expense paid on deposits and borrowed funds 
fluctuations in interest rates as well as volume and mix changes in interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities materially impact net interest income 
net interest income for the year ended december  was million  a decrease of million or compared to the same period in the overall decrease in net interest income was due to the fact that decreases in interest income from loans and securities were more than decreases in interest expense from deposits and other borrowings which decreased the net yield on average interest earning assets 
average interest earning assets increased million or  and the net yield on average interest earning assets decreased from at december  to at december  net interest income decreased during the first nine months ended september  as a result of decreases in the company s net interest margin and spread to and  respectively  when compared to the same period in  which was due in large part to significantly lower mortgage interest rates and the lower overall interest rate environment primarily during the second quarter ended june  this led to substantially increased residential mortgage refinancing nationwide and in the company s market area combined with increased repricing of all of the company s other loan types primarily during the second quarter ended june  and the third quarter ended september  net interest income increased during the fourth quarter as a result of increases in the company s net interest margin and spread during the fourth quarter ended december  to and  respectively when compared to and  respectively for the same period in  which was due to several factors 
the higher overall interest rate environment during the fourth quarter ended december  led to decreased residential mortgage refinancing nationwide and in the company s market area combined with decreased repricing of all of the company s other loan types during the fourth quarter ended december  a return to long term interest rate levels experienced in may and june of could impact the company s net interest margin in the future due to increased prepayments and repricings 
other factors that impacted southside s net interest margin and spread included million of fixed rate fhlb advances at an average rate of that repriced during the fourth quarter of  and the reduction in interest expense on southside bancshares trust preferred securities during the fourth quarter ended december  an increase in average earning assets during the fourth quarter ended december  was also a contributing factor for the increase in net interest income 
during the year ended december   average loans  funded by the growth in average deposits  increased million or  compared to the same period in the average yield on loans decreased from at december  to at december   reflective of an overall average decrease in interest rates 
as interest rates declined  especially short term interest rates  loan customers increasingly requested floating rate loans  which lowered the overall yield on loans 
in addition  the company has experienced a large number of loan customers requesting loan repricings due to lower interest rates offered to them by competing financial institutions 
if interest rates remain low or move lower the company anticipates it will be required to meet lower interest rate offers from competing financial institutions in order to retain quality loan relationships  which could impact the overall loan yield 
the decrease in interest income on loans of million or was the result of the decrease in interest rates partially offset by the increase in average loans 
average investment and mortgage backed securities increased million or for the year ended december  when compared to the same period in this increase was primarily funded by an increase in the company s average deposits 
the overall yield on average investment and mortgage backed securities decreased to during the year ended december  from during the same period in  due in large part to increased prepayment speeds on mortgage backed securities which led to increased amortization expense and increased cash to reinvest in a lower interest rate environment 
interest income on investment and mortgage backed securities decreased million in or compared to due to the decrease in the average yield on securities during  which more than offset the increase in the average balance 
interest income from marketable equity securities  federal funds and other interest earning assets decreased  or for the year ended december  when compared to as a result of lower interest rates in during the year ended december  securities increased more than loans 
as a result  the mix of the company s interest earning assets reflected a decrease in total loans as a percentage of total average interest earning assets compared to the prior year end as loans averaged compared to during  a direct result of slower loan growth and a larger increase in securities 
securities averaged of the total and other interest earning asset categories averaged for december  during the comparable mix was in securities and in the other interest earning asset categories 
total interest expense decreased million or to million during the year ended december  as compared to million during the same period in the decrease was attributable to a decrease in interest rates partially offset by an increase in average interest bearing liabilities of million or 
average interest bearing deposits increased million or while the average rate paid decreased from at december  to at december  average time deposits decreased million or and the average rate paid decreased basis points 
average interest bearing demand deposits increased million or while the average rate paid decreased basis points 
average savings deposits increased million or while the average rate paid decreased basis points 
average noninterest bearing demand deposits increased million or during the latter three categories  which are considered the lowest cost deposits  comprised of total average deposits during the year ended december  compared to during and during the increase in average total deposits is reflective of overall bank growth and branch expansion 
the company s current policy allows for a maximum of million in brokered cds 
the potential higher interest cost and lack of customer loyalty are risks associated with the use of brokered cds 
at december   and december   the company had no brokered cds and brokered cds represented zero percent of deposits

fhlb advances are collateralized by fhlb stock  securities and nonspecific real estate loans 
average short term junior subordinated debentures increased million or during the year ended december  when compared to same period in the increase is due to the fact that on september   the company announced it would redeem on october  the million of long term junior subordinated debentures the company originally issued during this reflects the reclassification of the long term junior subordinated debentures to short term until they were redeemed

due to the decline in major stock market indexes for three straight years combined with low interest rates the company s rate of return on plan assets did not achieve a return for the years ended december   and during  the company achieved a return above the assumed long term rate of return 
the company will continue to evaluate the assumed long term rate of return of to determine if it should be changed in the future 
if this assumption were decreased the cost and funding required for the retirement plan could increase 
health and life insurance expense increased slightly by  or for the year ended december  due to increased health claims expense and reinsurance costs 
health insurance costs are rising nationwide and these costs may increase in net occupancy expense increased  or for the year ended december  compared to the same period in  largely due to branch expansion  higher real estate taxes and depreciation expense 
atm and bank analysis fees increased  or for the year ended december  compared to the same period in due primarily to overall deposit and activity growth and a decrease in the earnings credit rate due to lower interest rates 
amortization expense increased  or  due to the redemption of southside capital trust i cumulative trust preferred securities 
the unamortized origination cost associated with the redemption was expensed during the third quarter of other expense increased  or during the year ended december  compared to the increase was due primarily to the retirement of assets in a grocery store branch  liability insurance  personnel placement fees  other losses and bank examination fees 
the retirement of assets in the grocery branch was a result of relocating the branch within the store prior to fully depreciating the original lease improvements 
income taxes income tax expense was million for the year ended december  and represented a  or increase from the year ended december  the effective tax rate as a percentage of pre tax income was in  in and in the increase in the effective tax rate and income tax expense for was due to the increase in taxable income for the year ended december  when compared to december  the increase in taxable income was partially a result of a decrease in tax free income during the company decreased its municipal securities portfolio during and has further decreased it during the first quarter of to reduce the overall level of tax free income from the securities portfolio and to allow the company the opportunity to grow its municipal loan portfolio 
during and the company was in an alternative minimum tax position due to unusually high retirement expenses  the one time million amortization expense during and the level of tax free income 
the company will not have the amortization expense in and has the ability to and is addressing the appropriate level of tax free income so as to not be in an alternative minimum tax position 
because management believes  based on this information  this is reversible in the future no valuation allowance is deemed necessary at this time 
december  compared to december  overview during the year ended december   the company s net income increased million or to million  from million for the same period in the increase in net income was primarily attributable to an increase in noninterest income and net interest income due to the increase in earning assets 
noninterest income increased primarily due to the increases in deposit services income  bank owned life insurance income  mortgage servicing release fees income  and trust income 
these increases were partially offset by an increase in noninterest expense and provision for loan losses 
the majority of the increase in noninterest expense was a result of bank growth and the costs associated with the opening of five new branches 
earnings per share of represented an increase of or over the year ended december  net interest income net interest income for the year ended december  was million  an increase of million or compared to the same period in the overall increase in net interest income was due to the fact that decreases in interest income from loans and securities were more than offset by decreases in interest expense from deposits and other borrowings which increased the net yield on average interest earning assets 
average interest earning assets increased million or  and the net yield on average interest earning assets increased from at december  to at december  during the fourth quarter ended december  the company s net interest margin was and the net interest spread was which reflected a decrease when compared to the same quarter in the net interest margin and net interest spread for the quarter ended december  was and  respectively 
the decrease in the net interest margin and spread during the fourth quarter of was due in part to lower mortgage interest rates and the lower overall interest rate environment which led to substantially increased residential mortgage refinancings nationwide and in the company s market area combined with substantially increased repricings of all of the company s other loan types 
as interest rates decreased during  the company s yield on premium mortgage backed securities decreased as prepayment speeds increased 
this decrease in yield  along with the decrease in the yield on average loans  combined to decrease the net yield on average earning assets 
during the year ended december   average loans  funded by the growth in average deposits  increased million or  compared to the same period in the average yield on loans decreased from at december  to at december   reflective of an overall decrease in interest rates 
as interest rates declined  especially short term interest rates  loan customers increasingly requested floating rate loans  which lowered the overall yield on loans 
in addition  the company experienced a large number of loan customers that requested loan repricings due to lower interest rates offered to them by competing financial institutions 
the decrease in interest income on loans of million or was the result of the decrease in interest rates partially offset by the increase in average loans 
average investment and mortgage backed securities increased million or for the year ended december  when compared to the same period in this increase was primarily a result of a slight increase in the company s leverage strategy 
the overall yield on average investment and mortgage backed securities decreased to during the year ended december  from during the same period in  due in part to increased prepayment speeds on mortgage backed securities which led to increased amortization expense and increased cash to reinvest in a lower interest rate environment 
during the repositioning of the securities portfolio in an attempt to lower duration also decreased the overall yield on the securities portfolio 
interest income on investment and mortgage backed securities decreased million in or compared to due to the decrease in the average yield of securities during  which more than offset the increase in the average balance 
interest income from marketable equity securities  federal funds and other interest earning assets decreased  or for the year ended december  when compared to as a result of lower interest rates in during the year ended december   the mix of the company s interest earning assets reflected an increase in total loans compared to the prior year end as loans averaged of total average interest earning assets compared to during  a direct result of loan growth 
securities averaged of the total and other interest earning asset categories averaged for december  during the comparable mix was in securities and in the other interest earning asset categories 
total interest expense decreased million or to million during the year ended december  as compared to million during the same period in the decrease was attributable to a decrease in interest rates partially offset by an increase in average interest bearing liabilities of million or 
average interest bearing deposits increased million or while the average rate paid decreased from at december  to at december  average time deposits increased million or while the average rate paid decreased basis points 
average interest bearing demand deposits increased million or while the average rate paid decreased basis points 
average savings deposits increased million or while the average rate paid decreased basis points 
average noninterest bearing demand deposits increased million or during the latter three categories  which are considered the lowest cost deposits  comprised of total average deposits during the year ended december  compared to during and during the increase in average total deposits was reflective of overall bank growth and branch expansion 
during the second quarter ended june   the company issued million of long term brokered cds with one year call options and additional call options every six months thereafter  until the cds mature 
the average yield on these cds was with an average life of years 
obtaining this long term funding enabled the company to take advantage of the higher interest rate environment  primarily through the purchase of securities without incurring significant additional interest rate risk 
the higher cost associated with these callable cds had a negative impact on net interest spread during the five quarters ended june  the options associated with these cds provided the bank with valuable balance sheet opportunities 
in conjunction with the issuance of these long term brokered cds  securities were purchased with an overall duration and yield that approximated the brokered cds 
during march  the company notified cd holders that million of brokered cds were being called april  the company recorded  of additional interest expense associated with the call of the cds during the first quarter ended march  gains on sales of securities were used to offset this expense 
during april  the company notified cd holders that the remaining million of brokered cds would be called may  an additional  of expense was incurred during the second quarter ending june   associated with the call of the brokered cds 
these cds were replaced with long term advances from the fhlb at an average rate of approximately 
as a result  the company s interest expense on this million declined after the cds were called 
the company s current policy allows for a maximum of million in brokered cds 
the potential higher interest cost and lack of customer loyalty are risks associated with the use of brokered cds 
at december  and december   the company had no brokered cds and brokered cds represented zero percent of deposits 
average short term interest bearing liabilities  consisting primarily of fhlb advances and federal funds purchased  were million  a decrease of million or for the year ended december  when compared to the same period in interest expense associated with short term interest bearing liabilities decreased million or and the average rate paid decreased basis points for the year ended december  when compared to the same period in average long term interest bearing liabilities consisting of fhlb advances increased million or during the year ended december  to million as compared to million at december  interest expense associated with long term fhlb advances decreased  or and the average rate paid decreased basis points for the year ended december  when compared to the same period in the long term advances were obtained from the fhlb primarily to fund long term securities and to a lesser extent long term loans 
fhlb advances are collateralized by fhlb stock  securities and nonspecific real estate loans

total charge offs for commercial loans increased  from december  due to the increase in small business loans charged off resulting from the slower economy in the company s market area 
total charge offs for loans to individuals increased  from december  reflective of increased consumer bankruptcies 
total charge offs for real estate loans and construction loans increased  and  respectively from december  primarily due to charge offs associated with one builder and one of his clients 
total recoveries decreased  from december  primarily as a result of two recoveries on old charge offs the company received during that totaled as of december   the company s review of the loan portfolio indicated that a loan loss allowance of million was adequate to cover probable losses in the portfolio 
noninterest income noninterest income consists of revenues generated from a broad range of financial services and activities including fee based services

the company sold securities out of its afs portfolio to accomplish alco and investment portfolio objectives aimed at repositioning and reducing the overall duration of the securities portfolio in an effort to maximize the total return of the securities portfolio 
sales of afs securities were the result of changes in economic conditions and a change in the desired mix of the securities portfolio 
during  interest rates declined and the yield curve remained steep 
the company used this interest rate environment to reposition the securities portfolio in an attempt to lower the overall duration and minimize prepayment of the premium mortgage backed securities 
higher coupon premium mortgage backed securities with high selling prices or with a potentially greater prepayment exposure were replaced with mortgage backed securities that had characteristics which potentially might reduce the prepayment exposure 
in some cases  higher coupon premium year mortgage backed securities with prepayment exposure were replaced with lower coupon premium year mortgage backed securities which lowered the overall duration and potentially reduced the prepayment exposure 
specific lower coupon or long duration municipal securities were sold and partially replaced with higher coupon municipal securities 
the increase in deposit services income of million or was a result of increases in overdraft income  increased numbers of deposit accounts and increased deposit activity 
bank owned life insurance income increased  or

the net increase in cash surrender value is shown as a component of noninterest income 
gain on sale of loans increased  or due to the significant increase in mortgage loan refinancings the company handled during as a result of the lower interest rate environment 
trust income increased  or due to growth in the trust department 
other noninterest income decreased  or primarily as a result of decreases in travelers express income combined with an increase in the loss associated with bsc securities and countywide

income taxes income tax expense was million for the year ended december  and represented a million or decrease from the year ended december  the effective tax rate as a percentage of pre tax income was in  in and in the decrease in the effective tax rate and income tax expense for was due to the increase in tax free income for the year ended december  when compared to december  capital resources total shareholders equity at december  of million increased or million from december  and represented of total assets at december  compared to at december  net income for of million was the major contributor to the increase in shareholders equity at december  along with the issuance of million in common stock  shares through conversions of southside capital trust ii s preferred securities into the company s common stock and the company s incentive stock option and dividend reinvestment plans 
decreases to shareholders equity consisted of a decrease of million in accumulated other comprehensive income  million in dividends paid and the purchase of million in common stock  shares 
the company purchased common stock pursuant to a common stock repurchase plan instituted in late under the repurchase plan  the board of directors establishes  on a quarterly basis  total dollar limitations 
the board reviews this plan in conjunction with the capital needs of the company and southside bank and may  at its discretion  modify or discontinue the plan 
during the third quarter of  the company issued a stock dividend  which had no net effect on shareholders equity 
the company s dividend policy requires that any cash dividend payments made by the company not exceed consolidated earnings for that year 
shareholders should not anticipate a continuation of the cash dividend simply because of the implementation of a dividend reinvestment program 
the payment of dividends will depend upon future earnings  the financial condition of the company  and other related factors including the discretion of the board of directors 
the bank is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies 
failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that  if undertaken  could have a direct material effect on the bank s financial statements 
under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action  the bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of the bank s assets  liabilities  and certain off balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices 
the bank s capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components  risk weightings  and other factors 
quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require the bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios set forth in the table below of total and tier capital as defined in the regulations to risk weighted assets as defined  and of tier capital as defined to average assets as defined 
management believes  as of december   that the bank meets all capital adequacy requirements to which it is subject

 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin  which covers guarantees such as standby letters of credit  performance guarantees  and direct or indirect guarantees of the indebtedness of others  but not guarantees of funding 
fin requires a guarantor to recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability in an amount equal to the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee  and requires disclosure about maximum potential payments that might be required  as well as the collateral or other recourse obtainable 
the recognition and measurement provisions of fin were effective on a prospective basis after december  the adoption of fin did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
consolidation of variable interest entities fin  which establishes guidance for determining when an entity should consolidate another entity that meets the definition of a variable interest entity 
fin requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company will absorb a majority of the expected losses  will receive a majority of the expected residual returns  or both 
transferors to qualified special purpose entities qspes and certain other interests in a qspe are not subject to the requirements of fin on december   the fasb revised fin fin r and deferred the effective date of fin to no later than the end of the first reporting period that ends after march   however  for special purpose entities the company would be required to apply fin as of december  the company adopted fin in connection with its consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  fin required the company to de consolidate its investments in southside statutory trust iii in its financial statements 
effective december   the company deconsolidated the wholly owned issuing trust entity resulting in a recharacterization of the underlying consolidated debt obligation from the previous trust preferred securities obligation to the junior subordinated debenture obligation that exist between the company and the issuing trust entity 
as a result of adopting fin on december   the company did not restate its prior period consolidated financial statements 
in july  the board of governors of the federal reserve issued a supervisory letter instructing bank holding companies to continue to include the trust preferred securities in their tier capital for regulatory capital purposes until notice is given to the contrary 
the federal reserve intends to review the regulatory implications of any accounting treatment changes and  if necessary or warranted  provide further appropriate guidance 
there can be no assurance that the federal reserve will continue to permit institutions to include trust preferred securities in tier capital for regulatory capital purposes 
if  as of december   the company was not permitted to include a portion of the million in trust preferred securities issued by southside statutory trust iii in its tier capital  the company would still exceed the regulatory required minimums for capital adequacy purposes 
if the trust preferred securities were no longer permitted to be included in tier capital  the company would also be permitted to redeem the capital securities

revised  employers disclosures about pensions and postretirement benefits 
this statement requires additional disclosures about the assets  obligations and cash flows of defined benefit pension and postretirement plans  as well as the expense recorded for such plans 
as of december   the company has disclosed the required elements related to its defined benefit pension plan in note to these consolidated financial statements 
effects of inflation the consolidated financial statements of the company  and their related notes  have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  that require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars  without considering the change in the relative purchasing power of money over time and due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of the company s operations 
unlike many industrial companies  nearly all of the assets and liabilities of the company are monetary 
as a result  interest rates have a greater impact on the company s performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the price of goods and services 
management of liquidity liquidity management involves the ability to convert assets to cash with a minimum of loss 
the company must be capable of meeting its obligations to its customers at any time 
this means addressing the immediate cash withdrawal requirements of depositors and other funds providers  the funding requirements of all lines and letters of credit  and the short term credit needs of customers 
liquidity is provided by short term investments that can be readily liquidated with a minimum risk of loss 
cash  interest earning deposits  federal funds sold and short term investments with maturities or repricing characteristics of one year or less continue to be a substantial percentage of total assets 
at december   these investments were of total assets  as compared with for december   and for december  liquidity is further provided through the matching  by time period  of rate sensitive interest earning assets with rate sensitive interest bearing liabilities 
the company has three lines of credit for the purchase of federal funds 
two million and one million unsecured lines of credit have been established with bank of america  frost bank and texas independent bank  respectively 
the asset liability management committee of the bank closely monitors various liquidity ratios  interest rate spreads and margins  interest rate shock reports and market value of portfolio equity with rates shocked plus and minus basis points to ensure the company a satisfactory liquidity position 
market value of portfolio equity is defined as the net present value of an institution s existing assets  liabilities and off balance sheet instruments 
market value of portfolio equity analysis is one of the general measures used by regulatory authorities for assessing an institution s interest rate risk 
the extent to which assets will gain or lose value in relation to the gains or losses of liabilities and or interest rate contracts determines the appreciation or depreciation in equity on a market value basis 
such market value analysis is intended to evaluate the impact of immediate and sustained parallel interest rate shifts of the current yield curve upon the market value of the current balance sheet 
in addition  the bank utilizes a simulation model to determine the impact on net interest income under several different interest rate scenarios 
by utilizing this technology  the bank attempts to determine changes that need to be made to the asset and liability mix to minimize the change in net interest income under these various interest rate scenarios 
the bank uses fhlb as a significant source of liquidity 
fhlb advances are collateralized by fhlb stock  nonspecified real estate loans and securities 
if this source of funding were not available the costs associated with obtaining funding to replace fhlb advances maturing could be more expensive or could be unavailable 
in the event alternative funding was not available  sales of securities would be necessary to provide liquidity which could impact net income 
the bank issues letters of credit and has unfunded loan commitments and lines of credit 
if all of these were to fund at one time the company would need to draw on some of it s sources of liquidity which would include fhlb advances  federal funds purchase lines  brokered cd s  or the sale of securities 
contractual cash obligations the following summarizes the company s contractual cash obligations and commercial commitments at december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on liquidity and cash flow in future periods

the total balance of debt was million at december  with a scheduled maturity date of the company had fhlb advances with maturity dates ranging from through  with a total balance of  at december  the company had various operating leases for its copy machines that total  and expire on or before the end of in addition  the company has operating leases totaling million on its retail branch locations which have future commitments of up to five years and additional options  the company controls  beyond the commitment period 
the bank has deferred compensation agreements with seven officers of the company and the bank totaling million 
payments from the plan are to commence at the time of retirement 
as of december   no payments had been made from the plan 
of the seven officers included in the plan  two were eligible for retirement at december  and one is eligible for retirement in april all other officers are eligible at various times after five years 
the totals reflected under five years assume the two eligible officers could retire at any time and the officer eligible in will retire at the scheduled retirement date 
the table on page shows the expected maturities for interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities as of december  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the banking industry  a major risk exposure is changing interest rates 
the primary objective of monitoring the company s interest rate sensitivity  or risk  is to provide management the tools necessary to manage the balance sheet to minimize adverse changes in net interest income as a result of changes in the direction and level of interest rates 
federal reserve monetary control efforts  the effects of deregulation and legislative changes have been significant factors affecting the task of managing interest rate sensitivity positions in recent years 
the interest rate risk inherent in assets and liabilities may be determined by analyzing the extent to which such assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive and by measuring an institution s interest rate sensitivity gap 
an asset or liability is said to be interest rate sensitive within a defined time period if it matures or reprices within that period 
the difference or mismatch between the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within a defined period and the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within the same period is defined as the interest rate sensitivity gap 
an institution is considered to have a negative gap if the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within a specified time period exceeds the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within the same period 
if more interest earning assets than interest bearing liabilities mature or reprice within a specified period  then the institution is considered to have a positive gap 
accordingly  in a rising interest rate environment in an institution with a negative gap  the cost of its rate sensitive liabilities would theoretically rise at a faster pace than the yield on its rate sensitive assets  thereby diminishing future net interest income 
in a falling interest rate environment  a negative gap would indicate that the cost of rate sensitive liabilities would decline at a faster pace than the yield on rate sensitive assets and improve net interest income 
for an institution with a positive gap  the reverse would be expected 
the table on page shows interest sensitivity gaps for four different intervals as of december  in an attempt to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates  management closely monitors the company s exposure to interest rate risk 
management maintains an asset liability committee which meets regularly and reviews the company s interest rate risk position and makes recommendations for adjusting this position 
in addition  the board reviews on a monthly basis the company s asset liability position 
the company primarily uses two methods for measuring and analyzing interest rate risk net income simulation analysis and market value of portfolio equity modeling 
through these simulations the company attempts to estimate the impact on net interest income of a basis point parallel shift in the yield curve 
policy guidelines limit the estimated change in net interest income to percent of forecasted net income over the succeeding months and basis point parallel rate shock 
policy guidelines limit the change in market value of equity in a basis point parallel rate shock to percent of the base case 
the results of the valuation analysis as of december   were within policy guidelines 
due to the level of interest at december   many of the interest rates cannot move down basis points 
as part of the overall assumptions  certain assets and liabilities have been given reasonable floors 
in the present interest rate environment  management is primarily focusing on the shock down basis points and the shock up and basis points 
this type of stimulation analysis requires numerous assumptions including but not limited to changes in balance sheet mix  prepayment rates on mortgage related assets and fixed rate loans  cash flows and repricings of all financial instruments  changes in volumes and pricing  future shapes of the yield curve  relationship of market interest rates to each other basis risk  credit spread and deposit sensitivity 
assumptions are based on management s best estimates but may not accurately reflect actual results under certain changes in interest rates

municipal loans are assumed to prepay at an annual rate between and 
fixed and adjustable rate mortgage backed securities  including collateralized mortgage obligations cmos and real estate mortgage investment conduits remics  have annual payment assumptions ranging from to 
at december   the contractual maturity of substantially all of the company s mortgage backed or related securities was in excess of ten years 
the actual maturity of a mortgage backed or related security is less than its stated maturity due to regular principal payments and prepayments of the underlying mortgages 
prepayments that are faster than anticipated may shorten the life of the security and affect its yield to maturity 
the yield to maturity is based upon the interest income and the amortization of any premium or discount related to the security 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  premiums and discounts are amortized over the estimated lives of the loans  which decrease and increase interest income  respectively 
the prepayment assumptions used to determine the amortization period for premiums and discounts can significantly affect the yield of the mortgage backed or related security  and these assumptions are reviewed periodically to reflect actual prepayments 
although prepayments of underlying mortgages depend on many factors  including the type of mortgages  the coupon rate  the age of mortgages  the geographical location of the underlying real estate collateralizing the mortgages and general levels of market interest rates  the difference between the interest rates on the underlying mortgages and the prevailing mortgage interest rates generally is the most significant determinant of the rate of prepayments 
during periods of falling mortgage interest rates  if the coupon rate of the underlying mortgages exceeds the prevailing market interest rates offered for mortgage loans  refinancing may increase and accelerate the prepayment of the underlying mortgages and the related security 
at december   of the million of mortgage backed and related securities held by the company  all were secured by fixed rate mortgage loans 
the company assumes of savings accounts and transaction accounts at december   are core deposits and are  therefore  expected to roll off after five years

fixed maturity deposits reprice at maturity 
in evaluating the company s exposure to interest rate risk  certain limitations inherent in the method of analysis presented in the foregoing table must be considered 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
also  the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
additionally  certain assets  such as adjustable rate mortgages  have features which restrict changes in interest rates  prepayment and early withdrawal levels may deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the table 
finally  the ability of many borrowers to service their debt may decrease in the event of an interest rate increase 
the company considers all of these factors in monitoring its exposure to interest rate risk

the asset liability management committee of the bank closely monitors the desired gap along with various liquidity ratios to ensure a satisfactory liquidity position for the company 
management continually evaluates the condition of the economy  the pattern of market interest rates and other economic data to determine the types of investments that should be made and at what maturities 
using this analysis  management from time to time assumes calculated interest sensitivity gap positions to maximize net interest income based upon anticipated movements in the general level of interest rates 
regulatory authorities also monitor the bank s gap position along with other liquidity ratios 
in addition  the bank utilizes a simulation model to determine the impact of net interest income under several different interest rate scenarios 
by utilizing this technology  the bank can determine changes that need to be made to the asset and liability mixes to minimize the change in net interest income under these various interest rate scenarios
