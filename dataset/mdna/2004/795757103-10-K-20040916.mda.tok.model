discussion of critical accounting policies our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which require us to make estimates and judgments that significantly affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we regularly evaluate these estimates  including those related to our allowance for doubtful accounts  reserve for inventory valuation  reserve for returns and allowances  valuation of reporting units with goodwill  valuation of intangible assets having indefinite lives  cooperative advertising accruals  pension benefits and depreciation and amortization 
we base these estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that are believed by management to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates  which may impact the carrying value of assets and liabilities 
the following critical accounting policies required the most significant estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements allowance for doubtful accounts we calculate allowances for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we utilize a number of tools to evaluate and mitigate our customer credit risk 
management evaluates each new customer account using a combination of some or all of the following sources of information credit bureau reports  industry credit group reports  customer financial statement analysis  customer supplied credit references and bank references 
appropriate credit limits are set in accordance with our credit risk policy and monitored on an on going basis 
existing customers are monitored and credit limits are adjusted according to changes in their financial condition 
based on the procedures outlined herein  and the fact that no customer accounted for or more of the gross accounts receivable at july  and june   we believe there is no concentration of credit risk 
our exposure to credit loss on our foreign currency forward contracts in the event of non performance by the counterparties is believed to be remote due to the requirements that the counterparties consist only of major financial institutions that have a long term credit rating of single a or better from both moody s and standard poor s 
additionally  our foreign currency forward contracts generally have a term of one year or less 
inventory valuation the company values inventory at the lower of cost or market  and regularly reviews the book value of discontinued product lines and stock keeping units skus to determine if these items are properly valued 
if market value is less than cost  the company writes down the related inventory to the estimated net realizable value 
the company regularly evaluates the composition of inventory to identify slow moving and obsolete inventories to determine if additional write downs are required 
the company s domestic inventories are generally determined by the last in  first out lifo method 
these inventories account for approximately and of the company s inventories as of and  respectively 
all remaining inventory cost is determined on the first in  first out basis 
see note inventories 
commitments and contingencies we are subject to lawsuits and other claims related to product and other matters that are being defended and handled in the ordinary course of business 
we maintain reserves and or accruals for such costs that may be incurred  which are determined on a case by case basis  taking into consideration the likelihood of adverse judgments or outcomes  as well as the potential range of probable loss 
the reserves and accruals are monitored on an ongoing basis and are updated for new developments or new information as appropriate 
intangible assets we record intangible assets through transactions and acquisitions 
the cost of acquisitions are allocated to the assets and liabilities acquired  including identifiable intangible assets  with the remaining amount being classified as goodwill 
under current accounting guidelines that became effective on july   goodwill arising from transactions occurring after july  and any existing goodwill as of june  are not amortized to expense but rather assessed for annually for impairment 
other intangible assets that have an indefinite life are also assessed annually for impairment 
the allocation of the acquisition cost to intangible assets and goodwill therefore has a significant impact on our future operating results 
the allocation process requires the extensive use of estimates and assumptions  including estimates of future cash flows expected to be generated by the acquired assets 
further  when impairment indicators are identified with respect to previously recorded intangible assets  the values of the assets are determined using a variety of techniques including discounted future cash flows  which are based on estimated future operating results 
significant management judgment is required in the forecasting of future operating results  which are used in the preparation of projected discounted cash flows 
year in review in  salton continued its focus on increasing international opportunities and during the fourth quarter  launched an effort to return its domestic business to profitability 
fiscal year was our first full year of consolidating the financial results of amap 
we also started expansion into brazil  italy  spain and germany 
however  our international growth was offset by the continued decline in sales and profitability of the domestic operations 
as part of an effort to improve profitability in our domestic operations  we announced a us restructuring plan in the domestic market in order to better align domestic operating costs with current sales levels 
we expect to generate at least million in annual cost savings from our us restructuring plan when fully implemented in fiscal through a reduction in operating expenses and a consolidation of us operations 
we completed the initial phase of this us restructuring plan by reducing headcount in the domestic operations by approximately in the fourth quarter of fiscal the salaried headcount reduction is expected to reduce annualized costs by million 
in connection with the us restructuring plan and subsequent valuation reviews in light of those decisions  we recorded certain pretax charges in the fourth quarter as follows million write down of certain inventory identified for liquidation as part of the company s decision to rationalize warehouse and distribution facilities million of intangible asset impairment charge associated with trademarks effected by the restructuring plan million fixed assets charge related primarily to tooling million write down of costs associated with several marketing programs that were discontinued million in consulting and legal costs directly associated with the development and implementation of the us restructuring plan  and in termination and severance costs associated with the headcount reduction in the us other items impacting the third quarter results include million impairment charge consisting of consolidated goodwill and certain other indefinite lived intangible assets see impairment loss on goodwill and intangible assets 
other items impacting the fourth quarter and fiscal year end results include million valuation allowance against certain foreign income tax credits million pre tax loss on the early extinguishment of debt the restructuring costs and other items listed above affected comparability of reported operating income  net income and earnings per share for the fourth quarter and fiscal year results of operations the following table sets forth our results of operations as a percentage of net sales for the years ended july  june  june  net sales cost of goods sold distribution expenses gross profit selling  general and administrative expense lawsuit settlements  net impairment loss on goodwill and intangible assets restructuring costs operating loss income includes million of net sales of fourth quarter restructuring costs see year in review 
consists of an aggregate of million of impairment charges see impairment loss on goodwill and intangible assets 
compared to net sales and gross profit salton reached billion in net sales for compared to the million reported in the largest increase was the inclusion of a full year of amap s results which amounted to million of additional sales 
in addition  salton had million of exchange rate gain and million of other foreign sales increases 
the other foreign sales increases were primarily driven by the george foreman and russell hobbs product lines 
while foreman sales continued to increase internationally  domestic volume decline in the first half of the year was the primary reason for a million decrease in domestic sales for the fiscal year 
management believes foreman will continue its success overseas as we expand our foreign operations and introduce the foreman grill in new markets 
in addition  the launch of the new george foreman grills with removable plates the next grilleration is expected to help accelerate the replacement cycle among existing customers in north america  a factor in further stabilizing domestic sales volumes 
gross profit for declined million from million in to million in as a percent of net sales  it was in compared to in  a decrease of 
these decreases are attributed to a million decline in domestic gross profit associated with a volume and mix shift from higher margin george foreman products to lower margin new products such as the westinghouse electrics  melitta one one and various other new products introduced at the international housewares show 
as part of the million of domestic decline in operations  we incurred million of fourth quarter charges in connection with the us restructuring plan announced on may  these costs included inventory and tooling write downs associated with the company s decision to rationalize warehouse and distribution facilities and exit certain marketing programs 
the decreases caused by domestic gross profit declines and us restructuring costs were partially offset by a million increase due to the inclusion of a full year of amap s gross profit  million in foreign currency gains and million in other foreign gross profit increases associated with growth and expansion of our international subsidiaries 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased to of net sales or million in compared to of net sales or million for the million increase in selling  general and administrative was due to increases of million driven by international growth from expansion  including million from amap and million from other foreign increases as the company launched new products internationally and expanded operations on the european continent and in brazil 
the remaining million were of international increases attributed to foreign currency fluctuations 
selling  general and administrative expenses for domestic operations increased million 
as a result of approximately million of additional expenditures for television  royalty expense  certain other media and cooperative advertising and trade show expenses 
of the million  approximately million related to cooperative advertising and promotional activities associated with an aggressive retailer position following product shortages during the holidays 
it was management s intention to drive additional sales through significant new product introductions 
we had varied success on the new product launches and continued to experience declines in overall domestic sales in the first three quarters  which was the primary driver of the us restructuring plans  launched in the fourth quarter 
as part of those plans  we incurred a million charge associated with the termination of certain advertising and marketing programs as part of our us restructuring plan 
these increases from domestic operations were offset by million of various other insignificant decreases in other selling  general and administrative expense categories 
impairment loss on goodwill and intangible assets effective with the beginning of fiscal year  we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
upon adoption of sfas no 
 we discontinued the amortization of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets 
goodwill and intangible assets that are not amortized are subject to a fair value based impairment test on an annual basis or more frequently if circumstances indicate a potential impairment 
the annual test for impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets is conducted during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year 
at the beginning of  management believed that projected operating results would validate the amount of goodwill and other intangible assets on the financial statements 
as discussed in our annual report on form k filed with the securities and exchange commission  shortfalls in future operating results or the application of more conservative market assumptions could have an adverse affect on the comparison of fair value to carrying value for goodwill and other intangible assets 
management determined that the combination of the shortfall beginning in the third quarter in meeting projected operating results along with the our inability to meet financial debt covenants required for the senior secured revolving credit facility for two consecutive quarters and a downgrade in the debt rating could have such an adverse effect  and as such  an interim impairment test was necessary 
a valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets was conducted 
the valuation incorporated performance through the third quarter 
the valuation did not incorporate the future us restructuring plan that management started in the fourth quarter of fiscal as a result  we determined that the implied fair value of goodwill and the fair value of certain other indefinite lived intangible assets were less than their carrying values 
we recorded a non cash impairment charge totaling million pre tax or million net of tax  consisting of consolidated goodwill of million and certain other indefinite lived intangible assets associated with icebox of million 
in conjunction with the us restructuring plan and extensive individual product line reviews  we completed our annual test for impairment of indefinite lived intangible assets as of the end of the fourth quarter 
as a result  we determined that an additional charge of million was necessary against trademarks impacted by the us restructuring plan 
restructuring costs as a result of our us restructuring plan  we incurred million in restructuring costs consisting of million for consulting and legal costs directly associated with the development and implementation of the restructuring plan and million associated with the termination and severance cost as a result of a us headcount reduction in the fourth quarter 
net interest expense net interest expense was million for both fiscal and fiscal our rate of interest on amounts outstanding under the revolver  term loan and senior subordinated debt was a weighted average annual rate of in fiscal compared to in fiscal the average amount of all debt outstanding was million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal this was a result of lower average borrowings under the current and former revolver and term loan agreement and our repayment of certain other obligations 
loss on early extinguishment of debt during the fourth quarter  the company incurred a non cash pretax charge of million for the write off of unamortized financing costs under the previous credit agreement

compared to net sales and gross profit salton s net sales for were million 
this represented a decrease of compared to while overall sales in the domestic market decreased  our strong portfolio of brand names contributed to our success internationally 
we experienced significant volume decreases in the domestic market as a result of a disappointing holiday season at retail 
this left retailers overstocked during the third quarter of fiscal further depressing sales 
in addition  we experienced a decrease of approximately million in net sales attributable to domestic price reductions in an effort to gain long term market presence  an initiative to reduce domestic inventory levels and reduce the number of stock keeping units skus the company carries in inventory 
these actions occurred primarily in the second half of these decreases were offset by just over million in international sales increases primarily associated with the george foreman and russell hobbs brands  foreign currency fluctuations of million  the inclusion of approximately million of sales from amap for the period of may  through june  and the inclusion of approximately million of sales from the look for acquisition  now renamed salton france

liquidity and capital resources cash flow from operations our primary sources of liquidity are our cash flow from operations and borrowings under our senior secured revolving credit facility 
in  salton s operations provided million in cash flow  compared with million in this decrease is primarily a result of decreased profits and higher international inventories  offset by decreases in accounts receivable and increases in accounts payable

our results of operations for the periods discussed have not been significantly affected by inflation or foreign currency fluctuation 
we generally negotiate our purchase orders with our foreign manufacturers in united states dollars
