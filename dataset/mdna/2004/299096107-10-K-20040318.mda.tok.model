executive overview business evans sutherland computer corporation evans sutherland  e s  we  our  or the company produces high quality visual systems used to display images of the real world rapidly and accurately 
e s is widely regarded as both a pioneer and a leader in providing the world s most realistic visual systems 
we design  manufacture  market and support visual systems for simulation with solutions that meet the training requirements for a wide range of military and commercial applications 
we also provide this leading edge visual system technology and experience to planetariums  science centers  and entertainment venues 
we develop and deliver a complete line of image generators  displays  databases  services and support products that match technology to customer requirements 
our products and solutions range from the desktop pc to what we believe are the most advanced visual systems in the world 
highlights and outlook was an important year for e s 
we made substantial progress resolving many problems from prior years  and achieved initial success with new products and strategies 
this combination enabled us to achieve profitable operations in the final quarter of the year and lay the foundation for a return to sustained profitability in the future 
the problems from past years were in two general categories large military programs with cost overruns  and declining sales for our products 
the large military programs  which we refer to in this report as the big six programs  involved the delivery of advanced visual systems in the us and europe between and the total value was over million  which made up a substantial portion of our sales in those years 
the programs were complex in many ways  both contractually and technically  and for various reasons we fell behind and incurred large excess costs and penalties  creating losses which we were not able to offset in other parts of the business 
while these programs were extremely difficult for us and caused major financial stress  we nevertheless successfully completed and delivered all requirements  with the exception of a few remaining items which we expect to complete in early declining sales for our products occurred both for external and internal reasons 
the primary external reason was a drastic shrinkage in our markets following the events of september  commercial airlines suffered severe financial disruptions and generally reduced purchases of equipment 
in the united states military market  funds were diverted to operational requirements and purchases of simulation equipment fell sharply 
overall  our markets shrank to half their former size  a significant decline in any industry 
internally  we suffered from difficulties with our scheduling systems related to very complex programs and development 
our response was to shrink the size of our company in accordance with the size of our markets and with the completion of the big six programs  and to install new management and systems 
overall  we reduced employment by about from the peak in  while revenue has fallen by about from the same year 
we reduced other recurring costs similarly 
in addition  such a drastic reduction in the size of the company led us to reduce excess inventories procured for previously higher sales projections  as well as to recognize other restructuring charges 
to address the problems that we encountered with the big six programs and related development  we installed sophisticated new hardware and software infrastructure to provide more accurate and timely management of information 
these systems reached maturity in in our military market  and we have since had no further problems of the types encountered in earlier military programs such as the big six programs 
we had scheduled the installation of these same systems in in our united kingdom subsidiary  where we manage our commercial airline business 
however  prior to their installation we encountered problems there  arising from the incorrect recognition of costs  revenue  and profit on percent complete contracts 
to correct the errors  we restated the first three quarters of condensed consolidated financial statements  which were previously unaudited 
as a result  revenues were reduced and losses were increased for the quarters restated 
despite these actions  our transition to profitability in the fourth quarter was still achieved 
throughout this very difficult period  we steadfastly maintained investment in new products as the primary pathway to rebuilding the company once our markets stabilize 
we believe that these efforts have now begun to bear fruit  and will do so increasingly during and the years beyond 
in  we introduced new products in both our simulation and digital theater businesses  and delivered first prototypes of our new laser projector 
in  we anticipate we will continue to introduce new products in all these markets  with special emphasis on the delivery of the first production level model of the laser projector 
all of the new products have enjoyed enthusiastic acceptance from our customers  enabling us to gain market share in a down market 
we believe that our ep environment processor software is  in fact  revolutionary in its structure and impact on rapid development of databases for training and mission rehearsal  and we believe that the laser projector will revolutionize the market for large format  high accuracy displays 
we have already received patents on the laser projector  with a large number of additional patents in process but not yet awarded 
we expect the continued success of our new products to return the company to profitability for the full year  although the pattern of our current order book suggests we are likely to operate moderately below break even in the first half 
beyond this year  we anticipate a modest recovery in our markets in in addition  we believe the laser projector will start to ship in higher volumes in and beyond  contributing a substantial new revenue stream to the company and potentially opening entirely new markets 
because of the major cost reductions which we have already completed  and because of our major investment in systems and software for internal operations  our infrastructure is capable of meeting substantially higher sales requirements with very little increase in overhead or fixed costs 
therefore  we believe revenue growth will produce accelerating profit growth 
results of operations year ended december  sales    cost of sales    inventory impairment   gross profit    expenses selling  general  and administrative   research and development    restructuring charges    impairment loss  operating expenses    gain on curtailment of pension plan  gain on sale of assets held for sale   gain on sale of business unit operating loss    other income expense  net    loss before income taxes    income tax benefit  net loss    results of operations summary our sales significantly decreased primarily as a result of current conditions in the military market as military customers diverted funds to more pressing requirements 
deliveries to commercial customers also declined because of cutbacks by airline customers after the terrorist attacks in we did achieve sales growth in both our pc based image generators and planetarium systems as a result of strong demand for our new simfusion and digistar products 
our gross margins also declined in this was due primarily to a million inventory impairment caused by customer order cancellations as the military realigned its spending priorities 
however  offsetting the impairment charges was improvement due to essentially completing the six large harmony programs big six programs which have driven significant losses or extremely low margins in prior years 
we also saw a decrease in our commercial gross margins  but expect improvements in to offset current market conditions  we executed two restructuring plans in and reduced our headcount by approximately employees to reduce operating costs and create a cost structure in line with our anticipated sales 
these actions were the primary cause of our million reduction in our operating expenses from to we achieved strong reductions in our other expenses as we reduced interest expenses and debt levels in  and reduced income tax expenses 
more detailed explanations of our results are provided below 
consolidated sales and gross profit our total sales were million in  compared with million in and million in the sales decrease was driven mainly by a reduction in sales in the military market 
sales to the military market decreased in primarily because contained two large programs with significant final product deliveries 
no new programs of this magnitude were awarded during to produce replacement sales 
also contributing to a decrease in sales to the military market was that approximately of the remaining sales from our big six programs were recognized in  while approximately was recognized in four of these big six programs are now complete and the remaining two are complete 
sales to the commercial market also declined in while orders increased significantly in from this market  a significant portion of those orders will routinely be delivered in in addition  we experienced a slight decrease in service and support sales 
sales of our pc based image generator increased in as a result of a strong demand for our new simfusion products 
sales of our planetarium systems also increased significantly in   as a result of strong demand for our new digistar product 
from to sales to the military market decreased primarily as a result of a significant drop in orders over a period of these two years 
orders decreased approximately in and in sales of our pc based image generator declined approximately in because the updated simfusion product line was not launched until the third quarter of and customers were waiting for the release of this enhanced pc based image generator 
the new simfusion product generated orders and sales in the third and fourth quarters of in  sales of our planetarium systems declined as customers delayed their orders of existing products in anticipation of our next generation products  which have now been launched and are producing growth in orders and sales 
sales were also impacted by a worldwide slowdown of demand for planetarium equipment in in  we also sold our realimage business and discontinued the operations of our rapidsite business  therefore  losing related sales in these decreases in sales were partially offset by a slight increase in service and support sales 
trends in the commercial and military markets remained unchanged in  and are expected to continue through in the commercial market  commercial airlines have reduced purchases of new aircraft compared to prior years 
this has resulted in a reduction in the number of new simulators they require for training 
however  many commercial airlines are upgrading their currently installed simulators 
as a result  we have benefited from this change because we had a large share of the installed base of visual systems and because our newly introduced ep ct product provides an attractive upgrade path due to its compatibility with the installed base 
military markets have continued to shrink as funds are diverted to more pressing military requirements 
we believe this diversion of funds will continue during  but may result in some pent up demand in in the military and commercial markets some large prime contractors  with whom we may subcontract with  are moving the high margin database and software work in house instead of subcontracting out to other companies in order to protect their revenues and margins 
if this trend continues in future years it could negatively affect our revenues and profitability 
our gross margin percentages were in  compared with in and in our gross margins primarily decreased as a result of a million inventory impairment loss 
during certain significant orders that we had expected to receive as of december   and into early were cancelled by customers 
these cancellations were primarily the result of a re alignment of military spending priorities during the first part of accordingly  the future demand for our harmony  esig  and targetview products significantly decreased compared to our prior projections because of these cancellations 
as a result  we recorded a million impairment to specific inventory during note of the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements of this annual report on form k contains a detailed description of this impairment 
from to gross margins percentages on sales to the military market decreased significantly as a result of a majority of the million of inventory impairment consisting mainly of products sold in the military market 
offsetting this was a significant reduction in the negative impact that the big six programs had 
gross margin percentages on sales to commercial airline customers decreased significantly in as a result of pricing pressure that is currently in the commercial market and due to cost overruns 
in addition  we experienced higher than normal warranty and support costs due to part failures and an increase in our warranty provision for anticipated future warranty costs 
these decreases were slightly offset by a small increase in our service support gross margin percentages 
from to our gross margins increased significantly because the big six programs had less of a negative impact in than in these six programs heavily contributed either losses or small positive gross margins to s overall gross profit 
additionally  gross margins on sales to commercial airline customers were up as included both positive adjustments for completing programs below cost estimates and improved overall cost performance 
in gross margin improvements were offset by an inventory impairment loss of million related to our restructuring plan decision to exit the simfusion product line 
the million charge encompassed the total value for the simfusion inventory on hand 
we took this impairment write off because we anticipated reduced demand for simfusion products as a result of customer migration to the updated simfusion products 
operating expenses  other items and taxes our operating expenses were million in  compared with million in and million in selling  general  and administrative sg a expenses decreased million during we achieved significant sg a expense reductions primarily as a result of lower headcount and reductions in expenditures for travel  consultants  and facilities costs 
however  sg a expenses remained near the level because in we reversed previous bad debt accruals of million as a result of improved collection experience 
additionally  our sg a expenses in increased as a result of reductions in our rental income  which affect our rent expense 
research and development r d expenses decreased million in as a result of lower headcount and reduced development expenditures for materials and software 
sg a expenses decreased million during as a result of lower headcount  lower labor costs  reduced use of consultants  and lower overheads 
additionally  due to improved collection experience  previous bad debt accruals were reversed  which lowered sg a expenses 
sg a also decreased million in compared to as a result of our sale of the realimage solutions group in r d expenses decreased million in as a result of lower headcount  decreased effort on our integrator software product as it neared completion  and reduced overhead costs 
r d also decreased million in compared to as a result of our sale of the realimage solutions group in these r d decreases were partly offset by one time material purchases for the development of both our ep line of new visual systems for commercial simulation and our new pc based products 
during  we recorded restructuring charges of million related to reductions in force of approximately full time equivalent employees to reduce operating costs as well as to create a cost structure in line with anticipated sales 
we estimate that this restructuring will reduce expenses by approximately million per year going forward 
we are continuing cost reduction actions in order to further reduce operating expenses to return to profitable performance 
during  we recorded a restructuring charge of million related to a reduction in force of approximately employees in an attempt to reduce the operating cost structure as well as to create a cost structure in line with future sales 
we estimate that this restructuring reduced expenses by approximately million per year going forward 
during  we recorded a restructuring charge of million relating to a reduction in force of approximately employees 
during  we recognized an impairment loss of million on certain fixed assets specifically used to build  test  and demonstrate our harmony product 
during  we recognized an impairment loss of million on software licenses that were used by employees who were terminated as a result of the reduction in force actions 
during  we recognized an impairment loss of million related to the write off of goodwill acquired in the e s acquisition of accelgraphics  inc and silicon reality  inc in during  we recognized a gain on the amendment of our pension plan of million 
in order to match current market practices  the pension plan was amended to curtail accrual of future benefits 
at the same time  the e s k plan was amended to permit the board of directors to grant additional discretionary matching contributions based on profitability as well as other financial and operational considerations 
during  e s recognized a gain on assets held for sale of million on the sale of a building 
during  we recognized a gain on assets held for sale of million on the sale of a building 
during  we recognized a gain on the sale of assets held for sale of million due to the sale of certain d graphics patents and a gain on the sale of a business unit of million as a result of the sale of our realimage solutions group 
our other income expense was million in net expense in  million in net expense in  and million in net expense in interest expense decreased to million in from million in and from million in due to our continued reduction of debt 
during we also benefited from an increase in interest income  however this was offset primarily by a million write down of a nonmarketable investment in quantum vision  inc based on our analysis and meeting with quantum vision  inc in the first part of  we determined this technology would not enhance our own technology or strategic direction 
our income tax benefits were million in compared to million in and million in the income tax benefits in and were primarily due to the favorable resolution of certain potential tax liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries 
the income tax benefit was the result of a change in the us tax law  which allows us to use additional net operating losses to offset taxable income 
liquidity and capital resources overview summary information about our financial position as of december  and december   is presented in the following table in thousands cash and cash equivalents   restricted cash  line of credit agreements   net short term cash indebtedness   long term debt   net cash indebtedness   stockholders equity   during we continued to take actions to adjust our business in order to reach profitability  to complete certain harmony programs  and to market two of our salt lake city buildings for sale 
in addition  to bring costs in line with projected sales  we completed two restructurings during the year 
we moved closer to completion of the big six programs  with only two remaining for final completion at the end of this allowed us to collect million related to these programs 
we sold one of the two buildings we had for sale  with cash proceeds of million 
these events allowed us rely less on our credit facilities during than in our average balance outstanding on the credit facilities was million in compared to million in in the first quarter of we were able to finalize the renewal of both of our lines of credit providing a maximum borrowing capability of million 
in addition  as discussed under credit facilities below  we were in breach of one of the covenants at the end of the first quarter of that resulted in a waiver and an amended agreement  changing our financial covenants and increasing our interest rates on borrowings 
both line of credit agreements expire in december for  we foresee decreasing reliance on our credit facilities  helped by the expected sale of our last building that remains for sale  to provide cash to fund our operating activities 
over the past three years we have taken actions to reduce our operating cash requirements and our capital expenditure requirements 
while these actions have significantly reduced our total operating cash requirements  our current operations may not yield positive cash flow 
circumstances that could materially affect liquidity in include  but are not limited to  the following i our ability to successfully develop and produce new technologies and products  ii our ability to meet our forecasted sales levels during  iii our ability to reduce costs and expenses  and iv our ability to favorably negotiate a sale agreement related to the one building that is for sale 
for years beyond  if our projections are broadly correct and our markets start to recover in  we believe that cash from operations will be sufficient for our planned needs 
if our projections are incorrect  then we may need to continue to supplement cash from operations with borrowing facilities 
in addition  we have the option to use our remaining buildings that are currently not for sale to finance our operations by selling these buildings or using other options available at the time that decision is made 
also  we believe that long term our investment in research and development and our current product strategy will allow our business to grow  thus future funding requirements are anticipated to be provided from our operating activities 
we believe that existing cash  restricted cash  borrowings available under our various borrowing facilities  the sale of the one building currently held for sale  and expected cash from future operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated working capital needs  routine capital expenditures and current debt service obligations for the next twelve months 
at december   our total indebtedness was million 
both of our lines of credit expire in december if we continue to need these credit facilities  we may attempt to replace them  however  there can be no assurances that we will be successful in renegotiating our existing borrowing facilities or obtaining additional debt or equity financing 
our cash and restricted cash  subject to various restrictions previously set forth below  are available for working capital needs  capital expenditures  strategic investments  mergers and acquisitions  stock repurchases and other potential cash needs as they may arise 
impact of big six programs we have six harmony programs that have had a negative impact on our overall financial condition in prior years 
our work is essentially complete on these programs and we are awaiting final acceptance by end users in two of these programs in order to invoice our last remaining milestones 
four of the big six programs are fully invoiced and collected 
at the end of  costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts relating to the big six programs were million 
our collections in were million 
the big six programs balance of cost and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts at the end of was million 
we expect to convert this amount to invoicing and collections in cash flow for the following years ended dec 
in thousands net cash provided by used in operating activities  net cash provided by used in investing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities   increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents   in and our overall liquidity improved as we were able to reduce the magnitude of our reliance on our credit facilities 
as a result  in we were able to maintain much lower borrowing balances compared to prior years  and in we effectively reduced our borrowings on our lines of credit million 
we were able to accomplish this in three ways 
first  the big six programs were a significant drain on our cash flow during in  we made significant progress and neared completion on most of these programs and were able to convert a significant portion of the related costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts into invoicing and then into collections 
this trend continued in  where we ended the year with only two of the big six programs awaiting final completion 
second  over the last two years we have been selling unneeded facilities in salt lake city 
in this provided million and in  million in cash 
third  in each of the last three years we have taken actions to restructure our business several times  mainly through reductions in force and the sale of non core businesses  which significantly reduced cash requirements 
at december   we had working capital of million  including cash and restricted cash of million  compared to working capital of million at december   including cash and restricted cash of million 
during  we used million in our operating activities  generated million from our investing activities  and generated million from our financing activities 
in cash used in our operating activities was mainly attributable to a million net loss  offset by non cash changes primarily consisting of million related to asset impairments and million related to depreciation and amortization  and decreases in accrued expenses and accounts payables of million and million  respectively 
accrued expenses decreased as a result of a reduction in our compensation and benefits accruals 
this reduction is a result of our headcount reductions during and accounts payables decreased as a result of our improved liquidity in as well as a result of an overall shrinkage of our business 
cash from our operating activities was provided by an million decrease in the net costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts and a million increase in customer deposits 
costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts decreased million due to the completion and billings of all but two of the big six programs 
customer deposits increased due to strong fourth quarter orders from both the commercial simulation and digital theater customer markets 
in  cash provided by our operating activities was mainly attributable to decreases of million in net costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts  million in accounts receivables and million in inventory 
while the million loss had a negative impact on cash  it was mainly offset by million in depreciation and amortization 
net costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts decreased as a result of a decrease in costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts of approximately million primarily due to successful near completion of the big six programs and a decrease in billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts of approximately million due primarily to million in deliveries made in related to commercial simulation customer orders booked in and million in deliveries made in related to military simulation product orders in also contributing to cash from operations was an million decrease in accounts receivable due primarily to collections on the big six programs and improved collections overall 
the inventory decrease was mainly due to a decrease in raw material requirements as our sales decreased and due to converting work in process inventory related to the big six programs into cost of sales as these contracts moved further towards completion 
cash provided by our investing activities was million in the primary source was the sale of one of our buildings  which provided million 
this was offset by investments in property  plant and equipment  which used million 
this is a continuation of our cost reduction plan associated with our restructuring efforts 
investments in property  plant  and equipment were million in  million in  and million in cash provided by our financing activities was million in this was primarily due to a change in restricted cash that generated million 
in  we used cash provided from operating activities to mainly reduce our credit facility borrowings by million 
credit ratings our credit ratings were lowered by moody s investor services moody s on multiple occasions during our convertible subordinated debentures due in credit ratings were lowered from b to caa our senior implied rating was downgraded from ba to b these credit rating downgrades may affect our future ability to renew our credit facilities  negotiate new credit facilities  and issue debt and equity securities 
with respect to moody s  issuers with a ba rating are judged to have speculative elements and are subject to substantial credit risk 
issuers with a b rating are judged to have speculative elements and are subject to high credit risk 
issuers with caa ratings are in poor standing with moody s and subject to very high credit risk 
these issuers may be in default  according to moody s  or there may be present elements of danger with respect to principal and interest 
the  modifiers show relative standing within the major categories  being the highest  or best  modifier in terms of credit quality 
moody s senior implied ratings are generally employed for speculative grade corporate issuers 
the senior implied rating is an opinion of a corporate family s ability to honor its financial obligations and is assigned to a corporate family as if it had a single class of debt and a single consolidated legal entity structure 
credit facilities we have in place two lines of credit that allow us to bridge the gap between our daily cash requirements and the cash we have on hand  as well as provide for the ability to issue letters of credit 
we require access to these lines of credit  or others  in order to operate 
the ability to issue letters of credit has become more important to our business as sales in countries other than north america and western europe have grown and become a larger percentage of our gross sales 
letters of credit in many of these countries are required as part of any final contract 
in december  e s entered into a secured credit facility the foothill facility with foothill capital corporation foothill that provided for borrowings and the issuance of letters of credit up to million 
in december  e s and foothill renegotiated and renewed the terms of the foothill facility  providing for borrowings and the issuance of letters of credit up to million 
the foothill facility  among other things  i requires e s to maintain certain financial ratios and covenants  including a combined cash and borrowing availability financial covenant that adjusts each quarter and a limitation of million of aggregate capital expenditures in any fiscal year  ii restricts our ability to incur debt or liens  sell  assign  pledge or lease assets  merge with another company  and iii restricts the payment of dividends and repurchase of any of our outstanding shares without the prior consent of the lender 
the foothill facility expires in december borrowings under the foothill facility bear interest at the wells fargo bank national association prevailing prime rate plus to  depending on the amount outstanding 
in addition  the foothill facility has an unused line fee equal to per annum times the difference between million and the sum of the average undrawn portion of the borrowings  payable each quarter 
the foothill facility provides foothill with a first priority perfected security interest in substantially all of our assets  including  but not limited to  all of our intellectual property 
in march  we were not in compliance with the tangible net worth financial covenant of our foothill facility 
in july  the foothill facility was amended and the march covenant breach was waived 
the amendments deleted the tangible net worth covenant from the foothill facility and replaced it with a combined cash and borrowing availability financial covenant that went into effect on june   and is in effect until the foothill facility expires 
in addition  the interest rate that borrowings bear interest at was amended  from a range of to to a range of to over the wells fargo bank  na prevailing prime rate  depending on the amount outstanding 
also  at no time will borrowings under the foothill facility bear interest at a rate less than 
as of december   we were in compliance with all covenants 
as of december   e s had million in outstanding borrowings and million in outstanding letters of credit under the foothill facility 
our customers can draw against these letters of credit if we fail to meet the performance requirements contained within the terms of each letter of credit 
as of december   no amounts have been accrued for any estimated losses under the obligations  as we believe it is probable that we will perform as required under our contracts 
as of february   there were no outstanding borrowings and the outstanding letters of credit were million 
evans sutherland computer limited  a wholly owned subsidiary of evans sutherland computer corporation  had a million overdraft facility the overdraft facility with lloyds tsb bank plc lloyds 
at the discretion of lloyds  the maximum amount borrowed against the overdraft facility can be increased for a short period of time that is predetermined by lloyds 
borrowings under the overdraft facility bear interest at lloyds short term offered rate plus per annum 
as of december   there were million in outstanding borrowings 
the overdraft facility is subject to reduction or demand repayment for any reason at any time at lloyds discretion 
the overdraft facility expired on december  we have renewed the overdraft facility with essentially the same terms  except that the borrowing limit is million and it expires on december  evans sutherland computer limited executed a letter of negative pledge in favor of lloyds whereby it agreed not to sell or encumber its assets  except in the ordinary course of business 
covenants contained in the overdraft facility restrict dividend payments from evans sutherland computer limited and required maintenance of certain financial covenants 
in addition  at december   we had million on deposit with lloyds in a restricted cash collateral amount to support certain obligations that the bank guarantees 
as of february   there were not outstanding borrowings 
convertible subordinated debentures due in as of december   we had approximately million of convertible subordinated debentures due in the debentures 
the debentures are unsecured and are convertible at each bondholder s option into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of or  shares of our common stock  subject to adjustment 
the debentures are redeemable at our option  in whole or in part  at par 
other in  we expect capital expenditures to be similar to  spending approximately million 
there were no material capital expenditure commitments at the end of  nor do we anticipate any over the next several years 
on february   e s s board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to  shares of our common stock  including the  shares still available from the repurchase authorization approved by the board of directors on november  on september   our board of directors authorized the repurchase of an additional  shares of our common stock 
on february    shares remained available for repurchase 
no shares were repurchased during   or stock may be acquired on the open market or through negotiated transactions 
under the program  repurchases may be made from time to time  depending on market conditions  share price and other factors 
the foothill facility requires that we obtain prior consent from foothill before we repurchase any shares 
we also maintain trade credit arrangements with certain of our suppliers 
the unavailability of a significant portion of  or the loss of  the various borrowing facilities of e s or trade credit from suppliers would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operations 
in the event our various borrowing facilities were to become unavailable  we were unable to make timely deliveries of products pursuant to the terms of various agreements with third parties  or certain of our contracts were adversely impacted for failure to meet delivery requirements  we may be unable to meet our anticipated working capital needs  routine capital expenditures  and current debt service obligations on a short term and long term basis 
effects of inflation the effects of inflation were not considered material during fiscal years   and  and are not expected to be material for fiscal year off balance sheet arrangements as part of our ongoing business  we normally do not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities spes  which can be established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
in july  we formed a joint venture with quadrant group plc quadrant known as quest flight training limited quest 
quest provides certain equipment  software  training and other goods and services to the uk ministry of defence uk mod and other related governmental entities with regard to an upgrade of the uk mod e d facility and e d sentry aircrew training services 
we have a interest in quest which is accounted for as an investment under the equity method and therefore is not consolidated in our financial statements 
the financial position and operating results of quest are immaterial to our financial results 
in connection with the services of quest to the uk mod  during we entered into guarantees of various obligations of quest 
as of december   we had four guaranties outstanding related to quest 
pursuant to the first guaranty  we have guarantied  jointly and severally with quadrant  the performance of quest in relation to its contract with the uk mod 
if quest fails to meet its obligations under the contract then we and quadrant are required to perform under the terms of the contract 
due to the length of the contract and the uncertainty of performance for which we would be liable if quest fails to perform  we cannot estimate the maximum amount of possible future payments 
this guaranty is in place until pursuant to the second guaranty  we have guarantied  jointly and severally with quadrant  up to a maximum amount of million million as of december   the performance of quest  where not subcontracted  and the performance of quest where subcontracted  and the subcontractor is not liable to meet its obligation due to any limitation of liability in the sub contract agreement  thus preventing quest from meeting its obligation under its contract with the uk mod 
this guaranty is in place until pursuant to the third guaranty  we have pledged our equity shares in quest to guaranty payment by quest of a loan agreement executed by quest 
the loan agreement terminates in the pledge of our equity shares in quest will expire at such time as quest s obligations under the loan agreement are satisfied or the date on which the loan agreement is otherwise terminated 
in the event of default on this loan agreement  the lending institution can request that the trustee holding such equity shares surrender them to the lending institution in order to satisfy all amounts then outstanding under the loan agreement 
pursuant to the fourth guaranty  we have guarantied payment  up to a maximum of million million as of december   in the event that quest has a default event  as defined by its loan agreement 
this guaranty is in place until as of december   no amounts have been accrued for any estimated losses under these guaranties because we believe that quest will meet all of its performance and financial obligations in relation to its contract with the uk mod 
however  if we are required to perform under any or all of the four guaranties  it could have a material adverse impact on our operating results and liquidity 
contractual obligations the impact that our contractual obligations as of december   are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods is as follows payments due by period total less than year years years more than years contractual obligations long term debt  including current portion   operating lease obligations     purchase obligations  total     amounts represent the expected cash payments of our long term debt and our credit facilities  and do not include any fair value adjustments or bond premiums or discounts 
purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on e s and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased and the approximate timing of the transaction 
purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty 
we estimate that we will make no contributions to any of our pension and post retirement plans in fiscal year  and we currently have no plans to make contributions beyond fiscal year  unless required to by statutory funding requirements 
restatement of quarterly financial statements the financial data in this annual report on form k for the first three quarters of has been restated from amounts previously reported for the correction of certain accounting errors 
a discussion of the restatement in relation to the affected quarters of is provided in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
all information presented in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations reflects the restatement 
management overview restatement of financial information 
we restated certain of our previously filed unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the three fiscal quarters ended march   june  and september  for the correction of accounting errors identified by management 
the aggregate effect of the restatement decreased sales previously reported for the first three quarters of by an aggregate of million  increased net loss previously reported for these periods by an aggregate of million and increased the loss per share by  and for the fiscal quarter ended march  june and september   respectively 
background on the restatement 
during our year end close process and review  we discovered certain errors that affected our previously issued quarterly unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of the first three quarters of accordingly  our quarterly unaudited  condensed consolidated financial statements have been restated 
the adjustments reflected in the restatement resulted from the incorrect application of certain accounting principles at our wholly owned subsidiary  evans sutherland computer limited  that we determined were in error as a result of our in depth review of all aspects of the matter 
management and the audit committee took a leadership role in assessing these issues and in taking corrective action 
management performed an in depth review into several accounting issues that arose in connection with the restatement  as more specifically described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
following our in depth review  we concluded that while there were material weaknesses in our control environment  we cannot conclude that there was misconduct or that our employees intentionally used improper accounting practices to manipulate earnings or that there was any fraud or intentional misconduct on the part of our officers or employees 
item a of this annual report on form k provides a description of actions we have taken to improve our internal controls and procedures based on our review of our accounting and reporting policies 
critical accounting policies the policies discussed below are considered by management to be critical to an understanding of e s s financial statements 
their application places significant demands on management s judgment  with financial reporting results relying on estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
specific risks for these critical accounting policies are described in the following paragraphs 
a summary of significant accounting policies can be found in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
for all of these policies  management cautions that future results rarely develop exactly as forecast  and the best estimates routinely require adjustment 
revenue recognition revenue from long term contracts requiring significant production  modification or customization is recorded using the percentage of completion method 
this method uses the ratio of costs incurred to management s estimate of total anticipated costs 
our estimates of total costs include assumptions  such as man hours to complete  estimated materials cost  and estimates of other direct and indirect costs 
actual results may vary significantly from our estimates 
if the actual costs are higher than management s anticipated total costs  then an adjustment is required to reduce the previously recognized revenue as the ratio of costs incurred to management s estimate was overstated 
if actual costs are lower than management s anticipated total costs  then an adjustment is required to increase the previously recognized revenue as the ratio of costs incurred to management s estimate is understated 
costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts and billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts billings on uncompleted long term contracts may be greater than or less than incurred costs and estimated earnings 
as a result  these differences are recorded as an asset or liability on the balance sheets 
since revenue recognized on these long term contracts includes estimates of management s anticipated total costs  the amounts in costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts and billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts also include these estimates 
inventories inventory includes materials at standard costs  which approximates average costs  as well as inventoried costs on programs including material  labor  subcontracting costs  as well as an allocation of indirect costs 
we periodically review inventories for excess supply  obsolescence  and valuations above estimated realizable amounts  and then provide a reserve we consider sufficient to cover these items 
reserve adequacy is based on estimates of future sales  product pricing  and requirements to complete projects 
revisions of these estimates would result in adjustments to our operating results 
accrued expenses accrued expenses include amounts for liquidated damages and late delivery penalties see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
while current contracts could include additional liquidated damages and late delivery penalties  we have included all amounts management believes e s is liable for as of december  these liquidated damages are based primarily on estimates of project completion dates 
to the extent completion dates are not consistent with our estimates  these damage and penalty accruals may require additional adjustments 
allowance for doubtful accounts the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we specifically analyze accounts receivables and consider historic experience  customer creditworthiness  facts and circumstances specific to outstanding balances  current economic trends  and payment term changes when evaluating adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
changes in these factors could result in material adjustments to the expense recognized for bad debts 
income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our actual income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatments of items  such as accrued liabilities  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheets 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase or decrease this allowance in a period  we must include a corresponding adjustment within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
significant management judgment is required to determine our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued a revised financial accounting standard no 
sfas revised  employer s disclosures about pension and other postretirement benefits an amendment of fasb statements no 
  and sfas revised revises employer s disclosure about pension plans and other post retirement benefits 
sfas revised does not change the recognition or measurement of those plans required by sfas nos 
  and it retains the disclosure requirements of the original sfas as well as requires additional disclosures about the assets  obligations  cash flow  and net periodic benefit cost of defined benefit pension plans and other defined benefit postretirement plans 
certain of the additional disclosure are required for fiscal years ending after december   and are included in the notes to these consolidated financial statements as applicable 
in december  the fasb issued a revision to interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities finr 
finr clarifies the application of arb no 
 consolidated financial statements to certain entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support 
finr requires the consolidation of these entities  known as variable interest entities  by the primary beneficiary of the entity 
the primary beneficiary is the entity  if any  that will absorb a majority of the entity s expected losses  receive a majority of the entity s expected residual returns  or both 
among other changes  the revisions of finr a clarified some requirements of the original fin  which had been issued in january  b eased some implementation problems  and c added new scope exceptions 
finr deferred the effective date of the interpretation for public companies  to the end of the first reporting period ending after march  under these guidelines  we will adopt finr in the first quarter of fiscal the adoption of this interpretation is not expected to have a material effect on our business  results of operations  financial position  or liquidity

forward looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties  some of which cannot be predicted or quantified 
future events and actual results could differ materially from those set forth in  contemplated by  or underlying the forward looking information 
our actual results could differ materially from these forward looking statements 
in addition to the other risks described in the factors that may affect future results discussed below  important factors to consider in evaluating such forward looking statements include risk of product demand  market acceptance  economic conditions  competitive products and pricing  difficulties in product development  product delays  commercialization and technology  and our ability to maintain credit facilities to support our operations on favorable and acceptable terms 
in light of these risks and uncertainties  there can be no assurance that the events contemplated by the forward looking statements contained in this annual report will  in fact  occur 
factors that may affect future results our domestic and international businesses operate in highly competitive markets that involve a number of risks  some of which are beyond our control 
while we are optimistic about our long term prospects  the following discussion highlights some risks and uncertainties that should be considered in evaluating our growth outlook 
cash flow may be insufficient to guarantee access to capital and retire existing debt if the company does not generate sufficient earnings to increase its cash position  then our ability to obtain future capital and to repay existing debt will be reduced 
while we have significantly reduced our debt in the last two years  we still have both short term and long term debt 
the long term debt is in the form of convertible preferred bonds due in a portion of our short term debt bears interest at variable rates 
any increase in interest rates will reduce funds available to us for our operations and future business opportunities 
our business model is changing and may not produce consistent earnings our success depends on our ability to compete in an industry that is highly competitive  with rapid technological advances and constantly improving products in both price and performance 
in most market areas in which we operate we are experiencing increased competition  and we expect this trend to continue 
when new systems are ordered  prices are below similar systems in the past 
this condition requires a new business model to be successful in the market for visual systems 
the new business model emphasizes smaller systems and associated hardware revenue  with more dependence on software  databases  and support services 
while e s has made significant progress in adapting to this business model by introducing products emphasizing the new factors for success  there is no assurance that this model will achieve its full objectives and ensure profitability in the future 
covenants and restrictions in our credit documents limit our ability to take certain actions our credit documents contain significant financial and operating covenants that limit the discretion of management with respect to certain business matters 
these covenants include  among others  restrictions on our ability to declare dividends or redeem or repurchase capital stock  incur certain additional debt  grant liens  make certain payments and investments  sell or otherwise dispose of assets  and consolidate with other entities 
we must also meet certain financial ratios and tests  including a combined cash and borrowing availability financial covenant that adjusts each quarter and a limitation of million of aggregate capital expenditures in any fiscal year 
failure to comply with the obligations contained in the credit documents could result in an event of default  and possibly the acceleration of the related debt and the acceleration of debt under other instruments evidencing debt that may contain cross acceleration or cross default provisions 
due to foothill s amendments and waivers on july  and july   of e s s noncompliance with financial covenants on march   we were in compliance with our financial covenants as of december  should the need arise  we will negotiate with our lenders to modify and expand various financial covenants  however  no assurance can be given that such negotiations will result in modifications that will allow us to continue to be in compliance or otherwise be acceptable to us 
competitors may infringe our intellectual property currently  we rely on a combination of patents  trademarks  copyrights and common law safeguards including trade secret protection 
to protect our intellectual property rights in the future  we intend to continue to rely on a combination of patents  trademarks  copyrights and common law safeguards  including trade secret protection 
we also rely on restrictions on use  confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements and other contractual arrangements with our employees  affiliates  customers  alliance partners and others 
the protective steps we have taken may be inadequate to deter misappropriation of our intellectual property and proprietary information 
specifically  we may be unable to detect the unauthorized use of  or take appropriate steps to enforce our intellectual property rights 
effective patent  trademark  copyright and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which we offer or intend to offer our products and services to the same extent as in the united states 
failure to adequately protect our intellectual property could harm or even destroy our brands and impair our ability to compete effectively 
further  enforcing our intellectual property rights could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources and may not prove successful 
these factors all become more important as we rely more on software and other forms of intellectual property that are more difficult to control than hardware 
military markets may not recover  depressing our revenue and earnings since september  both commercial and military markets for our products have declined significantly 
the size of this decline was unprecedented in our industry  and has created a condition of gross oversupply and extreme competition 
this condition has put intense pressure on prices and margins  as well as forcing every company to significantly reduce costs and operating expenses used in the production of visual systems 
while commercial markets have begun to recover  military markets have not yet produced significant new revenue 
in the us  the reduction in military spending for visual systems is generally due to the demands of overseas deployments  while in europe defense budgets have been under pressure for a number of years 
there is no assurance that military spending will recover in the years ahead  leading to continued pressure on our revenue and earnings 
the market for visual systems may not support our current r d spending in a very fragmented market  there may be insufficient business to support current research and development 
the market for visual systems is unusual in that it is a small market that requires specialized and expensive r d to achieve optimal results 
unless there is significant consolidation among competitors  the market may be too small to support any company large enough to invest in the necessary r d 
currently  only two companies are significantly investing in visual system r d e s  which invests its own funds  and cae  whose r d is supported by canadian government subsidies 
e s has addressed this situation by sharply targeting its r d 
we believe our r d is highly efficient at this time  but we have no assurance that the market will provide sufficient earnings in the future to continue this program 
prime contractors may bring workshare into their own company and decrease the demand for e s products large prime contractors in the defense and aerospace industry have encountered the same competitive pressures described earlier for simulation and training revenue 
to protect their own revenue and margins  most have responded by putting pressure on smaller suppliers  as well as bringing work in house to protect established engineering organizations wherever possible 
this trend has  in effect  created new competitors for e s s traditional business 
these in house engineering groups attempt to do only the most profitable work  such as software and databases  and leave hardware to others 
often the costs of these efforts are not visible to the end customer because they are part of a much larger contract 
if these trends continue and the end customers accept the results  they could reduce demand for the most profitable future portions of our revenue stream and business model  software and databases 
we may not continue to be successful if we are unable to develop  produce and transition our products our continued success depends on our ability to develop  produce and transition technologically complex and innovative products that meet customer needs 
we have no assurance that we will be able to successfully continue such development  production and transition 
the development of new technologies and products is increasingly complex and expensive  which among other risks  increases the risk of product introduction delays 
the introduction of a new product requires close collaboration and continued technological advancement involving multiple hardware and software design and manufacturing teams within e s as well as teams at outside suppliers of key components 
the failure of any one of these elements could cause our new products to fail to meet specifications or to miss the aggressive timetables the market demands 
the process of planning and managing production  inventory levels  and delivery schedules also is increasingly complex 
there is no assurance that acceptance of and demand for our new products will not be affected by delays in this process 
changes in government priorities may impact the military simulation market during the last several years significant changes have been taking place in budget priorities for both us and international government spending  especially military spending 
some of these changes have resulted in delays or reductions of purchases of visual systems 
while we have downsized our company in accordance with these changes  we have no assurance that such delays will not continue to occur or accelerate and cause further declines in our revenue from this market 
we depend on several significant customers and our net sales could suffer if their purchases decline we currently derive a significant portion of our sales from a limited number of non us government customers 
the loss of any one or more of these customers could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we were dependent on five of our non us government customers for approximately of our consolidated sales in we expect that sales to a limited number of customers will continue to account for a substantial portion of our sales in the foreseeable future 
we have no assurance that sales from this limited number of customers will continue to reach or exceed historical levels in the future 
we do not have supply contracts with any of our significant customers 
our operations could be hurt by terrorist attacks and other activities that make air travel difficult or reduce the willingness of our commercial airline customers to purchase our simulation products during  million  or of our total revenue generated was derived from sales of our simulation products to commercial airline companies and other third parties in the commercial airline industry 
the demand for our various commercial simulation products and services is heavily dependent upon new orders from these commercial airline customers 
in the event terrorist attacks or other activities make air travel difficult or reduce the demand or willingness of our customers to purchase our commercial simulation products  our revenue may decline substantially 
our shareholders may not realize certain opportunities because of the anti takeover effect of state law we may be subject to the utah control shares acquisition act which provides that any person who acquires or more of the outstanding voting shares of a publicly held utah corporation will not have voting rights with respect to the acquired shares unless a majority of the disinterested shareholders of the corporation votes to grant such rights 
this could deprive shareholders of opportunities to realize takeover premiums for their shares or other advantages that large accumulations of stock would provide because anyone interested in acquiring e s could only do so with the cooperation of our board of directors 
we may face risks related to an sec investigation and securities litigation in connection with the restatement of our financial statements 
we are not aware that the sec has begun any formal or informal investigation in connection with accounting errors requiring restatement of quarterly financial statements for the first three quarters  or that any laws have been violated 
however  if the sec makes a determination that the company has violated federal securities laws  the company may face sanctions  including  but not limited to  monetary penalties and injunctive relief 
in addition  the company or its officers and directors could be named defendants in civil proceedings arising from the restatement 
we are unable to estimate what our liability in either event might be 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the principal market risks to which we are exposed are changes in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates 
our international sales  which accounted for of our total sales in  are concentrated in the united kingdom  continental europe and asia 
foreign currency purchase and sale contracts may be entered into for periods consistent with related underlying exposures and do not constitute positions independent of those exposures 
we do not enter into contracts for trading purposes and do not use leveraged contracts 
as of december   we had nine material sale or purchase contracts in currencies other than us dollars
