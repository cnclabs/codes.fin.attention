restructuring of senior notes debt at december   the company was indebted to paribas and exeter collectively paribas in the sum of approximately  pursuant to a subordinated note bearing interest at per annum see senior notes in note 
on april   an agreement was reached among the company  paribas and certain members of cd l management and others investors as to the financial restructuring of the senior notes 
paribas agreed to convert a portion of its existing debt due from cd l into equity and to modify the terms of its subordinated note if the investors purchase a portion of the note and accept similar modifications 
the nature of the restructuring is as follows a paribas exchanged notes in the aggregate principal amount of million for shares of the series a convertible redeemable preferred stock of the company  par value 
per share preferred stock with a liquidation preference of million 
the preferred stock is convertible into an aggregate of  shares of common stock  does not pay dividends unless dividends are declared and paid on the common stock  and is redeemable by the company for the liquidation value 
holders of the preferred stock will have the right to elect two directors 
b paribas and the company amended the terms of the million balance of the notes  and then exchanged the original notes for the amended and restated notes  which consist of two series of convertible notes  the series a convertible subordinated notes the series a converible notes in the principal amount of million and the series b convertible subordinated notes series b convertible notes in the principal amount of million collectively  the convertible notes 
the loan agreement was amended and restated to reflect the terms of the substituted series a convertible notes and the series b convertible notes  including the elimination of most financial covenants 
principal is due in a balloon payment at the maturity date of april  the convertible notes bear interest at a rate of for the first two years of the term  for the next two years  and for the final three years of the term 
the terms of the two series of convertible notes are identical except for the conversion price for the series a convertible notes  the average closing price for the company s shares for the days prior to the closing  and for the series b convertible notes 
c the investors purchased the series a convertible notes from paribas for a purchase price of million 
d the company issued an additional million of series a convertible notes to the investors for an additional payment of million  the proceeds of which were used to reduce short term debt 
e the investors  paribas and the company entered into a registration rights agreement pursuant to which the shares of the company s common stock issuable upon conversion of the preferred stock and the convertible notes will be registered for resale with the securities and exchange commission 
in addition  the company has agreed to commence a rights offering to its common stockholders as soon as practical  and in any event prior to january   whereby the common shareholders of the company shall have the right to acquire at least million of additional shares of common stock of the company in the aggregate at a price equal to the conversion price of the series a convertible notes

b represents the write off of the unamortized debt discount balance of  as of december  related to the original senior notes and the related tax effect 
the company has reviewed sfas with respect to this transaction and has determined that the preferred shares issued are properly treated as equity  as the shares are not mandatorily redeemable at any time 
as the interest on the investor notes and the new paribas note increase over the term of the notes  the company will record the associated interest expense on a straight line basis  which will give rise to accrued interest over the early term of the notes 
discontinued operations on december   we made a strategic decision to dispose of our air delivery business and accordingly have restated the accompanying balance sheets  statements of operations and statements of cash flows to reflect such as discontinued operations 
on march   we consummated a transaction providing for the sale of certain assets and liabilities of sureway air traffic corporation  inc sureway  our air delivery business 
the selling price for the net assets was approximately  and was comprised of  in cash  a subordinated promissory note the sureway note receivable for  and contingent cash payments based upon the ultimate development of certain liabilities retained by us 
the sureway note receivable originally bore interest at the rate of per annum  with interest only payable in monthly installments 
the entire balance of principal  plus all accrued interest  was due and payable on march  as of december  collection of the sureway note receivable  interest accrued thereon and certain other related receivables was in doubt 
accordingly  the company recorded a pre tax charge of  included in other income expense  net in the fourth quarter of to write off the sureway note receivable 
additionally  the company recorded a pre tax charge of  included in discontinued operations in the fourth quarter of to write off certain other direct expenses incurred on behalf of sureway subsequent to march  for which collection was in doubt and to true up certain accruals that were estimated in relative to the disposition of sureway 
the company reported a net loss on the disposition of the company s air delivery business of  net of benefit for income taxes of  accounted for as discontinued operations for the year ended december  in february  the company became obligated for seller financed acquisition debt of  related to the acquisition of gold wings see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
as of february   the note had a remaining principal balance of  the cdl gold note 
on february   the company completed a series of related transactions with gmv express  inc gmv  richard gold a principal of gmv gold and his affiliates  and global delivery systems llc global and its subsidiary  sureway worldwide llc sureway worldwide 
the net effect of the transactions with global  sureway worldwide  gmv and gold was that the company assigned the sureway note receivable to gmv in exchange for a release on the cdl gold note payable  so that the company was relieved of its  liability for the cdl gold note and the company has no further rights to the sureway note receivable 
in addition  the company received payments from sureway worldwide and global of approximately   in settlement of disputed claims and  for other amounts due and provided gold with a release covering claims of breach of certain non competition agreements 
as a result of this transaction  the company recorded a gain of  during the year ended december  critical accounting policies and estimates the company s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to accounts and notes receivable  intangible assets  insurance reserves  income taxes and contingencies 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies reflect more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts and notes receivable for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers and debtors to make payments when due or within a reasonable period of time thereafter 
the company estimates allowances for doubtful accounts and notes receivable by evaluating past due aging trends  analyzing customer payment histories and assessing market conditions relating to its customers operations and financial condition 
such allowances are developed principally for specific customers 
as of december   the company has estimated that an allowance for doubtful accounts of  is needed to cover the current receivable base 
as a result of this estimate  the company recorded  of expense in related to the provision for doubtful accounts 
if the financial condition of the company s customers and debtors were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make required payments  additional allowances may be required 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized when pervasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price to the customer is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
the company interprets the timing of revenue recognition to be when services are rendered to customers  and expenses are recognized as incurred 
this policy applies to all of the company s same day  time critical delivery service options  including rush  scheduled  facilities management and dedicated contract logistics 
certain customers pay in advance  giving rise to deferred revenue 
this policy is consistent with prior years and as such  the increase in revenue from relates solely to additional sales volume 
goodwill the value of the company s goodwill is significant relative to total assets and stockholders equity 
the company reviews goodwill for impairment on at least an annual basis using several fair value based tests  which include  a discounted cash flow and terminal value computation  market capitalization and peer group equity transactions 
the discounted cash flow and terminal value computation is based on management s estimates of future operations 
during  an annual impairment test was performed and the company determined that there was no impairment of goodwill 
as such  there was no impact on the statement of operation related to goodwill 
changes in business conditions could materially impact management s estimates of future operations and this could result in an impairment of goodwill 
such impairment  if any  could have a significant impact on the company s operations and financial condition 
examples of changes in business conditions include  but are not limited to  bankruptcy or loss of a significant customer  a significant adverse change in regulatory factors  a loss of key personnel  increased levels of competition from companies with greater financial resources than the company and margin erosion caused by our inability to increase prices to our customers at the same rate that our costs increase 
insurance reserves the company insures certain of its risks through insurance policies  but retains risk as a result of its deductibles related to such insurance policies 
the company s deductible for workers compensation is  per loss  prior to may  
the deductible for employee health medical costs is  per loss  prior to march  
effective july   automobile liability coverage is maintained for covered vehicles through a fully insured indemnity program with no deductible  deductible prior to july  
the company reserves the estimated amounts of uninsured claims and deductibles related to such insurance retentions for claims that have occurred in the normal course of business 
these reserves are established by management based upon the recommendations of third party administrators who perform a specific review of open claims  which include fully developed estimates of both reported claims and incurred but not reported claims  as of the balance sheet date 
actual claim settlements may differ materially from these estimated reserve amounts 
the company s estimated cumulative reported losses for workers compensation and automobile liability claims for the period january  through december  amounted to  for losses and  for administrative and reinsurance costs  all of which has been funded to the company s insurance carrier 
additionally  as of december   the company has accrued approximately million for estimated losses incurred but not reported 
the company has also accrued  for incurred but unpaid employee health medical costs as of december  income taxes the company files income tax returns in every jurisdiction in which it has reason to believe it is subject to tax 
historically  the company has been subject to examination by various taxing jurisdictions 
to date  none of these examinations has resulted in any material additional tax 
nonetheless  any tax jurisdiction may contend that a filing position claimed by the company regarding one or more of its transactions is contrary to that jurisdiction s laws or regulations 
the company utilizes a tax rate of in all years presented in the statements of operations

goodwill impairment there was no goodwill impairment for compared to  for the charge taken in was the result of a comprehensive review of the company s intangible assets under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and long lived assets to be disposed of sfas 
in  as a result of recording significant losses on the dispositions of sureway and the mid west operations and as a result of inadequate cash flows from certain acquired businesses due to the loss of customers  the company determined that the carrying amount of certain assets might not be fully recoverable 
the measurement of impairment losses recognized in is based on the difference between the fair values  which were calculated based upon the present value of projected future cash flows  and the carrying amounts of the assets 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization decreased by  or  from  for to  for the decrease was primarily attributable to the adoption of sfas  as discussed below 
in addition  other factors driving such reduction were the full depreciation of certain vehicles held under a capital lease that ended during and reduced capital expenditures in  and on june   sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas was issued 
sfas eliminates goodwill amortization over its estimated useful life 
however  goodwill is subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment by applying a fair value based test 
additionally  acquired intangible assets must be separately recognized if the benefit of the intangible asset is obtained through contractual or other legal rights  or if the intangible asset can be sold  transferred  licensed  rented or exchanged  regardless of the acquirer s intent to do so 
intangible assets with definitive lives are amortized over their useful lives 
the statement requires that by june   a company must establish its fair value benchmarks in order to test for impairment 
the company adopted sfas effective january  for purposes of performing the fair value based test of goodwill  the company has determined that it has one reporting unit 
this reporting unit is consistent with its single operating segment  which management determined is appropriate under the provisions of sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information sfas 
during  a transitional goodwill impairment test was performed and the company determined that there was no impairment of goodwill 
further  as required by sfas  an annual impairment test was completed at the end of fiscal and the company determined that there was no impairment 
fair value was determined by two methods present value of future estimated cash flows  including a determination of a terminal value 
market capitalization utilizing quoted market prices of the company s common stock 
the adoption of sfas did not result in an impairment of goodwill 
however  changes in business conditions could result in an impairment in the future 
such impairment  if any  could have a significant impact on the company s operations and financial condition 
examples of changes in business conditions include  but are not limited to  bankruptcy or loss of a significant customer  a significant adverse change in regulatory factors  a loss of key personnel  increased levels of competition from companies with greater financial resources than the company and margin erosion caused by our inability to increase prices to our customers at the same rate that our costs increase 
adoption of sfas increased pretax earnings by approximately  for the year ended december  due to the cessation of goodwill amortization 
other expense other expense decreased by  to  in from  in the expense includes a  increase in the allowance for the shareholder note receivable 
the expense is primarily due to two transactions 
as of december   the company wrote off the sureway note receivable received on march  amounting to  in the transaction to dispose of certain assets and liabilities of sureway  as collection of the sureway note receivable  interest accrued thereon and certain other related receivables was in doubt 
the company also recorded a  loss on the sale of all of the outstanding stock in national express  inc the company s ground courier operation in the mid west to first choice courier and distribution  inc first choice on june  the selling price of the stock was approximately  and was comprised of  in cash and a subordinated promissory note the promissory note for  the promissory note originally bore interest at the rate of per annum

management believes that cash flows from operations and its borrowing capacity  after the debt restructuring referred to above  are sufficient to support the company s operations and general business and capital requirements for at least the next twelve months 
such conclusions are predicated upon sufficient cash flow from operations and the continued availability of a revolving credit facility 
the risks associated with cash flow from operations are mitigated by the company s low gross profit margin 
unless extraordinary  decreases in revenue should be accompanied by corresponding decreases in costs  resulting in minimal impact to liquidity 
the risks associated with the revolving credit facility are as discussed above
