item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s interest rate risk represents the level of exposure it has to fluctuations in interest rates and is primarily measured as the change in earnings and the theoretical market value of equity that result from changes in interest rates 
the asset liability management committee of the board of directors the alco oversees the company s management of interest rate risk 
the objective of the management of interest rate risk is to optimize net interest income during periods of volatile as well as stable interest rates  while maintaining a balance between the maturity and repricing characteristics of assets and liabilities that is consistent with the company s liquidity  asset and earnings growth  and capital adequacy goals 
critical to the management of this process is the alco s interest rate program  designed to manage interest rate sensitivity gap management and balance sheet mix and pricing spread management 
gap management represents those actions taken to measure and monitor rate sensitive assets and rate sensitive liabilities 
spread management requires managing investments  loans and funding sources to achieve an acceptable spread between the company s return on its earning assets and its cost of funds 
one tool used by the company to assess and manage its interest rate risk is the gap analysis 
the gap analysis  summarized in the following table  measures the mismatch in repricing between interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities and provides a general indication of the interest sensitivity of the balance sheet at a specified point in time 
by limiting the size of the gap position  the company can limit the net interest income at risk arising from repricing imbalances 
the following table summarizes the anticipated maturities or repricing of the company s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities as of december  and the company s interest sensitivity gap at that date 
the company s cumulative sensitivity gap through twelve months is a positive 
a positive sensitivity gap for any time period indicates that more interest earning assets will mature or reprice during that time period than interest bearing liabilities 
the company s goal is generally to maintain a reasonably balanced cumulative interest sensitivity gap position for the period of one year or less in order to mitigate the impact of changes in interest rates on liquidity  interest margins and corresponding operating results 
during periods of falling interest rates  a short term positive interest sensitivity gap position would generally result in a decrease in net interest income  and during periods of rising interest rates  a short term positive interest sensitivity gap position would generally result in an increase in net interest income assuming all earning assets and interest bearing liabilities are affected by a rate change equally and simultaneously 
it is important to note that the table represents the static gap position for interest sensitive assets and liabilities at december  the table does not give effect to prepayments or extensions of loans as a result of changes in general market rates 
moreover  while the table does indicate the opportunities to reprice assets and liabilities within certain time frames  it does not account for timing differences that occur during periods of repricing 
for example  changes to deposit rates tend to lag in a rising rate environment and lead in a falling rate environment

the balance also excludes nonaccrual loans totaling  the analysis provided in the table above includes the following significant assumptions fixed rate loans are scheduled by contractual maturity and variable rate loans are scheduled by repricing date 
variable rate loans that have reached a pre established interest rate floor are classified as fixed rate loans and reprice according to contractual maturity 
investments other than mortgage backed securities are scheduled according to the earlier of contractual maturity date or most likely call date  given current interest rates 
mortgage backed securities are scheduled according to estimated maturity based upon the most recent monthly prepayment factors  which may change 
residential mortgage loans originated for sale are scheduled based on their expected sale dates  generally to days after settlement 
projected run off of deposits that do not have a contractual maturity date  such as now  savings and money market accounts  are computed based upon the most recently proposed decay rate assumptions set forth by the federal financial institutions examination council ffiec 
penalty free certificates of deposit are scheduled by stated maturity date 
if rates begin to increase  a portion of these certificates may reprice prior to contractual maturity 
long term advances from the fhlb are scheduled according to their maturity date 

table of contents the company also uses a computer simulation analysis to assess and manage its interest rate risk 
the simulation analysis assumes an immediate  parallel shift of basis points in the treasury yield curve 
during  as market rates approached historically low levels  the company adjusted the assumptions used in the simulation process to incorporate interest rate floors for certain deposit products  recognizing the practical concept that rates on interest bearing products would not reprice below a certain point 
the company also recognized that for evaluating interest rate risk in the current rate environment  a downward shift of basis points is not practical 
as a result  the simulation applied a basis point shift downward and the upward shift remained at basis points 
the analysis measures the potential change in earnings over a one year time horizon and in the market value of portfolio equity  captures optionality factors such as call features embedded in investment and loan portfolio contracts  and includes assumptions as to the timing and magnitude of movements in interest rates associated with the company s funding sources not fixed in price 
measured based on december  data  the simulation analysis provided the following profile of the company s interest rate risk immediate rate change bp bp policy net interest income at risk economic value of equity both of the above tools used to assess interest rate risk have strengths and weaknesses 
because the gap analysis reflects a static position at a single point in time  it is limited in quantifying the total impact of market rate changes which do not affect all earning assets and interest bearing liabilities equally or simultaneously 
in addition  gap reports depict the existing structure  excluding exposure arising from new business 
while the simulation process is a powerful tool in analyzing interest rate sensitivity  many of the assumptions used in the process are highly qualitative and subjective and are subject to the risk that past historical activity may not generate accurate predictions of the future 
both measurement tools  however  provide a comprehensive evaluation of the company s exposure to changes in interest rates  enabling management to better control the volatility of earnings
