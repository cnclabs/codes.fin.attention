keynote s goal is to empower customers to deliver an optimal experience to end users and to gain competitive advantage  while helping them reduce unnecessary capital expenditures and leverage enterprise management software they already own 
revenue consists of subscription services revenue and consulting and support services revenue 
subscription services revenue consists of fees from subscriptions to our web monitoring and measurement  testing  customer experience  diagnostic and our webeffective intelligence platform services 
subscription services revenue is deferred upon invoicing and is recognized ratably over the service period  commencing on the day service is provided  generally ranging from one to twelve months 
for some customers  subscription services revenue is invoiced monthly upon completion of the services 
deferred revenue is comprised of all unearned revenue that has been collected  primarily unearned subscription services revenue  and is recorded as deferred revenue on our balance sheet until the revenue is earned 
any uncollected deferred revenue reduces the balance of accounts receivable 
as of september   we had recorded approximately million of deferred revenue 
we do not generally grant refunds 
all discounts granted reduce revenue 
revenue is not recognized during free trial periods 
consulting and support services revenue  which consists of fees generated by our consulting and support services and our load testing services  is recognized as the services are performed  typically over a period of one to three months 
for longer consulting projects that span more than one month  we recognize revenue as milestones or deliverables are completed 
a majority of our subscription services revenue comes from our e business performance measurement services  which include our perspective services 
subscription services revenue also includes our red alert and netmechanic monitoring and alarm services  test perspective  webeffective intelligence platform  performance 
table of contents management subscription services  our private agent and application performance management services 
our customers purchase these services for an initial term of three to twelve months and then may renew on an annual  semi annual  or month to month basis 
subscription services fees can vary based on the number of urls measured  the number of devices monitored  the number of measurement locations  the number of users  the number of hours  the frequency of the measurements  the number of private agents  the additional features ordered  and the type of services purchased 
we offer our consulting and support services on a per engagement basis 
consulting and support services revenue amounted to approximately of total revenue for the year ended and approximately of total revenue for both the years ended and we believe that consulting and support services revenue may increase somewhat in the future as a percentage of total revenue  as our existing consulting and support services become more widely used  as a result of acquisitions and as we introduce additional services that require consulting expertise 
however  we cannot assure you that this revenue will increase in absolute dollars in future periods 
we had total revenue of million for the year ended september   million for the year ended september   and million for the year ended september  we achieved net income of million for the year ended september   a net loss of million for the year ended september   and a net loss of million for the year ended september  for the year ended september   our largest customers accounted for approximately of total revenue 
we cannot be certain that customers that have accounted for significant revenue in past periods  individually or in aggregate  will renew our services and continue to generate revenue in any future period 
in addition  our customers that have monthly renewal arrangements may terminate their services at any time with little or no penalty 
if we lose a major customer or a group of significant customers  our revenue could significantly decline 
during fiscal  we made four acquisitions 
in december  we acquired the business of matrixnet matrixnet  a division of xaffire  inc for  in cash 
the matrixnet service measures performance from network agent locations to a customer s web infrastructure or devices 
with the acquisition of matrixnet  we introduced our network perspective services which is a diagnostic service that provides granular reporting of internet latency and performance metrics for quick resolution of internet related problems 
in april  we acquired netraker corporation netraker for approximately million in cash 
netraker is a provider of online customer experience management solutions that help e businesses manage  measure  evaluate and improve the design and navigability of their web sites 
we believe this acquisition will enhance and broaden our customer experience management solutions for enterprise customers as well as allow us to target e business marketing executives within fortune companies 
in july  we acquired hudson williams corporation hudson williams for approximately million in cash 
hudson williams is a provider of performance management and load testing consulting services 
in september  we acquired vividence corporation vividence for approximately million in cash 
similar to netraker  vividence is a provider of web based customer experience management solutions 
we believe that the challenges for our business include increasing performance management solutions revenue while continuing to stabilize performance measurement services revenue  integrating our recent acquisitions and controlling our expenses for the first quarter of fiscal at to higher than the fourth quarter of fiscal  assuming no acquisitions 
critical accounting policies and estimates in preparing our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  our management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and related notes 
we believe that the 
table of contents estimates  judgments and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates  judgments and assumptions are made 
these estimates  judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods presented 
to the extent there are material differences between these estimates  judgments or assumptions and actual results  our financial statements will be affected 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
our critical accounting policies and estimates are of both a routine and non routine nature 
the recurring policies relate to revenue recognition  the allowance for doubtful accounts and billing allowance  goodwill impairments  and accounting for income taxes 
the non routine policy relates to the valuation of our long lived assets including purchased intangibles 
revenue recognition revenue consists of subscription services revenue and consulting and support services revenue 
subscription services revenue consists of fees from subscriptions to our web monitoring and measurement services and performance management solutions 
our subscription services revenue is generally deferred upon invoicing and is recognized ratably over the service period  generally ranging from one to twelve months 
for some customers  subscription services revenue is invoiced monthly upon completion of the services 
we do not generally grant refunds 
all discounts granted reduce revenue 
revenue is not recognized for free trial periods 
revenue from our consulting and support services other than vividence services  which includes revenue from our load testing service  is recognized ratably as the services are performed  typically over a period of one to three months 
for consulting projects that span more than one month  we generally recognize revenue as milestones or deliverables are completed 
subscription revenue related to the use of the webeffective intelligence platform to conduct evaluations is recognized upon completion of each evaluation 
deferred revenue is comprised of all unearned revenue that has been collected in advance  primarily unearned subscription services revenue and is recorded as deferred revenue on our balance sheet until the revenue is earned 
any uncollected deferred revenue reduces the balance of accounts receivable 
allowance for doubtful accounts and billing allowance accounts receivable is recorded net of an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable and billing allowance of approximately  or of total accounts receivable  and million  or of total accounts receivable as of september  and  respectively 
the decrease in our allowance for doubtful accounts and billing allowance is due to improved collection efforts as well as a reduction in loss experience 
our accounting policy for our allowance for doubtful accounts is determined based on historical trends  experience and current market and industry conditions 
we regularly review the adequacy of our accounts receivable allowance after considering the age of each invoice of the accounts receivable aging  each customer s expected ability to pay and our collection history with each customer 
we review invoices greater than days past due to determine whether an allowance is appropriate based on the receivable balance 
in addition  we maintain a reserve for all other invoices  which is calculated by applying a percentage  based on historical collection trends  to the outstanding accounts receivable balance 
billing allowance represents the reserve for potential billing adjustments that are recorded as a reduction of revenue and represents a percentage of revenue based on historical trends and experience 
the allowance for doubtful accounts and billing allowance represent management s best estimate  but changes in circumstances relating to accounts receivable and billing adjustments  including unforeseen declines in market conditions and collection rates and the number of billing adjustments  may result in additional allowances in the future or reductions in allowances due to future recoveries or trends 

table of contents impairment assessments of goodwill and identifiable purchased intangibles our methodology for allocating the purchase price relating to acquisitions is usually determined based on valuations performed by an independent third party 
goodwill is measured as the excess of the cost of acquisition over the sum of the amounts assigned to identifiable assets acquired less liabilities assumed 
we perform goodwill impairment tests on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain circumstances for our single reporting unit 
the goodwill recorded on the consolidated balance sheets as of september  was approximately million as compared to  as of september  valuation of long lived assets we evaluate the recoverability of fixed assets and identifiable purchased intangible assets other than goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of any such asset group may not be fully recoverable 
changes in circumstances include economic conditions or operating performance 
our evaluation is based upon assumptions about the estimated future undiscounted net cash flows from such asset groups 
management continually applies its judgment when performing these evaluations to determine the timing of the testing  the undiscounted net cash flows used to assess recoverability and the fair value of the asset group 
if future events or circumstances indicate that an impairment assessment is required and an asset group is determined to be impaired  our financial results could be materially and adversely impacted in future periods 
accounting for income taxes we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax liabilities  including the impact  if any  of additional taxes resulting from tax examinations together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities  and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
at present  our deferred tax assets have been offset by a full valuation allowance because of our history of losses 
if we subsequently determine that some or all deferred tax assets that were previously offset by a valuation allowance are realizable  the result would be a positive adjustment to earnings in the period such determination is made 
we establish liabilities or reserves when we believe that certain tax positions are likely to be challenged and we may not succeed  despite our belief that our tax returns are fully supportable 
we adjust these reserves  as well as related interest  in light of changing circumstances such as the progress of tax exams 
during the twelve months ended september   we recorded net income tax benefits totaling  associated with the resolution of tax matters relating to a foreign subsidiary and us state income taxes

table of contents our results of operations included the two weeks activity for vividence subsequent to the date of our acquisition for the period from september  through september  our results of operations included approximately  of revenue and a net loss of approximately  for vividence from the date of acquisition to september  our results of operations also included activities for netraker and hudson williams 
for our netraker acquisition  our results of operations reflect activities subsequent to the date of our acquisition for the period from april  through september  for our hudson williams acquisition  our results of operations reflect activities for the period from july  through september  our results of operations included approximately million and  of revenue and a net income of  and  for netraker and hudson williams  respectively 
we anticipate that total expenses for the first quarter of fiscal will increase by approximately to as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal  which were approximately million  primarily due to our recent acquisition of vividence in september  expenses associated with our global internet performance conference held in october  additional personnel costs related to the acquisition of vividence completed in september  increasing cost of compliance requirements  and additional investment in our sales and marketing efforts 
in addition to analyzing revenue for subscription services and consulting and support services  management also internally analyzes revenue categorized as performance measurement services and performance management solutions 
the following table identifies which services are categorized as performance measurement services and performance management solutions and where they are recorded in our condensed consolidated statements of operations listed in alphabetical order subscription services consulting and support services performance measurement services application perspective outside edition x netmechanic x red alert x streaming perspective x transaction perspective x website perspective x performance management solutions application perspective private x diagnostic services x enterprise solutions x x loadpro x network perspective x professional services x test perspective x webeffective intelligence platform x x webintegrity x wireless perspective x the following table summarizes performance measurement services and performance management solutions revenue in thousands change for the year ended september performance measurement services revenue performance management solutions revenue total revenue 
table of contents change for the year ended september performance measurement services revenue performance management solutions revenue total revenue performance measurement services revenue decreased by  for the twelve months ended september  as compared to the corresponding period in fiscal performance measurement services revenue represented and of total revenue for the twelve months ended september  and  respectively 
performance measurement services revenue decreased by approximately million for the twelve months ended september  as compared to the corresponding period in fiscal performance measurement services revenue represented and of total revenue for the twelve months ended september  and  respectively 
the decrease in performance measurement services revenue was mainly attributable to reduced subscriptions for our website perspective service  resulting in fewer measurements  partially offset by increases in our transaction perspective and red alert monitoring services as well as revenue from our streaming perspective and application perspective services which were newly introduced in fiscal performance management solutions revenue increased by approximately million for the twelve months ended september  as compared to the corresponding period in fiscal performance management solutions revenue represented and of total revenue for the twelve months ended september  and  respectively 
performance management solutions revenue increased by approximately million for the twelve months ended september  as compared to the corresponding period in fiscal performance management solutions revenue represented and of total revenue for the twelve months ended september  and  respectively 
the increase in performance management solutions revenue was mainly attributable to increased contribution from our enterprise solutions  webeffective intelligence platform services as a result of our acquisition of netraker in april and vividence in september  wireless perspective  testing and tuning solutions  as well as network perspective  which was newly introduced in december as a result of our acquisition of the business of matrixnet division of xaffire  inc matrixnet 
comparison of fiscal years ended september  and revenue change in thousands subscription services consulting and support services total revenue subscription services 
revenue from subscription services increased million for the twelve months ended september  as compared to the twelve months ended september  subscription services represented and of total revenue for the twelve months ended september  and september   respectively 
the increase in revenue in absolute dollars  as listed in descending order of impact  was primarily attributable to increased revenue from our wireless perspective  webeffective intelligence platform  network perspective  streaming  and private agent services  offset by a decrease in our benchmarking revenue 
consulting and support services 
revenue from consulting and support services increased by approximately million for the twelve months ended september  as compared to the twelve months ended september  revenue from consulting and support services represented approximately and of total revenue for the twelve months ended september  and  respectively 
the increase in revenue in absolute dollars  as listed in descending order of impact  resulted primarily due to the increased contribution from webeffective intelligence platform as a result of our recent acquisitions of netraker and 
table of contents vividence  and from our enterprise solutions  and loadpro services 
because our consulting and support services are provided on a per engagement basis  revenue depends on the number of engagements and the size of such engagements 
as a result  consulting and support services revenue are less predictable than subscription services revenue and may vary from period to period 
for the years ended september  and  no single customer accounted for more than of total revenue 
at september  and  no single customer accounted for more than of total accounts receivable 
international sales were approximately of our total revenue for each of the twelve months ended september  and  respectively 
expenses costs of subscription services and consulting and support services change in thousands costs of subscription services costs of consulting and support services costs of subscription services 
costs of subscription services consist of connection fees to internet service providers for bandwidth usage of our measurement computers  which are located around the world  and depreciation  maintenance and other equipment charges for our measurement and data collection infrastructure 
costs of subscription services decreased by approximately million for the twelve months ended september  as compared to the twelve months ended september  and represented and of subscription services revenue for the twelve months ended september  and  respectively 
this decrease was primarily due to reduced costs for bandwidth and  to a lesser extent  lower depreciation expenses 
we intend to continue our efforts to reduce costs of subscription services in future periods 
we believe that costs of subscription services in absolute dollars for the first quarter of fiscal will remain comparable to the fourth quarter of fiscal costs of consulting and support services 
costs of consulting and support services consist of compensation expenses and related costs for consulting and support service personnel  all load testing bandwidth costs and related network infrastructure costs 
costs of consulting and support services also include costs of retaining and rewarding panel participants for our webeffective intelligence platform engagements 
costs of consulting and support services increased by  for the twelve months ended september  as compared to the year ended september  and represented and of consulting and support service revenue for the years ended september  and  respectively 
the increase was primarily due to costs associated with our webeffective intelligence platform services  which we acquired in april related to our netraker acquisition and september related to our vividence acquisition and additional personnel costs as a result of our acquisition of hudson williams in july  offset  in part  by a decrease in bandwidth costs 
we expect that the costs of consulting and support services as a percentage of consulting and support services revenue will continue to be greater than the costs of subscription services as a percentage of subscription services revenue 
we expect that costs of consulting and support services in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue for the first quarter of fiscal will be higher than the fourth quarter of fiscal due to the acquisition of vividence completed in september research and development change in thousands research and development 
table of contents research and development expenses consist primarily of compensation and related costs for research and development personnel 
research and development expenses decreased by  for the twelve months ended september  as compared to the twelve months ended september  this decrease was primarily attributable to lower costs resulting from a reduced number of research and development personnel and reduced salaries 
to date  all research and development expenses have been expensed as incurred 
we anticipate that research and development expenses in absolute dollars for the first quarter of fiscal will increase from the fourth quarter of fiscal due to additional personnel costs related to the acquisition of vividence completed in september sales and marketing change in thousands sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions and bonuses earned by sales and marketing personnel  lead referral fees  marketing programs and travel expenses 
our sales and marketing expenses decreased by million for the twelve months ended september  as compared to the twelve months ended september  the decrease primarily resulted from a reduced number of sales and marketing personnel  and to a lesser extent  from reduced spending on certain marketing programs 
we believe that continued investments in our sales and marketing efforts are essential for us to maintain our market position and to further increase acceptance of our services 
we anticipate that sales and marketing expenses in absolute dollars for the first quarter of fiscal will increase compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal due to expenses associated with our global internet performance conference held in october operations change in thousands operations operations expenses consist primarily of compensation and related costs for management and technical support personnel who manage and maintain our field measurement and collection infrastructure and headquarters data center  and provide basic customer support 
our operations personnel also work closely with other departments to assure the reliability of our services and to support our sales and marketing activities 
our operations expenses decreased by million for the twelve months ended september  as compared to the twelve months ended september  the decrease in operations expenses was primarily the result of improving operating efficiencies and to lower personnel costs from reducing the number of personnel in the operations group  and  to a lesser extent  to reduced salaries  offset partially by increased spending in communication services 
we anticipate that operations expenses in absolute dollars for the first quarter of fiscal will increase compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal due to additional personnel costs related to the acquisition of vividence completed in september general and administrative change in thousands general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses  accounting  legal and administrative expenses  insurance  professional services fees and other general corporate expenses 
our general and administrative expenses decreased by million for the twelve months ended september  
table of contents as compared to the twelve months ended september  the decrease in our general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to reduced personnel costs  lower spending on professional service fees such as legal and consulting  offset by an increase in spending on accounting and audit fees mainly attributable to the increasing cost of compliance requirements and audit work associated with our acquisitions 
we anticipate that general and administrative expenses in absolute dollars for the first quarter of fiscal will increase compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal due to increased personnel costs related to the acquisition of vividence completed in september and increased regulatory services and audit fees 
excess occupancy costs change in thousands excess occupancy costs excess occupancy costs are fixed expenses associated with the unoccupied portion of our headquarters building  acquired in september  such as property taxes  insurance  and depreciation 
the costs are based on the actual unoccupied square footage  which was for the first nine months and for the last three months for the year ended september  and the twelve months ended september  the decrease in expenses was primarily due to an increase in tenant income and a one time property tax refund of  we expect the unoccupied portion of our headquarters building to reduce in the first quarter of fiscal as personnel from vividence are relocated to our headquarters building 
amortization of identifiable intangible assets  amortization of stock based compensation and in process research and development change in thousands amortization of identifiable intangible assets amortization of stock based compensation in process research and development costs total amortization of identifiable intangible assets  amortization of stock based compensation and in process research and development for the twelve months ended september   we recorded approximately million for the amortization of identifiable intangible assets and for the year ended september   we recorded approximately million for the amortization of identifiable intangible assets 
amortization of identifiable intangible assets increased by approximately  for the twelve months ended september  due to increased amortization of identifiable intangible assets resulting from our acquisitions of matrixnet in december  netraker in april  hudson williams in july  and vividence in september at september   we had a remaining balance of approximately million of identifiable intangible assets that are being amortized over a three or four year expected life 
the in process research and development expense of  for the year ended september  relates to the estimated fair value of an acquired in process research and development project in connection with our acquisition of vividence 
this project  related to vividence s technology for its web based customer research  had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use 
the estimated fair value of this project was determined based on the avoided costs approach as of the acquisition date where the fair value of the acquired technology is equal to the costs  which an acquirer will avoid spending in developing a similar functional technology 
this amount was immediately expensed as of the acquisition date 
we expect to complete the research and development on this project in the first quarter of fiscal 
table of contents we review our identifiable intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable 
we expect the amortization of identifiable intangible assets to be approximately  for the first quarter of fiscal  assuming no additional acquisitions or impairment charges 
we expect the remaining carrying value of the identifiable intangible assets as of september   as listed in the table below  will be fully amortized by september in thousands technology based customer based total net carrying value at september  interest income  and interest and other expenses change in thousands interest income interest and other expenses interest income  interest and other expenses  net interest income  and interest and other expenses  net  decreased by million for the twelve months ended september  as compared to the twelve months ended september  the decrease in interest income  and interest and other expenses  net  was primarily attributable to a lower level of invested cash due to the use of approximately million of cash to repurchase our common stock primarily in our two issuer tender offers in november and may  the use of approximately million of cash for our acquisitions of matrixnet  netraker  hudson williams  and vividence in december  april  july  and september  respectively  and lower average interest rates 
substantially all of the interest income represents interest earned from our cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments 
we expect that interest income  and interest and other expense  net  for the first quarter of fiscal will be approximately  absent any additional transactions  and assuming no material changes in interest rates provision for income taxes change in thousands provision for income taxes provision for income taxes for the twelve months ended september  was  our effective tax rate for the twelve months ended september  was approximately  before recording in the fourth quarter of the year ended september   a net income tax benefit totaling  associated with resolution of tax matters relating to a foreign subsidiary and us state income taxes  which reduced the effective tax rate to approximately 
we establish liabilities or reserves when we believe that certain tax positions are likely to be challenged and we may not succeed  despite our belief that our tax returns are fully supportable 
we adjust these reserves  as well as related interest  in light of changing circumstances such as the progress of tax examinations and the expiration of the statute of limitations 
no benefit for federal  state  and foreign income taxes was recorded for the year ended september  because we provided a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets generated from the operating loss 
as of september   we had net operating loss carryforwards for us and foreign income tax reporting purposes of approximately million  and million  respectively  available to reduce future income subject to income taxes 
as of september   we had net operating loss carryforwards for state income tax purposes of approximately million available to 
table of contents reduce future income subject to income taxes 
the us net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire  if not utilized in the year the foreign net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in the year state net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire if not utilized in in addition  as of september   we had research credit carryforwards for both federal and california income tax purposes of approximately million and million  respectively  available to reduce future income taxes 
the federal research credit carryforwards begin to expire in the year the california research credit carryforwards are available indefinitely 
deferred tax liabilities have not been recognized for undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries because it is management s intention to reinvest such undistributed earnings outside the united states 
federal and california tax laws impose substantial restrictions on the utilization of net operating loss and credit carryforwards in the event of an ownership change for tax purposes  as defined in section of the internal revenue code 
we are currently in the process of determining whether ownership changes have occurred due to significant historical stock transactions in prior years 
if an ownership change has occurred  the utilization of net operating loss and credit carryforwards could be reduced significantly

table of contents excess occupancy costs change in thousands excess occupancy costs excess occupancy costs are fixed expenses associated with the unoccupied portion of our headquarters building  acquired in september  such as property taxes  insurance  and depreciation 
the costs are based on the actual unoccupied square footage  which was for the first nine months and for the last three months for the year ended september  lease termination charge change in thousands lease termination charge in july  we entered into a five year synthetic lease agreement for our corporate headquarters building in san mateo  california 
on september   we terminated the lease and purchased the property for a total of million 
the lease  which was due to expire in  provided for a residual guarantee of a total of million due at the end of the lease term or upon lease termination 
our obligation was fully collateralized with restricted cash of million 
after we entered into the lease in july  real estate market conditions worsened  including a significant increase in available space for lease and significant declines in corresponding lease rates for commercial property 
accordingly  a loss on termination of this lease was recognized in connection with the purchase of the building in september the loss was calculated by comparing the purchase price of the building to its fair value 
to determine the fair value of the building  we had an independent real estate appraisal conducted  which indicated that the fair value of the property was approximately million 
the calculated loss of approximately million was recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal the million loss on termination was adjusted for the reversal of the remaining excess facility charge accrual and costs associated with the acquisition of the building  resulting in a net charge to the consolidated statements of operations of approximately million for the year ended september  amortization of identifiable intangible assets  amortization of stock based compensation and in process research and development change in thousands amortization of identifiable intangible assets amortization of stock based compensation in process research and development costs total amortization of identifiable intangible assets  amortization of stock based compensation and in process research and development for the year ended september   we recorded approximately million for the amortization of identifiable intangible assets and for the year ended september   we recorded approximately million for the amortization of identifiable intangible assets 
amortization of identifiable intangible assets increased by approximately  for the year ended september  in connection with our acquisitions of netmechanic in may  enviz in october  and streamcheck in july 
table of contents at september   we had a remaining balance of approximately million of identifiable intangible assets that are being amortized over a three year period from the date of acquisition 
certain stock options granted prior to june   have been considered to be compensatory  as the estimated fair value for accounting purposes was greater than the stock price as determined by the board of directors on the date of grant 
as a result  we recorded amortization of deferred compensation expense of  during the year ended september   compared to  for the year ended september  the decrease in the amortization of deferred compensation from fiscal to fiscal was a result of our discontinuing to amortize costs associated with former employees that had been terminated 
deferred compensation was amortized on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the options and was fully amortized as of september  the in process research and development charge of  for the year ended september  related to the estimated fair value of an acquired in process research and development project  which we acquired in connection with our acquisition of netmechanic  that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use  related to netmechanic s technology for web site testing

interest income  interest and other expenses change in thousands interest income interest and other expenses interest income  interest and other expenses  net interest income  and interest and other expenses  net  decreased by million  or  during the year ended september  as compared to the year ended september  the majority of the interest income was earned on our invested cash 
the decrease in interest income was primarily attributable to a lower level of invested cash due to the use of million of restricted cash to purchase our headquarters building in september  the use of approximately million of cash to repurchase our common stock primarily in our two issuer tender offers in november and may  and the continued decline in interest rates 
substantially all of the interest income represents interest earned from our cash  short term investments and restricted cash 
provision for income taxes no benefit for federal  state  and foreign income taxes was recorded for the years ended september  and  because we provided a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets generated from the operating loss

liquidity and capital resources as of september  as of september  as of september  in thousands cash  cash equivalents and short term investments accounts receivable  net working capital days sales in accounts receivable dso a a dso is based on ending net accounts receivable and the most recent quarterly net sales for each period in thousands for the year ended september cash provided by operating activities cash provided by used in investing activities cash provided by used in financing activities cash  cash equivalents and short term investments at september   we had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents and approximately million in short term investments  for a total of approximately million 
cash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments held at major banks  commercial paper  united states government agency discount notes  money market mutual funds and other money market securities with original maturities of three months or less 
short term investments consist of investment grade corporate and government debt securities and issuances with moody s ratings of a or better 
the increase in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments for the year ended september  was primarily due to approximately million from cash flow from operating activities  and approximately million from cash flow from financing activities 
the largest uses of cash from investing activities during the year ended september were the net purchases of property  equipment and software for approximately million and approximately million for the purchases of matrixnet in december  netraker in april  hudson williams in july  and vividence in september cash provided by operating activities for the twelve months ended september   net cash provided by operating activities was approximately million which was mainly due to net income  excluding all non cash amortization and depreciation charges  an increase of accounts payable and accrued liabilities of approximately million  and an increase in deferred revenue of  partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of  and an increase of prepaids and other assets of  the increase in deferred revenue was mainly attributable to an increase in the value of prepaid invoices and deferred revenue arising from the vividence acquisition in september net accounts receivable increased primarily due to the increase in revenue for fiscal as compared to the corresponding period in the decrease in prepaids and other assets was mainly attributable to normal monthly amortization  as well as lower spending and renegotiation of maintenance and support contracts at lower rates 
the increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities was mainly attributable to an increase in personnel costs related accruals such as vacation associated with our recent acquisitions and withheld our employee stock purchase plan contributions and increased spending in legal and audit services related to regulatory compliance and acquisitions 

table of contents cash used in investing activities for the twelve months ended september   net cash used in our investing activities was approximately million 
we utilized approximately million  including direct costs of the acquisitions  for the acquisitions of the business of the matrixnet in december  netraker in april  hudson williams in july  and vividence in september we utilized approximately million to purchase property and equipment  primarily for our production infrastructure  information systems  and tenant improvements associated with space that we have rented in our headquarters building 
we generated approximately million from the net sales and maturities of our short term investments 
cash provided by financing activities for the twelve months ended september   net cash provided by our financing activities was approximately million 
we received approximately million from the issuance of common stock associated with our employee stock option plan and employee stock purchase plan 
we utilized  to repay two lines of credit that were assumed as a result of our recent acquisitions of netraker and vividence 
our board of directors has approved a program to repurchase shares of our common stock  and pursuant to the stock repurchase program  a total of million shares were repurchased between january and september for an aggregate price of approximately million 
at september   approximately million was available to repurchase shares of our common stock pursuant to this stock repurchase program 
no repurchases occurred during the twelve months ended september  commitments and contractual obligations as of september   our principal commitments consisted of  in real property operating leases and equipment capital and operating leases  with various lease terms  the longest of which expires in june additionally  we had contingent commitments to bandwidth and collocation providers amounting to  for locations ranging from one to fifteen months  which commitments become due if we terminate any of these agreements prior to their expiration 
at present  we do not intend to terminate any of these agreements prior to their expiration 
we expect to continue to invest in capital and other assets to support our growth 
we expect to make additional capital expenditures of approximately million related to our operations and headquarters building for the first quarter of fiscal  absent any other acquisitions or extraordinary transactions 
the following table summarizes our minimum contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of september  in thousands  and the effect we expect them to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods payment due by period total less than year years years more than years contractual obligations leases commercial commitments bandwidth and collocation total we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next months 
factors that could affect our cash position include potential acquisitions  additional stock repurchases  decreases in customers or renewals  decreases in revenue or changes in the value of our short term investments 
if  after some period of time  cash generated from operations is insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or to obtain a credit facility 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of debt 
table of contents securities  these securities could have rights  preferences and privileges senior to holders of common stock  and the term of this debt could impose restrictions on our operations 
the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities could result in dilution to our stockholders  and we may not be able to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain this additional financing  our business may be harmed 
we also have earn out obligations associated with some of our acquisitions 
for our streamcheck acquisition  we are expected to pay out a cash payment of approximately  in january for our netraker and vividence acquisitions  there are additional contingent consideration cash payments of up to million and million  respectively  that could be made if certain revenue and profitability targets are achieved by the acquired businesses during the year ended september  for more details  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
off balance sheet arrangements we did not enter into any transactions with unconsolidated entities whereby we have financial guarantees  subordinated retained interests  derivative instruments or other contingent arrangements that expose us to material continuing risks  contingent liabilities  or any other obligation under a variable interest in a unconsolidated entity that provides financing  liquidity  market risk or credit risk support to us 
indemnifications we do not generally indemnify customers for our measuring  monitoring and testing web based applications against legal claims that our products and services infringe on third party intellectual property rights 
other agreements entered into by us may include indemnification provisions under which we could be subject to costs and or damages in the event of an infringement claim against us or an indemnified third party 
however  we have never been a party to an infringement claim and in the opinion of management  we do not have a liability related to any infringement claims subject to indemnification and as such  there is no material adverse affect on our financial condition  liquidity or results of operations 
recent accounting pronouncements in march  the emerging issues task force reached consensus on issue no 
eitf  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
eitf includes new guidance for evaluating and recording impairment losses on debt and equity investments  as well as new disclosure requirements for investments that are deemed to be temporarily impaired 
in september  the fasb issued fasb staff position eitf  which delays the effective date until additional guidance is issued for the application of the recognition and measurement provisions of eitf to investments in securities that are impaired  however  the disclosure requirements are effective for annual periods ending after june  although we will continue to monitor the application of eitf  we do not currently believe adoption will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in december  the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition  which supersedes sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
the primary purpose of sab no 
is to rescind accounting guidance contained in sab no 
related to multiple element revenue arrangements  superseded as a result of the issuance of eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
additionally  sab no 
rescinds the sec s revenue recognition in financial statements frequently asked questions and answers the faq issued with sab no 
that had been codified in sec topic  revenue recognition 
selected portions of the faq have been incorporated into sab no 
while the wording of sab no 
has changed to reflect the issuance of eitf issue no 
 the revenue recognition principles of sab no 
remain largely unchanged by the issuance of sab no 
the adoption of sab no 
did not have a material impact on our reported results 

table of contents accounting for stock based compensation we currently measure compensation expense for our employee stock based compensation plans using the intrinsic value method prescribed by accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and provide pro forma disclosures of the effect on net income loss and earnings loss per share as if the fair value based method had been applied in measuring compensation expense 
we have elected to follow apb opinion no 
because  as further discussed in part ii  item of this form k at note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  the alternative fair value accounting provided for under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  requires use of option valuation models that were not developed for use in valuing employee stock options and employee stock purchase plan shares 
under apb opinion no 
 when the exercise price of our employee stock options equals the market price of the underlying stock on the date of the grant  no compensation expense is recognized 
on march   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued a proposed statement  share based payment  that addresses the accounting for share based payment transactions in which an enterprise receives employee services in exchange for a equity instruments of the enterprise or b liabilities that are based on the fair value of the enterprise s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments 
the proposed statement would eliminate the ability to account for share based compensation transactions using apb opinion no 
and generally would require instead that such transactions be accounted for using a fair value based method 
if adopted  it is currently anticipated that the proposed statement would be effective for us beginning our fourth fiscal quarter of we have not elected to expense the value of employee stock options until the fasb finalizes its new accounting standard on the matter  which may play a significant role in determining the fair value of and accounting for employee stock options 
we will monitor the progress at the fasb and other developments with respect to the general issue of employee stock compensation 
we are currently reviewing the potential impact from the guidance of the proposed statement  which may require that we recognize substantially more compensation expense in future periods that could have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations 
the accounting impact had we chosen to apply the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
 instead of the recognition provisions under apb opinion no 
 is described in part ii  item of this form k at note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
factors that may impact future operating results we have introduced new products and services  and we have an unproven business model  which makes it difficult to evaluate our current business and future prospects 
we have introduced many new services during the past fiscal year  including in october  we introduced an updated version of our wireless perspective service and we introduced several new services including  application perspective  performance scoreboard  performancetune  and test perspective for siebel in january  we introduced network perspective  which we acquired in connection with our acquisition of the business of the matrixnet division of xaffire  inc in december in february  we introduced application perspective outside edition 
in april  we introduced webeffective intelligence platform  an integration of our existing webeffective services with netraker s services as a result of our acquisition of netraker in april in june  we launched webintegrity  a new version of our hosted service 
in september  we entered into the customer experience management market through our acquisition of vividence corporation 
because we introduced these services relatively recently  it is difficult for us to evaluate the long term revenue and income potential of our current business and services and the related markets 
in addition  because 
table of contents some of our services are new and because the market for e business performance management services is evolving and we also have little previous experience in the customer experience management market and  therefore  we have limited insight into trends that may emerge and affect our business 
we have incurred in the past and may in the future continue to incur losses  and we may not sustain profitability 
although we have recently been profitable  we have experienced operating losses in each annual period since inception and in each quarterly period since inception through the third quarter of fiscal we may not be able to sustain operating profitability in the future 
we generated net income of approximately million for the twelve months ended september   and as of september   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
in addition  we are required under generally accepted accounting principles to review our goodwill and identifiable intangible assets for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
as of september   we had approximately million of net identifiable intangible assets and approximately million of goodwill 
if we complete additional acquisitions in the future  we may have additional goodwill and or identifiable intangibles and  accordingly  may incur expenses in connection with a write down of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets due to changes in market conditions as we did in the quarter ended june  when we recorded an impairment charge for goodwill and identifiable intangible assets of million in connection with our acquisitions of velogic and digital content 
we believe that our operating expenses could increase as they have in certain past periods 
as a result  we will need to increase our revenue to sustain profitability 
we may not sustain a sequential quarterly increase in revenue and may never be able to regain our historic revenue growth rates 
the success of our business depends on customers renewing their subscriptions for our services and purchasing additional services 
to maintain and grow our revenue  we must achieve and maintain high customer renewal rates for our services 
our customers have no obligation to renew our services and therefore  they could cease using our services at any time 
in addition  our customers may renew for fewer services or at lower prices 
further  our customers may reduce their use of our services during the term of their subscription 
we cannot project the level of renewal rates or the prices at which the customer renews their subscription 
our customer renewal rates and renewal prices may decline as a result of a number of factors  including consolidations in the internet industry or if a significant number of our customers cease operations 
further  we depend on sales to new customers and sales of additional services to our existing customers 
renewals by existing customers or purchases of our services by new customers may be limited as companies limit or reduce their technology spending in response to uncertain economic conditions 
we have experienced  and may in the future experience  cancellations  non renewals and or reduction in service 
if we experience reduced renewal rates or if customers renew for a lesser amount of our services  or if customers  at any time  reduce the amount of services they purchase from us  our revenue could continue to decline unless we are able to obtain additional customers or sources of revenue  sufficient to replace lost revenue 
continued reductions and or cancellations could also result in our inability to collect amounts due 
our quarterly financial results are subject to significant fluctuations  and if our future results are below the expectations of investors  the price of our common stock may decline 
results of operations could vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
if revenue falls below our expectations  we may not be able to reduce our spending rapidly in response to the shortfall 
other factors that could affect our quarterly operating results include those described below and elsewhere in this report the rate of new and renewed subscriptions to our services during the quarter  the amount and timing of any reductions by our customers in their usage of our services during the quarter  
table of contents our ability to increase the number of web sites we measure and the scope of services we offer for our existing customers in a particular quarter  our ability to attract new customers in a quarter  particularly larger customers  our ability to successfully introduce new products and services to offset any reductions in revenue from services that are not as widely used  the timing and amount of consulting and support services revenue  which is difficult to predict because this is dependent on the number of consulting and support services engagements in any given period  the size of these engagements  and our ability to continue our existing engagements and secure new engagements from customers  the timing and amount of operating costs and capital expenditures relating to expansion or contraction of our domestic and international operations infrastructure  the timing and amount  if any  of impairment charges related to potential write down of acquired assets in acquisitions or charges related to the amortization of intangible assets from acquisitions  and the timing and amount  if any  of restructuring costs if we are required to further restructure our operations 
due to these and other factors  we believe that period to period comparisons of our results of operations are not meaningful and should not be relied upon as indicators of our future performance 
it is possible that in some future periods  our results of operations may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
if this occurs  the price of our common stock may decline 
we may face difficulties assimilating our acquisitions and may incur costs associated with any future acquisitions 
we have completed several acquisitions  and as a part of our business strategy we may seek to acquire or invest in additional businesses  products or technologies that we feel could complement or expand our business  augment our market coverage  enhance our technical capabilities or that may otherwise offer growth opportunities 
future acquisitions could create risks for us  including difficulties in assimilating acquired personnel  operations and technologies  difficulties in managing a larger organization  unanticipated costs associated with the acquisition  diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  entry in new businesses in which we have little direct experience  as was the case with our acquisition of vividence corporation  adverse effects on existing business relationships with resellers of our service and our customers  difficulties in managing geographically dispersed businesses  difficulties in retaining personnel from acquired companies  the need to integrate or enhance the systems of an acquired business  impairment charges related to potential write down of acquired assets in acquisitions  failure to realize any of the anticipated benefits of the acquisition  and use of substantial portions of our available cash or dilution in equity if stock is used to consummate the acquisition and or operate the acquired business 

table of contents if we are required by law to account for stock options under our stock option plans as a compensation expense  our results of operations would be materially affected 
it is possible that future laws  regulations or accounting standards will require us to treat all stock options as a compensation expense 
if there is any such change in accounting regulations or standards  this could result in our reporting increased operating expenses  which would decrease any reported net income or increase any reported net loss 
note of our consolidated financial statements shows the impact that such a change in accounting treatment would have had on our net income loss and net income loss per share if it had been in effect during the reporting periods shown and if the compensation expense were calculated as described in note our operating results could be harmed if sales of our e business performance measurement services decline 
sales of our e business performance measurement services  primarily our web site perspective business edition services  and  to a lesser degree  our transaction perspective services  have generated a majority of our total revenue in the past 
therefore  the success of our business currently depends  and for the immediate future will continue to substantially depend  on sales and renewals of our benchmarking services as well as our recently added consulting services 
revenues from our measurement services have been declining from historic levels 
if these revenue continues to decline  our operating results could suffer if we are not able to increase revenues from other services 
improvements to the infrastructure of the internet could reduce or eliminate demand for our internet performance measurement services 
the demand for our e business performance measurement services could be reduced or eliminated if future improvements to the infrastructure of the internet lead companies to conclude that the measurement and evaluation of the performance of their web sites is no longer important to their business 
because the inherent complexity of the internet currently causes significant quality of service problems for e business companies  we believe that the vendors and operators that supply and manage the underlying infrastructure still look to improve the speed  availability  reliability and consistency of the internet 
if these vendors and operators succeed in significantly improving the performance of the internet  which would result in corresponding improvements in the performance of companies web sites  demand for our services would likely decline which would harm our operating results 
the inability of our services to perform properly could result in loss of or delay in revenue  injury to our reputation or other harm to our business 
we offer complex services  which may not perform at the level our customers expect 
we have  in the past  occasionally given credits to customers as a result of past problems with our service 
despite our testing  our existing or future services may not perform as expected due to unforeseen problems  which could result in loss of or delay in revenue  loss of market share  failure to achieve market acceptance  diversion of development resources  injury to our reputation  increased insurance costs or increased service costs 
in addition  we have acquired  rather than developed internally  some of our services in connection with our acquisitions of companies and businesses 
these services may not perform at the level we or our customers expect 
these problems could also result in tort or warranty claims 
although we attempt to reduce the risk of losses resulting from any claims through warranty disclaimers and liability limitation clauses in our customer agreements  these contractual provisions may not be enforceable in every instance 
furthermore  although we maintain errors and omissions insurance  this insurance coverage may not adequately cover us for claims 
if a court refused to enforce the liability limiting provisions of our contracts for any reason  or if liabilities arose that were not contractually limited or adequately covered by insurance  we could be required to pay damages 

table of contents if we do not continually improve our services in response to technological changes  including changes to the internet  we may encounter difficulties retaining existing customers and attracting new customers 
the ongoing evolution of the internet requires us to continually improve the functionality  features and reliability of our e business performance management solutions  particularly in response to offerings of our competitors 
if we do not succeed in developing and marketing new services that respond to competitive and technological developments and changing customer needs  we may encounter difficulties retaining existing customers and attracting new customers 
we must also introduce any new services as quickly as possible 
the success of new services depends on several factors  including proper definition of the scope of the new services and timely completion  introduction and market acceptance of our new services 
if new internet  networking or telecommunication technologies or standards are widely adopted or if other technological changes occur  we may need to expend significant resources to adapt our services to these developments 
we face competition that could make it difficult for us to acquire and retain customers 
the market for e business performance measurement services and performance management solutions is rapidly evolving 
our competitors vary in size and in the scope and breadth of the products and services that they offer 
we face competition from companies that offer software and services with features similar to our services such as mercury interactive  gomez advisors  segue software  watchfire and a variety of small companies that offer a combination of testing  market research capabilities and data 
while we believe these services are not as comprehensive as ours  customers could still choose to use these services or these companies could enhance their services to offer all of the features we offer 
as we expand the scope of our products and services  we expect to encounter many additional market specific competitors 
we could also face competition from other companies  which currently do not offer services similar to our services  but offer software or services related to e business performance management solutions  such as webtrends  omniture  webside story and coremetrics  and free services that measure web site availability 
in addition  companies that sell systems management software  such as bmc software  compuware  ca unicenter  hp openview  quest software  netiq  veritas precise software  and ibm s tivoli unit  with some of whom we have strategic relationships  could choose to offer services similar to ours 
in the future  we intend to expand our service offerings and continue to measure and manage the performance of emerging technologies such as internet telephony  wireless devices  and wireless fidelity  or wi fi  networks and  as a result  could face competition from other companies 
some of our existing and future competitors have or may have longer operating histories  larger customer bases  greater brand recognition in similar businesses  and significantly greater financial  marketing  technical and other resources 
in addition  some of our competitors may be able to devote greater resources to marketing and promotional campaigns  to adopt more aggressive pricing policies  and to devote substantially more resources to technology and systems development 
increased competition may result in price reductions  increased costs of providing our services and loss of market share  any of which could seriously harm our business 
we may not be able to compete successfully against our current and future competitors 
a limited number of customers account for a significant portion of our revenue  and the loss of a major customer could harm our operating results 
ten customers accounted for approximately  and of our total revenue for the twelve months ended september    and  respectively 
we cannot be certain that customers that have accounted for significant revenue in past periods  individually or as a group  will renew  will not cancel or will not reduce their services and  therefore  continue to generate revenue in any future period 
in addition  our customers that do not have written contracts may terminate their services at any time with little or no penalty 
if we lose a major customer  our revenue could decline 

table of contents if we do not complement our direct sales force with relationships with other companies to help market our e business performance management solutions  we may not be able to grow our business 
to increase sales of services worldwide  we must complement our direct sales force with relationships with companies to help market and sell our services to their customers 
if we are unable to maintain our existing marketing and distribution relationships  or fail to enter into additional relationships  we may have to devote substantially more resources to the direct sale and marketing of our services 
we would also lose anticipated revenue from customer referrals and other co marketing benefits 
in the past  we terminated relationships with three of our international resellers  and we may be required to terminate other reseller relationships in the future 
as a result  we are investing time and resources in evaluating replacements for these resellers and are committing resources to supplement our direct sales effort in the united kingdom and germany 
our success depends in part on the ability of these companies to help market and sell our services 
our existing relationships do not  and any future relationships may not  afford us any exclusive marketing or distribution rights 
therefore  they could reduce their commitment to us at any time in the future 
many of these companies have multiple relationships and they may not regard us as significant for their business 
in addition  these companies generally may terminate their relationships with us  pursue other relationships with our competitors or develop or acquire products or services that compete with our services 
even if we succeed in entering into these relationships  they may not result in additional customers or revenue 
we must retain qualified personnel in a competitive marketplace  or we may not be able to grow our business 
we may be unable to retain our key employees  namely our management team and experienced engineers  or to attract  assimilate or retain other highly qualified employees 
although we  and a number of other technology companies  have implemented workforce reductions  there remains substantial competition for highly skilled employees 
in addition  vividence had approximately employees  and some of these employees have decided not to continue to work with us 
because the vividence business is an area in which we have little experience  it will be important for us to retain the key personnel from this company and we cannot assure you that we will be successful in doing so 
our key employees are not bound by agreements that could prevent them from terminating their employment at any time 
if we fail to attract and retain key employees  our business could be harmed 
if the market does not accept our professional services  our results of operations could be harmed 
consulting and support services revenue represented approximately of total revenue for the twelve months ended september  we have recently added to our consulting services with our acquisitions of netraker corporation in april  hudson williams corporation in july  and vividence corporation in september the cost of consulting and support services has  at times  exceeded our consulting revenue 
we will also need to successfully market these services to potential customers in order to increase consulting revenue 
each consulting engagement typically spans a one to three month period  and therefore  it is more difficult for us to predict the amount of consulting and support services revenue recognized in any particular quarter 
there are many experienced firms that offer computer network and internet related consulting services 
these consulting services providers include consulting companies  such as accenture  as well as consulting divisions of large technology companies such as ibm 
because we do not have an established reputation for delivering consulting services  because this area is very competitive  and due to our limited experience in delivering consulting services  we may not succeed in selling these services 
the success of our business depends on the continued use of the internet by business and consumers for e business and communications 
because our business is based on providing e business performance management solutions  the internet must continue to be used as a means of electronic business  or e business  and communications 
in addition  we 
table of contents believe that the use of the internet for conducting business transactions could be hindered for a number of reasons  including  but not limited to security concerns including the potential for fraud or theft of stored data and information communicated over the internet  inconsistent quality of service  including well publicized outages of popular web sites  lack of availability of cost effective  high speed services  limited numbers of local access points for corporate users  delay in the development of enabling technologies or adoption of new standards  inability to integrate business applications with the internet  the need to operate with multiple and frequently incompatible products  and a lack of tools to simplify access to and use of the internet 
our network infrastructure could be disrupted by a number of different occurrences  which could impair our ability to serve and retain existing customers or attract new customers 
all data collected from our measurement computers are stored in and distributed from our operations center  which we maintain at a single location 
therefore  our operations depend upon our ability to maintain and protect our computer systems  most of which are located at our corporate headquarters in san mateo  california  which is an area susceptible to earthquakes and possible power outages 
although we have a generator to provide our own source of long term uninterruptible power  if we experience power outages at our operations center  we might not be able to promptly receive data from our measurement computers and we might not be able to deliver our services to our customers on a timely basis 
although we believe our main operations are redundant between our san mateo and plano  texas datacenters  an outage at either center could lead to service interruptions 
therefore  our operations systems are vulnerable to damage from break ins  computer viruses  unauthorized access  vandalism  fire  floods  earthquakes  power loss  telecommunications failures and similar events 
although we maintain insurance against fires  earthquakes and general business interruptions  the amount of coverage may not be adequate in any particular case 
if our operations center is damaged  this could disrupt our services  which could impair our ability to retain existing customers or attract new customers 
if our computer infrastructure is not functioning properly  we may not be able to deliver our services in a timely or accurate manner 
we have occasionally experienced outages of our service in the past  which have typically lasted no more than a few hours 
these outages have been caused by a variety of factors including electrical distribution equipment malfunctions  operator error  the failure of a back up computer to operate when the primary computer ceased functioning and power outages due to our previous facility s being inadequately equipped to house our operations center 
any outage for any period of time or loss of customer data could cause us to lose customers 
individuals who attempt to breach our network security  such as hackers  could  if successful  misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions in our services 
although in the past  we had a breach of our security through what appears to be unauthorized access to certain data belonging to one of our customers  we have not yet experienced any breaches of our network security or sabotage that has prevented us from serving our customers 
we might be required to expend significant capital and resources to protect against  or to alleviate  problems caused by hackers 
we may not have a timely remedy against a hacker who is able to breach our network security 
in addition to intentional security breaches  the inadvertent transmission of computer viruses could expose us to litigation or to a material risk of loss 

table of contents our measurement computers are located at sites that we do not own or operate  and it could be difficult for us to maintain or repair them if they do not function properly 
our measurement computers are located at facilities that are not owned by our customers or us 
instead  these computers are installed at locations near various internet access points worldwide 
although we operate these computers remotely from our san mateo  california operations center  we do not own or operate the facilities  and we have little control over how these computers are maintained on a day to day basis 
we do not have long term contractual relationships with the companies that operate the facilities where our measurement computers are located 
we may have to find new locations for these computers if we are unable to develop relationships with these companies or if these companies cease their operations as some have done due to bankruptcies or are acquired 
in addition  if our measurement computers cease to function properly  we may not be able to repair or service these computers on a timely basis  as we may not have immediate access to our measurement computers 
our ability to collect data in a timely manner could be impaired if we are unable to maintain and repair our computers should performance problems arise 
others might bring infringement claims against us or our suppliers that could harm our business 
in recent years  there has been significant litigation in the united states involving patents and other intellectual property rights 
we could become subject to intellectual property infringement claims as the number of our competitors grows and our services overlap with competitive offerings 
in addition  we are also subject to other legal proceedings  claims  and litigation arising in the ordinary course of our business 
any of these claims  even if not meritorious  could be expensive and divert management s attention from operating our company 
if we become liable to others for infringement of their intellectual property rights  we could be required to pay a substantial damage award and to develop noninfringing technology  obtain a license or cease selling the services that contain the infringing intellectual property 
we may be unable to develop non infringing technology or to obtain a license on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
our business will be susceptible to additional risks associated with international operations 
we believe we must expand the sales of our services outside the united states 
to date  we have little experience with direct sales outside the united states  and we may not succeed in these efforts 
international sales were approximately of our total revenue for each of the twelve months ended september  and  respectively 
we intend to expand the sales of our services by selling directly to certain customers and through resellers to other customers 
therefore  we expect to continue to commit our resources to expand our international sales and marketing activities 
conducting international operations subjects us to risks we do not face in the united states 
these include currency exchange rate fluctuations  seasonal fluctuations in purchasing patterns  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  maintaining and servicing computer hardware in distant locations  longer accounts receivable payment cycles and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable  difficulties in managing and staffing international operations  potentially adverse tax consequences  including restrictions on the repatriation of earnings  the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws  and reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries 
the internet may not be used as widely in other countries and the adoption of e business may evolve slowly or may not evolve at all

table of contents our future operating results could be harmed if we are unable to lease a major portion of the space in our corporate headquarters building or if the fair value of this property decreases further 
we currently do not occupy approximately of our headquarters building in san mateo  california 
we may be unable to lease all or a part of the available space  and if it is leased  we may not receive sufficiently high rental rates to cover our building operating costs 
in addition  we have previously incurred a charge for the write down of the building  and  if the real estate market continues to deteriorate  we may incur charges for future write downs 
any such charge could harm our results of operations 
compliance with new rules and regulations concerning corporate governance may increase our costs and could harm our business 
the sarbanes oxley act  which was signed into law in july  mandates  among other things  that companies adopt new corporate governance measures and imposes comprehensive reporting and disclosure requirements  sets stricter independence and financial expertise standards for audit committee members and imposes increased civil and criminal penalties for companies  their chief executive officers and chief financial officers and directors for securities law violations 
in addition  the nasdaq stock market  on which our common stock is listed  has also adopted additional comprehensive rules and regulations relating to corporate governance 
these laws  rules and regulations have increased the scope  complexity and cost of our corporate governance  reporting and disclosure practices  which could harm our results of operations and divert management s attention from business operations 
we also expect these developments to make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance  and we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage 
further  our board members  chief executive officer and chief financial officer could face an increased risk of personal liability in connection with the performance of their duties 
as a result  we may have difficultly attracting and retaining qualified board members and executive officers  which would adversely affect our business 
we have anti takeover protections that may delay or prevent a change in control that could benefit our stockholders 
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our board of directors

we have also adopted a stockholder rights plan that may discourage  delay or prevent a change of control and make any future unsolicited acquisition attempt more difficult 
the rights will become exercisable only upon the occurrence of certain events specified in the rights plan  including the acquisition of of our outstanding common stock by a person or group 
in addition  it is the policy of our board of directors that a committee consisting solely of independent directors will review the rights plan at least once every three years to consider whether maintaining the rights plan continues to be in the best interests of keynote and our stockholders 
the board may amend the terms of the rights without the approval of the holders of the rights 
industry consolidation may lead to increased competition and may harm our operating results 
there has been a trend toward industry consolidation in our markets for several years 
we expect this trend to continue as companies attempt to strengthen or hold their market positions in an evolving industry and as companies are acquired or are unable to continue operations 
we believe that industry consolidation may result in 
table of contents stronger competitors that are better able to compete for customers 
this could lead to more variability in operating results and could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results  and financial condition 
furthermore  rapid consolidation could also lead to fewer customers  with the effect that loss of a major customer could harm our revenue

interest rate sensitivity 
our interest income and expense is sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates  particularly because most of our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments are invested in short term debt instruments 
if market interest rates were to change immediately and uniformly by ten percent from levels at september   the interest earned on those cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments could increase or decrease by approximately  on an annualized basis
