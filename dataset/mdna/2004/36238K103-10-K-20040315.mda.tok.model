item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis is provided to increase the understanding of  and should be read in conjunction with  the consolidated financial statements and notes 
historical results and percentage relationships among any amounts in the consolidated financial statements are not necessarily indicative of trends in operating results for any future period 
overview gtsi is a recognized information technology it solutions leader  providing products and services to federal  state  and local government customers worldwide 
for two decades gtsi has served the public sector by teaming up with global it leaders such as hp  panasonic  microsoft  sun and cisco 
gtsi seeks to deliver maximum value through its broad range of products  extensive contract portfolio  and iso registered logistics 
through its technology teams  gtsi delivers best of breed products and services to help its customers realize strong value for their it investments 
the technology teams consist of technical experts who support a wide range of integrated it solutions in such areas as high performance computing  advanced networking  mobile and wireless solutions  high availability storage and information assurance 
gtsi continues to broaden its leadership in electronic commerce and procurement through its federally focused website  gtsi 
com  that provides customized shopping zones to meet customers personalized needs 
gtsi is headquartered in northern virginia  outside of washington  dc federal government it spending has grown at a compounded annual rate since  and the company believes that government it spending will continue to be robust in the foreseeable future 
the company s revenue has grown at a compounded annual rate since however  revenue grew at only two percentage points in changes in sales throughout the company s history have been attributable to increased or decreased unit sales  to expansion of the company s product offerings eg  peripherals  personal computers and networking  unix servers workstation and internet products  to the addition removal of vendors  and to the addition or expiration of sales contract vehicles 
the expiration of the fbi trilogy contract early in had a significant impact on the ability for the company to grow revenue in a substantial portion of the company s contracts are fixed price and idiq 
the uncertainties related to future contract performance costs  product life cycles  quantities to be shipped and delivery dates  among other factors  make it difficult to predict the future sales and profits  if any  that may result from such contracts 
gtsi qualified as a small business under several of the gwacs and bpas it held in based upon gtsi s size status at the time of the contracts original award 
as a small business  gtsi enjoys a number of benefits  including being able to compete for small business set aside contracts  qualifying as a small business subcontractor  bidding pursuant to small purchase procedures directed to non manufacturer small business  and offering government agencies an avenue to meet their internal small business purchase goals 
a company s size status under a contract is based on the north american industry classification system naics code referenced in the subject contract s solicitation 
dependent on the naics code referenced in a solicitation  gtsi may or may not qualify as a small business for new contract awards 
under a federal acquisition regulation far deviation issued by gsa on october   gtsi will be required to recertify its size status on its gsa schedule contract no later than at such time  gtsi may not qualify as a small business for new contract awards under the gsa schedule 
in addition  new legislation or regulations may require gtsi to recertify its size status on its gsa schedule sooner than gtsi cannot predict whether it would continue to qualify as a small business at the time of recertification 
to mitigate any potential adverse impact  gtsi has developed strategic relationships with small minority owned businesses that benefit from the small business benefits described above 
gtsi acts as both a supplier and prime contractor to these small minority owned businesses 
legislation is periodically introduced in congress that may change the federal government s procurement practices  and agencies from time to time may issue new regulations or modify existing regulations that may also change the government s procurement practices 
gtsi cannot predict whether any legislative or regulatory proposals will be adopted or  if adopted  the impact upon its operating results 
changes in the structure  composition and or buying patterns of the government  either alone or in combination with competitive conditions or other factors  could adversely affect future results 
noncompliance with government procurement regulations or contract provisions could result in termination of government contracts  substantial monetary fines or damages  suspension or debarment from doing business with the government and civil or criminal liability 
during the term of any suspension or debarment by any government agency  the contractor could be prohibited from competing for or being awarded any contract by any government agency 
in addition  substantially all of the company s government contracts are terminable at any time at the government s convenience or upon default 
upon termination of a government contract for default  the government may also seek to recover from the defaulting contractor the increased costs of procuring the specified goods and services from a different contractor 
the effect of any of these possible government actions or the adoption of new or modified procurement regulations or practices could adversely affect the company 
the company has historically experienced and expects to continue to experience significant seasonal fluctuations in its operations as a result of government buying and funding patterns  which also affect the buying patterns of gtsi s prime contractor customers 
these buying and funding patterns historically have had a significant positive effect on gtsi s bookings in the third quarter ending september each year the federal government s fiscal year end  and consequently on sales and net income in the third and fourth quarters of each year 
quarterly financial results are also affected by the timing of the award of and shipments of products under government contracts  price competition in the computer and it industries  the addition of personnel or other expenses in anticipation of sales growth  product line changes and expansions  and the timing and costs of changes in customer and product mix 
in addition  customer order deferrals in anticipation of new product releases by leading hardware and software manufacturers  delays in vendor shipments of new or existing products  a shift in sales mix to more complex requirements contracts with more complex service costs  and vendor delays in the processing of incentives and credits due gtsi  have occurred all of which are also likely to occur in the future and have adversely affected the company s operating performance in particular periods 
the seasonality and the unpredictability of the factors affecting such seasonality make gtsi s quarterly and yearly financial results difficult to predict and subject to significant fluctuation 
the company s stock price could be adversely affected if any such financial results fail to meet the financial community s expectations 
the company s business strategy is to continue to focus on higher end product based solutions  to broaden its product offering  and to remain a low cost  and high reliability provider of commodity products 
the company also focuses on bringing new technologies to government customers

services also include approximately million  million  and million of consulting and other services that we provided either through our own business resources or through our alliance partners for the years ended december    and  respectively

sales consist of revenues from products delivered and services rendered  net of allowances for customer returns and credits 
net sales in increased million to million  or over sales under idiq and open market contracts increased million and million  respectively 
idiq sales increased due primarily to increased sales on one of our mature contracts combined with strong sales on a newer contract that was just ramping up at the end of sales in the subcontracts and other contracts category decreased million to million due primarily to decreased volume on subcontracts with prime contractors  specifically on the fbi s trilogy contract 
sales in the services product category increase million in services consist mainly of third party productized service and maintenance contracts  as well as consulting services  either through our own business resources or through our alliance with partners 
the increase in service is primarily related to the increased volume of the third party productized service and maintenance contracts 
backlog 
the company recognizes an order in its backlog at the time it receives and accepts a written customer purchase order 
the company s total backlog includes orders that have not shipped unshipped backlog as well as orders that have shipped but cannot be recognized as revenue at the period end 
total backlog at december  was approximately million compared to million at december  unshipped backlog at december  was approximately million compared to million at december  backlog fluctuates significantly from quarter to quarter because of the seasonality of government ordering patterns and fluctuations in inventory availability of various products 
gross margin 
gross margin increased million  or  to million from million in gross margin as a percentage of sales also increased to for from for this increase is due primarily to the january  adoption of emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 accounting for consideration received from a vendor by a customer including a reseller of the vendor s product  which resulted in reclassifying in certain vendor funds as a reduction in cost of sales 
as a result of adopting eitf no 
 the company records certain vendor considerations as a reduction of inventory and a subsequent reduction in cost of goods sold when the related product is sold 
in  the company recorded these items as a reduction to operating expenses 
for comparative purposes  if the company applied eitf no 
to the year ended december   the company s gross margin would have increased from million to million 
the gross margin percentage would have increased from for to for the primary reason for the increase in margins on this comparative basis is due to an increase in the volume of the vendor incentives funds received in compared to during the second quarter of  gtsi s sales organization was successful in securing an order for software inventory that had been reserved for during as a result  the company reversed a million reserve 
this benefit partially contributed to the increase in the gross margin percentage for the year 
operating expenses 
total operating expenses for the year ended december  increased to million from million for excluding a million impairment charge the company recorded in the fourth quarter of for the impairment of a capitalized asset  operating expenses increased million to million from million in a large portion of this increase was a result of the adoption of eitf no 
for comparative purposes  operating expenses for the year ended december  would have been million if eitf no 
was applied to in addition to the impact of this new accounting pronouncement  operating expenses increased due to higher personnel costs due to increased headcount primarily in the sales and technology team organizations 
when an organization adds resources to its sales teams  there is ramp up period before these new sales personnel are fully optimized 
management feels that by making these investments in sales and technology team  personnel the company is now better positioned to take advantage of new opportunities in the state and local marketplace utilizing the us communities contract  sales to prime contractors through the company s revamped integrator solutions group  and in the area of leasing to the government 
also during the third quarter  the company reversed two accrued liabilities related to the resolution of a state business tax issue and the resolution of a customer dispute  which resulted in a total expense reduction of 
million 
expressed as a percentage of total sales  total operating expenses increased to for from in excluding the impact of the impairment charge  operating expenses as a percentage of sales for increased to from 
applying the impact from eitf no 
to the year ended december  for comparison purposes  operating expenses excluding the impairment charge expressed as a percentage of sales would have increased to for compared to in the same quarter last year 
in the fourth quarter of the company recorded an impairment charge of million related to the impairment of capitalized software 
during the fourth quarter the company determined that it was not in the company s best interest to continue to pursue a highly customized enterprise resource planning erp solution due to the high level of development risk and the higher total cost of ownership associated with maintaining a customized solution 
the company has changed its strategy and decided to implement a standard erp system  which is expected to lower the risk  compress the delivery time  provide significant value sooner  and reduce the overall project expenses 
due to this change in strategy  million of the capitalized assets related to the customized solution was determined to have no future economic value 
the enterprise software and hardware for a standard erp system purchased to date will be fully utilized in the roll out of the new erp 
during the fourth quarter of  the company determined that it was remote that certain accrued obligations would need to be paid 
accordingly  the associated obligation of million was reversed 
interest and other income  net 
interest and other income  net is the amount of interest income  prompt payment discounts  and other income partially offset by interest expense on borrowings 
interest and other income  net decreased million  from million to million  or  in compared to interest and other income decreased by million and interest expense decreased 
million over the decrease in interest income is primarily due to a million decrease in prompt payment discounts partially combined with a 
million decrease in interest income from lease receivables 
other income decreased 
million due primarily to a 
million gain on the sale of equipment leases in the first quarter of that did not occur in  partially offset by income received from a minority interest the company holds in another government contractor 
interest expense decreased 
million to 
million in due primarily to improved cash management practices allowing the company to rely less on the credit facility throughout the year than in income taxes 
the company s effective tax rate in was resulting in a tax provision of million in the difference between the effective rate and the statutory rate is primarily state taxes and permanent non deductible items 
compared with sales 
sales consist of revenues from products delivered and services rendered  net of allowances for customer returns and credits 
net sales in increased million  or over sales increased in most product and contract categories 
the largest increase was an approximately million increase in sales made under the subcontracts and other contracts category 
this increase is primarily due to increase in volume on subcontracts with prime contractors  specifically on the fbi s trilogy contract 
increased sales under a distribution agreement with a major vendor also contributed to the increase in subcontracts and other contracts category 
the million increase in sales in the idiq contracts category is primarily related to increased sales under established contract vehicles 
idiq contracts sales were also helped by sales from a new contract awarded to the company in the gsa schedule category increased million due primarily to the government converting some of the company s legacy idiq contracts to bpa contracts at contract renewal 
this caused a shift in sales from the idiq category to the bpa contracts category during the company was also awarded several new bpa contracts during that also contributed to the increase in bpa contract sales 
open market sales decreased million primarily due to the company s customers taking advantage of the company s expanding and mature contract portfolio 
backlog 
the company recognizes an order in its backlog at the time it receives and accepts a written customer purchase order 
the company s total backlog includes orders that have not shipped unshipped backlog as well as orders that have shipped but cannot be recognized as revenue at the period end 
total backlog at december   was approximately million compared to million at december  unshipped backlog at december   was approximately million compared to million at december  backlogs fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter because of the seasonality of government ordering patterns and fluctuations in inventory availability of various products 
gross margin 
gross margin increased million  or  to million from million in due primarily to the increase in sales for the year 
gross margin as a percentage of sales remained flat at in and operating expenses 
net operating expenses for the year ended december  increased million to million for as compared to million for the increase in operating expenses is due primarily to an increase in commission expense as a result of increased sales  an increase in other performance based incentives  and an increase in sales and technology team personnel expense 
expressed as a percentage of total sales  net operating expenses decreased to from in the previous year 
operating expenses reflect the favorable impact of vendor sales support funds 
before the application of these funds  operating expenses were million  or of sales  as compared to million  or of sales  for during the fourth quarter of  the company determined that it was remote that certain accrued obligations would need to be paid 
accordingly  the associated obligation of million was reversed and as a result operating expenses were reduced 
interest and other income  net 
net interest and other income is the amount of interest income  prompt payment discounts  and other income partially offset by interest expense on borrowings 
net interest and other income increased by approximately 
million  from million to million  or  in compared to interest income increased by 
million and interest expense decreased 
million over the increase in interest income is primarily due to a million increase in prompt payment discounts partially offset by a 
million decrease in interest income from lease receivables and a 
million decrease in other interest income from customer collections 
other income increased 
million due primarily to a 
million gain on the sale of equipment leases in the first quarter of income taxes 
the company s effective tax rate in was resulting in a tax provision of million in critical accounting policies we have included below our policies that are both important to our financial condition and operating results  and require management s most subjective and complex judgments in determining the underlying estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates  as they require assumptions that are inherently uncertain 
revenue recognition 
revenue is recognized when a customer order has been executed  the sales price is fixed and determinable  delivery of services or products has occurred  and collection of the sales price is considered probable and can be reasonably estimated 
revenue from hardware and software product sales is generally recognized when title to the products sold passes to the customer  with provisions established for estimated product returns 
based upon the company s standard shipping terms  title generally passes upon the customer s receipt of the products 
the company also sells third party services  such as maintenance contracts  and recognizes revenue in the same manner as hardware and software sales 
revenues from other services are recognized when the services are complete 
payments received before delivery has occurred or services have been rendered are recorded as deferred revenue 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon our historical experiences and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while such losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same loss rates that we have in the past 
as we continue to increase the volume of sales to prime contractors or to commercial customers  the company may see a need to increase its allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company assesses the adequacy of its allowance for doubtful accounts on a regular basis and adjusts the amount as necessary 
sales of lease receivables 
we periodically sell lease receivables to unrelated financing companies 
we account for our sales of lease receivables in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities a replacement of fasb statement no 
merchandise inventories 
we value our inventory at the lower of average cost or market value of the inventory 
whenever possible  we order inventory only as needed 
however  we do maintain inventory related to certain products or vendors 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
our estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate  in which case we may have understated or overstated the provision required for excess or obsolete inventory 
in the future  if our inventory is determined to be overvalued  we will be required to recognize such costs in our cost of goods sold at the time of such determination 
therefore  although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our reported operating results 
long lived assets 
long lived assets  consisting primarily of property and equipment and capitalized software  are currently reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount should be addressed pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we determine impairment by comparing the carrying value of these long lived assets to a probability weighted estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of these assets and their eventual disposition 
the cash flow projections used to make this assessment is consistent with the cash flow projections we use internally to assist us in making key decisions 
if we determine that an impairment exists  a loss would be recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the assets  which is generally determined by using quoted market prices or valuation techniques such as the discounted present value of expected future cash flows  appraisals  or other pricing models as appropriate 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 the company recorded a million impairment charge for the impairment of capitalized software in warranties 
we offer warranties on sales under certain products specific to the terms of the customer agreements 
our standard warranties require us to repair or replace defective products reported to us during such warranty period at no cost to the customer 
we record an estimate for warranty related costs at the time of sale based on our actual historical return rates and repair costs at the time of sale 
while our warranty costs have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same warranty return rates or repair costs that we have in the past 
factors that impact the company s accrued warranty liability include the number of installed units under warranty contracts  the rate of unit failures  the cost of spare parts  and historical and anticipated cost per warranty claim under the warranty contract 
as these factors are affected by actual experience and future expectations  the company reevaluates the adequacy of its accrued warranty liability and adjusts amounts as necessary 
stock compensation 
the company has chosen to continue to account for stock based compensation using the intrinsic value method prescribed in accounting principle board apb opinion no 
accounting for stock issued to employees and related interpretations 
accordingly  compensation expense for stock options is measured as the excess  if any  of the fair market value of the company s stock at the date of the grant over the exercise price of the related option 
alternative guidance exists under statement of accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation which requires companies to determine the fair value of options at the time of grant and to recognize compensation expense over the service period 
had compensation costs for the company s stock options been determined based on sfas no 
using an accepted fair valuation method  the company s net income and earnings per share would have been as follows in thousands  except per share amounts net income as reported    add total stock based employee compensation expense as reported under intrinsic value method apb no 
for all awards  net of related tax effects deduct total stock based employee compensation expense determined under fair value based method sfas no 
for all awards and stock purchase plans  net of related tax effects    net income pro forma   net income per share as reported basic net income per share as reported diluted net income per share pro forma basic net income per share pro forma diluted new accounting pronouncements in november  the eitf published issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf no 
 which addresses certain aspects of the accounting by a vendor for arrangements under which it will perform multiple revenue generating activities 
eitf no 
addresses how to determine whether an arrangement involving multiple deliverables contains more than one unit of accounting 
eitf no 
is effective for the company for revenue arrangements entered into beginning july  the adoption of eitf no 
did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in november  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin no 

fin no 
elaborates on the disclosure to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued 
it also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
the initial recognition and initial measurement provisions of fin no 
are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  the disclosure requirements of fin no 
are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after december  as a result of adopting fin no 
 the company has added additional disclosures related to accrued warranty obligations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of sfas no 
this statement amends sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  this statement amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
the company adopted the annual disclosure provisions of sfas no 
in its financial report for the year ended december  and adopted the interim disclosure provisions for its financial reports beginning with the quarter ended march  on january  the company adopted a new accounting pronouncement  eitf issue no 
 accounting for consideration received from a vendor by a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products 
this pronouncement requires that consideration from vendors  such as advertising support funds and sales volume incentives  be accounted for as a reduction to cost of sales unless certain requirements are met showing that the funds represent a reimbursement of a specific  incremental  identifiable cost incurred by the company in selling the vendor s product 
if these specific requirements related to individual vendors are met  the consideration is accounted for as a reduction in the related expense category  such as advertising or selling and administrative expense 
the company provides numerous advertising programs to support vendors  including catalogs  radio  internet  magazine and newspaper advertising for which it receives consideration 
the company adopted eitf no 
for the quarter ended march  as a result of adopting eitf no 
 the company records certain vendor considerations as a reduction of inventory and a subsequent reduction in cost of goods sold when the related product is sold 
in previous reporting periods  the company recorded these items as a reduction to operating expenses in that period 
the impact for the year ended december  was an increase in cost of goods sold of approximately  or a tax effected reduction to net income of approximately  if eitf no 
was applied to  the net income impact would have been a decrease of  for comparative purposes  if the company applied eitf no 
to the year ended december   the company s gross margin would have increased from million to million 
gross margin percentage would have increased from for to for the primary reason for the increase in margins on this comparative basis is due to an increase in the volume of the vendor incentives funds received in compared to operating expenses would have also increased from million for to million for effect of inflation the company believes that inflation has not had a material effect on its operations 
if  however  inflation increases in the future it could temporarily adversely affect the profitability of gtsi s sales under its government fixed price contracts  which generally preclude the company from passing on inflation related or other increases in product costs to government customers during the term of a pre existing contract 
the company mitigates this risk in part by often obtaining agreements from certain of its suppliers prohibiting them from increasing their prices to gtsi during fixed price  term contracts 
seasonal fluctuations and factors affecting government procurement practices the company has historically experienced and expects to continue to experience significant seasonal fluctuations in its operations as a result of government buying and funding patterns  which also affect the buying patterns of gtsi s prime contractor customers 
these buying and funding patterns historically have had a significant positive effect on gtsi s bookings in the third quarter ending september each year the federal government s fiscal year end  and consequently on sales and net income in the third and fourth quarters of each year 
quarterly financial results are also affected by the timing of the award of and shipments of products under government contracts  price competition in the computer and it industries  the addition of personnel or other expenses in anticipation of sales growth  product line changes and expansions  and the timing and costs of changes in customer and product mix 
in addition  customer order deferrals in anticipation of new product releases by leading hardware and software manufacturers  delays in vendor shipments of new or existing products  a shift in sales mix to more complex requirements contracts with more complex service costs  and vendor delays in the processing of incentives and credits due gtsi  have occurred all of which are also likely to occur in the future and have adversely affected the company s operating performance in particular periods 
the seasonality and the unpredictability of the factors affecting such seasonality make gtsi s quarterly and yearly financial results difficult to predict and subject to significant fluctuation 
the company s stock price could be adversely affected if any such financial results fail to meet the financial community s expectations 
additionally  legislation is periodically introduced in congress that may change the federal government s procurement practices  and agencies from time to time may issue new regulations or modify existing regulations that may also change the government s procurement practices 
gtsi cannot predict whether any legislative or regulatory proposals will be adopted or  if adopted  the impact upon its operating results 
changes in the structure  composition and or buying patterns of the government  either alone or in combination with competitive conditions or other factors  could adversely affect future results 
liquidity and capital resources during  the company s operating activities provided approximately million of cash  compared to million provided by operations in sources of cash provided by operating activities in include an increase in accounts payable of million  and an increase in accrued liabilities and warranty liabilities of million offset by an increase in accounts receivables of million and an increase in other assets of million 
trade accounts receivables are up million as of december  compared to the previous year end and other vendor receivables make up the additional million increase 
the primary reason for the increase in trade accounts receivables at year end is the increase in the fourth quarter sales 
investing activities used cash of approximately million in the company used approximately million for the erp system implementation 
approximately million was used for networking  storage  other hardware  and equipment 
approximately 
million was used on leasehold improvements during the year primarily related to a new office facility in chantilly  virginia

after the million impairment charge for the impairment of portions of the erp system  the company has capitalized approximately million related to the development of the new erp system as of december  the company s financing activities provided approximately million of cash during due to borrowings on its line of credit of million 
the company used million in the first part of the year to repurchase its stock from third party shareholders 
this was partially offset by million in proceeds from stock options and employee stock purchase plan activity 
during the fourth quarter  the company closed a new million credit facility the credit facility with a lender and terminated the existing credit facilities 
the new credit facility  which matures on february   includes a revolving line of credit the revolver and a provision for inventory financing of vendor products the wholesale financing facility 
borrowing under the revolver is limited to of eligible accounts receivable 
the revolver is secured by substantially all of the company s assets 
borrowing under the wholesale financing facility is limited to of the value of the inventory 
the wholesale financing facility is secured by the underlying inventory 
the credit facility carries an interest rate indexed to libor plus percentage points 
the credit facility also contains certain covenants as well as provisions specifying compliance with certain quarterly and annual financial ratios 
in and the company had a revolving line of credit the prior revolver with a group of banks  which allowed for borrowings up to million during its highest seasonal period 
additionally  the company had a separate facility with a bank for inventory financing of vendor products the prior wholesale financing facility  which allowed for borrowings up to million during its highest seasonal period 
combined  the prior revolver and the prior wholesale financing facility the prior credit facilities allowed the company to borrow from million to million depending on the seasonal period 
the seasonal structure of the prior credit facilities coincided with the seasonality of the company s business and allowed the company to minimize banking fees 
the interest rate under the prior credit facilities was a rate indexed to the london interbank offered rate libor plus percentage points 
on march  the company and its group of banks signed an amendment to the prior revolver in which the group of banks consented to allow the company to repurchase up to an additional million worth of its stock from stockholders 
during  the company repurchased approximately million of its stock 
the company anticipates that it will continue to rely primarily on operating cash flow  loans and vendor credit to finance its operating cash needs 
the company believes that such funds should be sufficient to satisfy the company s near term anticipated cash requirements for operations 
nonetheless  the company may seek additional sources of capital  including permanent financing over a longer term at fixed rates  to finance its working capital requirements 
as of december  and  respectively  the company s interest rate under the credit facility was and  respectively 
the available portion of the credit facility was approximately million at december   up from million available under the prior credit facility at december  contractual obligations less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations     purchase obligations notes payable to banks   other long term liabilities reflected on the registrant s balance sheet under gaap total contractual obligations     the company is obligated under an operating lease to provide the landlord with a letter of credit in the amount of million as a security deposit for all tenant improvements associated with the lease
