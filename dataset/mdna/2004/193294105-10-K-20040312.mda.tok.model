critical accounting policies and estimates general the company s management s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to customer programs and incentives  product returns  bad debts  inventories  investments  income taxes  financing operations  contingencies and litigation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
inventory the company writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
sales returns and allowances the company s ability to collect factor chargebacks for deductions taken from its customers for returns  discounts  and allowances as well as potential future customer deductions is significant to its operations 
the company reserves against known chargebacks as well as potential future customer deductions  based on a combination of historical activity and current market conditions 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  which may have a significant impact on the company s results 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
these customers include non factored accounts and credit card receivables from third party service providers 
if the financial conditions of these customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
income taxes the company is routinely under audit by federal  state  or local authorities in the areas of income taxes 
these audits include questioning the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions 
based on its annual evaluations of tax positions  the company believes it has appropriately accrued for probable exposures 
to the extent the company is required to pay amounts in excess of recorded income tax liabilities  the company s effective tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially impacted 
litigation the company is periodically involved in carious legal actions arising in the normal course of business 
management is required to assess the probability of any adverse judgements as well as the potential range of any losses 
management determines the required accruals after a careful review of the facts of each significant legal action 
the company s accruals may change in the future due to new developments in these matters 
contingencies in the ordinary course of business  the company is involved in and subject to compliance and regulatory reviews and audits by numerous authorities  agencies and other governmental agents and entities from various jurisdictions 
the company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse outcomes of these matters 
a determination of the amount of reserves required  if any  for these reviews are made after careful analysis of each individual issue 
the reserves may change in the future due to new developments or final resolution in each matter  which may have a significant impact on the company s results

the associated distribution and merchandising have resulted in creating the current short term sales reduction 
in the longer term  however  the company believes these initiatives will produce a stronger business and a corner stone of the brands 
the company believes its focus on improving product offerings  advertising campaigns  marketing efforts  website  catalogs and growing retail presence  combined with the marketing efforts of its licensees  will be significant factors to strengthen and define its distinct brands  kenneth cole new york  reaction kenneth cole  unlisted and bongo across all product classifications  thereby increasing consumer demand for the company s brands in the future

to million in from million in of the total increase  million was attributable to new store sales in plus that portion of sales for stores not open for all of  which was offset by a decrease of million in comparable store sales and comparable catalog and internet sales 
the company believes the decrease in comparable store sales in the consumer direct segment is due to the effects of a promotionally driven and highly competitive retail store environment and less consumer spending due to the ongoing middle east tension  potential additional terrorist attacks and general economic conditions 
in an effort to overcome these challenges  the company continues to analyze inventory  focus on products and further scrutinize consumer trends 
royalty revenue increased million  or to million in from million in the increase primarily reflects revenues from the launch of the company s men s and women s fragrance during the third quarter of and the launch of the company s children s apparel line of products

exchange rates the company routinely enters into forward exchange contracts for its future purchases of inventory denominated in foreign currencies  primarily the euro 
at december   forward exchange contracts with a notional value totaling million were outstanding with settlement dates ranging from january through march gains and losses on forward exchange contracts that are used for hedges are accounted for on the balance sheet as inventory and an adjustment to equity  and are subsequently accounted for as part of the purchase price of the inventory upon execution of the contract 
at december   the unrealized gain on these outstanding forward contracts is approximately  net of taxes 
the company expects to continue to routinely enter into additional foreign exchange contracts throughout the year 
while the company believes that its current procedures with respect to the reduction of risk associated with currency exchange rate fluctuations are adequate  there can be no assurance that such fluctuations will not have a material adverse effect on the results of operations of the company in the future 
inventory from contract manufacturers in the far east and brazil are purchased in united states dollars and the recent changes of many of these currencies against the united states dollar has not had any material adverse impact on the company 
however  future purchase prices for the company s products may be impacted by fluctuations in the exchange rate between the united states dollar and the local currencies of the contract manufacturer  which may affect the company s cost of goods in the future 
the company does not believe the potential effects of such fluctuations would have a material adverse effect on the company 
effects of inflation the company does not believe that the relatively low rates of inflation experienced over the last few years in the united states  where it primarily competes  have had a significant effect on revenues or profitability 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company does not believe it has a material exposure to market risk 
the company is primarily exposed to currency exchange rate risks with respect to its inventory transactions denominated in euro 
business activities in various currencies expose the company to the risk that the eventual net dollar cash flows from transactions with foreign suppliers denominated in foreign currencies may be adversely affected by changes in currency rates 
the company manages these risks by utilizing foreign exchange contracts 
the company does not enter into foreign currency transactions for speculative purposes 
at december   the company had forward exchange contracts totaling with notional values million  which resulted in an unrealized gain of approximately  net of taxes 
the company s earnings may also be affected by changes in short term interest rates as a result of borrowings under its line of credit facility 
a two or less percentage point increase in interest rates effecting the company s credit facility would not have had a material effect on the company s and net income
