the company s current and long term growth strategy is to expand geographic market presence  achieved by opening new retail stores and enhance financial performance through same store sales increases  achieved through aggressive merchandising programs with an everyday low prices philosophy  supported by strong customer service 
the company has experienced considerable growth in recent years  including the addition of stores in fiscal  in fiscal  and in fiscal the significant growth in is due primarily to the acquisition of real property and lease rights from quality stores  inc see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in this report for further discussion regarding this purchase 
this growth has increased the company s market presence in the southeast  primarily in florida  in the central northern part of the united states  primarily in ohio and michigan  and in the northeast  primarily in new york and pennsylvania

seasonality and weather the company s business is highly seasonal 
historically  the company s sales and profits have been the highest in the second and fourth fiscal quarters of each year due to the sale of seasonal products

unseasonable weather  excessive rain  drought  and early or late frosts may also affect the company s sales 
the company believes  however  that the impact of adverse weather conditions is somewhat mitigated by the geographic dispersion of its stores

change in accounting principle emerging issue task force issue no 
eitf  accounting by a customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a vendor provides guidance for the accounting treatment and income statement classification for consideration given by a vendor to a retailer in connection with the sale of the vendor s products or for the promotion of sales of the vendor s products 
the eitf concluded that such consideration received from vendors should be reflected as a decrease in prices paid for inventory and recognized in cost of sales as the related inventory is sold 
prior to adopting this pronouncement  the company classified all vendor provided marketing support funds as a reduction in selling  general and administrative expenses 
the effect of applying eitf on prior period financial statements would have resulted in a change to previously reported net income  thus  the company has reported the adoption of eitf as a cumulative effect adjustment 
accordingly  in the first quarter of fiscal  the company recorded a cumulative effect of accounting change of million million net of income taxes for the impact of this adoption on prior fiscal years

the company s favorable performance versus prior year was driven primarily by market share gains in certain markets  continued improvement in merchandising programs and improved in store execution 
in fiscal  the company opened new stores compared to in the prior year  closed one store compared to three in the prior year and relocated stores compared to in the prior year 
the company substantially expanded its store base during due to its purchase of property and lease rights from quality stores  inc see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in this report for further discussion regarding this purchase 
as a percent of sales  gross margin increased basis points from for fiscal to for fiscal assuming the provisions of eitf had been applied prior to  fiscal gross margin would have decreased basis points from in fiscal the majority of this decline is attributable to a return to a more normal level of vendor funding in fiscal specifically  vendors provided additional funds in fiscal in connection with the opening of new stores as a result of the purchase of certain properties and lease rights from quality stores  inc as a percent of sales  selling  general and administrative sg a expenses were and for fiscal and  respectively 
assuming the provisions of eitf had been applied prior to fiscal and exclusive of non recurring expansion costs of million experienced in fiscal these costs include pre opening transition and training costs related to the new stores  costs for store relocations and three store closings as a result of the purchase of the aforementioned properties and lease rights from quality stores  inc fiscal sg a expenses as a percent of sales decreased basis points from for fiscal this decrease is primarily a result of controlled spending and greater leverage from increased sales 
depreciation and amortization expense increased in fiscal over the prior year due mainly to costs associated with new and relocated stores  as well as remodeled existing stores 
net interest expense decreased in fiscal over the prior year 
this decrease reflects stronger cash flow and less cash requirements for store openings  which resulted in reduced average long term borrowings under the company s revolving credit agreement 
the company s effective tax rate increased to for fiscal compared with for fiscal this increase is due to increased income in states with higher tax rates 
as a result of the foregoing factors  net income for fiscal increased to million  or per diluted share  compared to net income of million  or per diluted share  in the prior year 
exclusive of the cumulative effect of the accounting change  net income for fiscal was million or per diluted share 
this increase is primarily a result of increased leverage from increased sales at both new and existing stores 
additionally  certain store expansion costs incurred in the company s significant expansion in  which was primarily the result of the purchase of property and lease rights from quality stores  inc in the first quarter of  were non recurring 
the expansion increased the size of the company by over and was completed in a very compressed timeframe 
as such  the company incurred significant incremental costs to achieve the state of readiness required to enable all stores to open within the desired time frame and such costs are not considered by management to be indicative of normal pre opening or recurring expenses 
management believes that disclosing the effect of the significant store expansion improves the investor s ability to reasonably evaluate the company s longer term business trends 
the following pro forma information isolates the effect of adoption of eitf and the expansion costs related to the store expansion in thousands  except per share amounts of of sales sales net income as reported   change in accounting for vendor funding had eitf been adopted prior to  net of income taxes   non recurring store expansion costs  net of income taxes  pro forma net income assuming the change in accounting for vendor funding occurred prior to and exclusive of non recurring store expansion costs   pro forma pro forma income shares diluted income shares diluted net income as reported     change in accounting for vendor funding had eitf been adopted prior to fiscal  net of income taxes     non recurring store expansion costs  net of income taxes    pro forma net income assuming the change in accounting for vendor funding had occurred prior to and exclusive of non recurring store expansion costs     fiscal compared to fiscal net sales increased to  million in fiscal from million in fiscal this increase resulted from the opening of new stores as well as a same store sales improvement of 
the significant improvement in same store sales in fiscal is due primarily to new merchandising programs  special promotions  market share gains in certain markets and improved in store execution 
in fiscal  the company opened new stores compared to in the prior year  closed three stores compared to none in the prior year and relocated stores compared to one in the prior year

exclusive of the incremental expansion costs  sg a expense  as a percent of sales  decreased percentage point to for fiscal on an absolute basis  sg a expenses increased to million 
these increases primarily reflect the incremental expansion costs and the remaining incremental costs associated with the new stores opened in fiscal  as well as higher variable store operating costs associated with the same store sales increase and higher incentive compensation accruals 
depreciation and amortization expense increased over the prior year due mainly to costs associated with new and relocated stores  as well as remodeled existing stores
