table of contents results of operations net earnings in were  million or a share the best year on record compared with  million or a share in  million or a share 
higher realizations for natural gas and crude oil and higher industry margins for petroleum products  partly offset by the negative impact of a higher canadian dollar  were the main reasons for the increased earnings 
total revenues were billion  up about percent from natural resources earnings from natural resources were  million  up from  million in million 
higher realizations for natural gas and crude oil and higher production of cold lake bitumen were largely offset by the negative impact of a higher canadian dollar 
resource revenues were billion  up from billion in billion 
the main reasons for the increase were higher prices for natural gas and crude oil and increased production from cold lake 
financial statistics millions net earnings revenues world oil prices strengthened considerably in early and remained relatively strong due to a combination of world supply concerns and increased world demand 
the annual average price of brent crude oil  the most actively traded north sea crude and a common benchmark of world oil markets  was us a barrel in  compared with in the increase in the company s realizations on sales of conventional canadian crude oil was diminished by the strengthening of the canadian dollar 
average realizations during the year were cdn a barrel versus in 
average prices for canadian heavy crude oil were higher in  but not as high as those for lighter crude oil  as increased supply of canadian heavy crude oil widened the average spread between light and heavy crude 
the price of bow river  a benchmark canadian heavy crude oil  increased by four percent in  compared with a nine percent increase in prices for canadian light crude oil 
average realizations for cold lake bitumen were about two percent lower than the previous year  as the stronger canadian dollar offset any price increases 
prices for canadian natural gas in were higher on average than in the previous year 
the average of day spot prices for natural gas at the aeco hub in alberta was about a thousand cubic feet in  up from in 
the company s average realizations on natural gas sales increased to a thousand cubic feet from in 
average realizations and prices conventional crude oil realizations a barrel natural gas realizations a thousand cubic feet par crude oil price at edmonton a barrel heavy crude oil price at hardisty bow river  a barrel gross production of crude oil and natural gas liquids ngls increased to  barrels a day from  barrels in 
net production increased slightly to  barrels a day from  barrels in 
net bitumen production at the company s wholly owned facilities at cold lake increased to  barrels a day from  barrels in 
the higher volume was a result of the initial production cycles from phases  which began operation in december this was offset in part by lower production from existing operations  due to the cyclic nature of production at cold lake 
the effective royalty rate on cold lake production increased in  as capital expenditures were lower upon the completion of phases the rate increased to percent of production from five percent in five percent 

table of contents production from the syncrude operation  in which the company has a percent interest  decreased during as increased unplanned maintenance affected production through much of the year 
gross production of upgraded crude oil dropped to  barrels a day from  barrels in 
the company s share of average net production decreased to  barrels a day from  barrels in 
net production of conventional oil decreased to  barrels a day from  barrels in  as a result of the natural decline in western canadian reservoirs 
gross production of natural gas decreased to million cubic feet a day from million in million 
net production was million cubic feet a day in  down from million in million 
net production available for sale decreased to million cubic feet a day from million in million 
lower production as a result of reservoir decline was mostly offset by production from the new facilities at wizard lake in alberta  which were completed in the third quarter of crude oil and ngls production and sales a gross net gross net gross net gross net gross net thousands of barrels a day conventional crude oil cold lake syncrude total crude oil production ngls available for sale b total crude oil and ngl production cold lake sales  including diluent c ngl sales natural gas production and sales a gross net gross net gross net gross net gross net millions of cubic feet a day production d production available for sale b sales a daily volumes are calculated by dividing total volumes for the year by the number of days in the year 
gross production is the company s share of production excluding purchases before deducting the shares of mineral owners or governments or both 
net production excludes those shares 
b production available for sale excludes amounts used for internal consumption and amounts reinjected 
starting in  production available for sale reflects a change in the supply of natural gas to company operations from company produced gas to third party purchased gas 
c includes natural gas condensate added to the cold lake bitumen to facilitate transportation to market by pipeline 
d production of natural gas includes amounts used for internal consumption with the exception of amounts reinjected 
operating costs increased by percent in the main factors were increased costs associated with the newly completed phases and cogeneration facilities at cold lake  unplanned maintenance at syncrude and increased exploration costs 
petroleum products net earnings from petroleum products were a record million or cents a litre in  up from million or cents a litre in million or cents a litre 
earnings improved mainly as a result of the strengthening of industry petroleum product margins and increased sales volumes  partly offset by the negative impact of a higher canadian dollar 
revenues were billion  up from billion in billion

b crude oil and feedstocks sent directly to atmospheric distillation units one thousand litres is approximately barrels 
margins were higher in the refining segment of the industry in compared with those in  as international wholesale product prices increased more than raw material costs 
however  the effects of higher international margins were reduced partially by a higher canadian dollar 
the company s total sales volumes  including those resulting from reciprocal supply agreements with other companies  were million litres a day  compared with million litres in million 
excluding sales resulting from reciprocal agreements  sales were million litres a day  compared with million litres in million 
operating costs increased by about five percent in from the previous year  mainly because of higher energy costs and expenses related to increased sales volumes 
chemicals earnings from chemical operations were million in  down from million in million 
reduced industry margins on sales of polyethylene as a result of higher feedstock costs and weaker industry demand were the main reasons for the decrease in earnings 
total revenues from chemical operations were  million  compared with  million in  million 
gains from higher prices for polyethylene  intermediate chemicals and aromatics during more than offset lower sales volumes 
financial statistics millions net earnings revenues the average industry price of polyethylene was  a tonne in  up percent from  a tonne in 
however  margins were reduced because of higher feedstock costs  reflecting increased prices for natural gas 

table of contents sales of chemicals decreased to  tonnes a day from  tonnes in  tonnes as a result of reduced demand 
sales volumes thousands of tonnes a day a polymers basic chemicals intermediates and other total chemicals a volumes a day are calculated by dividing total volumes for the year by the number of days in the year 
one tonne is approximately short tons or long tons 
operating costs in the chemicals segment increased by about four percent in mainly because of higher planned capital project related expenses 
corporate and other earnings from corporate and other accounts were positive million in  compared with negative million in negative million 
the improvement was mainly attributable to favourable foreign exchange effects on the company s us dollar denominated debt 
the company retired the remaining balance of its us dollar denominated debt in liquidity and capital resources cash flow from earnings was  million  up from  million in  million  mainly because of increased earnings 
cash provided from operating activities was  million  compared with  million in  million 
the increased cash inflow was mainly due to higher earnings  timing of scheduled income tax payments and the effects of commodity prices on receivable and payable balances  partly offset by additional funding contributions to the company s registered pension plan 
in june  the company renewed the normal course issuer bid share buyback program for another months 
during  the company purchased more than million shares for million 
since the company initiated its first buyback program in  the company has purchased million shares representing about percent of the total outstanding at the start of the program with resulting distributions to shareholders of  million 
the company declared dividends totalling cents a share in  up from cents in cents 
regular per share dividends paid have increased in each of the past nine years and  since  payments a share have grown by more than percent 
following one of the largest capital investment programs in the company s history as well as funding contributions to the company s registered pension plan  the cash balance was million at year end  compared with million at the end of million 
in  the company retired its million us variable rate debt  due in  for million cdn and replaced it with million of canadian dollar denominated variable rate loans from exxon overseas corporation at interest equivalent to canadian market rates 
total debt outstanding  excluding the company s share of equity company debt  at the end of was  million  compared with  million at the end of  million 
debt represented percent of the company s capital structure at the end of  compared with percent at the end of percent 
debt related interest expense paid in was million  down from million in million

capital and exploration expenditures total capital and exploration expenditures were  million in  down slightly from  million in  million 
the funds were used mainly to maintain and expand crude oil and natural gas production capacity  to upgrade refineries to meet low sulphur gasoline requirements and to enhance the company s retail network 
the following table shows the company s capital and exploration expenditures for natural resources during the five years ending december  millions exploration production heavy oil total for the natural resources segment  about percent of the capital and exploration expenditures in was focused on growth opportunities 
the single largest investment during the year was the company s share of the syncrude expansion 
the remainder of investment was directed to advancing the mackenzie gas project  drilling for conventional oil and gas in western canada  and east coast development and deepwater exploration 
planned capital and exploration expenditures in natural resources are expected to total about billion in  with nearly percent of the total focused on growth opportunities 
much of the expenditure will be directed to the expansion now underway at syncrude 
investments are also planned for the ongoing development drilling at cold lake  the mackenzie gas project  development of the sable south venture field and the sable compression platform  as well as further development drilling in western canada 
planned expenditures for exploration and development drilling  as well as capacity additions in conventional oil and gas operations  are expected to be about million 
the following table shows the company s capital expenditures in the petroleum products segment during the five years ending december  millions marketing refining and supply other a total a consists primarily of purchases of real estate 
for the petroleum product segment  capital expenditures decreased to million in  compared with million in million  primarily because of the completion of the project to significantly reduce sulphur content in gasoline  which began in new investments in included the products segment s million share of capital expenditures on a megawatt cogeneration facility to improve energy efficiency and reduce emissions at the petroleum products and chemicals operations in sarnia 
in addition  almost million was spent on other refinery projects to improve energy efficiency and increase yield 
major investments were also made to upgrade the network of esso retail outlets during the year 

table of contents capital expenditures for the petroleum products segment in are expected to be about million 
major items include investment in refining facilities to reduce the sulphur content in diesel to meet regulatory requirement and continued enhancements to the company s retail network 
the following table shows the company s capital expenditures for the chemicals operations during the five years ending december  millions chemicals of the capital expenditures for chemicals in  the major investment was the sarnia cogeneration project  a joint development between the petroleum products and chemicals operations at the site 
planned capital expenditures for chemicals in will be about million 
funds will be used largely to improve energy efficiency and yields 
total capital and exploration expenditures for the company in  which will focus mainly on growth and productivity improvements  are expected to total about billion and will be financed primarily from internally generated funds 
during  the company spent more than million on projects related to reducing the environmental impact of its operations and improving safety 
this included investments of more than million in the company s four refineries as part of the capital project to produce low sulphur gasoline and diesel fuels 
reporting investments in mineral interests in oil and gas properties the accounting standards for business combinations and goodwill and other intangible assets issued by the canadian institute of chartered accountants cica became effective for the company of july   and january   respectively 
these canadian standards are harmonized with specific us standards in these areas 
currently  the emerging issues task force eitf of the financial accounting standards board fasb is considering the issue of whether the us standards require interests held under oil  gas and mineral leases to be separately classified as intangible assets on the balance sheets of companies in the extractive industries 
if such interests were deemed to be intangible assets by the eitf  mineral rights to extract oil and gas for both undeveloped and developed leaseholds would be classified separately from oil and gas properties as intangible assets on the company s balance sheet 
the eitf interpretation could potentially have an impact on the canadian standards and the company s financial reporting 
historically  in accordance with canadian generally accepted accounting principles gaap  the company has capitalized the cost of oil and gas leasehold interests and reported these assets as part of tangible oil and gas property  plant and equipment 
this interpretation of the current us standards would only affect the classification of oil and gas leaseholds on the company s balance sheet and would not affect total assets  net worth or cash flows 
the company s results of operations would not be affected  since these leasehold costs would continue to be amortized in accordance with gaap 
the amount that is subject to reclassification as of december   was million and  million as of december  pension an independent actuarial valuation of the company s registered pension plan was completed in as a result of the valuation  the company contributed million to the registered pension plan 
while equity markets improved in and the company s contribution levels increased  the company plans to take a measured approach to the pace of funding  within the requirements of pension regulations 
however  pension liabilities need to be assessed in light of the company s strong credit position and prudent financial management 
the company has in the past and expects to continue to use its strong balance sheet to effectively manage pension liabilities 
future funding requirements are not expected to affect the company s existing capital investment plans or its ability to pursue new investment opportunities 
contractual obligations to more fully explain the company s financial position  the following table shows the company s contractual obligations outstanding at december  it brings together  for easier reference  data from the consolidated balance sheet and from individual notes to consolidated financial statements 

table of contents financial payment due by period statement note to and total millions of dollars reference beyond amount long term debt capital leases note  company s share of equity company debt operating leases note unconditional purchase obligations a note firm capital commitments b note pension obligations c note asset retirement obligations d note other long term agreements e note  total a unconditional purchase obligations mainly pertain to pipeline throughput agreements 
b firm capital commitments related to capital projects  shown on an undiscounted basis  totalled approximately million at the end of  compared with million at year end the largest commitment outstanding at year end was associated with the company s share of capital projects at syncrude million 
c pension obligations represent the amount by which accumulated benefit obligations abo exceeded the fair value of plan assets 
the abo is less than the projected benefit obligation shown in note to the consolidated financial statements because it does not take into account future compensation levels 
it is used instead of the projected benefit obligation because it more truly reflects the actual benefit obligation at the end of the year 
the payments by period include expected contributions to the company s registered pension plan in and estimated benefit payments for unfunded plans in all years 
the term abo used here is consistent with the definition under statement of financial accounting standards no 
issued by the financial accounting standards board 
d asset retirement obligations represent the discounted present value of legal obligations associated with site restoration on the retirement of assets with determinable useful lives 
e other long term agreements include primarily raw material supply and transportation services agreements 
critical accounting policies the company s financial statements have been prepared in accordance with canadian generally accepted accounting principles gaap and include estimates that reflect management s best judgments 
the company s accounting and financial reporting fairly reflect its straightforward business model 
the company does not use financing structures for the purpose of altering accounting outcomes or removing debt from the balance sheet 
the following summary provides further information about the critical accounting policies and the estimates that are made by the company to apply those policies 
it should be read in conjunction with pages f to f oil and gas and synthetic crude oil reserves proved oil and gas and synthetic crude oil reserves quantities are used as the basis of calculating unit of production rates for depreciation and evaluating for impairment 
these reserves are the estimated quantities of crude oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs and deposits under existing economic and operating conditions 
the estimation of reserves is an ongoing process based on rigorous technical evaluations and extrapolations of appropriate information 
while proved reserves have a reasonable certainty of recovery  they are based on estimates that are subject to some variability 
the variability can result in upward or downward revisions in the previously estimated volumes of proved reserves for existing fields due to initial study or restudy of already available geologic  reservoir or production data  or new geologic or reservoir data obtained from wells 
revisions can also include changes associated with improved recovery projects  fiscal terms and significant changes in development strategy  oil and gas prices or production equipment facility capacity 
over time  revisions of proved reserves for the company have generally resulted in net upward experience based changes through effective reservoir management and the application of new technology 
while revisions are an indicator of variability  they have had little impact on the unit of production rates of depreciation and on impairment testing because the revisions have been small compared to the large proved reserves base 
retirement benefits the company s pension plan is managed in compliance with the requirements of governmental authorities and meets funding levels as determined by independent third party actuaries 
pension accounting requires explicit assumptions regarding  among others  the discount rate for the benefit obligations  the expected rate of return on plan assets and the long term rate of future compensation increases 
all pension assumptions are reviewed annually by senior financial management 
these assumptions are adjusted only as appropriate to reflect long term changes in market rates and outlook 
the long term expected rate of return on plan assets of percent used in compares to actual returns of percent and percent achieved over the last and year periods ending december  if different assumptions are used  the expense and obligations could increase or decrease as a result 
the company s potential exposure to change in assumptions is summarized in footnote e 
table of contents of note to the consolidated financial statements 
at the company  differences between actual returns on plan assets versus long term expected returns are not recorded in the year the differences occur  but rather are amortized in pension expense as permitted by gaap  along with other actuarial gains and losses over the expected remaining service life of employees 
the company uses the fair value of the plan assets at year end to determine the amount of the actual gain or loss that will be amortized and does not use a moving average value of plan assets 
pension expense represented about one percent of total expenses in asset retirement obligations and other environmental liabilities legal obligations associated with site restoration on the retirement of assets with determinable useful lives are recognized when they are incurred  which is typically at the time the assets are installed 
the obligations are initially measured at fair value and discounted to present value 
over time the discounted asset retirement obligation amount will be accreted for the change in its present value  with this effect included in operating expense 
as payments to settle the obligations occur on an ongoing basis and will continue over the lives of the operating assets  which can exceed years  the discount rate will be adjusted only as appropriate to reflect long term changes in market rates and outlook 
in  the obligations have been discounted at six percent and the accretion expense was million  which was significantly less than one percent of total expenses in the year 
there would be no material impact on the company s reported financial results if a different discount rate had been used 
asset retirement obligations are not recognized for assets with an indeterminate useful life 
for these and non operating assets  the company accrues provisions for environmental liabilities when it is probable that obligations have been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
asset retirement obligations and other environmental liabilities are based on engineering estimated costs  taking into account the anticipated method and extent of remediation consistent with legal requirements  current technology and the possible use of the location 
since these estimates are specific to the locations involved  there are many individual assumptions underlying the company s total asset retirement obligations and provision for other environmental liabilities 
while these individual assumptions can be subject to change  none of them is individually significant to the company s reported financial results 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to a variety of financial  operating and market risks in the course of its business 
some of these risks are within the company s control  while others are not 
for those risks that can be controlled  specific risk management strategies are employed to reduce the likelihood of loss 
other risks  such as changes in international commodity prices and currency exchange rates  are beyond the company s control 
the company s size  strong financial position and the complementary nature of its natural resources  petroleum products and chemicals segments help mitigate the company s exposure to changes in these other risks 
the company s potential exposure to these types of risk is summarized in the table below 
the company does not use derivative markets to speculate on the future direction of currency or commodity prices and does not sell forward any part of production from any business segment 
the following table shows the estimated annual effect  under current conditions  of certain sensitivities of the company s after tax earnings 
millions of dollars after tax three dollars us a barrel change in crude oil prices sixty cents a thousand cubic feet change in natural gas prices one cent a litre change in sales margins for total petroleum products one cents us a pound change in sales margins for polyethylene one quarter percent decrease increase in short term interest rates eight cents decrease increase in the value of the canadian dollar versus the us dollar the amount quoted to illustrate the impact of each sensitivity represents a change of about percent in the value of the commodity or rate in question at the end of each sensitivity calculation shows the impact on annual earnings that results from a change in one factor  after tax and royalties and holding all other factors constant 
while these sensitivities are applicable under current conditions  they may not apply proportionately to larger fluctuations 
the sensitivity to changes in the canadian dollar versus the usdollar increased from by about million after tax a year for each one cent change 
this is primarily a result of the retirement of the us dollar denominated debt which had previously moderated the impact of foreign exchange rate changes on commodity prices and product margins 
the sensitivity to changes in crude oil prices decreased from by about million after tax for each one us dollar difference 
an increase in the value of the canadian dollar has lessened the impact of us dollar denominated crude oil prices on the company s revenues and earnings
