item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our results of operations and financial condition should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements included elsewhere in this report and other information incorporated by reference in this report 
this discussion may contain forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from the results anticipated in any forward looking statements as a result of a variety of factors  including those discussed in risk factors and elsewhere in this report 
overview we are the world s leading dental laser company 
we design  manufacture and market proprietary dental laser systems that allow dentists  oral surgeons and other specialists to perform a broad range of common dental procedures  including cosmetic applications 
our systems provide superior performance for many types of dental procedures  with less pain and faster recovery times than are generally achieved with drills and other dental instruments 
we have clearance from the u 
s 
food and drug administration to market our laser systems in the united states 
we also have the approvals necessary to sell our laser systems in canada  the european union and other international markets 
since  we have sold more than  laser systems in over countries 
on may   we acquired the american dental laser product line and other dental laser assets of american medical technologies  inc  or amt  for approximately million  consisting of million in cash   shares of our common stock and  in costs directly attributable to the acquisition 
as a part of the purchase transaction  we and amt agreed to dismiss with prejudice the lawsuit we had filed in october against amt which alleged infringement of certain of our patents 
in the dismissal  amt acknowledged that it had infringed our intellectual property rights as identified in our complaint and recognized that the patents we had asserted in the legal action are valid and enforceable 
the acquired assets included dental laser patents  customer lists  brand names and other intellectual property as well as laser systems  including the diolase and pulsemaster systems 
the purchase price was allocated to the assets based on their fair value 
we are selling the diolase and pulsemaster systems both domestically and internationally under the american dental laser brand name 
sales of the new systems began in the second half of we have the following principal product lines i waterlase system  ii lasersmile system  iii american dental laser products  including the diolase and pulsemaster systems  and iv related accessories and disposables for use with our laser systems 
our product  the waterlase system  is used for hard and soft tissue dental procedures  and can be used to perform most procedures currently performed using dental drills  scalpels and other traditional dental instruments 
the lasersmile system is used for a range of soft tissue procedures and tooth whitening 
our newly acquired diolase and pulsemaster systems are primarily used for soft tissue procedures 
we also manufacture and sell accessories and disposables  such as handpieces  laser tips and tooth whitening gel  for use with our dental laser systems 
significant accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and 
table of contents judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses for each period 
the following represents a summary of our critical accounting policies  defined as those policies that we believe are i the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations  and ii that require our most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  or sab sab requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred and title and the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to our customer or services have been rendered  the price is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
assuming that all of the above criteria were satisfied  for the period from january  to early august  we recorded revenue for domestic sales when we received payment in full  due to a clause in our purchase order that stated title transferred upon payment in full  we recorded revenue for international direct sales when the product was installed  which is when the customer became obligated to pay  and we recorded revenue for sales to distributors upon delivery 
in august  we modified the sales arrangements with our customers so that title transfers to the customer upon shipment for domestic sales  and there is an enforceable obligation to pay upon shipment for international direct sales 
since august  we have been recording revenue for domestic sales and international direct sales upon shipment 
we continue to record revenue for sales to distributors upon delivery 
as a result  we recorded million in revenue under the revenue recognition policy in effect before the modification to our sales arrangements and million in revenue under our revenue recognition policy in effect after the modification to our sales arrangements  during the year ended december  net revenues unaffected by the changes in our revenue recognition policy were million for the year ended december  as a result of the change in our revenue recognition policy during the third quarter of  our net sales  gross profit  operating income and other operating results for the year ended december  are not directly comparable to the year ended december similarly  for the same reason  our quarterly sales  gross profit  operating income and other operating results for each of the next three quarters ending september  will not be directly comparable to corresponding periods in the preceding year 
on july   we adopted eitf  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
we concluded that certain of our arrangements include multiple units of accounting resulting in the allocation of the total consideration based on the residual value method 
the adoption of eitf did not have a material impact to our consolidated financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
we do not offer a stated right of return on our sales  however  we may accept returns of products in certain circumstances 
we record a provision for sales returns based on historical experience concurrent with the recognition of revenue 
when a provision is made for sales returns  we reduce accounts receivable  revenue and cost of goods sold based on the estimated amount of returns we will experience 
valuation of accounts receivable 
we maintain an allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable to estimate the risk of extending credit to customers 
the allowance is estimated based on customer compliance 
table of contents with credit terms  the financial condition of the customer and collection history where applicable 
additional allowances could be required if the financial condition of our customers were to be impaired beyond our estimates 
valuation of inventory 
inventory is valued at the lower of cost estimated using the first in  first out method or market 
we periodically evaluate the carrying value of inventories and maintain an allowance for obsolescence to adjust the carrying value as necessary to the lower of cost or market 
the allowance is based on physical and technical functionality as well as other factors affecting the recoverability of the asset through future sales 
unfavorable changes in estimates of obsolete inventory would result in an increase in the allowance and a decrease in gross profit 
valuation of long lived assets 
property  plant and equipment  intangible and certain other long lived assets are amortized over their useful lives 
useful lives are based on our estimate of the period that the assets will generate revenue or otherwise productively support our business goals 
long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable through future business operations 
in our estimate  no provision for impairment is currently required on any of our long lived assets 
warranty cost 
products sold directly to end users are covered by a warranty against defects in material and workmanship for a period of one year 
products sold internationally to distributors are covered by a warranty on parts for up to fourteen months with additional coverage on certain components for up to two years 
we accrue a warranty reserve to estimate the risk of incurring costs to provide warranty services 
the accrual is based on our historical experience and our expectation of future conditions 
an increase in warranty claims or in the costs associated with servicing those claims would result in an increase in the accrual and a decrease in gross profit 
litigation and other contingencies 
we regularly evaluate our exposure to threatened or pending litigation and other business contingencies 
because of the uncertainties related to the amount of loss from litigation and other business contingencies  the recording of losses relating to such exposures requires significant judgment about the potential range of outcomes 
as additional information about current or future litigation or other contingencies becomes available  we will assess whether such information warrants the recording of additional expense relating to contingencies 
to be recorded as expense  a loss contingency must be both probable and reasonably estimable 
if a loss contingency is material but is not both probable and estimable  we will disclose the matter in the notes to the financial statements 
income taxes 
we estimate our actual current tax expense together with assessing any temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of certain items  such as the timing for recognizing revenue and expenses  for tax and financial reporting purposes 
these differences may result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
we are required to assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets  which include net operating loss carryforwards and temporary differences that are expected to be deductible in future years  will be recoverable from future taxable income or tax planning strategies 
if we conclude that our deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized a probability level of more than  a valuation allowance is not recorded 
during the year ended december   we determined that our deferred tax assets  which consist primarily of net operating loss carryforwards  were more likely than not to be realized 
we considered factors such as our profitable operating history  three years of cumulative income and projections of continued profitability in making this determination 
in the event we are unable to sustain our profitability due to a decrease in demand of our products  an increase in operating expenses to support our growth  or other factors  we will be required to reassess whether a valuation allowance should be recorded against our deferred tax assets 
actual results of our ability to realize our deferred tax assets may be different from our current estimate 

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth certain data from our consolidated income statements for the years ended december   and  expressed as a percentage of net sales years ended december  consolidated statements of operations data net sales cost of sales gross profit other income operating expenses sales and marketing general and administrative engineering and development total operating expenses income loss from operations non operating income loss income loss before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle cumulative effect of change in accounting principle income loss before income taxes income tax benefit net income loss net sales 
net sales consists of sales of our laser systems  related disposables and accessories and service revenue 
we have at various times experienced fluctuations in sales due to seasonality 
in our experience  sales in the first quarter typically are lower than average  and sales in the fourth quarter typically are stronger than average  due to the buying patterns of dental professionals 
the fourth quarter of accounted for of our net sales for the year  whereas the first quarter of accounted for of net sales for the year 
sales in the third quarter tend to be even with and may sometimes be lower than sales in the second quarter due to vacation patterns 
the third quarter accounted for of our net sales in  whereas the second quarter accounted for of our net sales in our historical seasonality pattern is a recurring trend that we expect to continue 
consequently  we do not necessarily match the timing of our expenditures to the expected quarterly seasonality effects on revenue but rather anticipate the expected sales over the full year as a determinant of our spending levels 
since many of our costs are fixed in the short term  if we have a shortfall in sales resulting from a change in our historical seasonality pattern  or otherwise  we may be unable to reduce expenses quickly enough to avoid losses 
many dentists finance their purchases through third party leasing companies or banks 
in these transactions  the dentist first enters into a purchase order with us 
we then enter into a purchase order with the leasing company  which purchases the product from us  and the dentist enters into a lease agreement with the leasing company 
we receive payment in full for the product at the time of purchase by the leasing company  and we are not a party to the lease 
the dentist pays the leasing company or bank in installments  and we do not bear the credit risk that the dentist might not make payments 
the leasing companies and banks do not have recourse to us for a dentist s failure to make payments  nor do we have any obligation to take back the product at the end of the lease 
approximately of our revenue in  of our revenue in  and of our revenue in were generated from dentists who financed their purchase through national technology leasing corporation  an equipment leasing broker 
we are regularly approached by leasing companies seeking to finance purchases of our products and do not believe the loss of national technology leasing or any other current financing source would materially harm our business 

table of contents cost of sales 
cost of sales is comprised of all costs to manufacture our products  including materials  labor and related overhead costs such as depreciation  warranty and service costs 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist of salaries and benefits  commissions  and other costs related to our direct sales force  advertising costs and expenses related to trade shows and seminars 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist of salaries and benefits of administrative personnel as well as insurance  professional and regulatory fees and provisions for doubtful accounts 
engineering and development 
engineering and development expenses consist of engineering personnel salaries and benefits  prototype supplies  contract services and consulting fees related to product development 
non operating income loss 
non operating income loss consists of interest income and expense  foreign currency gains and losses and similar items not directly related to our operations 
interest income relates to interest earned on our cash balances  and interest expense relates to interest costs on our line of credit 
we generate a substantial portion of our revenue from the sale of products outside the united states 
sales to customers or distributors outside the united states accounted for approximately of our revenue for the year ended december  sales in europe and asia each accounted for approximately of our revenue for the year ended december  our sales in europe are denominated principally in euros  and our sales in other international markets are denominated in dollars 
as we do not engage in hedging transactions to offset foreign currency fluctuations  we are at risk for changes in the value of the dollar relative to the value of the euro 
an increase in the relative value of the dollar would lead to less income from sales denominated in euros unless we increase prices  which may not be possible due to competitive conditions in europe 
conversely  a decrease in the relative value of the dollar would lead to more income from sales denominated in euros 
additionally  we are obligated to pay expenses relating to our german facility in euros 
thus  we are also at risk for changes in the value of the dollar relative to the euro with respect to our obligation to pay expenses relating to our operations in germany 
an increase in the value of the dollar relative to the euro would reduce the expenses associated with the operations of our german facility  whereas a decrease in the relative value of the dollar would increase the cost associated with the operations of our german facility 
income taxes 
for the year ended december   no provision for income tax was recognized due to the availability of net operating loss carry forwards 
at such times as the recoverability of deferred tax assets  including the net operating loss carry forwards  becomes more likely realizable than not  we will reduce the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets  record an income tax benefit and subsequently record a provision for income taxes for financial statement purposes based on the amount of taxable net income 
during the year ended december   we determined that our deferred tax assets were more likely than not to be realized  resulting in the recognition of a million deferred tax benefit 
the utilization of net operating loss and credit carryforwards may be limited under the provisions of internal revenue code section and similar state provisions 
section of the internal revenue code of generally imposes an annual limitation on the amount of net operating loss nol carryforwards that may be used to offset taxable income where a corporation has undergone significant changes in its stock ownership 
in october we completed an analysis to determine the potential applicability of any annual limitations imposed by section based on our analysis  we believe that  as of december   we have  for federal income tax purposes  approximately million of nol carryforwards 
of this amount  approximately million is available to offset federal taxable income and the taxable income generated in future years 
additional nol carryforwards will become available at the rate of approximately million per year for the years through however  any future ownership changes qualifying under section may limit our ability to use remaining nol carryforwards 

table of contents year ended december  compared with year ended december  comparing the results of operations between the years ended december  and december   the most significant change affecting operating results is the increase in net sales 
net sales 
net sales for the year ended december  were million  an increase of million  or  as compared with net sales of million for the year ended december  approximately million of the increase is due to a increase in the number of products and services sold as a result of increased demand for our products 
the remainder of the increase is due to a change in the timing of revenue recognition described below 
in august  we modified our sales arrangements with our customers and began recognizing revenue upon shipment for our domestic sales  or on an accrual basis  which had previously been recognized upon receipt of payment in full  or on a cash basis 
additionally  we began to recognize revenue upon shipment for our international direct sales  which had previously been recognized after completion of installation 
as a result of the change in our revenue recognition policy during the third quarter of  our net sales are not directly comparable to the year ended december  during the year ended december  domestic sales were recognized on a cash basis and international direct sales were recognized after completion of installation 
revenue during the year ended december  included million of revenue for domestic sales recognized on a cash basis and million recognized on an accrual basis 
revenue during the year ended december  included million recognized for international direct sales upon completion of installation and million recognized upon shipment 
as of december  our balance sheet reflects approximately  that has been deferred on product shipments for which payment has not been received in full for domestic sales and where installation has not been completed for international direct sales 
we cannot provide any assurance as to the timing or whether the deferred revenue will ultimately be collected  or when or whether installations will be completed 
other than the possible recognition of this deferred revenue balance  the positive impact to net sales for the year ended december  that resulted from the change in our revenue recognition policy will not occur in future periods 
the waterlase and lasersmile systems accounted for approximately and of our net sales for the year ended december   respectively 
we expect the waterlase will continue to account for the majority of our sales 
many dentists finance their purchases through third party leasing companies 
approximately of our net sales for the year ended december  and of our net sales for the year ended december  were generated from dentists who financed their purchases through national technology leasing corporation  an independent equipment leasing company 
the recent decline in interest rates may have benefited purchasers of our products by reducing the interest expense to finance the purchase or lease of our products  although we do not believe it is possible to measure the effect of lower interest rates on our sales 
international sales for the year ended december  were million  or of net sales  as compared with million  or of net sales  for the year ended december  sales to asia and europe were million and million  respectively  for the year ended december  compared to million and million  respectively  for the year ended december  we had expected international sales to grow as a percentage of total sales in and in the future 
although international sales grew year over year  in line with our overall expectations for total sales  domestic sales growth was stronger due to higher than expected demand in the united states 
during we invested more resources in international sales and marketing and related infrastructure and intend to continue to do so in gross profit 
gross profit for the year ended december  was million  or of net sales  an increase of million  as compared with gross profit of million  or of net sales for the year 
table of contents ended december  gross profit for the year ended december  included million of gross profit for domestic sales recognized on a cash basis and million recognized on an accrual basis 
gross profit for the year ended december  included million recognized for international direct sales upon completion of installation and million recognized upon shipment 
the increase in gross profit is attributable to leveraging the increase in net sales against fixed and partially fixed manufacturing costs  reflecting better absorption of fixed manufacturing costs 
the increase is also due to the relative increase in domestic sales as a percentage of total sales  which generated higher gross margins 
the gross margin associated with sales to international distributors is generally lower as the selling price is lower in order to compensate dealers for the marketing and sales costs they must incur 
international sales increased as a percentage of total sales from to but then decreased as a percentage in however  we still expect international sales will increase as a percentage of sales in future periods 
therefore  while gross margin may continue to increase due to manufacturing efficiencies  relative increases in international sales compared to domestic sales may offset the effect of manufacturing efficiencies on gross profit 
sales of the recently acquired diolase and pulsemaster systems have not had a significant impact on gross profit 
other income other income 
other income consists of gain on sales of assets 
the gain on sales of assets for the years ended december  and december  of  and  respectively  consists principally of the amortization of the deferred gain relating to the sale and leaseback of our manufacturing facility in san clemente  california  in march operating expenses operating expenses 
operating expenses for the year ended december  were million  or of net sales as compared with million  or of net sales for the year ended december  approximately of the increase  or million  consists of sales and marketing costs incurred to generate the increase in net sales 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses for the year ended december  were million  or of net sales  as compared with million  or of net sales  for the year ended december  approximately of the increase in absolute dollars was due to the increase in our direct sales force  development of our infrastructure for international sales  and higher commission expense related to the increase in sales  including recognition  of approximately  in deferred commission expense related to revenue recognized that had been deferred 
marketing expense increased million due to increased staff and additional direct marketing activities in europe 
expenses related to trade shows  seminars and the world clinical laser institute increased approximately million due to an expansion in the scope of activities related to those programs 
we expect our sales and marketing expenses to continue to increase  in large part due to increases in expenses associated with education and training of existing and potential customers  which is an essential component of our effort to increase market acceptance of laser technology and our products 
overall  sales and marketing expense is expected to decrease slightly as a percentage of sales  assuming sales continue to grow in line with our expectations 
incremental costs relating to the marketing and sale of the american dental laser products have not had and are not expected to have a significant impact on total sales and marketing expense 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were million  or of net sales  as compared with million  or of net sales  for the year ended december  professional expenses accounted for approximately of the dollar increase  including approximately  in expenses related to the restatement of our consolidated financial statements  fees related to legal proceedings  expenses related to the preparation of our registration statement and fees incurred on various consulting projects 
we expect professional fee expense to continue to increase as a cost of compliance with new regulatory requirements  such as those generated from the sarbanes oxley act 
costs associated with 
table of contents general liability coverage  employee group insurance and workers compensation insurance increased by  in as compared to we expect these insurance costs to continue to increase significantly as a function of our growth and insurance market conditions in general 
bank charges relating to credit card sales increased by  as compared to and will likely continue to grow commensurate with our sales growth 
overall  general and administrative costs are expected to remain in the range of to of sales 
no significant additional general and administrative expenses have been incurred or are expected from the acquisition and production of the american dental laser products except for amortization expense related to certain intangible assets acquired 
we recorded amortization expense of  for the year ended december   as compared with amortization expense of  for the year ended december  engineering and development 
engineering and development expenses for the year ended december  were million  or of net sales  as compared with million  or of net sales  for the year ended december  the increase in absolute dollars is due to materials and consulting fees related to product development and enhancement 
the change in engineering and development expenses as a percent of net sales reflects the larger sales base and normal fluctuations in the scope of current research and development projects 
we expect engineering and development expenses to remain consistent within their historical range as a percentage of sales in non operating income loss gain on foreign currency transactions 
we realized a  gain on foreign currency transactions for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december  due to the changes in exchange rates between the united states dollar and euro 
gain on forward exchange contracts 
in the year ended december  and  we realized gains of  and  respectively  due to the increase in the fair market value of our forward exchange contracts which we purchased in connection with the debt incurred to acquire our facility in germany 
on february   the contracts expired and were not renewed 
interest income 
interest income relates to interest earned on our cash balances 
interest income for the year ended december  was  as compared with  for the year ended december  due to an increase in our cash balance 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased  or  to  for the year ended december   as compared with the year ended december  due to a decrease in the effective interest rate on our credit facility 
in may  we entered into a million credit facility with a bank to replace our existing line of credit 
the new line of credit bears interest at libor plus as compared with the previous line of libor plus 
although the nominal rate on the new facility is higher  the previous facility was burdened by the amortization of the cost of a third party guaranty 
income taxes 
an income tax benefit of  and a credit of  to additional paid in capital was recognized for the year ended december  this was primarily due to the reduction of the valuation allowance in the amount of  the credit to additional paid in capital was the result of a stock option deduction available to the company in the current year and prior year deductions included in the deferred tax assets which were previously offset by the valuation allowance 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
management considers the projected future taxable income  and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
based upon the level of historical taxable income and the projection for future taxable income over the periods when the deferred tax assets are deductible  management believes it more likely than not the company will realize all of these deductible differences 
as of december   we had net operating loss carry forwards for federal and 
table of contents state purposes of approximately million and million  respectively  which will begin expiring in as of december   we had research and development credit carryforwards for federal and state purposes of approximately  and  respectively  which will begin expiring in for federal purposes and carryforward indefinitely for state purposes 
the utilization of net operating loss and credit carry forwards may be limited under the provisions of internal revenue code section and similar state provisions 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  comparing the results of operations between the prior years  the most significant change affecting operating results is the increase in net sales 
net sales for the year ended december  increased over net sales for the year ended december  net sales 
net sales for the year ended december  were million  an increase of million  as compared with net sales of million for the year ended december  the increase in sales in both and resulted from the increased number of units sold of our laser systems 
our waterlase system accounted for of net sales in and of net sales in our lasersmile system was introduced in the third quarter of and accounted for of net sales in as compared with of net sales in international sales for the year ended december  were million  or of net sales  as compared with million  or of net sales  for the year ended december  the increase in international sales in was the result of a renewed effort to strengthen our network of international distributors after concentrating our resources in in the domestic market 
the formation of biolase europe in and the acquisition of a production and service facility in germany was an important step to increase our visibility in europe as well as to improve our ability to service european customers 
sales of products manufactured at our german facility accounted for of our revenue in in comparison  all of our revenue in was generated from the sale of products manufactured in the united states 
we plan to continue to add resources to our international sales program to take advantage of the large market potential and we expect that our international sales will continue to grow over time as a percentage of our total net sales 
although most of our international sales are made through independent distributors  we began making direct sales to dentists in europe in with the support of our german distributor 
based on the overall increase and detailed review of sales  we increased our allowance on accounts receivable from  at december  to  at december  gross profit 
gross profit for the years ended december  and was million and million  respectively 
the gross margin on sales for those same periods was and  respectively 
the increase in both gross profit and gross margin was attributable to leveraging the increase in our net sales against fixed and partially fixed manufacturing costs  reflecting better absorption of fixed manufacturing costs 
the increase in gross profit is also due to increased manufacturing efficiencies and design changes through engineering and product development  which reduced the cost of materials by 
these efficiencies and cost savings were partially offset by the start up costs for our german production and service facility of approximately  in and the addition of production resources of approximately  to support anticipated sales growth 
while we believe there is additional leverage to be realized from future increases in sales  increases in fixed costs will also accompany growth and may constrain increases in gross margin 
in addition  an increase in the mix of sales to international distributors will also tend to decrease gross profit since such sales are made at wholesale prices 
other income other income consists of gain on sale of assets 
the gain on sale of assets for the year ended december  of  was related to the sale and leaseback of our manufacturing facility in san clemente  california 
table of contents in march this sale resulted in a gain of  which is being recognized over the remaining term of the lease  which expires in gain on sales of assets in included this amortization of deferred gain plus a gain on the sale of certain other assets 
operating expenses operating expenses for the year ended december  were million  or of net sales  as compared with million  or of net sales  for the year ended december  most of the increases in operating expenses for each year were sales and marketing costs that were incurred to generate the increase in sales  including a growing sales force and related expenses 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses for the year ended december  was million  or of net sales  as compared with million  or of net sales  for the year ended december  the increase in absolute dollars from year to year was attributable to higher commission expense related to the increased sales and to the cost of additional sales personnel of approximately  in the united states 
in addition during  we expanded the scope of our nationwide seminar marketing program and our sponsorship of education and training programs for existing and potential customers  as a result of which we incurred additional expenses of  although growing in in absolute dollars  sales and marketing expense as a percentage of net sales decreased from in to in due to the increase in sales generated by these efforts 
in  in addition to a number of local and regional symposiums  we sponsored two national and two international symposiums presented by the world clinical laser institute  an organization that provides education and training in laser dentistry 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  was million  or of net sales  as compared with million  or of net sales  for the year ended december  the increase in absolute dollars in was due to administrative costs associated with the operations of biolase europe of  increases in the costs of legal fees relating to regulatory compliance and various legal proceedings in the amount of  and increases in the infrastructure needed to support the growth of our net sales 
insurance premiums increased in as a result of the increase in net sales and increased by  in both as a result of the increase in sales and as a result of general insurance market conditions 
we expect additional increases in due to adverse markets for workers compensation  group health insurance and liability insurance 
engineering and development 
engineering and development expenses for the year ended december  was million  or of net sales  as compared with million  or of net sales  for the year ended december  the increase in absolute dollars in was related to new product development and enhancements 
the decrease in research and development expenses as a percent of net sales reflects the larger sales base and fluctuations in the scope of current research and development projects 
non operating income loss unrealized gain on forward exchange contract 
in the year ended december   we recognized an unrealized gain on forward contracts of  due to the increase in the fair market value of our forward exchange contract 
interest income 
interest income for the year ended december  was  compared with  in even though our cash balances have increased over this period  continuing reductions in interest rates have resulted in lower interest income 
interest expense 
interest expense was  for the year ended december  compared with  in interest expense in included the amortization of the cost of issuing stock in connection with the extension of our line of credit in december interest expense in included three months of interest on the note payable on our san clemente manufacturing facility  which was sold and leased back in march 
table of contents income tax 
no provision for income tax was recognized for the year ended december  due to the availability of net operating loss carry forwards 
no income tax benefit was recognized in the year ended december  as there was no assurance that the benefit of the net operating loss carry forwards would be realized 
at such time as the recoverability of deferred tax assets  including the net operating loss carry forward  becomes more likely realizable than not  we will reduce the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets  record an income tax benefit and subsequently record a provision for income tax for financial statement purposes based on the amount of taxable net income 
as of december   we had net operating loss carry forwards for federal and state purposes of approximately million and million  respectively  which will begin to expire in as of december   we had research and development credit carryforwards for federal and state purposes of approximately  and  respectively 
the utilization of net operating loss and credit carry forwards may be limited under the provisions of internal revenue code section and similar state provisions 
liquidity and capital resources at december  we had million in net working capital as compared to million at december  our principal source of liquidity at december  consisted of our cash balance of million 
for the year ended december   our sources of cash were funds provided from operating activities of million and the exercise of stock options and warrants of million 
these sources of cash were reduced by investments in property and equipment of  million cash paid for the acquisition of the american dental laser product line and other dental laser assets of american medical technologies  and the repayment of million of debt 
the net effect on cash of operating  investing and financing transactions for the year ended december  was an increase of million 
accounts receivable  net  increased to million at december  from million at december  this increase was due to the higher sales volume experienced in inventories  net  increased to million at december  from million at december  the increase was due to increased production to meet estimated sales demand 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements   warrants with a weighted average exercise price of were exercised during the year ended december  several key indicators of liquidity are summarized in the following table in thousands  except ratio amounts fiscal years ended december  working capital cash provided by used in operations proceeds from the exercise of stock options and warrants current ratio accounts receivable collection period days inventory turnover we purchased our production facility in germany in february for cash consideration of approximately euros million million payable in installments through  subject to reduction in certain circumstances 
the maximum consideration was reduced to euros   in accordance with the terms of the agreement with the seller 
based on our further discussions with the seller  in september  the maximum consideration was reduced to euros  
in october  we paid the seller euros   plus applicable taxes  as full and final payment to the seller under the purchase agreement

under the terms of our credit line with bank of the west  we are subject to certain covenants  which include  among other things  covenants to maintain a specified minimum tangible net worth and a specified ratio of current assets to current liabilities  and a covenant to maintain profitability 
if we fail to satisfy these covenants and we fail to cure any breach of these covenants within a specified number of days after receipt of notice  bank of the west could accelerate the entire amount borrowed by us and cancel the line of credit 
our credit line has an outstanding balance of approximately million as of december  as of december  we were in compliance with all of the covenants 
we typically finance some or all of our annual insurance premiums through unsecured notes with a third party when the insurance carrier does not provide for monthly installment payments of our premiums

at december  the balance of unpaid premiums that were financed was  on may  we acquired the american dental laser product line from american medical technologies  inc  or amt  for approximately million 
the assets acquired included dental laser patents  customer lists  brand names and other intellectual property as well as laser products 
no outstanding debt of amt was assumed in the transaction 
the consideration paid by us consisted of approximately million cash   in transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition and  shares of common stock with a fair value of approximately million 
for purposes of computing the purchase price  the value of the common stock of per share was determined by taking the average closing price of our common stock as quoted on the nasdaq national market between may  and may  we had no material commitments for capital expenditures as of december  and have not entered into any material commitments after that date 
the following table presents our expected cash requirements for contractual obligations outstanding as of december  the years ending as indicated below line of credit short term debt operating leases total we believe that our current cash balances  plus cash expected to be generated from our operations  will be adequate to meet our debt service requirements and sustain our operations for at least the next twelve months 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the continuing market acceptance of our products and our corresponding level of revenues  the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts and the introduction of new products  the expansion of sales and marketing activities and the costs to insure access to adequate manufacturing capacity 
we could be required  or may elect  to seek additional funding through public or private equity or debt financing  however  additional funds may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all

risk factors investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk 
you should carefully consider the following risks and all the other information in this prospectus before making an investment decision about our common stock 
while the risks described below are the ones we believe are most important for you to consider  these risks are not the only ones that we face 
if any of the following risks actually occurs  our business  operating results or financial condition could suffer  the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment 
risks relating to our business our quarterly sales and operating results may fluctuate in future periods and we may fail to meet expectations  which may cause the price of our common stock to decline 
our quarterly sales and operating results have fluctuated and are likely to continue to vary from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors  many of which are not within our control 
if our quarterly sales or operating results fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts  the price of our common stock could decline substantially 
factors that might cause quarterly fluctuations in our sales and operating results include the following variation in demand for our products  including variation due to seasonality  our ability to research  develop  introduce  market and gain market acceptance of new products and product enhancements in a timely manner  our ability to control costs  the size  timing  rescheduling or cancellation of orders from distributors  the introduction of new products by competitors  long sales cycles and fluctuations in sales cycles  the availability and reliability of components used to manufacture our products  changes in our pricing policies or those of our suppliers and competitors  as well as increased price competition in general  the mix of our domestic and international sales  and the risks and uncertainties associated with our international business  costs associated with any future acquisitions of technologies and businesses  limitations on our ability to use net operating loss carryforwards under the provisions of internal revenue code section and similar provisions under applicable state laws  
table of contents developments concerning the protection of our proprietary rights  and general global economic and political conditions  including international conflicts and acts of terrorism 
the amount of expenses we incur  in part  depends on our expectations regarding future sales 
in particular  we expect to continue incurring substantial expenses relating to the marketing and promotion of our products 
since many of our costs are fixed in the short term  if we have a shortfall in sales  we may be unable to reduce expenses quickly enough to avoid losses 
accordingly  you should not rely on quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results as an indication of our future performance 
additionally  as a result of the change in our revenue recognition policy in the third quarter of  our quarterly sales and operating results for each of the next three quarters ending september   may not be directly comparable to corresponding periods in the preceding year due to the difference in the timing of revenue recognition 
regulatory proceedings relating to the restatement of our consolidated financial statements could divert management s attention and resources 
we restated our previously issued financial statements in september to reflect a change in the timing of revenue recognition 
in late october and subsequently  we received informal requests from the securities and exchange commission to voluntarily provide information relating to the restatement of our consolidated financial statements 
we have provided information to the securities and exchange commission and intend to continue to cooperate in responding to the inquiry 
in accordance with its normal practice  the securities and exchange commission has not advised us when its inquiry may be concluded  and we are unable to predict the outcome of this inquiry 
if the securities and exchange commission elects to request additional information from the company or commence further proceedings  responding to such requests or proceedings could divert management s attention and resources 
additionally  any negative developments arising from such requests or proceedings could harm our business and cause the price of our common stock to decline 
the loss of or a substantial reduction in  or change in the size or timing of  orders from distributors could harm our business 
our international sales are principally comprised of sales through independent distributors  although we sell products in certain european countries through direct sales representatives 
a significant amount of our sales may consist of sales through distributors 
net sales to distributors accounted for approximately of our total sales in and of our total sales in no distributor accounted for more than of our net sales in or in the loss of a substantial number of our distributors or a substantial reduction in  cancellation of or change in the size or timing of orders from our current distributors could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the loss of a key distributor could affect our operating results due to the potential length of time that might be required to locate and qualify a new distributor or to retain direct sales representatives for the territory 
in february of  we terminated our distributor in germany for failure to satisfy its obligations under its agreement with us  including failure to meet specified sales quotas 
the agreement was originally signed in and renewed in the agreement required minimum sales of  over the two year term following the renewal 
the average quarterly sales generated by our distributor from the time of the renewal until we terminated the distributor were nearly less than the quota provided under the distribution agreement 
to replace the distributor  we entered into contracts with independent sales agents within germany 
there is no assurance that our distributors will perform as expected and we may experience lengthy delays and incur substantial costs if we are required to replace distributors in the future 
variation in demand for our products due to seasonality can cause our operating results to fluctuate from quarter to quarter during the year 
we have experienced fluctuations in sales from quarter to quarter due to seasonality 
in our experience  sales in the first quarter typically are lower than average and sales in the fourth quarter typically are stronger than average due to the buying patterns of dental professionals 
for example  the fourth quarter of accounted for 
table of contents of our net sales for the year  whereas the first quarter of accounted for of net sales for the year 
in addition  sales in the third quarter of the year may be affected by vacation patterns which can cause sales to be flat or lower than in the second quarter of the year 
as a result  sequential quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results may not be an indication of our performance for the year and may cause our results of operations and stock price to fluctuate 
dentists and patients may be slow to adopt laser technologies  which could limit the market acceptance of our products 
our dental laser systems represent relatively new technologies in the dental market 
currently  only a small percentage of dentists use lasers to perform dental procedures 
our future success will depend on our ability to increase demand for our products by demonstrating to a broad spectrum of dentists and patients the potential performance advantages of our laser systems over traditional methods of treatment and over competitive laser systems 
dentists have historically been and may continue to be slow to adopt new technologies on a widespread basis 
this leads to long sales cycles and requires us to invest a significant amount of time and resources to educate customers about the benefits of our products and how they compare to competing products and technologies 
our sales personnel may be required to spend a substantial amount of time answering questions from potential customers and attending multiple in person meetings over the course of several months before completing a sale 
in addition  on occasion  our customers ask to return products after completing the purchase 
although we treat all sales as final  we may accept product returns from customers in certain circumstances 
if requests for product returns become more pervasive  they could seriously harm our reputation and results of operations 
factors that may inhibit adoption of laser technologies by dentists include cost  and concerns about the safety  efficacy and reliability of lasers 
for example  the selling price of our waterlase product is approximately  which is substantially above the cost of competing non laser technologies 
in order to make an investment in a waterlase  a dentist generally would need to invest time to gain an understanding of the technology and how that technology will produce a return on investment 
similarly  although medical lasers are generally accepted in other specialties  a dentist generally would want to understand how the use of laser technology can improve the clinical outcomes and satisfaction of his or her own patients before making a substantial investment 
absent an immediate competitive motivation  a dentist may not feel compelled to invest the time required to learn about the potential benefits of using a laser 
in addition  a dentistry practice  like any business  needs to make capital allocation decisions in which our product might compete with an unrelated alternative capital expenditure 
economic pressure  caused for example by an economic slowdown or by competitive factors in a specific market place  may make dentists reluctant to purchase substantial capital equipment or invest in new technologies 
patient acceptance will depend in part on the recommendations of dentists and specialists as well as other factors  including without limitation  the relative effectiveness  safety  reliability and comfort of our systems as compared with those of other instruments and methods for performing dental procedures 
the failure of dental lasers to achieve broad market acceptance would have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we cannot assure you that we will successfully achieve broad market acceptance for our products 
we may have difficulty managing our growth 
we have been experiencing significant growth in the scope of our operations and the number of our employees 
this growth has placed significant demands on our management as well as our financial and operational resources 
in order to achieve our business objectives  we anticipate that we will need to continue to grow 
if this growth occurs  it will continue to place additional significant demands on our management and our financial and operational resources  and will require that we continue to develop and improve our operational  financial and other internal controls both in the united states and internationally 
in particular  our growth has and  if it continues  will increase the challenges involved in implementing appropriate operational and financial systems  expanding manufacturing capacity and scaling up production  expanding our sales and marketing 
table of contents infrastructure and capabilities  providing adequate training and supervision to maintain high quality standards  and preserving our culture and values 
the main challenge associated with our growth has been  and we believe will continue to be  our ability to recruit skilled sales  manufacturing and management personnel 
our inability to scale our business appropriately or otherwise adapt to growth would cause our business  financial condition and results of operations to suffer 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights  our competitive position could be harmed or we could be required to incur expenses to enforce our rights 
our future success will depend  in part  on our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection for our products and technology  to preserve our trade secrets and to operate without infringing the intellectual property of others 
in part  we rely on patents to establish and maintain proprietary rights in our technology and products 
while we hold a number of issued patents and have other patent applications pending on our products and technology  we cannot assure you that any additional patents will be issued  that the scope of any patent protection will exclude competition or that any of our patents will be held valid if subsequently challenged 
other companies also may independently develop similar products  duplicate our products or design products that circumvent our patents 
additionally  the laws of foreign countries may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
we face substantial uncertainty regarding the impact that other parties intellectual property positions will have on the markets for dental and other medical lasers 
competitors may claim that we have infringed their current or future intellectual property rights 
the medical technology industry has in the past been characterized by a substantial amount of litigation and related administrative proceedings regarding patents and intellectual property rights 
we may not prevail in any future intellectual property infringement litigation given the complex technical issues and inherent uncertainties in litigation 
any claims  with or without merit  could be time consuming and distracting to management  result in costly litigation  cause product shipment delays  or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
additionally  if an intellectual property claim against us is successful  we might not be able to obtain a license on acceptable terms or license a substitute technology or redesign our products to avoid infringement 
any of the foregoing adverse events could seriously harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are a party to a patent infringement lawsuit involving patents relating to our core technology  which if determined adversely to us  could have a significant negative effect on our earnings 
we are currently involved in a patent lawsuit with diodem  llc  a california limited liability company  which was founded by collete cozean  the former chief executive officer of premier laser systems  inc the claims in this lawsuit were originally part of two separate lawsuits initiated in us district court 
on may   we initiated a civil action in the us district court for the central district of california against diodem to obtain a judicial declaration against diodem that technology used in our laser systems does not infringe four patents owned by diodem 
diodem claims to have acquired the patents from premier laser systems  inc  which filed for bankruptcy protection in march on may   diodem added us as a party to an infringement lawsuit it had previously filed in the us district court for the central district of california 
these lawsuits were consolidated into the currently pending lawsuit in august diodem alleges that our technology  including the technology used in our waterlase system  infringes four patents it acquired from premier 
diodem seeks treble damages  a preliminary and permanent injunction from further alleged infringement  attorneys fees and other unspecified damages 
this lawsuit is in the discovery phase of litigation  and may proceed for an extended period of time 
there can be no assurance that our technology will not be found to infringe any of diodem s patents at issue in this proceeding or that we will not be liable for some or all of the damages alleged by diodem or subject to some or all of the relief requested by diodem 
in addition  this lawsuit could result in significant expenses and diversion of management s time and other resources 
if diodem successfully asserts an infringement claim against us in the lawsuit  our operations may be 
table of contents severely impacted  especially to the extent that it affects our right to use the technology incorporated in our waterlase system  which accounted for approximately of our revenue in and approximately of our revenue in this proceeding could also result in significant limitations on our ability to manufacture  market and sell our products  including our waterlase system  as well as delays and costs associated with redesigning our products and payments of license fees  monetary damages and other payments 
additionally  we may be enjoined from incorporating certain technology into our products  all of which could significantly impede our operations  increase operating expenses  reduce our revenue and cause us to incur losses 
we depend on a limited number of suppliers and if we cannot secure alternate suppliers  the amount of sales in any period could be adversely affected 
we purchase certain materials and components included in our waterlase system and other products from a limited group of suppliers using purchase orders  and we have no written supply contracts with our key suppliers 
our business depends in part on our ability to obtain timely deliveries of materials and components in acceptable quality and quantities from our suppliers 
the introduction of our lasersmile system in was delayed due to an interruption in the supply of components for the system  however  we have not otherwise experienced material delays in the supply of components 
certain components of our products  particularly specialized components used in our lasers  are currently available only from a single source or limited sources 
for example  the crystal  fiber and handpieces used in our waterlase system  which accounted for approximately of our revenue in and approximately of our revenue in  are each supplied by a separate single supplier 
we have not experienced material delays from these suppliers  and we have identified and tested alternative suppliers for each of these three components 
however  an unexpected interruption in a single source supplier could create manufacturing delays  and disrupt sales and cash flow as we sought to replace the supplier  which we estimate could take up to three months 
such an interruption could cause our business  financial condition and results of operations to suffer 
we have significant international sales and are subject to risks associated with operating in international markets 
international sales comprise a significant portion of our net sales and we intend to continue to pursue and expand our international business activities 
international sales accounted for approximately of our revenue in and approximately of our revenue in political and economic conditions outside the united states could make it difficult for us to increase our international sales or to operate abroad 
international operations  including our facility in germany  are subject to many inherent risks  including adverse changes in tariffs  political  social and economic instability and increased security concerns  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  longer collection periods and difficulties in collecting receivables from foreign entities  exposure to different legal standards  ineffectiveness of international distributors  reduced protection for our intellectual property in some countries  burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws  import and export license requirements and restrictions of the united states and each other country in which we operate  trade restrictions  the imposition of governmental controls  
table of contents unexpected changes in regulatory or certification requirements  difficulties in staffing and managing international manufacturing and sales operations  and potentially adverse tax consequences and the complexities of foreign value added tax systems 
we believe that international sales will continue to represent a significant portion of our net sales  and we intend to further expand our international operations 
our direct sales in europe are denominated principally in euros  while our sales in other international markets are in dollars 
as a result  an increase in the relative value of the dollar against the euro would lead to less income from sales denominated in euros  unless we increase prices  which may not be possible due to competitive conditions in europe 
we realized a gain of  on foreign currency transactions for the year ended december   due to a decrease in the value of the dollar relative to the value of the euro 
we could experience losses from european transactions if the relative value of the dollar were to increase in the future 
we do not currently engage in any transactions as a hedge against risks of loss due to foreign currency fluctuations  although we may consider doing so in the future 
we also expect that sales of products manufactured at our facility in germany will account for an increasing percentage of our revenue  which will further increase our exposure to the above described risks associated with our international operations 
sales of products manufactured at our german facility accounted for of our revenue in and approximately of our revenue in since expenses relating to our manufacturing operations in germany are paid in euros  an increase in the value of the euro relative to the dollar would increase the expenses associated with our german manufacturing operations and reduce our earnings 
in addition  we may experience difficulties associated with managing our operations remotely and complying with german regulatory and legal requirements for maintaining our manufacturing operations in that country 
any of these factors may adversely affect our future international sales and manufacturing operations and  consequently  negatively impact our business  financial condition and operating results 
despite these risks  we believe the market for our products outside the united states justifies our effort to expand our international operations 
if we are unable to meet customer demand or comply with quality regulations  our sales will suffer 
we manufacture our products at our california and german production facilities 
in order to achieve our business objectives  we will need to significantly expand our manufacturing capabilities to produce the systems and accessories necessary to meet demand 
we intend to finance the cost of expansion through operating income  funds available under our bank credit line and a portion of the proceeds from this offering 
we may encounter difficulties in scaling up production of our products  including problems involving production capacity and yields  quality control and assurance  component supply and shortages of qualified personnel 
in addition  our manufacturing facilities are subject to periodic inspections by the us food and drug administration  state agencies and foreign regulatory agencies 
our success will depend in part upon our ability to manufacture our products in compliance with the us food and drug administration s quality system regulations and other regulatory requirements 
our business will suffer if we do not succeed in manufacturing our products on a timely basis and with acceptable manufacturing costs while at the same time maintaining good quality control and complying with applicable regulatory requirements 
any failure to significantly expand sales of our products will negatively impact our business 
we currently handle a majority of the marketing  distribution and sales of our laser systems 
in order to achieve our business objectives  we will need to significantly expand our marketing and sales efforts on a nationwide and global basis 
we will face significant challenges and risks in expanding  training  managing and retaining our sales and marketing teams  including managing geographically dispersed efforts 
in addition  we use third party distributors to sell our products in a number of countries outside the united states  and are dependent on the sales and marketing efforts of these third party distributors 
these distributors may not commit the necessary resources to effectively market and sell our products 
if we are unable to expand our sales and marketing capabilities  we may not be able to effectively commercialize our products 

table of contents acquisitions could have unintended negative consequences  which could harm our business 
as part of our business strategy  we may acquire one or more businesses  products or technologies 
in may  we acquired the american dental laser product line and related dental laser assets of american medical technologies  inc  including the diolase and pulsemaster systems  and related inventory  patents and other intellectual property rights 
we are currently in the process of integrating the assets relating to the american dental laser product line into our operations 
we must effectively integrate the american dental laser product line into our operations in order to achieve profitability from it 
the pro forma data in note to the consolidated financial statements included in this form k show a net loss for the year ended december  and a reduction in net income for the year ended december  when the seller s historical losses from operating this product line are combined with our operations 
however  we believe we can integrate the acquired assets into our sales and manufacturing infrastructure with minimal increase to our operating expenses because we acquired principally patents  brand names  customer lists and other intangibles and we did not assume the seller s personnel  facilities or other overhead 
acquisitions could require significant capital infusions and could involve many risks  including  but not limited to  the following we may encounter difficulties in assimilating and integrating the operations  products and workforce of the acquired companies  acquisitions may negatively impact our results of operations because they may require large one time charges or could result in increased debt or contingent liabilities  adverse tax consequences  substantial depreciation or deferred compensation charges  or the amortization or write down of amounts related to deferred compensation  goodwill and other intangible assets  acquisitions may be dilutive to our existing stockholders  acquisitions may disrupt our ongoing business and distract our management  and key personnel of the acquired company may decide not to work for us 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify or consummate any future acquisitions on acceptable terms  or at all 
if we do pursue any acquisitions  it is possible that we may not realize the anticipated benefits from such acquisitions or that the market will not positively view such acquisitions 
we may be unable to comply with covenants contained in our credit agreement  which could result in the impairment of our working capital and alter our ability to operate our business 
in may  we secured a new credit facility through bank of the west 
at december   the outstanding principal balance on this credit facility was million 
to maintain the right to borrow under this credit facility and avoid a default under our credit agreement with bank of the west  we are required to satisfy certain financial tests and comply with certain operating covenants contained in that agreement 
our ability to satisfy required financial ratios and tests can be affected by events beyond our control  including prevailing economic  financial and industry conditions  and we cannot assure you that we will continue to meet those ratios and tests in the future 
a breach of any of these covenants  ratios or tests could result in a default under our credit agreement 
if we default  our lender will no longer be obligated to extend credit to us and could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the credit agreement  together with accrued interest  to be immediately due and payable 
if we were unable to repay those amounts  our lender could proceed against the collateral granted to it to secure that indebtedness  which includes our intellectual property 
the results of such action would have a significant negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
for example  due to the restatement of our financial statements  we were not in compliance with three covenants under the credit facility as of june  the bank waived our noncompliance with these covenants as of june   so that we were not in default under the credit facility 
we were in compliance with the financial covenants as of december   the most recent evaluation date for determining compliance with the covenants 
however  we cannot assure you that we will be in compliance with our financial covenants on future evaluation dates 

table of contents material increases in interest rates may harm our sales 
we currently sell our products primarily to dentists in general practice 
these dentists often purchase our products with funds they secure through various financing arrangements with third party financial institutions  including credit facilities and short term loans 
if interest rates increase  these financing arrangements will be more expensive to our dental customers  which would effectively increase the price of our products to our customers and  thereby  may decrease overall demand for our products 
any reduction in the sales of our products would cause our business to suffer 
we may not be able to compete successfully against our current and future competitors 
we compete with a number of foreign and domestic companies that market traditional dental products  such as dental drills  as well as other companies that market laser technologies in the dental and medical markets that we address  including companies such as hoya conbio  a subsidiary of hoya photonics  a large japanese manufacturer primarily of optics and crystals  opusdent ltd  a subsidiary of lumenis  ka vo  deka dental corporation and fotona dd some of our competitors have greater financial  technical  marketing or other resources than us  which may allow them to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and to devote greater resources to the acquisition or development and introduction of enhanced products than we can 
in addition  the rapid technological changes occurring in the healthcare industry are expected to lead to the entry of new competitors  especially as dental and medical lasers gain increasing market acceptance 
our ability to anticipate technological changes and to introduce enhanced products on a timely basis will be a significant factor in our ability to grow and remain competitive 
new competitors or technological changes in laser products and methods could cause commoditization of such products  require price discounting or otherwise adversely affect our gross margins 
rapid changes in technology could harm the demand for our products or result in significant additional costs 
the markets in which our laser systems compete are subject to rapid technological change  evolving industry standards  changes in the regulatory environment  frequent new device introductions and evolving dental and surgical techniques 
these changes could render our products uncompetitive or obsolete 
the success of our existing and future products is dependent on the differentiation of our products from those of our competitors  the timely introduction of new products and the perceived benefit to the customer in terms of improved patient satisfaction and return on investment 
the process of developing new medical devices is inherently complex and requires regulatory approvals or clearances that can be expensive  time consuming and uncertain 
we cannot assure you that we will successfully identify new product opportunities  be financially or otherwise capable of completing the research and development required to bring new products to market in a timely manner or that products and technologies developed by others will not render our products obsolete 
the failure to attract and retain key personnel could adversely affect our business 
our future success depends in part on the continued service of certain key personnel  including our chief executive officer  our executive vice president responsible for sales  our chief operating officer  our vice president of research and development and our chief financial officer 
we do not have employment agreements with any of our key employees  other than employment agreements with our chief executive officer  and our executive vice president responsible for sales  each of which can be terminated at will by the executive or by us 
our success will also depend in large part on our ability to continue to attract  retain and motivate qualified engineering and other highly skilled technical personnel 
competition for certain employees  particularly development engineers  is intense despite the effects of the economic slowdown 
we may be unable to continue to attract and retain sufficient numbers of such highly skilled employees 
our inability to attract and retain additional key employees or the loss of one or more of our current key employees could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents product liability claims against us could be costly and could harm our reputation 
the sale of dental and medical devices involves the inherent risk of product liability claims against us 
we currently maintain product liability insurance on a per occurrence basis with a limit of million per occurrence and million in the aggregate for all occurrences 
the insurance is subject to various standard coverage exclusions  including damage to the product itself  losses from recall of our product and losses covered by other forms of insurance such as workers compensation 
there is no assurance that we will be able to obtain such insurance in the future on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
we do not know whether claims against us with respect to our products  if any  would be successfully defended or whether our insurance would be sufficient to cover liabilities resulting from such claims 
any claims successfully brought against us would cause our business to suffer 
our ability to use net operating loss carryforwards may be limited 
section of the internal revenue code of generally imposes an annual limitation on the amount of net operating loss carryforwards that may be used to offset taxable income when a corporation has undergone significant changes in its stock ownership 
we have completed an analysis to determine the applicability of the annual limitations imposed by section caused by previous changes in our stock ownership and have determined that such limitations should not be significant 
based on our analysis  we believe that  as of december   approximately million of net operating loss carryforwards was available to us for federal income tax purposes 
of this amount  approximately million is available to offset federal taxable income or the taxable income generated in future years 
additional net operating loss carryforwards will become available at the rate of approximately million per year for the years through however  any future ownership changes qualifying under section may similarly affect our ability to use our remaining net operating loss carryforwards 
if we lose our ability to use net operating loss carryforwards  our income will be subject to tax earlier than it would be if we were able to use net operating loss carryforwards  resulting in lower profits 
we are exposed to risks associated with the recent worldwide economic slowdown and related uncertainties 
concerns about decreased consumer and investor confidence  reduced corporate profits and capital spending  and recent international conflicts and terrorist and military activity have resulted in a downturn in the equity markets and a slowdown in economic conditions  both domestically and internationally  and have caused concern about the strength or longevity of an economic recovery 
these unfavorable conditions could ultimately cause a slowdown in customer orders or cause customer order cancellations 
in addition  recent political and social turmoil related to international conflicts and terrorist acts may put further pressure on economic conditions in the united states and abroad 
unstable political  social and economic conditions make it difficult for our customers  our suppliers and us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities 
if such conditions continue or worsen  our business  financial condition and results of operations could suffer 
we may not be able to secure additional financing to meet our future capital needs 
we expect to expend significant capital to further develop our products  increase awareness of our laser systems and our brand names and to expand our operating and management infrastructure as we increase sales in the united states and abroad 
we may use capital more rapidly than currently anticipated 
additionally  we may incur higher operating expenses and generate lower revenue than currently expected  and we may be required to depend on external financing to satisfy our operating and capital needs  including the repayment of our debt obligations 
we may be unable to secure additional debt or equity financing on terms acceptable to us  or at all  at the time when we need such funding 
if we do raise funds by issuing additional equity or convertible debt securities  the ownership percentages of existing stockholders would be reduced  and the securities that we issue may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of the holders of our common stock or may be issued at 
table of contents a discount to the market price of our common stock which would result in dilution to our existing stockholders 
if we raise additional funds by issuing debt  we may be subject to debt covenants  such as the debt covenants under our secured credit facility  which could place limitations on our operations including our ability to declare and pay dividends 
our inability to raise additional funds on a timely basis would make it difficult for us to achieve our business objectives and would have a negative impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we have adopted anti takeover defenses that could delay or prevent an acquisition of our company and may affect the price of our common stock 
certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and stockholder rights plan could make it difficult for any party to acquire us  even though an acquisition might be beneficial to our stockholders 
these provisions could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 
in december  we adopted a stockholder rights plan pursuant to which one preferred stock purchase right is distributed to our stockholders for each share of our common stock held by them 
in connection with the stockholder rights plan  the board of directors may issue up to  shares of series b junior participating cumulative preferred stock which may be increased by up to  more shares out of undesignated preferred stock described in the paragraph below that is available under our certificate of incorporation 
if any party acquires or more of our outstanding common stock or commences a tender offer to acquire or more of our outstanding stock  the holders of these rights will be able to purchase the underlying junior participating preferred stock as a way to discourage  delay or prevent a change in control of our company 
following the acquisition of or more of our stock by any person  if we are acquired by or merged with any other entity  holders of these rights will be able to purchase shares of common stock of the acquiring or surviving entity as a further means to discourage  delay or prevent a change in control of our company 
in addition  under our certificate of incorporation  the board of directors has the power to authorize the issuance of up to  shares of preferred stock that is currently undesignated  and to designate the price  rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions  including voting rights  of those shares without further vote or action by the stockholders 
accordingly  our board of directors may issue preferred stock with terms that could have preference over and adversely affect the rights of holders of our common stock 
the issuance of any preferred stock may delay  defer or prevent a change in control of biolase  discourage bids for the common stock at a premium over the market price of our common stock  adversely affect the voting and other rights of the holders of our common stock  and discourage acquisition proposals or tender offers for our shares 
risks relating to our industry changes in government regulation or the inability to obtain or maintain necessary government approvals could harm our business 
our products are subject to extensive government regulation  both in the united states and in other countries 
to clinically test  manufacture and market products for human use  we must comply with regulations and safety standards set by the us food and drug administration and comparable state and foreign agencies 
regulations adopted by the us food and drug administration are wide ranging and govern  among other things  product design  development  manufacture and testing  labeling  storage  advertising and sales 
generally  products must meet regulatory standards as safe and effective for their intended use before being marketed for 
table of contents human applications 
the clearance process is expensive  time consuming and uncertain 
failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements of the us food and drug administration can result in an enforcement action which may include a variety of sanctions  including fines  injunctions  civil penalties  recall or seizure of our products  operating restrictions  partial suspension or total shutdown of production and criminal prosecution 
the failure to receive or maintain requisite approvals for the use of our products or processes  or significant delays in obtaining such approvals  could prevent us from developing  manufacturing and marketing products and services necessary for us to remain competitive 
in addition  unanticipated changes in existing regulatory requirements or the adoption of new requirements could impose significant costs and burdens on us  which could increase our operating expenses  reduce our revenue and profits  and result in operating losses 
if our customers cannot obtain third party reimbursement for their use of our products  they may be less inclined to purchase our products 
our products are generally purchased by dental or medical professionals who have various billing practices and patient mixes 
such practices range from primarily private pay to those who rely heavily on third party payors  such as private insurance or government programs 
in the united states  third party payors review and frequently challenge the prices charged for medical services 
in many foreign countries  the prices for dental services are predetermined through government regulation 
payors may deny coverage and reimbursement if they determine that the procedure was not medically necessary  such as a cosmetic procedure  or that the device used in the procedure was investigational 
we believe that most of the procedures being performed with our current products generally are reimbursable  with the exception of cosmetic applications such as tooth whitening 
for the portion of dentists who rely heavily on third party reimbursement  the inability to obtain reimbursement for services using our products could deter them from purchasing or using our products 
we cannot predict the effect of future healthcare reforms or changes in financing for health and dental plans 
any such changes could have an adverse effect on the ability of a dental or medical professional to generate a return on investment using our current or future products 
such changes could act as disincentives for capital investments by dental and medical professionals and could have a negative impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  we acquired a production facility in germany in february of the debt related to those assets was paid on october  in conjunction with a portion of the debt due in  we entered into a forward contract to purchase approximately  of euros at an exchange rate of 
on february   the contracts expired and were not renewed  resulting in a cumulative realized gain on the contracts of  since february   we have not engaged in transactions to offset currency fluctuations 
in october  we paid off the debt on our german facility 
the value of the german facility itself as stated in dollars on our balance sheet will vary as the exchange rate of the dollar and the euro varies 
our sales in europe are denominated principally in euros  and our sales in other international markets are denominated in dollars 
as a result  an increase in the relative value of the dollar to the euro would lead to less income from sales denominated in euros  unless we increase prices  which may not be possible due to competitive conditions in europe 
additionally  since expenses relating to our manufacturing operations in germany are paid in euros  an increase in the value of the euro relative to the dollar would increase the expenses associated with our german manufacturing operations and reduce our earnings 
our bank line of credit bears interest at a variable rate tied to libor plus  which makes the current effective interest rate at december  a increase in libor would increase the effective interest rate from to  which would not result in a material difference to our interest expense on our outstanding bank debt of million 

table of contents our primary objective in managing our cash balances has been preservation of principal and maintenance of liquidity to meet our operating needs 
most of our excess cash balances are invested in a money market account consisting of us government securities in which there is minimal interest rate risk
