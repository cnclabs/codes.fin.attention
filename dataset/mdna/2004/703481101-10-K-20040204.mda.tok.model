item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this item contains forward looking statements  which are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of management overview we are a leading provider of contract services to the north american oil and natural gas industry 
our services primarily involve the drilling  on a contract basis  of land based oil and natural gas wells and to a lesser extent  we provide pressure pumping services and drilling and completion fluid services 
in addition to the aforementioned contract services  we also engage in the development  exploration  
table of contents acquisition and production of oil and natural gas 
for the three years ended december  our operating revenues consisted of the following dollars in thousands contract drilling pressure pumping drilling and completion fluids oil and natural gas we provide our contract services to oil and natural gas operators throughout the oil and natural gas producing regions of north america 
our contract drilling operations are focused in various regions of texas  new mexico  oklahoma  louisiana  mississippi  colorado  utah  wyoming and western canada while our pressure pumping services are focused primarily in the appalachian basin 
our drilling and completion fluids services are provided to operators in texas  new mexico  oklahoma  the gulf coast regions of texas and louisiana and the gulf of mexico 
our oil and natural gas operations are primarily focused in texas  new mexico and mississippi 
we have been a leading consolidator of the land based contract drilling industry over the past several years increasing our drilling fleet to rigs  which we believe is the second largest drilling fleet in north america 
our most significant transaction occurred in may when we merged with uti energy corp 
in a merger of equals which basically doubled our drilling fleet and added the pressure pumping services business 
growth by acquisition has been a corporate strategy intended to expand both revenues and market share 
the profitability of our business is most readily assessed by two primary indicators our average number of rigs operating and our average revenue per operating day 
during  our average number of rigs operating increased to from in and our average revenue per operating day increased to  from  in primarily due to these improved operating results  we experienced an increase of approximately million in net income in our revenues  profitability and cash flows are highly dependent upon the market prices of oil and natural gas 
during periods of improved commodity prices  the capital spending budgets of oil and natural gas operators tend to expand  which results in increased demand for our contract services 
conversely  in periods of time when these commodity prices deteriorate  the demand for our contract services generally weakens and we experience downward pressure on pricing for our services 
in addition  our operations are also highly impacted by competition  the availability of excess equipment  labor issues and various other factors which are more fully described as risk factors in our forward looking statements and cautionary statements for purposes of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of contained on page of this report 
management believes that the liquidity of our balance sheet as of december   which includes approximately million in working capital including million in cash  no long term debt and a million undrawn line of credit  provides us with the ability to pursue acquisition opportunities  expand into new regions  make improvements to our assets and to survive downturns in our industry 
commitments and contingencies we have no commitments or contingencies which require disclosure in our financial statements other than letters of credit totaling million at december   maintained for the benefit of various insurance companies as collateral for retrospective premiums and retained losses which may become payable under the terms of the underlying insurance contracts 
no amounts have been drawn under the letters of credit 
net income for the year ended december  includes a charge of million related to the financial failure in of a workers compensation insurance carrier that had provided coverage for us in prior years 

table of contents trading and investing we have not engaged in trading activities that include high risk securities  such as derivatives and non exchange traded contracts 
we invest cash primarily in highly liquid  short term investments such as overnight deposits  money markets  and highly rated municipal and commercial bonds 
however in june and october  we acquired a total of  shares of common stock of tmbr sharp drilling  inc  a company whose stock is traded on the nasdaq national market system  for a total cost of million 
description of business based on publicly available information  we believe we are the second largest owner of land based drilling rigs in north america 
we conduct our contract drilling operations in texas  new mexico  oklahoma  louisiana  mississippi  colorado  utah  wyoming  and western canada 
as of december   we owned drilling rigs 
we provide pressure pumping services to oil and natural gas operators primarily in the appalachian basin 
these services consist primarily of well stimulation and cementing for completion of new wells and remedial work on existing wells 
we provide drilling fluids  completion fluids  and related services to oil and natural gas operators in west texas  southeast new mexico  south texas  east texas  oklahoma  the gulf coast regions of texas and louisiana  and the gulf of mexico 
drilling and completion fluids are used by oil and natural gas operators during the drilling process to control pressure when drilling oil and natural gas wells 
we are also engaged in the development  exploration  acquisition  and production of oil and natural gas 
our oil and natural gas business operates primarily in producing regions in west texas  southeast new mexico  south texas and mississippi 
the contract drilling business experienced increased demand for drilling services in  and however  except for those periods and other occasional upturns  generally  there have been substantially more drilling rigs available than necessary to meet demand in most operational and geographic segments of the north american land drilling industry 
as a result  drilling contractors have had difficulty sustaining profit margins 
in addition to adverse effects that future declines in demand could have on patterson uti  ongoing factors which could adversely affect utilization rates and pricing  even in an environment of stronger oil and natural gas prices and increased drilling activity  include movement of drilling rigs from region to region  reactivation of land based drilling rigs  or new construction of drilling rigs 
we cannot predict either the future level of demand for our contract drilling services or future conditions in the oil and natural gas contract drilling business 
critical accounting policies in addition to established accounting policies  our consolidated financial statements are impacted by certain estimates and assumptions made by management 
the following is a discussion of our critical accounting policies pertaining to property and equipment  oil and natural gas properties  intangible assets  revenue recognition  and the use of estimates 
property and equipment property and equipment  including betterments which extend the useful life of the asset  are stated at cost 
maintenance and repairs are charged to expense when incurred 
we provide for the depreciation of our property and equipment using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives 
our method of depreciation does not change when equipment becomes idle  we continue to depreciate idled equipment on a straight line basis 
no provision for salvage value is considered in determining depreciation of our property and equipment 
we review our assets  including intangible assets  for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values of certain assets either exceed their respective fair values or may not be recovered over their estimated remaining useful lives 
the cyclical nature of our industry has resulted in fluctuations in rig utilization over periods of time 
management believes that the contract drilling industry will continue to be cyclical and rig utilization will fluctuate 
based on management s expectations of future trends  we estimate future cash flows in our assessment of impairment assuming the 
table of contents following four year industry cycle one year projected with low utilization  one year projected as a recovery period with improving utilization and the remaining two years projecting higher utilization 
provisions for asset impairment are charged to income when estimated future cash flows  on an undiscounted basis  are less than the asset s net book value 
impairment charges are recorded based on discounted cash flows 
there were no impairment charges during the years  or oil and natural gas properties oil and natural gas properties are accounted for using the successful efforts method of accounting 
exploration and development costs which result directly in the discovery of oil and natural gas reserves are capitalized to the appropriate well 
exploration costs which do not result directly in the discovery of oil and natural gas reserves are charged to expense when such determinations are made 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 financial accounting and reporting by oil and gas producing companies  sfas no 
costs of exploratory wells are initially capitalized to wells in progress until the outcome of the drilling is known 
we review wells in progress quarterly to determine the related reserve classification 
if the reserve classification is uncertain after one year following the completion of drilling  we consider the costs of the well to be impaired and recognize the costs as expense 
geological and geophysical costs  including seismic costs  and costs to carry and retain undeveloped properties are charged to expense when incurred 
capitalized costs of both developmental and successful exploratory type wells  consisting of lease and well equipment  lease acquisition costs  and intangible development costs  are depreciated  depleted  and amortized on the units of production method  based on petroleum engineer estimates of proved oil and natural gas reserves of each respective field 
we review our proved oil and natural gas properties for impairment when an event occurs such as downward revisions in reserve estimates or decreases in oil and natural gas prices 
proved properties are grouped by field and undiscounted cash flow estimates are provided by our reserve engineer 
if the net book value of a field exceeds its undiscounted cash flow estimate  impairment expense is measured and recognized as the difference between its net book value and discounted cash flow 
unproved oil and natural gas properties are reviewed quarterly to determine impairment 
our intent to drill  lease expiration  and abandonment of area are considered 
assessment of impairment is made on a lease by lease basis 
if an unproved property is determined to be impaired  then costs related to that property are expensed 
impairment expense of approximately million   and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  is included in depreciation  depletion  and amortization in the accompanying financial statements 
intangible assets intangible assets consist primarily of goodwill arising from business combinations see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included as part of item of this report 
intangible assets other than goodwill are amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives 
covenants not to compete are amortized over their underlying contractual lives of five years 
prior to  goodwill  representing the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets of the acquired business  was amortized over the period of expected benefit of years 
however  effective january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  sfas no 
which requires that we cease amortization of all intangible assets having indefinite useful economic lives 
such assets  including goodwill  are not to be amortized until their lives are determined to be finite  however  a recognized intangible asset with an indefinite useful life should be tested for impairment annually or on an interim basis if events or circumstances indicate that the fair value of the asset has decreased below its carrying value 
at december   we evaluated our goodwill and other intangible assets and determined that fair value had not decreased below carrying value and no adjustment to impair goodwill and other intangible assets was necessary in accordance with sfas no 
with respect to our drilling and completion fluids business  the determination that no impairment existed was based on our expectations of improvement in the results of operations for that business segment 
if the expected improvement in results does not occur  all or part of the goodwill and other intangible assets of approximately million associated with that business segment may be determined to be impaired 
revenue recognition revenues are recognized when services are performed  except for revenues earned under turnkey contract drilling arrangements which are recognized using the completed contract method of accounting  as described below 
we follow the percentage of completion method of accounting for footage contract drilling arrangements 
under this method  drilling revenues and costs related to a well in 
table of contents progress are recognized proportionately over the time it takes to drill the well 
percentage of completion is determined based upon the amount of expenses incurred through the measurement date as compared to total estimated expenses to be incurred drilling the well 
under the percentage of completion method  management estimates are relied upon in the determination of the total estimated expenses to be incurred drilling the well 
due to the nature of turnkey contract drilling arrangements and risks therein  we follow the completed contract method of accounting for such arrangements 
under this method  all drilling advances and costs related to a well in progress are deferred and recognized as revenues and expenses in the period the well is completed 
provisions for losses on incomplete or in process wells are made when estimated total costs are expected to exceed estimated total revenues 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date and the amounts of revenues and expenses recognized during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from such estimates 
key estimates used by management include allowance for doubtful accounts  depreciation  depletion  and amortization  asset impairment  reserves for self insured levels of insurance coverages  and fair values of assets and liabilities assumed

related party transactions in  we leased a beech king air airplane owned by ssi oil and gas  inc  an entity beneficially owned by cloyce a 
talbott  patterson uti s chief executive officer  and directly owned by a 
glenn patterson  patterson uti s president chief operating officer 
under the terms of the lease  we paid a monthly rental of  the costs of fuel  insurance  taxes  and maintenance of the aircraft 
such amounts totaled approximately  for the year ended december  we operate certain oil and natural gas properties in which certain of our affiliated persons have participated  either individually or through entities they control  in the prospects or properties in which we have an interest 
these participations  which have been on a working interest basis  have been in prospects or properties originated or acquired by patterson uti 
at december   affiliated persons were working interest owners in of the wells operated by patterson uti 
sales of working interests are made by patterson uti to reduce its economic risk in the properties 
generally  it is more efficient for patterson uti to sell the working interests to these affiliated persons than to market them to unrelated third parties 
sales were made by patterson uti at its cost  comprised of patterson uti s costs of acquiring and preparing the working interests for sale 
these costs were paid by the working interest owners on a pro rata basis based upon their working interest ownership percentage 
the price at which working interests were sold to affiliated persons was the same price at which working interests were sold to unaffiliated persons 
the following table sets forth production revenues and joint interest costs of each of the affiliated persons during for all wells operated by patterson uti in which they have working interests 
these amounts do not necessarily represent their profits or losses from these interests because the joint interest costs do not include the parties related drilling and leasehold acquisition costs incurred prior to january  these

table of contents liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had working capital of million including cash and cash equivalents of million 
for  our significant sources of cash flow were million derived from operations  million from the exercise of stock options and warrants  and million from the sale of certain property and equipment 
we used approximately million to make capital expenditures for the betterment and refurbishment of our drilling rigs  for the acquisition and procurement of drilling equipment  to fund capital expenditures for our pressure pumping and drilling and completion fluids divisions  and to fund leasehold acquisition and development and exploration of oil and natural gas properties 
in january  we acquired four land based drilling rigs and related equipment from sei drilling company for million in cash 
the transaction was accounted for as an acquisition of assets and the purchase price was allocated among the assets acquired based on their estimated fair market values 
in february  we acquired three land based drilling rigs  a yard  and other related equipment from mesa drilling  inc and related entities for million in cash 
the transaction was accounted for as an acquisition of assets and the purchase price was allocated among the assets acquired based on their estimated fair market values 
in april  we acquired two land based drilling rigs for million in cash 
the transaction was accounted for as an acquisition of assets and the purchase price was allocated among the assets acquired based on their estimated fair market values 
in may  we acquired seven land based drilling rigs and related equipment from hexadyne drilling corporation for million in cash 
the transaction was accounted for as an acquisition of assets and the purchase price was allocated among the assets acquired based on their estimated fair market values 
in may  the company  patterson uti acquisition  llc  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company sub  and tmbr sharp drilling  inc  a texas corporation tmbr  entered into an agreement and plan of merger  as amended by amendment no 
to agreement and plan of merger  dated as of december   by and among the same parties the merger agreement  pursuant to which  upon the satisfaction and completion of the conditions to the merger contained in the merger agreement  including approval of the merger agreement by at least two thirds of the shareholders of tmbr  tmbr will merge with and into sub with sub being the surviving company 
if the merger is completed  each issued and outstanding share of common stock  
par value per share  of tmbr not owned directly or indirectly by the company or tmbr or held by tmbr shareholders who validly exercise their dissenters rights under texas law  will be converted into the right to receive in cash from the company and of a share of common stock  par value per share  of the company the company common stock  for a total of approximately million in cash and approximately million shares of company common stock based on the outstanding shares of tmbr common stock as of january  the company currently intends to pay the cash portion of the merger consideration to tmbr shareholders out of funds available on hand and existing financing facilities 
the tmbr shareholders meeting is currently scheduled for february  in november  we acquired three land based drilling rigs  a shop facility  and related equipment from fort drilling llc for million in cash 
the transaction was accounted for as an acquisition of assets and the purchase price was allocated among the assets acquired based on their estimated fair market values 
in addition to the above mentioned acquisitions  we spent approximately million on other acquisitions of assets and costs associated with the acquisitions completed during 
table of contents we believe that the current level of cash and short term investments  together with cash generated from operations  should be sufficient to meet our capital needs 
from time to time  acquisition opportunities are reviewed relating to our business 
the timing  size or success of any acquisition and the associated capital commitments are unpredictable 
over the longer term  should further opportunities for growth requiring capital arise  we believe we would be able to satisfy these needs through a combination of working capital  cash generated from operations  and either debt or equity financing 
however  there can be no assurance that such capital would be available

the decreased operating results in were reflective of a significant decline in demand for our contract drilling services as evidenced by decreases in the number of operating days and average rig utilization 
increased competition during for available jobs resulted in downward pricing pressure and decreased operating revenues 
increased operating costs per operating day were primarily attributable to increased labor costs  including payroll expenses and workers compensation insurance costs 
payroll expenses increased as experienced field personnel were retained despite the significant decline in our average rig utilization 
management believes this strategy is beneficial as it retains experienced personnel and facilitates our response to increased demand levels as industry conditions improve

volatility of oil and natural gas prices our revenue  profitability  and future rate of growth are substantially dependent upon prevailing prices for oil and natural gas  with respect to all of our operating segments 
historically  oil and natural gas prices and markets have been volatile 
prices are affected by market supply and demand factors as well as actions of state and local agencies  the united states and foreign governments  and international cartels 
all of these factors are beyond our control 
natural gas prices fell from an average of per mcf in the first quarter of to an average of per mcf for the same period in during this same period  the average number of our rigs operating dropped by approximately 
the average market price of natural gas improved to in compared to in  resulting in an increase in demand for our drilling services 
our average number of rigs operating increased to in from in we expect oil and natural gas prices to continue to be volatile and to affect our financial condition and operations and ability to access sources of capital 
the contract drilling business experienced increased demand for drilling services in  and however  except for those periods and other occasional upturns  generally  there have been substantially more drilling rigs available than necessary to meet demand in most operational and geographic segments of the north american land drilling industry 
as a result  drilling contractors have had difficulty sustaining profit margins

if the value of the canadian dollar against the us dollar weakens  revenues and earnings of our canadian operations will be reduced when they are translated to us dollars 
also  the value of our canadian net assets in us dollars may decline
