item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we believe that most of the major ate industry participants have not been profitable for the last three years  indicating a very competitive marketplace 
our revenue remained relatively weak throughout fiscal and began to grow sequentially beginning in the second quarter of fiscal the test and assembly sector of the semiconductor equipment industry continues to be impacted by a severe downturn that began in fiscal although there has been recent sequential improvements in the business environment  there is uncertainty as to the strength and length of the next cyclical growth phase 
until such time as we return to a period of sustainable growth and due to continued low visibility  we maintain a cautious outlook for future orders and sales levels 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  investments  leased equipment residual values  intangible assets  income taxes  warranty obligations  restructuring  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we discuss the development and selection of the critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors on a quarterly basis  and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosure relating to them in this annual report on form k 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition under sab  we recognize revenue on the sale of semiconductor manufacturing equipment when title and risk of loss have passed to the customer  there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the sales price is fixed or determinable  collectibility is reasonably assured and customer acceptance criteria have been successfully demonstrated 
our revenue recognition policies are applied consistently among our semiconductor manufacturing equipment product lines 
product revenue is recognized upon shipment when the product is classified as mature and the customer acceptance criteria can be demonstrated prior to shipment 
revenue related to the fair value of the installation obligation is recognized upon completion of the installation 
products are classified as mature after several different customers have accepted similar systems 
for sales of new products or when the customer acceptance criteria cannot be demonstrated prior to shipment  revenue and the related cost of goods sold are deferred until customer acceptance 
lease revenue is recorded in accordance with fas no 
 accounting for leases which requires that a lessor account for each lease by either the direct financing  sales type or operating method 
revenue from sales type leases is recognized at the net present value of future lease payments 
revenue from operating leases is recognized over the lease period 
under the sab revenue recognition policy  we defer revenue for transactions that involve newly introduced products or when customers specify acceptance criteria that cannot be demonstrated prior to the shipment 
during fiscal and  we introduced several new systems and products 
certain revenues from sales of these new systems and products during fiscal were deferred until the revenue recognition requirements of our revenue recognition policy are satisfied 
this practice will continue in the future 
in the past  we experienced significant delays in the introduction and acceptance of new testers as well as certain enhancements to our existing testers 
as a result  some customers have experienced significant delays in receiving and accepting our testers in production 
delays in introducing a product or delays in our ability to obtain customer acceptance  if they occur in the future  will delay the recognition of revenue and gross profit by us 
when we are able to separate multiple deliverables from one another we recognize revenue for each deliverable  based on each deliverable s fair value  when the revenue recognition criteria for that specific deliverable is achieved 
in the vast majority of cases  our orders are shipped complete 
in rare instances when there are multiple shipments due to materials shortages  revenue and related cost of sales are recognized only for the line items that are physically shipped 
if the items not shipped on an order are required for the functionality of the delivered items  revenue and related cost of sales are deferred on the delivered items and recognized only upon the shipment of the required items 
if there are specific customer acceptance criteria  revenue is deferred until the specified performance has been completed in accordance with our revenue recognition policy 
installation in the majority of the cases occurs within two weeks of shipment 
installation is considered to be inconsequential and perfunctory 
the cost of installation can be reliably estimated and is accrued at shipment 
in order to comply with emerging issues task force accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  eitf  beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal  revenue related to the total value of installations not completed at the end of the period was deferred 
sales in the united states are principally through our direct sales organization consisting of direct sales employees and representatives 
sales outside the united states utilize both direct sales employees and distributors 
there are no significant differences in our revenue recognition policies based on the sales channel  due to the business practices that we have adopted with our distributor relationships 
because of these business circumstances we do not use price protection  stock rotation or similar programs with our distributors 
we do not typically sell inventory into our distributors for eventual sale to end users  but rather we sell product to the distributors on the basis of a purchase order received from an end user 
we evaluate any revenue recognition issues with respect to the end customer in light of our revenue recognition policy and in accordance with sab we sell stand alone software products and the revenue recognition policies related to these sales fall within the scope of aicpa statement of position no 
sop  software revenue recognition 
the stand alone software products are applications for ic manufacturers and test and assembly contractors to help improve quality and shorten development lead times 
we also have embedded software in our semiconductor manufacturing equipment 
we believe this embedded software is incidental to our products and therefore it is excluded from the scope of sop since the embedded software in our products is not sold separately  cannot be used on another vendor s products  and we cannot fundamentally enhance or expand the capability of the equipment with new or revised software 
in addition  the equipment s principal performance characteristics are governed by digital speed and pin count which are primarily a function of the hardware 
allowance for doubtful accounts our sales and distribution partners and we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability or unwillingness of our customers to make required payments 
we record our bad debt expenses as selling  general and administrative expenses 
when we become aware that a specific customer is unable to meet its financial obligations to us  for example because of bankruptcy or deteriorations in the customer s operating results or financial position  we record a specific allowance to reflect the level of credit risk in the customer s outstanding receivable balance 
in addition  we record additional allowances based on certain percentages of our aged receivable balances 
these percentages are determined by a variety of factors including  but not limited to  current economic trends  historical payment and bad debt write off experience 
we are not able to predict changes in the financial condition of our customers or changes in general economic conditions  and if circumstances related to our customers deteriorate  our estimates of the recoverability of our trade receivables could be materially affected and we may be required to record additional allowances 
alternatively  if we provide more allowances than we need  we may reverse a portion of such provisions in future periods based on our actual collection experience 
see schedule ii of this form k for an analysis of our historic bad debt expense 
inventory valuation and residual values related to leased products we evaluate our inventory levels and valuations based on our estimates and forecasts of the next cyclical industry upturn 
these forecasts require us to estimate our ability to sell current and future products in the next industry upturn and compare those estimates with our current inventory levels 
if these forecasts or estimates change  or our product roadmaps change  then we would need to adjust our assessment of the inventory valuations 
once inventories are written off  we carry that inventory at its reduced value until it is scrapped or otherwise disposed of 
at october   approximately and of the net inventory balances were for our older quartet mixed signal and kalos non volatile memory product families  respectively 
with the recent introduction of the kalos ii  the company intends to continue to review the value of the current kalos i inventory in light of the anticipated product transition to kalos ii 
in particular  the value of the kalos inventory will depend on factors such as the economic condition of the flash memory ic market  product development schedules for the production versions of the kalos ii and ultimately the success of the kalos ii product in the marketplace 
due to the dramatic decline in the semiconductor business cycle and corresponding impact on revenue since early in fiscal and continued uncertainty regarding the timing of the upturn  if any  in semiconductor equipment sales  we continue to monitor our inventory levels in light of product development changes and expectations of an eventual market upturn 
in the third quarter of fiscal  we recorded special charges to cost of goods sold of million due to a legal settlement on cancelled purchase contracts with an inventory vendor and million due to spare parts write offs related to our valstar product line 
we recorded a charge of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal  and charges of million and million in the second and fourth quarters of fiscal  respectively  for the write offs of excess inventories 
we may be required to take additional charges for excess and obsolete inventory if the current industry downturn causes further reductions to our current inventory valuations or our current product development plans change 
residual values assigned to the company s products that are leased to customers are based on their remaining useful economic life at the end of the lease terms 
the amounts assigned to the residual values are evaluated periodically based on technological change and the forecasted business cycle 
long lived asset valuation our long lived assets consist of plant  property and equipment  goodwill and identified intangible assets 
effective november   we adopted statement of financial accounting standard no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  or sfas  which was issued by the fasb in july under this standard  we ceased amortizing goodwill effective november  in addition  on adoption  we reclassified certain intangibles with a net book value of million  consisting of acquired workforce  which is no longer defined as an acquired intangible under sfas to goodwill 
accordingly  there was no amortization of acquired workforce in acquisition costs recognized during fiscal in fiscal  goodwill also increased by approximately million due to our acquisition of optonics  inc see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
we test goodwill for possible impairment on an annual basis and at any other time if events occur or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable 
circumstances that could trigger an impairment test include but are not limited to a significant adverse change in the business climate or legal factors  unanticipated competition  loss of key personnel  a significant change in direction with respect to investment in a product or market segment  the likelihood that a significant portion of the business will be sold or disposed of  or the results of testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit determined in accordance with sfas as mandated by sfas no 
 we completed our first annual goodwill impairment test as of july  and determined that no potential impairment existed as of the end of the third quarter of fiscal as a result  we recognized no impairment loss in fiscal in connection with the adoption of sfas no 
however  no assurances can be given that future evaluations of goodwill will not result in charges as a result of future impairment 
we will continue to evaluate goodwill on an annual basis and at such other times as events and changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may not be recoverable from its estimated future cash flow 
the determination as to whether a write down of goodwill is necessary involves significant judgment based on short term and long term projections of the future performance of the reporting unit to which the goodwill is attributed 
the assumptions supporting the estimated future cash flows of the reporting units  including discount rate used and estimated terminal value reflect our best estimates 
we evaluate the carrying value of our long lived assets  consisting primarily of our facilities  identifiable intangible assets  and property  plant and equipment  whenever certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable 
such events or circumstances include  but are not limited to  a prolonged industry downturn  a significant decline in our market value  or significant reductions in projected future cash flows 
in assessing the recoverability of our long lived assets  we compare the carrying value to the undiscounted future cash flows the assets are expected to generate 
if the total of the undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the assets  we write down such assets based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets 
fair value is generally determined by calculating the discounted future cash flows using a discount rate based upon our weighted average cost of capital 
significant judgments and assumptions are required in the forecast of future operating results used in the preparation of the estimated future cash flows  including profit margins  long term forecasts of the amounts and timing of overall market growth and our percentage of that market  groupings of assets  discount rates and terminal growth rates 
in addition  significant estimates and assumptions are required in the determination of the fair value of our tangible long lived assets  including replacement cost  economic obsolescence  and the value that could be realized in liquidation 
changes in these estimates could have a material adverse effect on the assessment of our long lived assets  thereby requiring us to write down the assets 
we made certain assessments with respect to the determination of all identifiable assets to be used in the business as well as research and development activities as of the acquisition date 
each of these activities was evaluated by both interviews and data analysis to determine our state of development and related fair value 
the purchased intangibles consist of purchased technology  customer relations  trademarks  patents and non compete agreements and they typically have estimated useful lives of two to ten years 
other intangible assets subject to amortization were as follows in thousands october  cost accumulated amortization net purchased technology customer relations trademarks patents non compete agreements total october  cost accumulated amortization net purchased technology customer relations trademarks patents assembled workforce total the change in the other intangible assets between october  and october  was due to additional intangibles associated with the purchase of optonics  inc see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion  as well as the reclassification of million of acquired workforce  which is no longer defined as an acquired intangible asset under sfas  to goodwill 
amortization expense for the other intangible assets was million for fiscal estimated annual amortization expense for the other intangible assets will be million for the fiscal year ending october   million for the fiscal year ending october   million for the fiscal year ending october   and million cumulatively for the fiscal years ending october  and thereafter 
warranty accrual we provide reserves for the estimated costs of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
we estimate the costs of our warranty obligations based on our historical experience of known product failure rates  use of materials to repair or replace defective products and service delivery costs incurred in correcting product failures 
in addition  from time to time  specific warranty accruals may be made if unforeseen technical problems arise 
should our actual experience relative to these factors differ from our estimates  we may be required to record additional warranty reserves 
alternatively  if we provide more reserves than we need  we may reverse a portion of such provisions in future periods 
the following table represents the activity in the warranty accrual for the twelve months ended october  in thousands balance at october  add accruals for warranties issued during the period acquired pre existing warranty obligations less warranty spending balance at october  deferred taxes when we prepare our consolidated financial statements  we calculate our income taxes based on the various jurisdictions where we conduct business 
this requires us to estimate our actual current tax exposure and to assess temporary differences that result from differing treatment of certain items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which we show on our consolidated balance sheet 
the net deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if  based upon available evidence  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
our net deferred tax asset balance as of october  was subject to a full valuation allowance due to uncertainties surrounding our ability to generate future taxable income and our corresponding ability to utilize our deferred tax assets 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
special charges the current accounting for restructuring costs requires us to record provisions and charges when we have a formal and committed restructuring plan 
in connection with restructuring activities  we recorded estimated special charges in our operating expenses for severance and facility consolidations of approximately million in the first quarter of fiscal and million in the third quarter of fiscal in addition  we recorded special charges to cost of sales of million in the third quarter of fiscal due to a million settlement reached with an inventory supplier relating to cancelled purchase orders and million for spare part write offs associated with our valstar product line 
given the significance of  and the timing of the execution of such activities  this process is complex and involves periodic reassessments of original estimates 
we continually evaluate the adequacy of the remaining liabilities under our restructuring initiatives and other special charges 
although we believe that these estimates accurately reflect the costs of our restructuring and other plans  actual results may differ  thereby requiring us to record additional provisions or reverse a portion of such provisions 
results of operations in august  we completed a merger with ims 
this transaction was accounted for as a pooling of interests and  therefore  the consolidated financial statements as of october  and for the year then ended  were restated as if the merger took place at the beginning of such period 
the following table sets forth certain operating data as a percentage of net sales for the fiscal years indicated fiscal years ended october  net sales cost of goods sold on net sales cost of goods sold special charges gross margin operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative amortization of purchased intangible assets in process research and development special charges total operating expenses operating income loss net income loss vs 
net sales 
net sales consist of revenues from systems sales  upgrades  spare parts sales  maintenance contracts  lease and rental income and software sales 
net sales increased  primarily due to the million in net sales derived from the products obtained in our acquisitions of optonics and sz  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal international net sales accounted for approximately and of total net sales in fiscal and  respectively 
our net sales to the asia pacific region accounted for approximately and of total net sales in fiscal and  respectively  and thus are subject to the risk of economic instability in that region that materially adversely affected the demand for our products in and early capital markets in korea and other areas of asia have been historically highly volatile  resulting in economic instabilities 
these instabilities may reoccur which could materially adversely affect demand for our products 
in addition  the economic impact of geopolitical instabilities on the korean peninsula as well as recurrence the severe acute respiratory syndrome health risks in the asian region may affect future orders to this region and the timing of or payment for shipments made to this region 
our net sales by product line in fiscal and consisted of digital mixed signal memory service emission based optical probers software and other total revenues from software were not material to our operations in fiscal and  representing less than of our net sales in each respective period 
operating lease and rental revenues were and of our net sales in fiscal and  respectively 
gross margin 
our gross margin has been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors  including manufacturing efficiencies  excess and obsolete inventory write offs  sell through of previously written off inventory  pricing by competitors or suppliers  new product introductions  product sales mix  production volume  customization and reconfiguration of systems  international and domestic sales mix  special charges  and field service margins 
our gross margin as a percentage of net sales increased to in fiscal from in fiscal the million increase in fiscal gross margins from fiscal levels primarily reflects the effect of special charges in fiscal cost of sales related to a million legal settlement with an inventory supplier and million spare part write offs in our valstar product line compared to million of write offs of excess inventories in fiscal see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the excess inventory write offs were recorded as a result of our response to a major downturn in the business outlook for the ate and related semiconductor equipment industries that began in fiscal and continued through fiscal we expect gross margins to improve for the foreseeable future primarily due to sales of a mix of higher gross margin products and better manufacturing efficiencies resulting from higher business levels 
research and development 
research and development  or r d  expenses as a percentage of net sales were and  in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
r d expenses decreased in absolute dollars to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  reflecting restructuring actions affecting r d taken during the fourth quarter of fiscal and first and third quarter of fiscal when compared to during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we reduced our headcount by approximately persons 
of this total  approximately were in r d 
in the first quarter of fiscal the company reduced the headcount by a further persons most of which were in sg a functions and a small number in r d 
in the third quarter of fiscal the company reduced the head count by a further persons  of which approximately were in r d functions 
these headcount reductions reduced our r d expenses by approximately million 
in addition  during fiscal the completion of the evaluation periods for several new products introduced during fiscal including the octet and asl resulted in less non recurring engineering nre expenses associated with the development of those products 
these savings were partially offset by the ongoing investment in new products and r d expenses associated with the products obtained in the acquisitions of optonics and sz in early fiscal the sz and optonics acquisitions added a total of approximately employees to the company  of which about percent perform r d 
the r d expenses associated with the acquired products represented approximately million of the r d expenses in fiscal we currently intend to continue to invest significant resources in the development and completion of new products and product enhancements 
accordingly  we anticipate that r d expenses will remain significant in absolute dollar terms and as a percentage of net sales in fiscal selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses  or sg a  increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  an increase of 
the slightly higher sg a spending in fiscal was primarily due to added sg a expenses of approximately million from the optonics and sz acquisitions and accelerated depreciation of million for leasehold improvements and other fixed assets related to buildings we planned on vacating in the first quarter of fiscal when we moved to our new headquarters offset by decreases in payroll related expenses resulting from a lower headcount and ongoing operating expense management 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we reduced our headcount by approximately persons 
of this total  approximately were in sg a functions 
in the first quarter of fiscal the company reduced the headcount by a further persons most of which were in sg a functions and a small number in r d 
in the third quarter of fiscal the company reduced the head count by a further persons  of which approximately were in sg a functions 
the sz and optonics acquisitions added a total of approximately employees to the company 
as a percentage of net sales  sg a expenses were and in fiscal and fiscal  respectively  reflecting the increase in business levels 
we expect sg a expenses for fiscal to be flat to slightly higher in absolute dollars when compared to those recorded in fiscal amortization of goodwill and purchased intangibles 
amortization of goodwill and purchased intangible expenses decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  a decrease of 
this decline was primarily the result of adopting sfas goodwill and other intangible assets as of november  the adoption of sfas reduced the annual amortization expense by approximately million 
under sfas  goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are no longer amortized  but are reviewed annually or more frequently under certain circumstances for impairment 
amortization of purchased intangibles increased by approximately million on an annual basis beginning in the second quarter of fiscal due to the acquisition of optonics in january in process research and development and special charges 
in january  we relocated our corporate headquarters to our owned facilities in milpitas  california and vacated our previously leased buildings in fremont  california 
the lease for three of the buildings expired around december  we will attempt to sublease the final building  consisting of  square feet 
this lease expires in june the company estimates the above actions will result in a restructuring charge during the first quarter of fiscal of approximately million 
during the third fiscal quarter of  we recorded restructuring charges of approximately million as operating expenses related to headcount reductions 
the reduction in force included the elimination of approximately positions or percent of the company s worldwide employee base 
the majority of these positions were in the r d function 
in the first quarter of fiscal  we recorded a restructure charge of approximately million for severance charges  and a lease write off that was included in operating expenses 
these charges were associated with headcount reductions and the completion of the consolidation of our ims facility in beaverton  oregon into our hillsboro  oregon site 
during the first fiscal quarter of fiscal  we reduced our headcount by approximately persons 
the bulk of the affected employees were in sg a functions and a smaller number were in r d 
in addition  we also recorded a charge of million in the first quarter of fiscal for the write off of in process research and development resulting from the purchase of optonics 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for discussion of the optonics purchase price allocation 
the charge was recorded as an operating expense 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded charges of approximately million  consisting of million  million  and million for severance charges  asset disposals  and lease write offs  respectively  which were included in operating expenses 
these charges were associated with headcount reductions and facility consolidations we implemented in the fourth fiscal quarter 
during the fourth fiscal quarter of  we reduced our headcount by approximately persons 
of this total  approximately were in manufacturing  were in r d and about were in sg a functions 
as part of this reduction we discontinued our next generation dram ims product and closed the associated ims facilities in switzerland and germany 
we exited the ims facility in beaverton  oregon and consolidated these employees into our facility in hillsboro  oregon 
approximately million of this charge required cash during the quarter  million will require cash over the remaining lease terms of which million was paid out in cash during fiscal year and the remaining million was non cash write offs 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
we wrote off notes receivable in the fourth fiscal quarter of by approximately million 
these impairment charges were due to the decline in the fair value of the notes receivable and were judged to be other than temporary 
the write offs of these individual notes receivable consisted of a million promissory note issued by credence capital corporation  or ccc  then owned  controlled and managed by the garrett capital group  an unaffiliated party  and a million promissory note from a customer issued in april as the result of a settlement on outstanding receivables 
the timing of these write offs was largely driven by the continuation of the downtown experienced by the semiconductor equipment industry during in the case of ccc  formerly a non affiliated company that provided lease  structured financing and other financing alternatives to our customers  its continued financial weakness ultimately resulted in our decision to pursue control of ccc 
this acquisition occurred in february in the case of the customer s promissory note  the customer s principal venture capital investor threatened to initiate bankruptcy proceedings and we wrote off this note as part of a restructured settlement on existing equipment leases 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded a charge totaling million associated with the impairment of the goodwill and intangible assets obtained in the acquisition of dci in january the charge consisted of million for the remaining intangible assets related to customer lists and million for remaining goodwill 
this impairment was based on the planned sale of the subsidiary to its management team effective november  dci had been integrated into our memory products line at the height of the last business cycle in january the economic advantage of maintaining the capabilities of dci diminished as the operating results deteriorated dramatically with the onset of this current downturn 
in addition  it became evident that it was unlikely the memory products business volume would increase to a level where the operational advantages of dci would be fully realized 
interest income 
we generated interest income of million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
the decline in fiscal was primarily due to lower average interest rates in fiscal as well as a declining investment balance throughout the fiscal years until june when we completed our convertible subordinated notes offering 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
interest and other expenses 
interest and other expenses increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the expense in fiscal is primarily attributable to million of interest and million of loan origination expenses related to the convertible subordinated notes that we issued in june  million of other interest expenses  million in net losses on sales of fixed assets  offset by a million gain on the sale of a publicly traded equity security held as an available for sale investment 
in  we incurred a million write down of a publicly traded equity security held as an available for sale investment due to the decline in the fair value of this investment that was judged to be other than temporary 
income taxes 
we recorded an income tax provision of million and million for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the income tax expense in consists of foreign tax on earnings and foreign withholding taxes generated from our foreign operations 
we expect to record a full valuation allowance on domestic tax benefits until we can reliably forecast future profitability 
until such time  we would not expect to recognize any significant tax benefits in our results of operations 
our effective tax rate was for fiscal and for fiscal for fiscal and  the effective tax rate was greater than the expected federal statutory tax benefit rate of primarily due to the establishment of a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets 
vs 
net sales 
net sales consist of revenues from system sales  upgrades  spare parts sales  maintenance contracts  lease and rental income  and software sales 
net sales decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal our net sales decreased from million in the first quarter of fiscal to million in the fourth quarter of fiscal during fiscal  our net sales remained relatively low due in significant part to the cyclical downturn in the semiconductor industry that is in sharp contrast to the quarterly increases in fiscal international net sales accounted for approximately and of total net sales in fiscal and  respectively 
our net sales to the asia pacific region accounted for approximately and of total net sales in fiscal and  respectively  and thus are subject to the risk of economic instability in that region that materially adversely affected the demand for our products in capital markets in korea and other areas of asia have been highly volatile  resulting from economic and geopolitical instabilities 
these instabilities may reoccur which could materially adversely affect demand for our products 
our net sales by product line in fiscal and consisted of mixed signal digital memory service and software total revenues from software were not material to our operations in fiscal and  representing less than of our net sales in each respective period 
gross margin 
our net gross margin as a percentage of net sales increased to in fiscal from in fiscal the increase in fiscal over fiscal is principally due to the million write off of excess inventories recorded during fiscal compared to million in fiscal see note to the consolidated financial statements 
these charges were recorded as a result of our response to a major downturn in the business outlook for the ate and related semiconductor and semiconductor equipment industries in fiscal and continuing through fiscal excluding the effect of the write offs  the lower gross margins in fiscal were primarily attributed to lower manufacturing absorption resulting from the lower business levels in as well as lower average selling prices during fiscal research and development 
research and development expenses as a percentage of net sales were and  in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
r d expenses decreased in absolute dollars to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  reflecting decreased spending in the development of new products  and enhancements of existing product lines 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative  or sg a  expenses decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  a decrease of 
the lower spending in fiscal in absolute dollars was primarily due to lower headcount  salary reductions and lower commission expenses 
in february the company reduced its headcount by approximately or about persons  in may the company reduced its headcount by approximately or about persons  and in august the company reduced its headcount by approximately or about persons 
these reductions were primarily in the manufacturing and sg a functions 
as a percentage of net sales  sg a expenses were in fiscal compared to in fiscal  reflecting the decrease in business levels 
amortization of purchased goodwill and intangible assets 
amortization of purchased goodwill and intangible asset expenses decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  a decrease of 
the decline was primarily attributable to the year end write off in fiscal of the nms goodwill and intangible assets which resulted in an annual decline of approximately million in amortization expenses as well end of life of other intangible assets 
special charges 
we wrote off notes receivable in the fourth fiscal quarter of by approximately million 
these impairment charges were due to the decline in the fair value of these notes receivable and were judged to be other than temporary 
the write off of these individual notes receivable consisted of a million promissory note issued by credence capital corporation  or ccc  then owned  controlled and managed by the garrett capital group  an unaffiliated party  and a million promissory note from a customer issued in april as the result of a settlement on outstanding receivables 
the timing of these write offs was largely driven by the continuation of the downtown experienced by the semiconductor equipment industry during in the case of ccc  formerly a non affiliated company that provided lease  structured financing  and other financing alternatives to our customers  its continued financial weakness ultimately resulted in our decision to pursue control of ccc 
this acquisition occurred in february in the case of the customer s promissory note  the customer s principal venture capital investor threatened to initiate bankruptcy proceedings and we wrote off this note as part of a restructured settlement on existing equipment leases 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded a charge totaling million associated with the impairment of the goodwill and intangible assets obtained in the acquisition of dci in january the charge consisted of million for the remaining intangible assets related to customer lists and million for remaining goodwill 
this impairment was based on the planned sale of the subsidiary to its management team effective november  dci had been integrated into our memory products line at the height of the last business cycle in january the economic advantage of maintaining the capabilities of dci diminished as the operating results deteriorated dramatically with the onset of this current downturn 
in addition  it became evident that it was unlikely the memory products business volume would increase to a level where the operational advantages of dci would be fully realized 
in the second and third quarters of fiscal we recorded charges of approximately million related to fees and expenses associated with the acquisition of ims 
an additional million was recorded in the fourth quarter for the closing of the ims transaction and the integration of its operations with credence and our subsidiary  fluence 
this charge included the write down of million of goodwill and purchased technology intangible assets of opmaxx 
the impairment was recorded based on product decisions for the newly combined operations of fluence and ims 
the elements of the ims acquisition charges are as follows in thousands fees and expenses write down of tangible and intangible assets lease and liability accruals employee termination benefits in the fourth quarter of fiscal we recorded a million charge for the impairment of the remaining intangible assets associated with the acquisition of nms in october the impairment consisted of million in purchased technology  million in patents  and million in goodwill 
this impairment was based on significant nms employee turnover in fiscal as well as a change in the technological direction of the remaining research and development project that originated in nms 
the product originally under development at nms was abandoned and there are no current activities associated with nms 
restructuring charges 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal we recorded charges of approximately million  consisting of million  million  and million for severance charges  asset disposals  and lease write offs  respectively  which was included in operating expenses 
these charges were associated with headcount reductions and facility consolidations we implemented in the fourth quarter of fiscal during the fourth fiscal quarter of  we reduced our headcount by approximately persons 
of this total  approximately were in manufacturing  were in r d and about were in sg a 
as part of this reduction we discontinued our next generation dram ims product and closed the associated ims facilities in switzerland and germany 
we exited the ims facility in beaverton  oregon and consolidated these employees into our facility in hillsboro  oregon 
approximately million of this charge required cash during the quarter  million will require cash over the remaining lease terms and the remaining million were non cash write downs 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in the second quarter of fiscal  we recorded a charge of approximately million for severance payments and asset disposals associated with headcount reductions we implemented in february these charges were recorded as a result of our response to a major downturn in the business outlook for the ate and related semiconductor and semiconductor equipment industries in in the third quarter of fiscal we recorded a further million for severance payments and asset disposals associated with headcount reductions we implemented in may and august in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded an additional million for headcount reductions 
we reduced headcount by more than people during the fiscal year across all functional areas 
severance payments were distributed during the year and the remaining accruals at october  were not significant 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded a million charge for the abandonment of the former tmt facility in sunnyvale  california as these operations were integrated into our fremont  california facilities 
this charge consisted of in estimated future rental payments to be paid through february and million for asset and leasehold improvement write downs 
interest income 
we generated interest income of million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
the decline in fiscal was primarily due to lower average interest rates in fiscal combined with lower average cash balances when compared to fiscal interest and other expenses 
interest and other expenses increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the higher expense in fiscal is primarily attributable to the million write down of a publicly traded equity security held as an available for sale investment 
this charge was due to the decline in the fair value of this investment and was judged to be other than temporary 
income tax 
our effective tax rate was for fiscal the effective tax rate was greater than the expected federal statutory tax benefit rate of primarily due to the establishment of a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets 
our effective tax benefit rate was for fiscal the effective tax benefit rate was less than the combined federal and state statutory rate primarily due to non deductible goodwill amortization 
liquidity and capital resources in fiscal  the net cash outflows from operating activities was million 
the net cash flows used by operating activities for fiscal were primarily attributable to a net loss before depreciation and amortization of million offset by cash provided through reductions in net working capital 
investing activities used net cash of approximately million in fiscal resulting primarily from the net purchases of available for sale securities of million plus approximately million for the acquisition of sz assets  and million for the structural and tenant improvements of our new milpitas headquarters and other property and equipment to support our business 
financing activities provided net cash flows of million in fiscal the cash in fiscal was primarily provided by million net proceeds from the issuance of convertible notes in the third quarter of fiscal and the million issuance of our treasury and common stock relating to our employee equity plans during the year 
these cash receipts were offset by the payments of liabilities related to leased products of million 
as of october   we had working capital of approximately million  including cash and short term investments of million  and accounts receivable and inventories totaling million 
we believe that because of the relatively long manufacturing cycles of many of our testers and the new products we presently offer and plan to introduce  investments in inventories will also continue to represent a significant portion of our working capital 
the semiconductor industry has historically been highly cyclical and has experienced downturns  which have had a material adverse effect on the semiconductor industry s demand for automatic test equipment  including equipment manufactured and marketed by us 
in addition  the automatic test equipment industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change 
it is reasonably possible that events related to these factors may occur in the near term which would cause a change to our estimate of the net realizable value of receivables  inventories or other assets  and the adequacy of accrued liabilities 
see discussion of critical accounting policies and estimates 
we believe our current cash and investment positions combined with the ability to borrow funds will be sufficient to meet our anticipated business requirements for the next months and foreseeable future  including potential acquisitions or strategic investments  capital expenditures  and working capital requirements 
in december  we completed the acquisition of certain assets of sz  located in amerang  germany  for approximately million in cash 
in january  we acquired optonics  inc headquartered in mountain view  california for approximately million in an all stock transaction 
in february  we acquired certain assets and liabilities of ccc  a non related leasing company 
the assets of ccc consisted primarily of a portfolio of leases of our equipment and its liabilities included indebtedness of approximately million associated with the lease portfolio 
we operate ccc as a wholly owned subsidiary to provide leasing and other financing solutions to our customers 
see note to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
in august  we acquired certain assets and liabilities of sz testsysteme japan limited  a distributor of automotive test equipment  for approximately million of cash 
the acquisition will provide a distribution channel to japanese customers for our existing products focused primarily on the japanese automotive test market 
we lease our facilities and equipment under operating leases that expire periodically through of which approximately million have been written off to special operating charges this fiscal year 
the approximate future minimum lease payments at october  are as follows in thousands committed gross lease payments leases written off in special charges net estimated future lease expense to the following summarizes the company s minimum contractual cash obligations and other commitments at october   and the effect of such obligations in future periods in thousands total thereafter contractual obligations facilities and equipment operating leases liabilities related to leased products interest on liabilities related to leased products convertible subordinated notes interest on convertible subordinated notes minimum payable for information technology open non cancelable purchase order commitments total contractual cash and other obligations some of the components that the company purchases are unique to the company and must be purchased in relatively high minimum quantities with long four and five month lead times 
these business circumstances can lead to the company holding relatively high inventory levels and associated risks 
in addition  purchase commitments for unique components are relatively inflexible in terms of deferral or cancellation 
in addition to the above lease commitments  at october   we have open and committed purchase orders totaling approximately million 
net transfer of inventory to property and equipment was million 
mature product spare parts that are used in the company s service business are classified as property and equipment 
in addition  the company capitalizes a small number of finished systems into the manufacturing function for use in de bug  quality control  and software development as well as the sales function for use in demonstrations and application development 
when capitalized spare parts and finished goods are sold to third parties the transaction is recorded as a sale of a fixed asset 
as of october   our principal sources of liquidity consisted of approximately million of cash and cash equivalents  and short term investments of million 
in addition  we had million of available for sale securities  classified as long term investments at october  recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standard no 
 business combinations  or sfas and statement of financial accounting standard no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  or sfas sfas supersedes apb opinion no 
 business combinations  and eliminates the pooling of interests method of accounting for business combinations  thus requiring that all business combinations be accounted for using the purchase method 
in addition  in applying the purchase method  sfas changes the criteria for recognizing intangible assets other than goodwill and states that the following criteria should be considered in determining the classification of intangible assets whether the intangible asset arises from contractual or other legal rights  or whether the intangible asset is separable or dividable from the acquired entity and capable of being sold  transferred  licensed  rented  or exchanged 
if neither criteria is met  the intangible assets are classified as goodwill and are not amortized 
we applied the requirements of sfas to all business combinations initiated after june  our purchase of optonics during the quarter ended january   was subject to these requirements 
sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  make use of the concept of reporting units 
all acquisitions must be assigned to a reporting unit or units 
reporting units have been defined under the standards to be the same as or one level below an operating segment  as defined in sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
a reporting unit would be one level below the operating segment if a component of an operating segment is a business as described under us gaap and is a separable unit that engages in business activities for which discrete financial information is available  has economic characteristics different from other components of the operating segment  and operating results of the component are reviewed regularly by the segment manager 
assets and liabilities will be allocated to each reporting unit if the asset will be employed in  or the liability relates to  the operation of a reporting unit or the asset or liability will be considered in determining the fair value of the reporting unit 
goodwill should be allocated to the reporting units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination 
to the extent that a reporting unit s carrying amount exceeds its fair value  an indication exists that the reporting unit s goodwill may be impaired 
under sfas no 
 we stated in our prior form k for fiscal that we operated in two industry segments the design  development  manufacture  sale and service of automatic test equipment or ate and the design  development  sale and service of software that assists in the development of test programs used in ate 
revenues from the software segment were not material to the company s operations in fiscal years and during  the software segment was significantly decreased in size and the remaining software operations were merged with the ate segment 
currently we operate in just one industry segment  ate 
we also have a single reporting unit  ate  primarily because all of the components of our ate segment are subject to similar economic characteristics 
in addition  all our products have common production processes  customers  and product life cycles 
total goodwill amortization expense  including impairments  was million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal we adopted the remaining elements of this new standard in the first quarter of fiscal and therefore ceased goodwill amortization for acquisitions made prior to july  as of the date of adoption of sfas on november   we had an unamortized acquired intangible assets balance of approximately million excluding the balance of approximately  for acquired workforce reclassified to goodwill 
as of that date  we also had an unamortized goodwill balance of approximately million 
in the quarter ended april   we completed the first step of the transitional goodwill impairment test and determined that no potential impairment existed as of october  the first step is a review for potential impairment  while the second step measures the amount of the impairment  if any 
we engaged an outside professional appraiser to evaluate goodwill to complete our annual impairment test and as of the end of the third quarter of fiscal  we again determined that no potential impairment exists 
to complete the impairment test  we identified our reporting units and determined the carrying value for each of them by assigning asset and liabilities  including existing goodwill and intangible assets  to those reporting units 
we then determined the fair value of each reporting unit and compared it to the reporting unit s carrying value 
to the extent that a reporting unit s carrying amount exceeds its fair value  an indication exists that the reporting unit s goodwill may be impaired and we must perform the second step of the transitional impairment test 
in the second step  if required  we must compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill to its carrying amount 
as a result of our completed impairment tests  we recognized no impairment loss in fiscal in connection with the adoption of sfas no 
however  no assurances can be given that future evaluations of goodwill will not result in charges as a result of future impairment 
we will continue to evaluate goodwill at least on an annual basis and whenever events and changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may not be recoverable from its estimated future cash flow

accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  or sfas sfas supersedes sfas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and long lived assets to be disposed of and the accounting and reporting provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions  for the disposal of a segment of a business 
sfas establishes a single accounting model for assets to be disposed of by sale whether previously held and used or newly acquired 
sfas no 
retains the provisions of apb no 
for presentation of discontinued operations in the income statement  but broadens the presentation to include a component of an entity 
we have adopted sfas effective november  in the quarter ended july   in accordance with sfas no 
 we accelerated the depreciation remaining for leasehold improvements related to buildings located in fremont  california that we plan on vacating in the first quarter of fiscal when we move to our new headquarters in milpitas  california 
the amount of the accelerated depreciation related to these leasehold improvements was approximately million and is being recognized over the three fiscal quarters ending january  accelerated depreciation related to the leasehold improvements is classified in sg a expense 
in july  the fasb approved statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  or sfas sfas addresses the financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with an exit activity  including restructuring  or with a disposal of long lived assets 
exit activities include  but are not limited to  eliminating or reducing product lines  terminating employees and contracts and relocating manufacturing facilities or personnel 
sfas specifies that a company will record a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity only when that liability is incurred and can be measured at fair value 
therefore  commitment to an exit plan or a plan of disposal expresses only management s intended future actions and  therefore  does not meet the requirement for recognizing a liability and the related expense 
sfas is effective prospectively for exit or disposal activities initiated after december  our severance and related costs recorded in the quarter ended july  were recorded in accordance with sfas in november  the eitf reached a consensus on issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
eitf issue no 
provides guidance on how to account for arrangements that involve the delivery or performance of multiple products  services and or rights to use assets 
the provisions of eitf issue no 
apply to revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june  the adoption of this eitf has not had a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition since we are able to separate multiple deliverables from one another and we recognize revenue for each deliverable  based on each deliverable s fair value  when the revenue recognition criteria for that specific deliverable is achieved 
in order to comply with eitf  beginning in our fourth quarter of fiscal  revenue of approximately  was deferred for the value of installation services not completed at the end of the quarter 
in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities 
fin addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities 
under that interpretation  certain entities known as variable interest entities vies must be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity 
the primary beneficiary is generally defined as having the majority of the risks and rewards arising from the vie 
for vies in which a significant but not majority variable interest is held  certain disclosures are required 
we have not entered into any arrangements or made any investments which qualify as a vie after january  and therefore the initial implementation of fin had no impact on our financial statements 
for vies acquired before february   we are required to apply the accounting and disclosure rules set forth in fin in the first quarter of fiscal we have determined that the adoption of fin will not have any impact on our financial position or results of operations
