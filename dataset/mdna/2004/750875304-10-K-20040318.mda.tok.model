item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this report contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of actual events and or future results of operations may differ materially from those contemplated by such forward looking statements  as a result of the factors described here  and in the documents incorporated herein by reference  including  in particular  those factors described under factors that may affect future results and market price of stock 
overview in the following discussion   and refer to the years ended december   and  respectively 
we are a leading outsource provider of sales and marketing programs for service contracts 
our cost effective programs generate service revenue and promote customer retention for our clients 
core services include professional telesales  direct marketing  and hosted ecommerce 
additional services include customer database enhancement  crm technology integration  and order management 
these services are available individually or as an integrated solution 
we incurred operating losses and net losses for  and in the second half of and continuing through  we refocused on our core service contracts business and profitable client relationships 
the portion of our net revenues from sales of our core service contracts increased to and in and  respectively  from in in addition  in the second half of  we implemented a restructuring program to streamline our operations and reduce our operating expenses 
as part of these restructuring activities  we reduced headcount and wrote off abandoned facilities  property and equipment 
in connection with these actions  we recorded restructuring and other related charges of million in during and  we recorded recoveries of restructuring and other related charges of  and  respectively  resulting from lower than anticipated employee severance and legal costs  and a reduction in the lease term for our unoccupied facility 
as a result of the focus on our core service contracts business and restructuring activities  we have been able to increase our gross profit at a greater rate than the increase in underlying operating expenses 
our gross profit increased in as compared to at the same time  our other operating expenses in total grew by only 
if the restructuring and other related recoveries in each of those years are excluded  the operating expenses in grew by only over our business primarily consists of marketing and selling our clients products and services to their customers 
in addition  most of our revenue is derived from a pay for performance model in which our revenue is based on the amount of our clients products and services that we sell 
accordingly  if a particular client s products and services fail to appeal to its customers for reasons beyond our control  such as preference for a competing product or service  our revenue from the sale of the client s products and services may decline 
new clients may require us to make significant up front investments including hiring additional staff and creating the necessary infrastructure to deliver our services 
these costs are typically incurred some time before significant revenue is generated 
we charge for certain of these costs  however  these costs could have an adverse effect on our future financial condition and operating results  depending on market acceptance of new service combinations and pricing options 
in  we discontinued marketing and selling certain clients products and services 
as a result of this as well as the unfavorable economic conditions in the united states  our net revenue has  and may continue to  decline 
if the economic conditions in the united states worsen or if a wider or global economic slowdown 
table of contents occurs  we may experience a material adverse impact on our business  operating results  and financial condition 
during unfavorable economic periods  it may be more difficult to sign new clients or expand relationships with existing clients 
in addition  during unfavorable economic periods  spending on existing and new technology may decrease  resulting in downgrades of service contracts or fewer new service contracts  which may have a material adverse impact on our business 
this impact may be offset as technology companies may compensate for decreased spending on new technology and technology upgrades with more robust service contracts on their existing technology 
terrorist acts or acts of war wherever located around the world may cause damage or disruption to our facilities  employees  clients or clients customers 
the potential for future terrorist attacks  the national and international response to terrorist attacks or perceived threats to national security  and other acts of war or hostility have created many uncertainties that could adversely affect our business or results of operations in ways that cannot presently be predicted 
our quarterly operating results may continue to fluctuate in the future based on a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
we believe that period to period comparisons of operating results should not be relied upon as predictive of future performance 
our operating results are expected to vary significantly from quarter to quarter and are difficult to predict 
our historical revenue has tended to fluctuate based on seasonal buying patterns of our clients and their customers 
our prospects must be considered in light of the risks  expenses and difficulties encountered by technology companies  particularly given that we operate in new and rapidly evolving markets  and face an uncertain economic environment 
we may not be successful in addressing such risks and difficulties 
see factors that may affect future results and market price of stock 
critical accounting policies estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and all known facts and circumstances that we believe are relevant and assumptions as to future events 
actual results may differ from our estimates 
our significant accounting polices are described in note to financial statements 
the significant accounting policies that we believe are critical  either because they relate to financial statement line items that are key indicators of our financial performance eg  revenue and or because their application requires significant management judgment  are described in the following paragraphs 
management has discussed the development of our critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors and they have reviewed the disclosures of such policies and management s estimates in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
revenue recognition and presentation revenue from the sale of service contracts and maintenance renewals is recognized when a purchase order from the client s customer is received  the service contract or maintenance agreement is delivered  the fee is fixed or determinable  the collection of the receivable is reasonably assured  and no significant post delivery obligations remain unfulfilled 
revenue from product sales is recognized at the time of shipment of the product directly to the client s customer 
revenue from services we perform is recognized as the services are accepted 
revenue from fee based activities  such as customized integration and development  is recognized once these services have been delivered 
a substantial amount of our sales transactions are reported based on the gross amount we bill to our client s customers for products and services since we take title and assume risk of loss for products and service contracts sold  we can sell the products or service contracts at prices we determine  and we assume the full credit risk for the products and service contracts 
however  we also sell products and services on behalf of our clients whereby  based on the evaluation of the specific facts and circumstances  we record revenue equal to the net amount that we earn in the transaction 
the difference between our gross billings  a measurement 
table of contents of the total volume of products and serviced billed by us to our clients customers  and our net revenue reported in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap was million  million  and million for   and  respectively 
the aspects of our revenue recognition policy that involve significant judgments and estimates include the following gross versus net presentation we evaluate each arrangement with our clients to determine whether we should report revenue as the gross amount billed to our client s customer versus the net amount earned in the transaction 
in determining whether to report revenue at the gross amount or net amount  we evaluate the existence of specific indicators as provided in the financial accounting standards board s emerging issues task force issue no 
 reporting revenue gross as a principle versus net as an agent 
the primary indicators include  but are not limited to  whether the vendor is the primary obligor in the transaction  whether the vendor assumes general inventory risk  whether the vendor has latitude for setting the pricing for the goods or services it sells to its customers  and whether the vendor bears credit risk in the transaction 
the evaluation of the indicators involves significant management judgment 
to the extent that facts or circumstances change  our conclusion as to whether to report revenue at the gross amount or net amount may change  which could have a significant impact on our reported net revenues  although it would not impact our gross billings  net income loss  financial position or cash flows 
collectibility we assess the probability of collection based on a number of factors  including past transaction history and or the creditworthiness of our clients customers  which is based on current published credit ratings  current events and circumstances regarding the business of our client s customer and other factors that we believe are relevant 
if we determine that collection is not reasonably assured  we defer revenue recognition until such time as collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of cash payment 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our clients customers to make required payments of amounts due to us 
the allowance is comprised of specifically identified account balances for which collection is currently deemed doubtful 
in addition to specifically identified accounts  estimates of amounts that may not be collectible from those accounts whose collection is not yet deemed doubtful but which may become doubtful in the future are made based on historical bad debt write off experience 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
the allowance for doubtful accounts at december  and was  and  respectively 
impairment of long lived assets we review all of our long lived assets  including fixed assets  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include  but are not limited to  significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  a significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and a significant change in our market capitalization relative to our net book value 
an asset or a group of assets is determined to be impaired if the estimated future undiscounted net cash flows attributable to the asset or group of assets are less than their carrying value 
if impairment exists  it is measured as the difference between the carrying value of the asset or group of assets and their estimated fair values 
fair values are determined using third party valuations  discounted cash flow analyses or other generally accepted methods 
estimating future cash flows attributable to a particular asset or group of assets is difficult  and requires the use of significant judgment 

table of contents during  we recorded a charge of million  relating to the write off of abandoned property and equipment as part of the restructuring program 
such assets included internally developed software and other property and equipment for which the future cash flows were estimated to be zero  based on the termination of certain client relationships and the abandonment of certain facilities 
see note of notes to financial statements 
restructuring and other related charges during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we implemented a restructuring program to focus and streamline our business and reduce operating expenses 
in connection with this program  we reduced headcount and abandoned facilities 
as a result of these actions  we recorded restructuring and other related charges consisting of cash severance payments to be made to severed employees  lease payments related to property abandoned as a result of our facilities consolidation  and legal and other costs 
each reporting period  we review these estimates based on the status of execution of our restructuring plan and  to the extent that these assumptions change due to changes in market conditions and our business  the ultimate restructuring expenses could vary 
as of december   our restructuring actions related to employee severance  legal and other costs were complete and we had no remaining obligations related to such activities 
during and  we recorded recoveries of restructuring and other related charges of  and  respectively  resulting from lower than anticipated employee severance and legal costs  and a reduction in the lease term for our unoccupied facility 
all cash expenditures related to our restructuring liability were disbursed as of december  use of estimates the preparation of the financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to establish accounting policies that contain estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to bad debts  investments  commissions and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
these policies that contain estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statement and accompanying notes include revenue recognition  the allowance for doubtful accounts  and impairment of long lived assets 
we have other equally important accounting policies and practices  however  once adopted  these other policies either generally do not require us to make significant estimates or assumptions or otherwise only require implementation of the adopted policy not a judgment as to the application of policy itself 
despite our intention to establish accurate estimates and assumptions  actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
concentrations we generated a significant portion of our net revenues from the marketing and selling of products and services for a limited number of clients 
in  sales to customers of hp  sybase and nortel each accounted for more than of our net revenues

we have outsource services agreements with our clients that expire at various dates ranging from march to september many of our client agreements contain automatic renewal clauses 
these clients may  however  terminate their contracts for cause in accordance with the provisions of each contract 
in most cases  a client must provide us with advance written notice of its intention to terminate 
we expect that a small number of clients will continue to account for a significant portion of our net revenue and gross billings 
in addition  our technology clients operate in industries that are experiencing consolidation  which may reduce the number of our existing and potential clients 
financial statement categories net services revenue consists of sales of our clients hardware and software support and service contracts  licenses and license upgrades to our clients customer base 
most of our revenue is based on a pay for performance model in which we generate revenue only when we complete the sale of our clients products and services 
a substantial amount of our sales transactions are reported based on the gross amount we bill to our clients customers for products and services  since we take title and assume risk of loss for products and services we sell  we sell the products or service contracts at prices we determined  and we assume the full credit risk for the products and service contracts 
however  we also sell products and services on behalf of our clients whereby  based on the evaluation of the specific facts and circumstances  we record revenue equal to the net amount we earn in the transaction 
cost of revenue includes payments for our clients products and services that we sell based on the specific pricing terms of each contract and costs associated with fee based revenues 
costs associated with fee based revenues consist primarily of salaries and other personnel related expenses 
some client relationships may be structured such that the costs of these products and services may be higher during the start up phase of our relationship until higher purchase discounts are achieved from increased sales volume 
in these relationships  once we integrate a client s customer database and begin to meet targeted sales volumes  our gross margins from that client may improve 
cost of revenue also consists of the cost of inbound and outbound shipping  net of amounts recovered from our clients customers as well as the costs of designing  producing and delivering marketing services 
sales and marketing expenses include costs associated with the marketing and selling of our services and costs associated with promoting and selling our clients products and services 
included in these costs are client integration costs  compensation costs of marketing and sales personnel  sales commissions  bonuses  marketing and promotional expenses and costs related to product and service development 
also included are unreimbursed client related marketing expenses 
most of the costs are personnel related and are relatively fixed 
bonuses and sales commissions will typically change in proportion to revenue or profitability 
technology expenses include costs associated with systems and telecommunications  including compensation and related costs for technology personnel  consultants  purchases of non capitalizable software 
table of contents and hardware  and support and maintenance costs related to our systems 
this financial statement category excludes all depreciation on systems hardware and software

stock option exchange program on november   we announced a voluntary stock option exchange program for our employees 
under the program  our employees were given the opportunity  if they chose  to cancel outstanding stock options previously granted to them in exchange for an equal number of replacement options to be granted at a future date  at least six months and a day from the cancellation date of january  the employees were required to remain employed with rainmaker at the date of the replacement grant in order to receive replacement options

the replacement options have terms and conditions that are substantially the same as those of the canceled options 
the exchange program did not result in any compensation charges 
related party transactions during and the six month period ending june   we purchased inventories and service agreements from a client who had a board member who also sits on our board of directors 
total purchases from such client during the six months ended june   the period during which it was a related party  amounted to million

we believe that cash flows from operations and current cash balances  together with external financing will be sufficient to fund operations and capital investments in the short term 
should additional funding be required such as to meet payment obligations of our long term debts when due  or to finance the expansion of our business and facilities  we may need to raise the required funds through borrowings or public or private sales of debt or equity securities 
such funding may be obtained through bank borrowings or from the issuance of additional debt or equity securities  which may be issued from time to time under an effective registration statement  through the issuance of securities in a transaction exempt from registration under the securities act of  or a combination of one or more of the foregoing 
we believe that  in the event of such requirements  we will be able to access the capital markets on terms and conditions adequate to meet our objectives 
however  given the possibility of changes in market conditions or other occurrences  there can be no certainty that such funding will be available in quantities or on terms favorable to us

off balance sheet arrangements leases as of december   our off balance sheet arrangements include operating leases of our facility and certain property and equipment that expire at various dates through these arrangements allow us to obtain the use of the equipment and facilities without purchasing them 
if we were to acquire these assets  we would be required to obtain financing and record a liability related to the financing of these assets 
leasing these assets under operating leases allows us to use these assets for our business while minimizing the obligations and up front cash flow related to purchasing the assets 
during  we recorded rent expense related to these leases of guarantees in addition to operating leases  at december  we have three separate letters of credit  which secure amounts owed under capital lease and other financing obligations

these obligations primarily relate to certain agreements with our officers  directors and employees  under which we may be required to indemnify such persons for liabilities arising out of their 
table of contents employment relationship 
the terms of such obligations vary 
generally  a maximum obligation is not explicitly stated 
because the obligated amounts of these types of agreements often are not explicitly stated  the overall maximum amount of the obligations cannot be reasonably estimated 
historically  we have not been obligated to make any payments for these obligations  and no liabilities have been recorded for these obligations on our balance sheets as of december  we do not have commercial commitments under lines of credit 
contractual obligations capital leases we lease certain property under capital leases that expire at various dates through the effective annual interest rates on our capital lease obligations range from to  with an average of

the principle difference between sfas and eitf relates to its requirement for recognition of a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity 
this statement requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred

factors that may affect future results and market price of stock we have incurred recent losses and expect to incur losses in the future 
we incurred an operating loss and net loss of million  an operating loss of million and net loss of million for  and an operating loss of million and a net loss of million for we may incur losses in the future  depending on the timing of signing of new clients  impact of new and existing clients  our decisions to further invest in our technology or infrastructure  and our ability to continue to increase our operating efficiencies 
because we depend on a small number of clients for a significant portion of our revenue  the loss of a single client could result in a substantial decrease in our revenue 
we have generated a significant portion of our revenue from sales to customers of a limited number of clients 
in  sales to customers of hp  sybase and nortel each accounted for more than of our net revenues 
in  sales to customers of hp and sybase and nortel each accounted for more than of net revenues 
in  sales to customers of hp and sybase each accounted for more than of net revenues for   and  sales to customers of the previously mentioned clients collectively accounted for   and  respectively  of net revenues and no individual clients accounted for more than   and of our net revenues in   and  respectively 
as a percentage of gross billings  hp  sybase  nortel and dell products  lp dell  each accounted for more than of our gross billings in in  sales to customers of hp  sybase  nortel and dell  each accounted for more than of our gross billings 
in  sales to customers of hp  sybase  and com corporation each accounted for more than of our gross billings 
for   and  sales to customers of the previously mentioned clients collectively accounted for   and  respectively  of gross billings and no individual clients accounted for more than   and of our gross billings in   and  respectively 
we expect that a small number of clients will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenue for the foreseeable future 
the loss of any of our principal clients could cause a significant decrease in our revenue 
in addition  our software and technology clients operate in industries that experience consolidation from time to time  which could reduce the number of our existing and potential clients 
our revenue will decline if demand for our clients products and services decreases 
our business primarily consists of marketing and selling our clients products and services to their customers 
in addition  most of our revenue is based on a pay for performance model in which our revenues are based on the amount of our clients products and services that we sell 
accordingly  if a particular client s products and services fail to appeal to its customers for reasons beyond our control  such as preference for a competing product or service  our revenue from the sale of the client s products and services may decline 
we are exposed to general economic conditions 
as a result of recent unfavorable economic conditions in the united states  our revenue has and may continue to decline 
if the economic conditions in the united states worsen or if a wider or global economic 
table of contents slowdown occurs  we may experience a material adverse impact on our business  operating results  and financial condition 
during these unfavorable economic periods  it may be more difficult to sign new clients or expand relationships with existing clients 
terrorist acts and acts of war may harm our business and revenue  costs and expenses  and financial position 
terrorist acts or acts of war my cause damage to our employees  facilities  clients  our clients customers  and vendors  which could significantly impact our revenues  costs and expenses and financial position 
the potential for future terrorist attacks  the national and international responses to terrorist attacks or perceived threats to national security  and other acts of war or hostility have created many economic and political uncertainties that could adversely affect our business and results of operations in ways that cannot be presently predicted 
we are predominantly uninsured for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist acts and acts of war 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate  and if we do not meet market expectations  our stock price could decline 
we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results are not a good indication of future performance 
although our operating results have generally improved from quarter to quarter until recently  our future operating results may not follow past trends in every quarter  even if they continue to improve overall 
in any future quarter  our operating results may be below the expectation of public market analysts and investors 
factors which may cause our future operating results to be below expectations include the growth of the market for outsourced sales and marketing solutions  the demand for and acceptance of our services  the demand for our clients products and services  the length of the sales and integration cycle for our new clients  our ability to expand relationships with existing clients  our ability to develop and implement additional services  products and technologies  and the success of our direct sales force 
the length and unpredictability of the sales and integration cycles for our full solution service offering could cause delays in our revenue growth 
selection of our services often entails an extended decision making process on the part of prospective clients 
we often must provide a significant level of education regarding the use and benefit of our services  which may delay the evaluation and acceptance process 
the selling cycle can extend to approximately nine to twelve months or longer between initial client contact and signing of a contract for our services 
additionally  once our services are selected  the integration of our services often can be a lengthy process  which further impacts the timing of revenue 
because we are unable to control many of the factors that will influence our clients buying decisions or the integration of our services  the length and unpredictability of the sales and integration cycles make it difficult for us to forecast the growth and timing of our revenue 
if we are unable to attract and retain highly qualified management  sales and technical personnel  the quality of our services may decline  and our ability to execute our growth strategies may be harmed 
our success depends to a significant extent upon the contributions of our executive officers and key sales and technical personnel and our ability to attract and retain highly qualified sales  technical and managerial personnel 
competition for personnel is intense as these personnel are limited in supply 
we have at times 
table of contents experienced difficulty in recruiting qualified personnel  and there can be no assurance that we will not experience difficulties in the future 
any difficulties could limit our future growth 
the loss of certain key personnel  particularly michael silton  our president and chief executive officer  and martin hernandez  our chief operating officer and chief financial officer could seriously harm our business 
we have obtained life insurance policies in the amount of million on michael silton and million on martin hernandez 
we have strong competitors and may not be able to compete effectively against them 
competition in crm services is intense  and we expect such competition to increase in the future 
our competitors include system integrators  ecommerce solutions providers  and other outsource providers of different components of customer interaction management 
we also face competition from internal marketing departments of current and potential clients 
additionally  we may face competition from outsource providers with substantial offshore facilities which may enable them to compete aggressively with similar service offerings at a substantially lower price 
many of our existing or potential competitors have greater name recognition  longer operating histories  and significantly greater financial  technical and marketing resources  which could further impact our ability to address competitive pressures 
should competitive factors require us to increase spending for  and investment in  client acquisition and retention or for the development of new services  our expenses could increase disproportionately to our revenues 
competitive pressures may also necessitate price reductions and other actions that would likely affect our business adversely 
additionally  there can be no assurances that we will have the resources to maintain a higher level of spending to address changes in the competitive landscape 
failure to maintain or to produce revenue proportionate to any increase in expenses would have a negative impact on our financial results 
the demand for outsourced sales and marketing services is highly uncertain 
demand and acceptance of our sales and marketing services is dependent upon companies willingness to outsource these processes 
it is possible that these outsourced solutions may never achieve broad market acceptance 
if the market for our services does not grow or grows more slowly than we currently anticipate  our business  financial condition and operating results may be materially adversely affected 
our success depends on our ability to successfully manage growth 
any future growth will place additional demands on our managerial  administrative  operational and financial resources 
we will need to improve our operational  financial and managerial controls and information systems and procedures and will need to train and manage our overall work force 
if we are unable to manage additional growth effectively  our business will be harmed 
our business strategy may ultimately include expansion into foreign markets  which would require increased expenditures  and if our international operations are not successfully implemented  they may not result in increased revenue or growth of our business 
our long term growth strategy may include expansion into international markets 
as a result  we may need to establish international operations  hire additional personnel and establish relationships with additional clients and customers in those markets 
this expansion may require significant financial resources and management attention and could have a negative effect on our earnings 
in addition  we may be exposed to political risks associated with operating in foreign markets 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in creating international demand for our crm services or that we will be able to effectively sell our clients products and services in international markets 
any business combinations in which we participate could result in dilution  unfavorable accounting charges and difficulties in successfully managing our business 
as part of our business strategy  we review from time to time business combination prospects that would complement our existing business or enhance our technological capabilities 
future business combinations by us 
table of contents could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities  large and immediate write offs  the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities or amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets  any of which could cause our financial performance to suffer 
furthermore  business combinations entail numerous risks and uncertainties  including difficulties in the assimilation of operations  personnel  technologies  products and the information systems of the combined companies  diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  risks of entering geographic and business markets in which we have no or limited prior experience  and potential loss of key employees of acquired organizations 
we cannot be certain that we would be able to successfully integrate any businesses  products  technologies or personnel that might be acquired in the future  and our failure to do so could limit our future growth 
although we do not currently have any agreement with respect to any material business combinations  we may enter into business combinations with complementary businesses  products or technologies in the future 
however  we may not be able to locate suitable business combination opportunities 
we rely heavily on our communications infrastructure  and the failure to invest in or the loss of these systems could disrupt the operation and growth of our business and result in the loss of clients or our clients customers 
our success is dependent in large part on our continued investment in sophisticated computer  internet and telecommunications systems 
we have invested significantly in technology and anticipate that it will be necessary to continue to do so in the future to remain competitive 
these technologies are evolving rapidly and are characterized by short product life cycles  which require us to anticipate technological developments 
we may be unsuccessful in anticipating  managing  adopting and integrating technological changes on a timely basis  or we may not have the capital resources available to invest in new technologies 
temporary or permanent loss of these systems could limit our ability to conduct our business and result in lost revenue 
if we are unable to safeguard our networks and clients data  our clients may not use our services and our business may be harmed 
our networks may be vulnerable to unauthorized access  computer hacking  computer viruses and other security problems 
a user who circumvents security measures could misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions or malfunctions in our operations 
we may be required to expend significant resources to protect against the threat of security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by any breaches 
although we intend to continue to implement industry standard security measures  these measures may be inadequate 
damage to our single facility may disable our operations 
our operations are housed in a single facility in scotts valley  california 
we have taken precautions to protect ourselves from events that could interrupt our services  such as off site storage of computer backup data and a backup power source  but there can be no assurance that an earthquake  fire  flood or other disaster affecting our facility would not disable these operations 
any significant damage to this facility from an earthquake or other disaster could prevent us from operating our business 
while we maintain insurance coverage for business interruptions  such coverage does not extend to losses caused by earthquake and such coverage may not be sufficient to cover all possible losses 

table of contents if we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property or face a claim of intellectual property infringement by a third party  we may lose our intellectual property rights and be liable for significant damages 
we cannot guarantee that the steps we have taken to protect our proprietary rights will be adequate to deter misappropriation of our intellectual property 
in addition  we may not be able to detect unauthorized use of our intellectual property and take appropriate steps to enforce our rights 
if third parties infringe or misappropriate our trade secrets  copyrights  trademarks  service marks  trade names or other proprietary information  our business could be seriously harmed 
in addition  although we believe that our proprietary rights do not infringe the intellectual property rights of others  other parties may assert infringement claims against us that we violated their intellectual property rights 
these claims  even if not true  could result in significant legal and other costs and may be a distraction to management 
in addition  protection of intellectual property in many foreign countries is weaker and less reliable than in the united states  so if our business expands into foreign countries  risks associated with protecting our intellectual property will increase 
we have applied to register the rainmaker systems  rainmaker and design  contract renewals plus  and education sales plus services marks in the united states and certain foreign countries  and have received registrations for the rainmaker systems service mark in the united states  canada  australia  the european community  switzerland  norway and new zealand  the rainmaker and design in the united states and the european community  the contracts renewals plus mark in the united states and switzerland  and the education sales plus mark in the united states and switzerland 
increased government regulation of the internet could decrease the demand for our services and increase our cost of doing business 
the increasing popularity and use of the internet and online services may lead to the adoption of new laws and regulations in the us or elsewhere covering issues such as online privacy  copyright and trademark  sales taxes and fair business practices or which require qualification to do business as a foreign corporation in certain jurisdictions 
increased government regulation  or the application of existing laws to online activities  could inhibit internet growth 
a number of government authorities are increasingly focusing on online privacy issues and the use of personal information 
our business could be adversely affected if new regulations regarding the use of personal information are introduced or if government authorities choose to investigate our privacy practices 
in addition  the european union has adopted directives addressing data privacy that may limit the collection and use of some information regarding internet users 
such directives may limit our ability to target our clients customers or collect and use information 
a decline in the growth of the internet could decrease demand for our services and increase our cost of doing business and otherwise harm our business 
we are subject to government regulation of direct marketing  which could restrict the operation and growth of our business 
the federal trade commission s ftc s telemarketing sales rules prohibit misrepresentations of the cost  terms  restrictions  performance or duration of products or services offered by telephone solicitation and specifically addresses other perceived telemarketing abuses in the offering of prizes 
additionally  the ftc s rules limit the hours during which telemarketers may call consumers 
the federal telephone consumer protection act of contains other restrictions on facsimile transmissions and on telemarketers  including a prohibition on the use of automated telephone dialing equipment to call certain telephone numbers 
a number of states also regulate telemarketing and some states have enacted restrictions similar to these federal laws 
in addition  a number of states regulate email and facsimile transmissions 
the failure to comply with applicable statutes and regulations could result in penalties 
there can be no assurance that additional federal or state legislation  or changes in regulatory implementation  or judicial interpretation of existing or future laws would not limit our activities in the future or significantly increase the cost of regulatory compliance 

table of contents our directors and their affiliates own a large percentage of our stock and can significantly influence all matters requiring stockholder approval 
our directors  executive officers and entities affiliated with them together beneficially control approximately of our outstanding shares based on the number of shares outstanding as of february  
as a result  any significant combination of those stockholders  acting together  may have the ability to control all matters requiring stockholder approval  including the election of all directors  and any merger  consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets 
accordingly  such concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control of rainmaker  which  in turn  could depress the market price of our common stock 
our charter documents and delaware law contain anti takeover provisions that could deter takeover attempts  even if a transaction would be beneficial to our stockholders 
the provisions of delaware law and of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make it difficult for a third party to acquire us  even though an acquisition might be beneficial to our stockholders 
our certificate of incorporation provides our board of directors the authority  without stockholder action  to issue up to  shares of preferred stock in one or more series 
our board determines when we will issue preferred stock  and the rights  preferences and privileges of any preferred stock 
in addition  our bylaws establish an advance notice procedure for stockholder proposals and for nominating candidates for election as directors 
delaware corporate law also contains provisions that can affect the ability to take over a company 
our stock price may be volatile resulting in potential litigation 
if our stock price is volatile  we could face securities class action litigation 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of their stock  many companies have been the subjects of securities class action litigation 
if we were sued in a securities class action  it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources and could cause our stock price to fall 
the trading price of our common stock could fluctuate widely due to quarter to quarter variations in results of operations  loss of a major client  announcements of technological innovations by us or our competitors  changes in  or our failure to meet  the expectations of securities analysts  new products or services offered by us or our competitors  changes in market valuations of similar companies  announcements of strategic relationships or acquisitions by us or our competitors  or other events or factors that may be beyond our control 
in addition  the securities markets in general have experienced extreme price and trading volume volatility in the past 
the trading prices of securities of many business process outsourcing companies have fluctuated broadly  often for reasons unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies 
these general market and industry factors may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock  regardless of our actual operating performance 
recently enacted and proposed changes in securities laws and regulations are likely to increase our costs 
the sarbanes oxley act of that became law in july requires changes in some of our corporate governance and securities disclosure or compliance practices 
that act also requires the sec to promulgate new rules on a variety of subjects  in addition to rule proposals already made  and nasdaq issued revisions to its 
table of contents requirements for companies that are nasdaq listed 
these developments have increased our legal and accounting compliance costs and may continue to do so in the future 
these developments have also made it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance  and we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage 
these developments could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors  or qualified executive officers 
we are presently evaluating and monitoring regulatory developments and cannot estimate the timing or magnitude of additional costs we may incur as a result 
we may have difficulty obtaining director and officer liability insurance in acceptable amounts for acceptable rates 
like most other public companies  we carry insurance protecting our officers and directors and us against claims relating to the conduct of our business 
this insurance covers  among other things  the costs incurred by companies and their management to defend against and resolve claims relating to management conduct and results of operations  such as securities class action claims 
these claims typically are extremely expensive to defend against and resolve 
hence  as is customary  we purchase and maintain insurance to cover some of these costs 
we pay significant premiums to acquire and maintain this insurance  which is provided by third party insurers 
since  the premiums we have paid for this insurance have increased substantially 
one consequence of the current economic downturn and decline in stock prices has been a substantial general increase in the number of securities class actions and similar claims brought against public corporations and their management  including our company and certain of our current and former officers and directors 
many  if not all  of these actions and claims are  and will likely continue to be  at least partially insured by third party insurers 
consequently  insurers providing director and officer liability insurance have in recent periods sharply increased the premiums they charge for this insurance  raised retentions that is  the amount of liability that a company is required to itself pay to defend and resolve a claim before any applicable insurance is provided  and limited the amount of insurance they will provide 
moreover  insurers typically provide only one year policies 
we renewed our director and officer insurance in the fourth quarter of for a one year term 
in the fourth quarter of  we will be required to do the same 
particularly in the current economic environment  we cannot assure that we will be able to obtain sufficient director and officer liability insurance coverage at acceptable rates and with acceptable deductibles and other limitations 
failure to obtain such insurance could materially harm our financial condition in the event that we are required to defend against and resolve any future securities class actions or other claims made against us or our management 
further  the inability to obtain such insurance in adequate amounts may impair our future ability to retain and recruit qualified officers and directors 
our business may be subject to additional obligations to collect and remit sales tax and  any successful action by state authorities to collect additional sales tax could adversely harm our business 
we file sales tax returns in certain states within the united states as required by law and certain client contracts for a portion of the outsourced sales and marketing services that we provide 
we do not collect sales or other similar taxes in other states and many of the states do not apply sales or similar taxes to the vast majority of the services that we provide 
however  one or more states could seek to impose additional sales or use tax collection and record keeping obligations on us 
any successful action by state authorities to compel us to collect and remit sales tax  either retroactively or prospectively or both  could adversely affect our results of operations and business 
if we fail to meet the nasdaq smallcap market listing requirements  our common stock will be delisted 
our common stock is currently listed on the nasdaq smallcap market 
nasdaq has requirements that a company must meet in order to remain listed on the nasdaq smallcap market 
if we continue to experience losses from our operations  or are unable to raise additional funds or our stock price does not meet minimum standards  we may not be able to maintain the standards for continued listing on the nasdaq smallcap market  which include  among other things  that our stock maintain a minimum closing bid price of at least per 
table of contents share subject to applicable grace and cure periods 
if as a result of the application of such listing requirements our common stock is delisted from the nasdaq smallcap market  our stock would become harder to buy and sell 
consequently  if we were removed from the nasdaq smallcap market  the ability or willingness of broker dealers to sell or make a market in our common stock might decline 
as a result  the ability to resell shares of our common stock could be adversely affected 
shares eligible for sale in the future could negatively affect our stock price 
the market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of our common stock or the perception that these sales could occur 
this might also make it more difficult for us to raise funds through the issuance of securities 
as of march   we had outstanding  shares of common stock 
as of march   there were an aggregate of  shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of outstanding stock options and warrants  including  shares issuable upon exercise of options outstanding under our option plan and  shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the outstanding warrants issued to the selling securityholders in our private placement transaction completed on february  under our existing stock option plan and employee stock purchase plan  we may issue up to an additional  shares and  shares of our common stock  respectively  subject to the terms and conditions of such plans 
we may issue and or register additional shares  options  or warrants in the future in connection with acquisitions  compensation or otherwise 
we have not entered into any agreements or understanding regarding any future acquisitions and cannot ensure that we will be able to identify or complete any acquisition in the future 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the increase or decrease in the amount of interest income we can earn on our investment portfolio 
we currently do not and do not plan to use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we plan to ensure the safety and preservation of our invested principal funds by limiting default risk  market risk and investment risk 
we mitigate default risk by investing in low risk securities 
to minimize our risks  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of short term and liquid securities including money market funds  commercial paper  us government and agency securities and municipal bonds 
in general  money market funds are not subject to market risk because the interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate 
as of december   of our portfolio was invested in instruments which mature in less than days 
see note to financial statements 
due to the short duration and conservative nature of our investment portfolio at december   we do not believe we have a material exposure to interest rate risk 
the interest rates on all of our outstanding capital leases and debt are fixed and therefore not subject to interest rate fluctuations
