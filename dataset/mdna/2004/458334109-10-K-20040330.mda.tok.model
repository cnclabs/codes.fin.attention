item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation overview nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  we operate in a single segment in the fragrance and cosmetic industry  and manufacture  market and distribute a wide array of fragrances  cosmetics and health and beauty aids 
we specialize in prestige perfumes and cosmetics and mass market perfumes  cosmetics and health and beauty aids 
most of our prestige products are produced and marketed by our owned subsidiary in paris  inter parfums  sa  which is also a publicly traded company  of inter parfums  sa shares trade on the paris bourse 
prestige products for each prestige brand  owned or licensed by us  we develop an original concept for the perfume or cosmetic line consistent with world market trends 
mass market products we design  market and distribute inexpensive fragrances and personal care products  including alternative designer fragrances  mass market cosmetics and health and beauty aids 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  our prestige product lines  which are manufactured and distributed by us primarily under license agreements with brand owners  represented approximately of net sales during since we have built a portfolio of brands under licenses which include burberry  st dupont  paul smith  christian lacroix  celine  and diane von furstenberg  which are distributed in over countries around the world 
in terms of sales  burberry is our most significant license  and sales of burberry products represented  and of net sales for the years ended december   and  respectively 
our current burberry license takes us through december  we believe it is important to have a long term relationship with burberry at this time  because product development and marketing strategies  including planning for product launches can  and often do  extend over several years 
accordingly  a new license agreement is under serious discussion with burberry 
we are hopeful for a positive outcome by the summer of nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  we have two licenses with affiliates of our strategic partner  lv capital  usa inc lv capital  a wholly owned subsidiary of lvmh moet hennessy louis vuitton sa lv capital owns approximately of our outstanding common shares 
in may we entered into an exclusive worldwide license for prestige fragrances for the celine brand  and in march we entered into an exclusive worldwide license for christian lacroix fragrances 
both licenses are subject to certain minimum sales requirements  advertising expenditures and royalty payments as are customary in our industry 
we believe that our association with lv capital has enhanced our creditability in the cosmetic industry  which should lead us to additional opportunities in our industry that might not have been otherwise available to us 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  our mass market product lines  which represent of sales  are comprised of alternative designer fragrances  cosmetics  health and beauty aids and personal care products 
these lines are sold under trademarks owned by us or pursuant to license agreements we have for the trademarks jordache  tatiana and fubu 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  we grow our business in two distinct ways 
first  we grow by adding new brands to our portfolio  either through new licenses or out right acquisitions of brands 
second  we grow through the creation of product line extensions for the existing brands in our portfolio 
every two to three years  we create a new family of fragrances for each brand in our portfolio 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  our business is not very capital intensive  and it is important to note that we do not own any manufacturing facilities 
rather  we act as a general contractor and source our needed components from our suppliers 
these components are received at one of our distribution centers and then  based upon production needs  the components are sent to one of several outside fillers which manufacture the finished good for us and ship it back to the distribution center 
discussion of critical accounting policies nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  we make estimates and assumptions in the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations 
these accounting policies generally require our management s most difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the following is a brief discussion of the more critical accounting policies that we employ 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  revenue recognition nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  we sell our products to department stores  perfumeries  mass market retailers  supermarkets and domestic and international wholesalers and distributors 
sales of such products by our domestic subsidiaries are denominated in us dollars and sales of such products by our foreign subsidiaries are primarily denominated in either euros or us dollars 
accounts receivable reflect the granting of credit to these customers 
we generally grant credit based upon our analysis of the customer s financial position as well as previously established buying patterns 
generally  we do not bill customers for shipping and handling costs and  accordingly  we classify such costs as selling and administrative expenses 
we recognize revenues when merchandise is shipped and the risk of loss passes to the customer 
net sales are comprised of gross revenues less returns  and trade discounts and allowances 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  sales returns nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  generally  we do not permit customers to return their unsold products 
however  on a case by case basis we occasionally allow customer returns 
we regularly review and revise  as deemed necessary  our estimate of reserves for future sales returns based primarily upon historic trends and relevant current data 
we record estimated reserves for sales returns as a reduction of sales  cost of sales and accounts receivable 
returned products are recorded as inventories and are valued based upon estimated realizable value 
the physical condition and marketability of returned products are the major factors we consider in estimating realizable value 
actual returns  as well as estimated realizable values of returned products  may differ significantly  either favorably or unfavorably  from our estimates  if factors such as economic conditions  inventory levels or competitive conditions differ from expectations 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  promotional allowances nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  we have various performance based arrangements with retailers to reimburse them for all or a portion of their promotional activities related to our products 
these arrangements primarily allow customers to take deductions against amounts owed to us for product purchases 
estimated accruals for promotions and co operative advertising programs are recorded in the period in which the related revenue is recognized 
we review and revise the estimated accruals for the projected costs for these promotions 
actual costs incurred may differ significantly  either favorably or unfavorably  from estimates if factors such as the level and success of the retailers programs or other conditions differ from our expectations 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  inventories nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value 
cost is principally determined by the first in  first out method 
we record adjustments to the cost of inventories based upon our sales forecast and the physical condition of the inventories 
these adjustments are estimates  which could vary significantly  either favorably or unfavorably  from actual requirements if future economic conditions or competitive conditions differ from our expectations 
equipment and other long lived assets nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  equipment  which includes tools and molds  is recorded at cost and is depreciated on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of such assets 
changes in circumstances such as technological advances  changes to our business model or changes in our capital spending strategy can result in the actual useful lives differing from our estimates 
in those cases where we determine that the useful life of equipment should be shortened  we would depreciate the net book value in excess of the salvage value  over its revised remaining useful life  thereby increasing depreciation expense 
factors such as changes in the planned use of equipment  or market acceptance of products  could result in shortened useful lives 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  long lived assets  including trademarks and licenses  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of any such asset may not be recoverable 
if the sum of the undiscounted cash flows excluding interest is less than the carrying value  then we recognize an impairment loss  measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset 
the estimate of undiscounted cash flow is based upon  among other things  certain assumptions about expected future operating performance 
our estimates of undiscounted cash flow may differ from actual cash flow due to  among other things  economic conditions  changes to our business model or changes in consumer acceptance of our products 
in those cases where we determine that the useful life of other long lived assets should be shortened  we would depreciate the net book value in excess of the salvage value after testing for impairment as described above  over the revised remaining useful life of such asset thereby increasing amortization expense 
results of operations nbsp  net sales years ended december  in millions change change prestige product sales mass market product sales total net sales nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  net sales for the year ended december  increased to million 
for the year ended december   net sales were up 
at comparable foreign currency exchange rates  net sales rose and in and  respectively 
the increases in net sales are attributable to increases in both our prestige and mass market product lines 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  prestige product sales  which were up approximately in  surged in prestige fragrance sales in general were slow for the first six months of as the economy and luxury goods manufacturers felt the effects of september  however  we began to see a significant turnaround in july  which continued for the remainder of that year and throughout nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  prestige product sales growth in was spurred by increased global distribution of our celine brand  which has a strong following throughout western europe and japan 
we also launched a new christian lacroix fragrance line  bazar  for men and women  as well as two fragrance line extensions  essence pure by st dupont and paul smith extreme 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  our calendar of new product launches was the most ambitious in our history 
besides the continued geographic rollout of essence pure by st dupont and paul smith extreme  new brands and brand extensions made their debuts throughout the year 
in the spring of we launched a summer seasonal fragrances for both our celine and christian lacroix fragrance lines 
in addition  in late september  we launched a fragrance and cosmetic line under the diane von furstenberg label 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  most importantly  the global rollout of burberry brit for women  which began in the third quarter of  is now expanding to asia  south america and the middle east 
we anticipate that burberry brit for women will be the best selling fragrance in our history 
we are also looking forward to the launch in the fall of the burberry brit for men line in selected markets 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  in september  we launched our first prestige cosmetics line  diane von furstenberg beauty  at about of the finest retail doors in the us as well as in the designer s boutiques in new york and miami 
initial sales have been satisfactory and efforts are being made to increase consumer awareness 
many promotional events are being planned  including personal appearances  free makeovers and gift with purchase programs 
diane von furstenberg products will be available on sephora 
com in april and at several sephora retail locations this summer 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  the year  will not be without its share of brand extensions 
in july  we will unveil new fragrance families for both st dupont and paul smith 
les eaux de st dupont will be available in versions for both men and women  as will paul smith london 
in october  we will introduce a new christian lacroix fragrance for men and women  and we have a limited edition warm weather  seasonal fragrance for our celine brand 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  with respect to our mass market product lines  net sales were up in after rising in through june we continued to see growth in our fragrances lines as a result of our may acquisition of certain fragrance brands from tristar corporation  a debtor in possession  tristar 
tristar was one of our most significant competitors in mass market fragrances and the brands acquired are being sold in the same distribution channels as that of our other mass market fragrance lines 
as we have passed the one year anniversary of this acquisition  we are consolidating certain fragrance lines to reduce duplication and improve overall efficiency  which resulted in decline in mass market fragrance sales in however  new product line extensions and an expanding distribution network continue to benefit sales volume in our intimate health and beauty aids and our aziza cosmetics lines 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  our new product development program for all of our product groups is well under way  and we expect to roll out new products throughout in addition  we are actively pursuing other new business opportunities 
however  we cannot assure you that any new license or acquisitions will be consummated 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  in december  we announced the signing of a letter of intent by our paris based subsidiary  inter parfums  sa  to acquire a interest in nickel sa for approximately million in cash 
closing of the transaction  which is subject to certain due diligence procedures and signing of a definitive agreement  is expected to take place in april the letter of intent contemplates a provision for a follow on cash infusion of approximately million  which would bring our ownership to 
in addition  minority shareholders will have the right to sell their remaining interest in nickel to us from january through june the purchase price is to be based upon a formula applied to nickel s sales for the year ending december   pro rated for the minority holders equity in nickel 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  established in by philippe dumont  nickel has developed two innovative concepts in the world of cosmetics spas exclusively for male customers and skin care product lines for men 
the nickel range of some fifteen skin care products for the face and body is sold through prestige department and specialty stores primarily in france outlets  the balance of western europe outlets and in the united states outlets  as well as through its men s spas in paris  new york and  most recently  san francisco

gross margins years ended december  in millions net sales cost of sales gross margin gross margin as a of net sales nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  gross profit margins were in  in and in in  gross profit margins were aided by the strong dollar in relation to the euro and were therefore ahead of our historic target rates of to 
this results from the fact that certain european sales are denominated in us dollars 
in  the weak us dollar began to reverse that trend 
in addition  sales of product in our prestige fragrance lines generate a significantly higher gross profit margin than sales of our mass market product lines 
in  mass market net sales were up as compared to prestige product sales which were up 
in  although the us dollar continued to weaken against the euro  its effect on gross margins was mitigated by the net sales growth rate achieved in our prestige product lines as compared to for our mass market lines 
if the dollar remains at current levels  and product mix continues the pattern of  then we expect the gross margin for to remain at approximately

this is because promotion and advertising are prerequisites for sales of designer prestige products 
we develop a complete marketing and promotional plan to support our growing portfolio of prestige brands and to build upon each brand s awareness 
promotion and advertising included in selling  general and administrative expenses was approximately of prestige product sales in each of the years in the three years period ended december  our mass market product lines do not require extensive advertising and therefore  more of our selling  general and administrative expenses are fixed rather than variable 
in addition  recent increases in certain fixed costs  including insurance  rent and wages  contributed to the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses in nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  interest expense aggregated million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively

at december   working capital aggregated million and we had a working capital ratio of nbsp  to nbsp  cash and cash equivalents aggregated million and we had no long term debt 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  cash provided by operating activities aggregated million  million and million for the years ended december nbsp   and  respectively 
at december   in terms of cash flows  accounts receivable and inventories were up and  respectively  from december  the increase in accounts receivable was not unusual considering that net sales for the three months and year ended december  were up and  respectively 
the increase in inventories is primarily attributable to the tristar inventory purchased in connection with the intellectual property acquisition in may at december   in terms of cash flows  accounts receivable and inventories were up and  respectively  from december  the increase in accounts receivable and the increase in inventories are not unusual considering that net sales for the three months and year ended december  were up and  respectively 
in addition  in a significant inventory build up during the fourth quarter of was made to meet our sales commitments in early including the continued rollout of our burberry brit for women line 
this buildup was financed primarily through normal credit terms with our vendors  and therefore did not have any significant impact on our cash flows from operations

as previously mentioned  our business is not capital intensive and we do not own any manufacturing facilities

this increased cash dividend in represents a small part of our cash position and is not expected to have any significant impact on our financial position 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  our short term financing requirements are expected to be met by available cash at december   cash generated by operations and short term credit lines provided by domestic and foreign banks 
the principal credit facilities for consist of a million unsecured revolving line of credit provided by a domestic commercial bank and approximately million in credit lines provided by a consortium of international financial institutions 
actual borrowings under these facilities have been minimal as we typically use our working capital to finance all of our cash needs 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  in december  we signed of a letter of intent to acquire a interest in nickel sa for approximately million in cash 
closing of the transaction  which is subject to certain due diligence procedures and signing of a definitive agreement  is expected to take place in april the letter of intent contemplates a provision for a follow on cash infusion of approximately million  which would bring our ownership to

nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  as previously reported  our french subsidiary  inter parfums  sa  is a party to litigation with jean charles brosseau  sa brosseau  the licensor of the ombre rose trademark 
in october  inter parfums  sa received notice of a judgment in favor of brosseau  which awarded damages of approximately  and which directed inter parfums  sa to turn over its license to brosseau within six months 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  inter parfums  sa appealed the judgment as it vigorously and categorically denied the claims of brosseau 
in june  as a result of certain developments  inter parfums  sa and its special litigation counsel considered it likely that the judgment would be sustained and therefore took a charge against earnings for  the full amount of the judgment 
in february  the court of appeal confirmed the brosseau claim with respect to turning over the license 
in addition  the court named an expert to proceed with additional investigations and required inter parfums  sa to pay  as an advance for damages claimed by brosseau 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  in february  the court of appeal ordered inter parfums  sa to pay total damages of  of which  has already been advanced 
brosseau has two months to appeal this decision and  therefore inter parfums  sa will maintain its current reserves until such time as all rights to appeal have expired

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk general nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  we address certain financial exposures through a controlled program of risk management that primarily consists of the use of derivative financial instruments 
we primarily enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts in order to reduce the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates 
we do not engage in the trading of foreign currency forward exchange contracts or interest rate swaps 
foreign exchange risk management nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  we periodically enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to hedge exposure related to receivables denominated in a foreign currency and to manage risks related to future sales expected to be denominated in a foreign currency 
we enter into these exchange contracts for periods consistent with our identified exposures 
the purpose of the hedging activities is to minimize the effect of foreign exchange rate movements on the receivables and cash flows of inter parfums  sa  our french subsidiary  whose functional currency is the euro 
all foreign currency contracts are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries and are with large financial institutions  which are rated as strong investment grade 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  all derivative instruments are required to be reflected as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet measured at fair value 
generally  increases or decreases in fair value of derivative instruments will be recognized as gains or losses in earnings in the period of change 
if the derivative is designated and qualifies as a cash flow hedge  then the changes in fair value of the derivative instrument will be recorded in other comprehensive income 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  before entering into a derivative transaction for hedging purposes  we determine that the change in the value of the derivative will effectively offset the change in the fair value of the hedged item from a movement in foreign currency rates 
then  we measure the effectiveness of each hedge throughout the hedged period 
any hedge ineffectiveness is recognized in the income statement 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  we believe that our risk of loss as the result of nonperformance by any of such financial institutions is remote and in any event would not be material 
the contracts have varying maturities with none exceeding one year 
costs associated with entering into such contracts have not been material to our financial results 
at december   we had foreign currency contracts at inter parfums  sa in the form of forward exchange contracts in the amount of approximately us million and gb pounds million
