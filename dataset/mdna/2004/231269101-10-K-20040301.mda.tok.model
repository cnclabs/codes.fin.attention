item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read together with selected financial data  and our financial statements and accompanying notes appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements  based on current expectations and related to future events and our future financial performance  that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of many important factors  including those set forth below under factors that may affect results and elsewhere in this report 
overview we are a therapeutic drug development company principally focused on the discovery  development and future commercialization of products that modulate key regulatory signaling pathways controlling the repair and regeneration of human tissues and organs 
our product development approach involves using small molecules  proteins or antibodies to modulate these regulatory signaling pathways 
we have successfully developed several promising preclinical product candidates in the fields of kidney disease  cancer  neurological disorders  cardiovascular disease and hair growth regulation 
since our inception  we have funded our operations primarily through license fees  research and development funding from our collaborative partners  the private and public placement of our equity securities  debt financings and the monitization of certain royalty rights 
we have never been profitable and have incurred an accumulated deficit of  as of december  we expect to incur significant operating losses for the next several years as we devote substantially all of our resources to research and development of our product candidates 
we will need to generate significant revenues to achieve profitability and do not expect to achieve profitability in the foreseeable future  if at all 
we currently have strategic collaborations with ortho biotech  genentech and wyeth 
our strategic alliances and collaborations generally provide for our research  development and commercialization programs to be funded by our collaborators and provide us with the opportunity to receive additional payments if specified milestones are achieved  as well as royalty payments upon the successful commercialization of any products based upon the collaboration 
in some cases  we have retained development and commercialization rights in areas where we believe we can attain the greatest potential long term value through the application of our own internal resources 
in the future  we plan to continue to seek corporate partners for the further development and commercialization of some of our technologies 
even though we are seeking partners to help develop some of our technologies  we expect to select at least one program that we will develop further on our own 
financial operations overview general 
our future operating results will depend largely on the magnitude of payments from our current and potential future corporate partners and the progress of other product candidates currently in our research and development pipeline 
the results of our operations will vary significantly from year to year and quarter to quarter and depend on  among other factors  the timing of our entry into new collaborations  the timing of the receipt of payments from collaborators and the cost and outcome of clinical trials 
we believe that our existing capital resources should enable us to maintain current and planned operations into the first half of revenue 
other than royalty revenue from stryker corporation s sales of op  a bone inducing protein  we have not generated any revenue from product sales since our inception and do not expect to generate any revenue from the sale of products for several years  if ever 
in late  stryker paid us  in exchange for the termination of its future royalty obligations on op accordingly  we will receive no future royalties on sales by stryker of op other than revenues from our agreements with stryker  substantially all of our revenue to date has been derived from license fees and research and development payments that we have received from our corporate collaborators 
in the future  we will seek to generate revenue from a combination of up front fees  research and development funding and milestone payments in connection with strategic collaborations  and royalties resulting from the sale of products which incorporate our intellectual property 
we expect that any revenue we generate will fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of the timing and amount of payments received under our strategic collaborations  and the amount and timing of payments we receive upon the sale of our products  to the extent that any are successfully commercialized 
research and development 
research and development expense consists of costs incurred to discover  research and develop product candidates 
these expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for personnel  outside service costs including medicinal chemistry  consulting and sponsored research collaborations  occupancy and depreciation charges and the legal costs of pursuing patent protection of our intellectual property 
we expense research and development costs  including patent related costs  as incurred 
the following table summarizes our primary research and development programs  including the current development status of each program 
in the table below  the term early preclinical means we are seeking to obtain initial demonstrations of therapeutic efficacy in preclinical models of human disease  mid preclinical means we are seeking to obtain multiple demonstrations of efficacy in preclinical models of human disease  and late preclinical means we are seeking to obtain both multiple demonstrations of efficacy in preclinical models of human disease and relevant toxicology and safety data required for an investigational new drug application  or ind  filing with the fda seeking to commence a phase i clinical trial to assess safety in humans 
we have set forth below under results of operations the expenses incurred with respect to each product candidate for the fiscal years ended december   and we have not provided program costs since inception because prior to we did not track and accumulate cost information by research program

moreover  because of uncertainties inherent in drug discovery and development  including those factors described below under risk factors that may affect results  we and our collaborative partners may not be able to successfully develop and commercialize any of the product candidates included in the table above 
all of our product development initiatives are in various stages of preclinical testing  other than our pyy peptide  which has been licensed to amylin pharmaceuticals and which is currently the subject of an investigational new drug application seeking fda approval to begin human clinical trials 
because all of our product development initiatives are in early stages of development  the successful development of our product candidates is highly uncertain 
we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature  timing and estimated costs of the efforts necessary to complete the development of  or the period in which material net cash inflows are expected to commence from  any of our product candidates due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing drugs  including the uncertainty of the scope  rate of progress and cost of clinical trials and other research and development activities undertaken by us or our collaborative partners  future clinical trials results  the terms and timing of any collaborative  licensing and other arrangements that we may establish  the cost and timing of regulatory approvals  the cost and timing of establishing sales  marketing and distribution capabilities  the cost of establishing clinical and commercial supplies of our product candidates and any products that we may develop  the effect of competing technological and market developments  and the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights 
any failure to complete the development of our product candidates in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on our operations  financial position and liquidity 
a discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with completing our projects on schedule  or at all  and some consequences of failing to do so  are set forth below in risk factors that may affect results 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries and other related costs for personnel in executive  finance  accounting  business development  legal  information technology  corporate communications and human resource functions 
other costs include facility costs not otherwise included in research and development expense and professional fees for legal and accounting services 
strategic alliances and license agreements 
since inception  substantially all of our revenue has been derived from collaborations and other research and development arrangements with third parties 
our current strategic alliances and key license agreements are as follows ortho biotech collaboration 
in november  we licensed our broad bmp technology portfolio to ortho biotech on an exclusive  worldwide royalty bearing basis  for all non orthopedic and non dental therapeutic applications in exchange for a  up front fee  a series of cash milestones if specified clinical research objectives and regulatory approvals are achieved  including a  milestone payment upon us regulatory approval of a product for the treatment of kidney disease  and a royalty on potential future product sales 
if the program progresses successfully through clinical development  we are entitled to receive additional milestone payments for the kidney disease related product candidate and milestone payments for the first neurology product candidate 
genentech  inc collaboration 
in june  we licensed our novel small molecule and antibody inhibitors of the hedgehog signaling pathway to genentech on an exclusive worldwide royalty bearing basis for applications in cancer therapy 
under the terms of the agreement  genentech paid us an upfront license fee of  purchased  shares of our common stock at a price of per share for aggregate proceeds of  and is also obligated to pay us a total of  in maintenance fees by july genentech is also obligated to make cash payments to us upon the successful achievement of clinical development and drug approval milestones 
in addition  genentech will pay a royalty on potential future net product sales  which increases with increasing sales volume 
we have retained the right to co develop products in the field of basal cell carcinoma  in which event we will share in any profits related to the basal cell carcinoma program in a percentage that is equal to our co development cost sharing contribution 
wyeth pharmaceuticals collaboration 
in january  we entered into an agreement to license our hedgehog proteins and novel small molecule hedgehog pathway agonists to wyeth on an exclusive worldwide  royalty bearing basis for the development and commercialization of pharmaceutical products for the therapeutic applications in treatment of neurological disorders  including neurodegenerative diseases and neuropathies 
under the terms of the agreement  wyeth pharmaceuticals paid us a license fee of  and purchased  shares of our common stock at a price of per share for an aggregate purchase price of  wyeth will provide research funding for a minimum of two years 
in addition  wyeth is obligated to make cash payments to us upon the successful achievement of clinical development and drug approval milestones and is obligated to pay a royalty on net product sales  if any  that escalates with increasing sales volume 
amylin pharmaceuticals licenses 
in december  we granted amylin pharmaceuticals an exclusive worldwide  royalty bearing license to our pyy patent applications for use in the research  development and commercialization of products in exchange for an up front fee  milestone payments upon the achievement of specified development objectives  and royalties on potential future product sales  if any 
pyy is a gut peptide that has been shown in animals and humans to suppress appetite and reduce food intake 
amylin has exclusive responsibility for expenses related to further development of the pyy compound 
critical accounting policies while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in our consolidated financial statements  we believe the following accounting policies to be critical to understanding the judgments and estimates we use in preparing our financial statements long lived assets 
long lived assets consist of goodwill  long term receivables  equity securities held in micromet  es cell international and aegera therapeutics  capitalized patent costs and long term deposits 
we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles and long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
in addition  we perform a goodwill impairment test annually 
if it were determined that the carrying value of intangible or long lived assets might not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more indicators of impairment  we would measure any impairment based on a projected cash flow method 
as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
 effective january   we ceased amortization of goodwill and performed an initial assessment of impairment of our goodwill in the first quarter of this initial assessment involved comparing our fair value to our net assets 
we determined our fair value based on quoted market prices adjusted to provide for a control premium 
our fair value was in excess of our net assets and  therefore  we concluded that our goodwill was not impaired 
sfas no 
requires us to perform an impairment assessment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that our goodwill may be impaired 
during the three month period ended june   we concluded that the decline in our market capitalization indicated that the carrying value of goodwill might be impaired 
as a result  we conducted an impairment assessment as required under sfas no 
by comparing our fair value to our net assets  including goodwill  as of june  because the carrying value of our net assets exceeded our fair value at june   we determined that our goodwill had been impaired 
to determine the amount of the impairment charge as a single reporting unit  we calculated our implied goodwill as the difference between our fair value and the fair value of our assets and liabilities 
the fair value of our intangible assets  principally consisting of completed and in process technology  was estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology 
based on this valuation  we determined that our implied goodwill was  and we recorded a non cash charge in the quarter ended june   of  to write down our existing goodwill 
the goodwill impairment analysis as of june  involved considerable judgment and the use of several estimates including control premium  discount rates  projected cash flows of op and projected cash flows of our in process research and development programs 
the control premium used in determining our fair value was based on an analysis of control premiums involved in other biotechnology and medical products acquisitions 
most of our research and development programs will not be completed for several years  if ever  and therefore estimating the costs to complete these programs and the revenue to be derived through collaborations and commercialization of the products involves substantial judgment 
the discount rates used to determine the net present value of these cash flows were based on a consideration of the risks associated with achieving these cash flow projections  including the risk of successfully completing our in process technology 
all of these estimates involve a significant amount of judgment by our management 
although the estimates used reflect management s best estimates based upon all available evidence  the use of different estimates could have yielded different results in our transitional impairment assessment conducted as of january   and in our impairment assessment conducted in the second quarter of had we used a significantly lower control premium in determining our fair value  our transitional impairment analysis could have indicated that goodwill was impaired at january  in addition  using different estimated cash flows or discount rates in determining our implied goodwill in the second quarter of could have resulted in a higher or lower goodwill impairment charge 
we completed our annual goodwill impairment test in december  and determined that as of that date our fair value exceeded the carrying value of our net assets 
accordingly  no goodwill impairment was recognized in during the year ended december   we recorded  in other expense  charges of  related to the write off of a euro denominated note receivable that is due in june from micromet  a former collaborator  and  related to a reduction in the carrying value of micromet equity securities held by us 
we determined that these charges were necessary due to micromet s recent announcement that it was terminating one third of its workforce as the result of a contract dispute with a co development partner 
micromet has stated that this dispute will result in a significant decrease of previously budgeted cash inflows in  which  in our estimate  materially and adversely affects the likelihood of collection of the note receivable 
during the fourth quarter of the year ended december   we recorded an impairment charge of  to write off the carrying value of patents associated with our op technology  which is licensed to stryker 
the charge was recorded as a result of our transaction with stryker under which  in exchange for  we sold our rights to future royalties from stryker on sales of op we wrote these patents off because we will not receive any future royalties or other revenue from stryker and because these patents cannot be utilized for alternative uses in either current or future operations 
during the first quarter of the year ended december   we recorded impairment charges of property and equipment assets related to our business realignment of  these charges related to impairment on assets at our former manufacturing and development facility located at erie street in cambridge  massachusetts 
of the total impairment charge   relates to the write off of tenant improvements made to the erie street facility  since such were affixed to the facility and therefore could not have been sold separately from the facility 
the remaining charge of  was to write down equipment to its estimated salvage value 
the amount we received from the sale of these assets was not significantly different from the originally estimated salvage value 
revenue recognition 
revenue is a key component of our results of operations 
we follow the provisions of the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin no 
sab no 
 revenue recognition  and eitf  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
in accordance with sab no 
 we recognize revenue related to research activities as they are performed  so long as there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is probable 
amounts received for license fees are deferred and recognized as services are performed over the performance period of the contract 
amounts received for milestones will be recognized upon achievement of the milestone  as long as the milestone is deemed to be substantive and we have no other performance obligations 
in the event that we have remaining performance obligations  the portion of the milestone payment equal to the lesser of the non refundable cash received or the percentage of the services performed through that date multiplied by the total milestone payment would be recognized as revenue 
we recognized  in revenue related to our collaboration with genentech for the year ended december  this amount primarily consists of revenue recognized under the amortization of a  up front license fee received from genentech in july and future maintenance fees totaling  that will be paid over the first two years of the collaboration 
the remainder will be recognized proportionately as the remaining services are performed 
revenues for research and development services are recognized as such services are performed 
for the year ended december   we recognized  of revenues relating to research and development services performed under an agreement with es cell international 
royalty revenue is recognized upon the sale of the related products  provided the royalty amounts are fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured 
no royalty revenue was recognized during the year ended december  amounts received prior to satisfying the above revenue recognition criteria are recorded as deferred revenue in the accompanying balance sheets 
amounts that we expect will not be recognized prior to december  are classified as long term deferred revenue 
as of december   we have recorded short and long term deferred revenue of  and  respectively  both of which are solely related to the  up front payment and the  in future maintenance fee payments under our collaboration with genentech 
we follow detailed guidelines in measuring revenue  however  certain judgments affect the application of our revenue policy 
for example  in connection with our collaboration agreement with genentech  we have recorded on our balance sheet short and long term deferred revenue based on our best estimate of when such revenue will be recognized 
the estimate of deferred revenue reflects management s estimate of the period of our involvement with the collaboration 
our period of involvement is largely determined by the time to commercialize clinical candidates that we may co develop with genentech 
since the timing of clinical development is difficult to estimate  our estimates may change in the future 
such changes to estimates would result in a change in revenue recognition rates 
as of december    has been recognized as revenue related to the amortization of the up front license fee and future maintenance fees 
the remaining  is recorded as deferred revenue on our balance sheet at december  under our current operating plan  we plan to recognize this revenue on a straight line basis through the third quarter of the above list is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosure of certain assets and liabilities at our balance sheet date 
such estimates include the collectibility of receivables  the carrying value of property and equipment and intangible assets and the value of certain liabilities 
actual results may differ from such estimates 
our more significant estimates are as follows valuation of investments in privately held companies 
we have investments in aegera  micromet and es cell international with original cost bases of   and  respectively 
these investments are included in the deposits and other assets category of our consolidated balance sheets 
at each balance sheet date  we review these investments to determine whether the fair value of these investments is less than the carrying value and  if so  whether we should write down the investment 
these companies are not publicly traded and  therefore  determining the fair value of our investments in these companies involves significant judgment 
we consider available information in estimating the fair value of these investments and  as of december   believe that the fair value of our investments in aegera and es cell are not less than their carrying value 
however  micromet recently announced that it terminated one third of its workforce as the result of a contract dispute with a co development partner that resulted in a significant decrease of previously budgeted cash inflows in accordingly  we concluded that the carrying value of our investment in micromet common stock had been impaired  and we recorded  in other expense to reduce the carrying value to the estimated fair value of  if the financial condition or results of aegera or es cell decline significantly or if micromet s financial condition continues to decline  the fair value of these investments would likely decline and  as a result  we may have to record an impairment charge to the extent such impairment is deemed other than temporary 
timing of deferred revenue recognition 
we have recorded short term deferred revenue of  and long term deferred revenue of  as of december  short term deferred revenue consists of amounts that are expected to be recognized as revenue by december  however  this estimate is based on our current operating plan as of december  if this operating plan should change in the future  we may recognize a different amount of deferred revenue over the twelve month period from january   through december  results of operations years ended december  and revenues total revenues are summarized as follows for the year ended december  research and development contracts and government grants license fees and royalties total revenues the increase in revenue from research and development contracts and government grants for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   was primarily due to our recognition of  in the year ended december   relating to research and development services performed by us under our licensing agreement with es cell international 
effective december  and consistent with the terms of this agreement  we are no longer providing research and development services and will therefore not recognize future revenues related to this collaboration 
the research and development contract and government grant revenue for the year ended december   was derived entirely from revenue recognized under our licensing agreement with es cell international and our former collaboration with micromet 
our license fee revenue for the year ended december   primarily consisted of  in previously deferred revenue which was recognized upon the termination of our collaboration with micromet during the third quarter of the decrease in license fees and royalty revenue for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   was primarily due to the recognition of revenue upon the completion of various transactions in  including  in revenue we recognized upon stryker s buy out of its royalty obligation to us for op and  in revenue we recognized from an up front payment received by us in connection with the licensing of certain of our bmp technologies to ortho biotech 
in addition  we received  in royalty revenue from stryker on sales of op for the year ended december  as part of the stryker transaction  we will receive no future royalties on sales by stryker of op the decrease in license fee and royalty revenue from transactions in was partially offset by the micromet revenue described above

for the years ended december  and   and  respectively  related to our adult stem cell and cell therapy programs 
as further described below  we reduced expenses incurred under our adult stem cell and cell therapy programs in connection with our business realignment in to date  we have not incurred material research and development expenses for our hh small molecule antagonist product candidate for hair growth inhibition 
all expenses relating to the development of our bmp protein product candidate for kidney disease are borne by our partner  ortho biotech 
costs allocated to the curis newco joint venture relate to research expenses incurred by us and charged to curis newco  a joint venture that  until may   was operated by us and affiliates of elan corporation 
of this aggregate amount   was related to our central nervous system disorders program and  was related to our peripheral nervous system disorders program 
the decrease in research and development expenses for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   was primarily due to a reduction in ongoing operating costs as a result of our business realignment in the first quarter of  including reductions in amounts spent on stem cell and cell therapy programs 
as a result of this realignment  our research and development expenses were focused principally on regulatory signaling pathways  particulary the hedgehog pathway  for the year ended december   and spending on our stem cell  cell therapy and other programs decreased by an aggregate of  to  for the year ended december   as compared to  for the year ended december  reductions in spending on our stem cell  cell therapy and other programs were offset by the termination of our collaboration with elan  which resulted in no research and development expense being charged to curis newco in verse  in in  our research and development expenses were presented net of these expenses charged to curis newco 
general and administrative expenses are summarized as follows for the year ended december  personnel occupancy and depreciation legal and professional services consulting services reserve against notes receivable insurance costs other general and administrative expenses total general and administrative expenses the decrease in general and administrative expenses for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   was primarily due to a reduction in ongoing operating costs as a result of our business realignment in the first quarter of  including reductions in personnel costs and legal and professional services 
in addition  the amount charged to reserve for the possible non collection of notes receivable outstanding to two former officers decreased by  to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december  stock based compensation decreased by  or  to  for the year ended december   as compared to  for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in the amount of stock based compensation expense related to our issuance on august  of stock options with exercise prices below fair market value 
we recorded  and  in stock based compensation related to these options for the years ended december  and  respectively 
because these options were issued with exercise prices below fair market value  we recorded deferred compensation and have been amortizing the deferred compensation over the four year vesting period of the options 
when an option holder s employment with us is terminated  we treat any unvested portion of their options and related deferred compensation as charged to additional paid in capital rather than stock based compensation 
accordingly  the departure of four officers and additional employees as a result of the realignment of our business and a subsequent staff reduction in december has resulted in a decrease in stock based compensation expense  as the remaining deferred compensation balance associated with each terminated employees august   stock options was immediately charged to additional paid in capital 
amortization of intangible assets decreased by  or  to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to an impairment charge of approximately  that we recorded during the fourth quarter of the year ended december   to reduce the carrying value of patents associated with our op technology that is licensed to stryker 
the charge was recorded as a result of our transaction with stryker  under which stryker bought out its future royalty obligation to us on sales of op for  we wrote these patents off because we will not receive any future royalties or other revenue from stryker and because these patents cannot be utilized for alternative uses in either current or future operations 
loss on property and equipment for the year ended december   of  related to impairment on assets at our facility at erie street in cambridge  massachusetts 
the total carrying value of assets at the erie street facility before the impairment charge was approximately  the property and equipment assets at the erie street facility were used to support clinical programs that were suspended or terminated as part of the realignment and were deemed to be unlikely to be used in our future operations 
of the impairment charge   related to the write off of tenant improvements made to the erie street facility since such improvements were affixed to the facility and therefore could not have been sold separately 
the remaining  of impairment charge was to write down furniture and equipment assets to their estimated salvage value 
we do not expect to incur additional impairment on property and equipment related to the realignment in future periods 
the amount we received from the sale of these assets was not significantly different from the originally estimated salvage value 
impairment of goodwill for the year ended december  was  in accordance with sfas no 
 we concluded that the decline in our market capitalization during the three month period ended june  indicated that the carrying value of our goodwill might be impaired 
accordingly  we conducted an impairment review as required under sfas no 
as of june   and determined that goodwill impairment had occurred as of june  our value  as a single reporting unit  was calculated using quoted market prices adjusted to provide for a control premium 
in calculating the impairment charge  the fair value of our intangible assets  principally consisting of completed and in process technology  was estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology 
realignment expenses of  were recorded for the year ended december  these charges relate to  associated with workforce reductions of people  including officers   associated with the closing of clinical programs and decommissioning of a manufacturing and development facility and other costs of  as of december   we expended approximately all of the  in realignment expenses 
we do not expect to incur additional expenses related to this realignment in future periods 
equity in loss from joint venture we recorded no equity in loss from joint venture during the year ended december   as compared to  during the year ended december  the equity in loss from joint venture relates to a joint venture  curis newco  which we formed in july with affiliates of elan corporation 
this joint venture was terminated on may  as a result of the termination  we now own of the outstanding shares of curis newco 
other income expense for the year ended december   interest income was  as compared to  for the year ended december   a decrease of  or 
the decrease in interest income resulted from a lower available investment balance and lower average investment yields for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  for the year ended december   other expense was  as compared to other income of  for the year ended december   a decrease of  this decrease was principally due to an impairment charge of  for the write off of a euro denominated note receivable from micromet  a former collaborator  during the fourth quarter of the year ended december   as well as a decrease in the gain recognized on currency rate fluctuations on the micromet note receivable of  in addition  the amount of gain recognized on sales of securities decreased by  in the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  we recognized gains on sales of securities of  for the year ended december   as compared to  for the year ended december  for the year ended december   interest expense was  as compared to  for the year ended december   a decrease of  or 
the decrease in interest expense resulted from the decrease in the amount of interest expense that we paid on capital leases in compared to accretion on series a convertible exchangeable preferred stock accretion of preferred stock dividend for the year ended december  was  as compared to  for the year ended december   a decrease of  or 
this charge relates to the accretion of a mandatory dividend on shares of convertible exchangeable preferred stock issued to an affiliate of elan as part of a joint venture with elan 
the decrease is attributed to the termination of the joint venture on may   in which the convertible exchangeable preferred stock was cancelled as part of the termination 
the amounts are included in the net loss applicable to common stockholders for the years ended december  and net loss applicable to common stockholders as a result of the foregoing  we incurred a net loss applicable to common stockholders of  for the year ended december   as compared to  for the year ended december  years ended december  and revenues total revenues are summarized as follows for the year ended december  research and development contracts and government grants license fees and royalties total revenues revenue from research and development contracts and government grants for the year ended december   was derived entirely from revenue recognized under our licensing agreement with es cell international and our former collaboration with micromet 
for the year ended december   this revenue was derived solely from government grants 
the increase in license fees and royalties for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   was primarily due to the recognition of revenue upon the completion of various transactions in including  in revenue we recognized upon stryker s buy out of its royalty obligation to us for op   in revenue we recognized from an up front payment received by us in connection with the licensing of certain of our bmp technology to ortho biotech and  we recognized under other transactions completed in in addition  royalty revenue received in from stryker on sales of op increased by  to  for the year ended december   as compared to  for the year ended december  as part of the stryker transaction  we will receive no future royalties on sales by stryker of op operating expenses research and development expenses are summarized as follows year ended december  research and development program primary indication hh small molecule antagonist basal cell carcinoma   hh small molecule antagonist and hh small molecule antibody antagonist cancer   hh small molecule agonist central nervous system disorders   hh small molecule agonist peripheral nervous system disorders   hh small molecule agonist hair loss other programs costs allocated to curis newco joint venture total research and development expense in the foregoing table  other programs includes expenses related to our hh agonist protein gene product candidate for cardiovascular disease  as well as research and development expenses relating to adult stem cell and cell therapy programs

for the year ended december    was related to our central nervous system disorders program and  was related to our peripheral nervous system disorders program 
the decrease in research and development expenses for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   was primarily due to a reduction in ongoing operating costs as a result of our business realignment in the first quarter of  particularly for reductions in amounts spent on our cell therapy programs since all such programs were terminated as a result of this realignment 
spending on our cell therapy programs decreased by  to  for the year ended december   as compared to  for the year ended december  in addition  our research expenses charged to curis newco increased by  from  for year ended december   to  for the year ended december  this resulted in lower research and development expenses in  as compared to  since research and development expenses at our consolidated statement of operations are presented net of expenses charged to curis newco

we also entered into two agreements in for the sublease of  square feet of lab and office space  resulting in decreases to our occupancy costs in stock based compensation decreased by  or  to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily attributable to the stock based compensation expense related to deferred compensation resulting from our merger in this stock based compensation  which was  for the year ended december   was amortized over the vesting period of the underlying options through august  because the amortization period ended on august   we recorded no stock based compensation related to these options for the year ended december  in addition  there was a decrease in the amount of stock based compensation expense related to our issuance on august   of stock options with exercise prices below fair market value 
we recorded  and  in stock based compensation related to these options for the years ended december  and  respectively 
because these options were issued with exercise prices below fair market value  we recorded deferred compensation and have been amortizing the deferred compensation over the four year vesting period of the options 
when an option holder s employment with us is terminated  we treat any unvested portion of their options and related deferred compensation as charged to additional paid in capital rather than to stock based compensation 
accordingly  the departure of four officers and approximately other employees as a result of the realignment of our business and a subsequent staff reduction in december has resulted in a decrease of stock based compensation expense  since the remaining deferred compensation balance associated with each terminated employees august   stock options was immediately charged to additional paid in capital 
the remaining deferred compensation related to the august   options will be amortized in amortization of intangible assets decreased by  or  to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to the adoption of sfas  which required companies to stop amortizing goodwill and certain other intangible assets 
we currently amortize only capitalized patent and technology costs 
amortization of goodwill totaling  was recorded for the year ended december  loss on property and equipment for the year ended december  of  related to impairment on assets at our facility at erie street in cambridge  massachusetts  as described above 
impairment of goodwill for the year ended december  was  as described above 
realignment expenses of  were recorded for the year ended december  these charges relate to i  associated with workforce reductions of people  including officers  ii  associated with the closing of clinical programs and decommissioning of a manufacturing and development facility and other costs of  as of december   we expended approximately all of the  in realignment expenses 
we do not expect to incur additional expenses in future periods 
equity in loss from joint venture equity in loss from joint venture decreased by  or  to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december  the equity in loss from joint venture related to our joint venture with affiliates of elan 
the decrease was primarily caused by our  or  share of a  write off of technology recorded by the joint venture in july this decrease was partially offset by an increase in our share of ongoing operating expenses recorded by the joint venture for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  the increase in ongoing operating expenses for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   was primarily caused by the joint venture operating for twelve months in versus five months in other income expenses for the year ended december   interest income was  as compared to  for the year ended december   a decrease of  or 
the decrease in interest income resulted from a lower available investment balance and lower average investment yields for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  for the year ended december   other income was  as compared to  for the year ended december   a decrease of  or 
this decrease was principally due to a decrease in the amount of gain recognized on sales of exelixis common stock 
we recognized gains of  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively  related to sales of exelixis  inc common stock 
the decrease in the gain recognized on sales of exelixis common stock was partially offset by an increase in the gain recognized on currency rate fluctuations on a euro denominated note receivable issued to us by micromet in connection with a collaboration 
we recognized gains on currency rate fluctuations of  and  respectively  for the years ended december  and for the year ended december   interest expense was  as compared to  for the year ended december   an increase of  or 
the increase in interest expense resulted partially from the increase in the amount that we owed to elan pharma international  ltd  an affiliate of elan  as part of our curis newco joint venture 
interest expense associated with the curis newco joint venture increased to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december  in addition  we incurred  for the year ended december  in non cash interest expense related to a  convertible subordinated note payable issued to becton dickinson in june this represented a  increase over the  incurred for the year ended december  these increases were partially offset by a decrease in interest expense paid on capital leases in compared to accretion on series a convertible exchangeable preferred stock accretion on series a convertible exchangeable preferred stock increased by  or  to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december  this charge relates to the accretion of a mandatory dividend on shares of convertible exchangeable preferred stock issued to an affiliate of elan 
the amounts are included in the net loss applicable to common stockholders for years ended december  and net loss applicable to common stockholders as a result of the foregoing  we incurred a net loss applicable to common stockholders of  for the year ended december   as compared to  for the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources our liquidity requirements have historically consisted of research and development expenses  capital expenditures  working capital and general corporate expenses 
at december   our principal sources of liquidity consisted of cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities and long term investments of  excluding restricted cash and cash equivalents of  since inception  we have financed our operations primarily through license fees  research and development funding from our collaborative partners  the private and public placement of our equity securities  debt financing and the amortization of certain royalty rights 
net cash used in operating activities was  for the year ended december   as compared to  for the year ended december  cash used in operating activities during the year ended december  was primarily to fund our net loss of  partially offset by  in non cash charges including stock based compensation expense  depreciation and amortization  non cash interest expense on notes payable  amortization of intangible assets and an impairment of a long term note receivable and investment in micronet  a former collaborator of ours 
in addition  we used  of operating cash as a result of changes in certain of our operating assets and liabilities during the year ended december  net cash used in operating activities during the year ended december   was primarily the result of our net loss for the period of  partially offset by  in non cash charges including impairment charges on our intangible and tangible assets  stock based compensation  depreciation  amortization and non cash interest income and expense 
our net loss was further offset by our equity in loss of joint venture and our use of operating cash as a result of changes in certain of our assets and liabilities 
investing activities generated  of net cash for the year ended december   as compared to net cash used in investing activities of  for the year ended december  net cash generated for the year ended december   was driven by a reduction in restricted cash balances of  resulting from the full repayment of our loan agreement with the boston private bank trust company 
cash used by investing activities in was primarily the result of the transfer of  to a restricted cash account under the terms of a debt agreement with the boston private bank trust company  offset in part by net proceeds from the sale of marketable securities 
financing activities generated  of net cash for the year ended december   as compared to net cash used in financing activities of  for the year ended december  the cash generated by financing activities during was principally the result of the sale of  of our common stock  including  from a private placement of  shares of common stock  and warrants to purchase  shares of common stock  in august   from the sale of  shares of common stock to genentech  and  in proceeds received upon stock option exercises 
these amounts were partially offset by repayments of debt totaling  including  in full repayment of our debt with the boston private bank trust company   as partial repayment of our convertible promissory note payable to elan pursuant to our may  termination agreement  and  in repayments of notes payable and capital leases 
the cash used in financing activities for the year ended december  was primarily due to  in net repayments of obligations under capital lease and debt arrangements 
in addition  we used  in cash to repurchase shares of our common stock during in june   we licensed our small molecule and antibody antagonists of the hedgehog signaling pathway to genentech for applications in cancer therapy pursuant to the terms of a collaborative research  development and license agreement 
the collaboration agreement provides for cash payments from genentech  including an up front payment of  maintenance fee payments totaling  over the first two years of the collaboration  none of which was received in  and milestone payments at various intervals during the regulatory approval process of small molecule and antibody product candidates  assuming specified research objectives are met 
genentech is also obligated to pay us a royalty on potential future product sales 
under the terms of the collaboration agreement  we are required to commit eight employees to the small molecule and or antibody programs for a period of two years 
we are recognizing revenue related to the  up front payment and the  maintenance fee payments receivable over our estimated period of involvement related to the collaboration 
under our current operating plan  we expect to recognize approximately  in related to these payments 
in addition  as partial consideration for the rights and licenses granted under the collaboration agreement  with respect to certain types of licensed compounds  we sold  shares of our common stock to genentech at a purchase price of per share for aggregate proceeds of  pursuant to the terms of a stock purchase agreement 
we also entered into a registration rights agreement with genentech covering the registration of the shares of common stock for resale under specified conditions 
in april  we amended our loan agreement with the boston private bank trust company 
under the terms of the amended loan amendment  we ceased making our quarterly principal payments 
instead  the loan was structured as a revolving credit facility under which up to  could have been borrowed and remained outstanding until the repayment date of april  we continued to pay interest monthly in arrears at variable interest rates during this loan was fully collateralized with a money market account maintained at the boston private bank trust company 
in december  we paid in full the outstanding loan balance of  with funds held in our fully collateralized money market account at the boston private bank trust company 
we had paid  earlier in in july  we issued to elan shares of our series a convertible exchangeable preferred stock valued at  to fund our pro rata share of the initial capitalization of curis newco 
we recorded a charge to accumulated deficit of  for the year ended december   for the accretion of a mandatory dividend on the preferred stock 
such amounts are included in the net loss applicable to common stockholders for the year ended december  the preferred stock  which had a carrying value of  was cancelled on the may  termination date of the joint venture program with elan 
as partial consideration for the rights and benefits described in the termination agreement  including the cancellation of the preferred stock  we issued  shares of our common stock to elan  having a fair value of  based on the may  closing price of our common stock on the nasdaq national market 
upon the termination of the elan agreement  we recorded a credit to additional paid in capital of  to reflect the cancellation of the preferred stock and the forgiveness of debt in exchange for the issuance of our common stock 
lastly  as a result of the termination  all rights granted by both us and elan at the formation of curis newco under separate license agreements with curis newco terminated 
in addition  intellectual property created by curis newco is owned by us  both in our own right and as sole shareholder of curis newco 
according to provisions in the termination agreement  we will pay elan future compensation  in the form of future royalty payments  in the event of any direct sales or third party commercialization agreements related to certain compounds 
in june  we received  from becton dickinson under a convertible subordinated note payable in connection with the exercise by becton dickinson of an option to negotiate a collaboration agreement 
the note payable is repayable at any time up to its maturity date of june   by us  at our discretion  in either cash or issuance to becton dickinson of shares of our common stock 
the note payable bears interest at 
as of december   there was  including  in accrued interest  outstanding under the note payable 
we lease equipment under various capital lease arrangements 
monthly payments on leases outstanding as of december  range from  to  and maturities range from march to july the initial terms of the leases range from months to months and bear interest at rates ranging from to 
as of december    was outstanding under these agreements and we were in compliance with all material covenants under these agreements 
as of december   we had future payments required under contractual obligations and other commitments as follows amounts in s total convertible subordinated long term debt capital lease obligations operating lease obligations outside service obligations licensing obligations total future obligations convertible subordinated debt is convertible into either shares of our common stock or payable in cash at our option 
we anticipate that existing capital resources should enable us to maintain current and planned operations into the first half of we expect to incur substantial additional research and development and other costs  including costs related to preclinical studies and clinical trials for the foreseeable future 
our ability to continue funding planned operations beyond the first half of is dependent upon the success of our collaborations  our ability to maintain or reduce our cash burn rate and our ability to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings  or from other sources of financing 
our ability to generate sufficient cash flows depends on a number of factors  including the ability of either us or our collaborators to obtain regulatory approval to market and commercialize products to treat indications in major commercial markets 
we are seeking additional collaborative arrangements and also expect to raise funds through one or more financing transactions  if conditions permit 
due to our significant long term capital requirements  we intend to seek to raise funds through the sale of debt or equity securities when conditions are favorable  even if we do not have an immediate need for additional capital at such time 
additional financing may not be available or  if available  it may not be available on favorable terms 
in addition  the sale of additional debt or equity securities could result in dilution to our stockholders 
if substantial additional funding is not available  our ability to fund research and development and other operations will be significantly affected and  accordingly  our business will be materially and adversely affected 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements as of december  inflation we believe that inflation has not had a significant impact on our revenue and results of operations since inception 
new accounting pronouncements in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities and  in december  issued a revision to that interpretation fin r 
fin r replaces fin and addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities that possess certain characteristics 
a variable interest entity vie is defined as a an ownership  contractual or monetary interest in an entity where the ability to influence financial decisions is not proportional to the investment interest  or b an entity lacking the invested capital sufficient to fund future activities without the support of a third party 
fin r establishes standards for determining under what circumstances vies should be consolidated with their primary beneficiary  including those to which the usual condition for consolidation does not apply 
our adoption of fin r is not expected to have any effect on our financial position or results of operations 
in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement amends and clarifies financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  collectively referred to as derivatives  and for hedging activities under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
is effective for contracts entered into or modified and for hedging relationships designated after june  at december   we had no financial instruments falling within the scope of sfas no 
in may  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
it requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability or an asset in some circumstances 
many of those instruments were previously classified as equity 
this statement is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after december  the adoption of sfas did not have a material effect on our financial statements 
in may  the fasb also issued eitf  determining whether an arrangement contains a lease  which requires capital lease treatment for arrangements containing an embedded lease  thereby conveying the right to control the use of property  plant or equipment collectively  property whether the right to control the use of the property is explicitly or implicitly specified 
the right is conveyed if the purchaser lessee obtains physical or operational control of the underlying property or takes substantially all of its output 
this pronouncement applies prospectively to new or modified arrangements beginning after may  the adoption of eitf had no impact on our financial statements 
effective july   we adopted eitf  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  which establishes criteria for whether revenue on a deliverable can be recognized separately from other deliverables in a multiple deliverable arrangement 
the criteria considers whether the delivered item has stand alone value to the customer  whether the fair value of the delivered item can be reliably determined and the customer s right of return for the delivered item 
the adoption of eitf did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
on december   the staff of the securities and exchange commission sec or the staff issued sab  revenue recognition  which amends sab  revenue recognition in financial statements 
sab s primary purpose is to rescind accounting guidance contained in sab related to multiple element revenue arrangements  superseded as a result of the issuance of eitf additionally  sab rescinds the sec s revenue recognition in financial statements frequently asked questions and answers the faq issued with sab that had been codified in sec topic  revenue recognition 
selected portions of the faq have been incorporated into sab while the wording of sab has changed to reflect the issuance of eitf  the revenue recognition principles of sab remain largely unchanged by the issuance of sab the adoption of sab did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
factors that may affect results risks relating to our financial results and need for financing we have incurred substantial losses  we expect to continue to incur substantial losses and we may never achieve profitability 
we expect to incur substantial operating losses for the foreseeable future  and we have no current sources of material ongoing revenue 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
it is uncertain when  if ever  we will develop significant sources of ongoing revenue or achieve profitability  even if we are able to develop and commercialize products 
even if our collaboration agreements provide funding for a portion of our research and development expenses for some of our programs  we expect to spend significant capital to fund our internal research and development programs for the foreseeable future 
as a result  we will need to generate significant revenues in order to achieve profitability 
we cannot be certain whether or when this will occur because of the significant uncertainties that affect our business 
our failure to become and remain profitable may depress the market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital  expand our business  diversify our product offerings or continue our operations 
we are likely to require additional financing  which may be difficult to obtain and may dilute your ownership interest in us 
we will require substantial funds to continue our research and development programs 
we believe that our existing cash and working capital should be sufficient to fund our operations until the first half of however  our future capital requirements may vary from what we expect and will depend on numerous factors  many of which are outside our control  including the following continued progress in our research and development programs  as well as the magnitude of these programs  the cost of additional facilities requirements  if any  our ability to establish and maintain collaborative arrangements  the timing  receipt and amount of research funding and milestone  license  royalty and other payments  if any  from collaborative partners  the timing  payment and amount of research funding and milestone  license  royalty and other payments due to licensors of patent rights and technology used to make  use and sell our product candidates  the timing  receipt and amount of sales revenues and associated royalties to us  if any  from our product candidates in the market  the cost of manufacturing and commercialization activities  if any  and the costs of preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining and enforcing patent claims and other patent related costs  including litigation costs and technology license fees 
we expect to seek additional funding through collaborative arrangements with strategic partners and may seek additional funding through public or private financings 
however  the biotechnology market in general  and the market for our common stock  in particular  is highly volatile 
due to market conditions and the status of our development pipeline  additional funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms  if at all 
if we fail to obtain such additional financing on a timely basis  our ability to continue all of our research  development  commercialization  manufacturing and marketing activities will be adversely affected 
if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities  dilution to our stockholders will result 
in addition  the terms of such a financing may adversely affect other rights of our stockholders 
we also could elect to seek funds through arrangements with collaborative partners or others that may require us to relinquish rights to certain technologies  product candidates or products 
if the estimates we make and the assumptions on which we rely in preparing our financial statements prove inaccurate  our actual results may vary significantly 
our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of our assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  the amounts of charges taken by us and related disclosure 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
there can be no assurance  however  that our estimates  or the assumptions underlying them  will be correct 
our actual financial results may vary significantly from the estimates contained in our financial statements 
risks relating to our collaborations we are dependent on collaborative partners for the development and commercialization of many of our product candidates 
if we lose any of these partners  of if they fail or delay in developing or commercializing our product candidates  our anticipated product pipeline and operating results would suffer 
the success of our strategy for development and commercialization of product candidates depends upon our ability to form and maintain productive strategic collaborations 
we currently have strategic collaborations with genentech  ortho biotech products  and wyeth 
we expect to enter into additional collaborations in the future 
our existing and any future alliances may not be scientifically or commercially successful 
the risks that we face in connection with these alliances include the following each of our collaborators has significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources that they will apply to the collaboration 
the timing and amount of any future royalty and milestone revenue that we may receive under such collaborative arrangements will depend on  among other things  such collaborator s efforts and allocation of resources 
all of our strategic alliance agreements are for fixed terms and are subject to termination under various circumstances  including in some cases  on short notice without cause 
if any collaborative partner were to terminate an agreement  we may be required to undertake product development  manufacturing and commercialization and we may not have the funds or capability to do this  which could result in a discontinuation of such program 
our collaborators may develop and commercialize  either alone or with others  products and services that are similar to or competitive with the products and services that are the subject of the alliance with us 
our collaborators may change the focus of their development and commercialization efforts 
pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies historically have re evaluated their priorities following mergers and consolidations  which have been common in recent years in these industries 
the ability of certain of our product candidates to reach their potential could be limited if our collaborators decrease or fail to increase spending related to such product candidates 
we may not be successful in establishing additional strategic alliances  which could adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize products and services 
as an integral part of our ongoing research and development efforts  we periodically review opportunities to establish new collaborations  joint ventures and strategic alliances for the development and commercialization of products in our development pipeline 
we face significant competition in seeking appropriate collaborators and the negotiation process is time consuming and complex 
we may not be successful in our efforts to establish additional strategic alliances or other alternative arrangements 
even if we are successful in our efforts to establish an alliance or agreement  the terms that we establish may not be favorable to us 
finally  such strategic alliances or other arrangements may not result in successful products and associated revenue 
risks related to our business  industry  strategy and operations other than op  which we and stryker commercialized under our former collaboration  we have not commercialized any products to date  either alone or with a collaborator 
if we are not able to commercialize any products  we will not be profitable 
most of our product opportunities are in various stages of preclinical development 
because our product opportunities have several years of development prior to reaching commercialization  there is a substantial risk that none of our current product opportunities will ever be commercialized 
if none of our product opportunities are commercialized  we will not be profitable 
we face substantial competition  which may result in our competitors discovering  developing or commercializing products before or more successfully than we do 
our product candidates face competition with existing and new products being developed by biotechnology  medical device and pharmaceutical companies  as well as universities and other research institutions 
for example  research in the fields of regulatory signaling pathways and functional genomics  which includes our work in cancer  with genentech and renal disease  with ortho biotech  is highly competitive 
a number of entities are seeking to identify and patent randomly sequenced genes and gene fragments  typically without specific knowledge of the function that such genes or gene fragments perform 
our competitors may discover  characterize and develop important inducing molecules or genes in advance of us 
we also face competition from these and other entities in gaining access to dna samples used in our research and development projects 
many of our competitors have substantially greater capital resources  research and development staffs and facilities than we have 
efforts by other biotechnology  medical device and pharmaceutical companies could render our programs or products uneconomical or result in therapies superior to those that we develop alone or with a collaboration partner 
for those programs that we have selected for further internal development  we face competition from companies that are more experienced in product development and commercialization  obtaining regulatory approvals and product manufacturing 
as a result  they may develop competing products more rapidly and at a lower cost 
for those programs that are subject to a collaboration agreement  competitors may discover  develop and commercialize products which render our products non competitive or obsolete 
we expect competition to intensify in genomics research and regulatory signaling pathways as technical advances in the field are made and become more widely known 
since our technologies have many potential applications and we have limited resources  our election to focus on a particular application may result in our failure to capitalize on other potentially profitable applications of our technologies 
we have limited financial and managerial resources 
these limitations require us to focus on a select group of product candidates in specific therapeutic areas and to forego the exploration of other product opportunities 
while our technologies may permit us to work in multiple areas  resource commitments may require trade offs resulting in delays in the development of certain programs or research areas  which may place us at a competitive disadvantage 
our decisions as to resource allocation may not lead to the development of viable commercial products and may divert resources away from other market opportunities which ultimately prove to be more profitable 
if we or our collaborators fail to achieve market acceptance for our products under development  our future revenue and ability to achieve profitability may be adversely affected 
if any of our product opportunities ever receive regulatory approval  the commercial success of these products will depend upon their acceptance by patients  the medical community and third party payors 
our future products  if any are successfully developed  may not gain commercial acceptance among physicians  patients and third party payors  even if necessary marketing approvals have been obtained 
we believe that recommendations and endorsements by physicians will be essential for market acceptance of our products 
if we are not able to obtain a positive reception for our products  our expected revenues from sales of these products would be adversely affected 
we could be exposed to significant risk from liability claims if we are unable to obtain insurance at acceptable costs or otherwise protect ourselves against potential product liability claims 
we may be subjected to product liability claims arising from the testing  manufacturing  marketing and sale of human health care products 
product liability claims  inherent in the process of researching and developing human health care products  could expose us to significant liabilities and prevent or interfere with the development or commercialization of our product candidates 
product liability claims would require us to spend significant time  money and other resources to defend such claims and could ultimately lead to our having to pay a significant damage award 
product liability insurance is expensive to procure for biopharmaceutical companies such as ours 
although we maintain product liability insurance coverage for the clinical trials of our products under development  it is possible that we will not be able to obtain additional product liability insurance on acceptable terms  if at all  and that our product liability insurance coverage will not prove to be adequate to protect us from all potential claims 
our growth could be limited if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel and consultants 
our success depends on the ability to attract  train and retain qualified scientific and technical personnel to further our research and development efforts 
the loss of services of one or more of our key employees or consultants could have a negative impact on our business and operating results 
locating candidates with the appropriate qualifications can be difficult 
although we expect to be able to attract and retain sufficient numbers of highly skilled employees for the foreseeable future  we may not be able to do so 
any growth and expansion into areas and activities that may require additional human resources or expertise  such as regulatory affairs and compliance  would require us to either hire new key personnel or obtain such services via an outsourcing arrangement 
the pool of personnel with the skills that we require is limited 
we may not be able to hire or contract such additional personnel 
risks relating to clinical and regulatory matters we expect to rely heavily on third parties for the conduct of clinical trials of our product candidates 
if these clinical trials are not successful  or if we or our collaborators are not able to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals  we will not be able to commercialize our product candidates 
in order to obtain regulatory approval for the commercial sale of our product candidates  we and our collaborators will be required to complete extensive preclinical studies as well as clinical trials in humans to demonstrate to the fda and foreign regulatory authorities that our product candidates are safe and effective 
we have limited experience in conducting clinical trials and expect to rely primarily on contract research organizations and collaborative partners for their performance and management of clinical trials of our product candidates 
clinical development  including preclinical testing  is a long  expensive and uncertain process 
accordingly  clinical trials  if any  of our product candidates under development may not be successful 
we and our collaborators could experience delays in preclinical or clinical trials of any of our product candidates  obtain unfavorable results in a development program  or fail to obtain regulatory approval for the commercialization of a product 
furthermore  the timing and completion of clinical trials  if any  of our product candidates depend on  among other factors  the numbers of patients required for approval and the rate at which those patients are enrolled 
any increase in the required number of patients or decrease in recruitment rates may result in increased costs  program delays or both 
also  our products under development may not be effective in treating any of our targeted disorders or may prove to have undesirable or unintended side effects  toxicities or other characteristics that may prevent or limit their commercial use 
any of these events would adversely affect our ability to market a product candidate 
the development process necessary to obtain regulatory approval is lengthy  complex and expensive 
if we and our collaborative partners do not obtain necessary regulatory approvals  then our business will be unsuccessful and the market price of our common stock will substantially decline 
to the extent that we are able to advance an internal program through the clinic  we will be required to obtain regulatory approval for any product we develop in such program 
in instances where our product candidates are being developed by our collaborators  our partners will be required to obtain regulatory approval for marketing and selling efforts 
the process of obtaining fda and other required regulatory approvals is expensive 
the time required for fda and other approvals is uncertain and typically takes a number of years  depending on the complexity and novelty of the product 
the process of obtaining fda and other required regulatory approvals for many of our products under development is further complicated because some of these products use non traditional or novel materials in non traditional or novel ways  and the regulatory officials have little precedent to follow 
to date  we have limited experience in filing and prosecuting applications to obtain marketing approval 
any regulatory approval to market a product may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which we may market the product 
these limitations may restrict the size of the market for the product and affect reimbursement by third party payors 
in addition  regulatory agencies may not grant approvals on a timely basis or may revoke or significantly modify previously granted approvals 
we also are subject to numerous foreign regulatory requirements governing the manufacturing and marketing of our potential future products outside of the united states 
the approval procedure varies among countries  and the time required to obtain foreign approvals often differs from that required to obtain fda approvals 
moreover  approval by the fda does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries  and vice versa 
as a result of these factors  we or our collaborators may not successfully begin or complete clinical trials in the time periods estimated  if at all 
moreover  if we or our collaborators incur costs and delays in development programs or fail to successfully develop and commercialize products based upon our technologies  our stock price could decline 
even if marketing approval is obtained  internally developed or licensed products will be subject to ongoing regulatory oversight which may affect the successful commercialization of our products 
even if regulatory approval of a product candidate is obtained by us or our collaborators  the approval may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the product is marketed or require costly post marketing follow up studies 
after marketing approval for any product is obtained  the manufacturer and the manufacturing facilities for that product will be subject to continual review and periodic inspections by the fda and other regulatory agencies 
the subsequent discovery of previously unknown problems with the product  or with the manufacturer or facility  may result in restrictions on the product or manufacturer  including withdrawal of the product from the market 
if there is a failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements  we or our collaborator may be subject to fines  suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals  product recalls  seizure of products  operating restrictions  and criminal prosecution 
we are subject to governmental regulations other than those imposed by the fda 
we may not be able to comply with these regulations  which could subject us to penalties and otherwise result in the limitation of our operations 
in addition to regulations imposed by the fda  we are subject to regulation under the occupational safety and health act  the environmental protection act  the toxic substances control act  the research conservation and recovery act  as well as regulations administered by the nuclear regulatory commission  national restrictions on technology transfer  import  export and customs regulations and certain other local  state or federal regulations 
from time to time  other federal agencies and congressional committees have indicated an interest in implementing further regulation of biotechnology applications 
we are not able to predict whether any such regulations will be adopted or whether  if adopted  such regulations will apply to our business  or whether we would be able to comply with any applicable regulations 
our research and development activities involve the controlled use of hazardous materials and chemicals 
although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of such materials comply with all applicable laws and regulations  we cannot completely eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury caused by these materials 
risks relating to product manufacturing and sales we will depend on our collaborators and third party manufacturers to produce most  if not all  of our products under development  and if these third parties do not successfully manufacture these products our business will be harmed 
we have no manufacturing experience or manufacturing capabilities 
in order to continue to develop products  apply for regulatory approvals  and commercialize our products  we or our collaborators must be able to manufacture products in commercial quantities  in compliance with regulatory requirements  at acceptable costs and in a timely manner 
the manufacture of our product candidates may be complex  difficult to accomplish and difficult to scale up when large scale production is required 
manufacture may be subject to delays  inefficiencies and poor or low yields of quality products 
the cost of manufacturing some of our products may make them prohibitively expensive 
if supplies of any of our product candidates or related materials become unavailable on a timely basis or at all or are contaminated or otherwise lost  clinical trials by us and our collaborators could be seriously delayed 
this is due to the fact that such materials are time consuming to manufacture and cannot be readily obtained from third party sources 
to the extent that we or our collaborators seek to enter into manufacturing arrangements with third parties  there will be a dependency upon these third parties to perform their obligations in a timely and effective manner and in accordance with government regulations 
if third party manufacturers fail to perform their obligations  our competitive position and ability to generate revenue may be adversely affected in a number of ways  including  we and our collaborators may not be able to initiate or continue clinical trials of products that are under development  we and our collaborators may be delayed in submitting applications for regulatory approvals for our product candidates  and we and our collaborators may not be able to meet commercial demands for any approved products 
we have no sales or marketing experience and  as such  will depend significantly on third parties who may not successfully sell our products 
we have no sales  marketing or product distribution experience 
if we receive required regulatory approvals  we plan to rely primarily on sales  marketing and distribution arrangements with third parties  including our collaborative partners 
for example  as part of our agreements with genentech  ortho biotech and wyeth  we have granted our collaborators exclusive rights to distribute certain products resulting from such collaborations  if any are ever successfully developed 
we may have to enter into additional marketing arrangements in the future and we may not be able to enter into these additional arrangements on terms which are favorable to us  if at all 
in addition  we may have limited or no control over the sales  marketing and distribution activities of these third parties and sales through these third parties could be less profitable to us than direct sales 
these third parties could sell competing products and may devote insufficient sales efforts to our products 
our future revenues will be materially dependent upon the success of the efforts of these third parties 
we may seek to independently market products that are not already subject to marketing agreements with other parties 
if we determine to perform sales  marketing and distribution functions ourselves  we could face a number of additional risks  including we may not be able to attract and build a significant and skilled marketing staff or sales force  the cost of establishing a marketing staff or sales force may not be justifiable in light of the revenues generated by any particular product  and our direct sales and marketing efforts may not be successful 
risks relating to intellectual property if we breach any of the agreements under which we license or have acquired intellectual property from others  we could lose intellectual property rights that are important to our business 
we are a party to intellectual property licenses and agreements that are important to our business and expect to enter into similar licenses and agreements in the future 
these licenses and agreements impose various research  development  commercialization  sublicensing  royalty  indemnification  insurance and other obligations on us 
if we or our collaborators fail to perform under these agreements or otherwise breach obligations thereunder  we could lose intellectual property rights that are important to our business 
we may not be able to obtain patent protection for our discoveries and our technologies may be found to infringe patent rights of third parties 
the patent positions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  including ours  are generally uncertain and involve complex legal  scientific and factual questions 
the long term success of our enterprise depends in significant part on our ability to obtain patents to protect our discoveries  protect trade secrets from disclosure to third party competitors  operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others  and prevent others from infringing on our proprietary rights 
patents may not issue from any of the patent applications that we own or license 
if patents do issue  the allowed claims may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology from exploitation by our competitors 
in addition  issued patents that we own or license may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented 
our patents also may not afford us protection against competitors with similar technology 
because patent applications in the united states are maintained in secrecy until months after filing  it is possible that third parties have filed or maintained patent applications for technology used by us or covered by our pending patent applications without our knowledge 
we may not have rights under patents which may cover one or more of our product candidates 
in some cases  these patents may be owned or controlled by third party competitors and may impair our ability to exploit our technology 
as a result  we or our collaborative partners may be required to obtain licenses under third party patents to develop and commercialize some of our product candidates 
if we are unable to secure licenses to such patented technology on acceptable terms  we or our collaborative partners will not be able to develop and commercialize the affected product candidate or candidates 
if we are unable to keep our trade secrets confidential  our technology and information may be used by others to compete against us 
we also rely significantly upon proprietary technology  information  processes and know how that is not subject to patent protection 
we seek to protect this information through confidentiality agreements with our employees  consultants and other third party contractors as well as through other security measures 
these confidentiality agreements may be breached  and we may not have adequate remedies for such breach 
in addition  our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors 
we may become involved in expensive patent litigation or other intellectual property proceedings which could result in liability for damages or stop our development and commercialization efforts 
there has been substantial litigation and other proceedings regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries 
we may become a party to patent litigation or other proceedings regarding intellectual property rights 
situations which may give rise to patent litigation or other disputes over the use of our intellectual property include initiation of litigation or other proceedings against third parties to enforce our patent rights  initiation of litigation or other proceedings against third parties to seek to invalidate the patents held by these third parties or to obtain a judgment that our product candidates or proposed services do not infringe the third parties patents  participation in interference or opposition proceedings to determine the priority of invention if our competitors file patent applications that claim technology also claimed by us  initiation of litigation by third parties claiming that our processes or product candidates or the intended use of our product candidates infringe their patent or other intellectual property rights  and initiation of litigation by us or third parties seeking to enforce contract rights relating to intellectual property which may be important to our business 
the costs associated with any patent litigation or other proceeding  even if resolved favorably  likely would be substantial 
some of our competitors may be able to sustain the cost of such litigation or other proceedings more effectively than we can because of their substantially greater financial resources 
if a patent litigation or other intellectual property proceeding is resolved unfavorably  we or our collaborative partners may be enjoined from manufacturing or selling our products and services without a license from the other party and be held liable for significant damages 
moreover  we may not be able to obtain required licenses on commercially acceptable terms or any terms at all 
in addition  we could be held liable for lost profits if we are found to have infringed a valid patent  or liable for treble damages if we are found to have willfully infringed a valid patent 
litigation results are highly unpredictable and we or our collaborative partners may not prevail in any patent litigation or other proceeding in which we may become involved 
uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could damage our ability to compete in the marketplace 
patent litigation and other proceedings may also absorb significant management time and expense 
if licensees or assignees of our intellectual property rights breach any of the agreements under which we have licensed or assigned our intellectual property to them  we could be deprived of important intellectual property rights and future revenue 
we are a party to intellectual property out licenses  collaborations and agreements that are important to our business and expect to enter into similar agreements with third parties in the future 
under these agreements  we license or transfer intellectual property to third parties and impose various research  development  commercialization  sublicensing  royalty  indemnification  insurance  and other obligations on them 
if a third party fails to comply with these requirements  we generally retain the right to terminate the agreement  and to bring a legal action in court or in arbitration 
in the event of breach  we may need to enforce our rights under these agreements by resorting to arbitration or litigation 
during the period of arbitration or litigation  we may be unable to effectively use  assign or license the relevant intellectual property rights and may be deprived of current or future revenues that are associated with such intellectual property 
risks related to our common stock we expect that our stock price will fluctuate significantly and the market price of our common stock could drop below the price you paid 
the trading price of our common stock has been volatile and may continue to be volatile in the future 
for example  our stock has traded as high as and as low as per share in the year ended december  the stock market  particularly in recent years  has experienced significant volatility with respect to biopharmaceutical and biotechnology based company stocks 
the volatility of biopharmaceutical and biotechnology based company stocks often does not relate to the operating performance of the companies represented by the stock 
prices for our stock will be determined in the market place and may be influenced by many factors  including announcements regarding new technologies by us or our competitors  market conditions in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical sectors  rumors relating to us or our competitors  litigation or public concern about the safety of our potential products  actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly operating results  deviations in our operating results from the estimates of securities analysts  adverse results or delays in clinical trials  any intellectual property lawsuits involving us  sales of large blocks of our common stock  sales of our common stock by our executive officers  directors or significant stockholders  the loss of any of our key scientific or management personnel  fda or international regulatory actions  and general market conditions 
while we cannot predict the individual effect that these factors may have on the price of our common stock  these factors  either individually or in the aggregate  could result in significant variations in price during any given period of time 
moreover  in the past  securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in their stock price 
this type of litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our management s attention and resources 
our common stock may be delisted from the nasdaq national market  which could reduce the liquidity of our common stock and adversely affect our ability to raise additional necessary capital 
in order to continue trading on the nasdaq national market  we must comply with the nasdaq national market s continued listing requirements  which require that we either maintain a minimum stockholders equity of million and a minimum closing bid price of per share or  if we fall below the minimum stockholders equity requirement  maintain a minimum closing bid price of per share 
we currently are in compliance with the nasdaq national market s continued listing requirements 
however  if in the future we fail to satisfy the nasdaq national market s continued listing requirements  our common stock may be delisted from the nasdaq national market 
the delisting of our common stock may result in the trading of the stock on the nasdaq smallcap market or the otc bulletin board 
consequently  a delisting of our common stock from the nasdaq national market may reduce the liquidity of our common stock and adversely affect our ability to raise capital 
substantially all of our total outstanding shares may be sold into the market at any time 
this could cause the market price of our common stock to drop significantly  even if our business is doing well 
sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could occur at any time 
these sales  or the perception in the market that the holders of a large number of shares intend to sell shares  could reduce the market price of our common stock 
as of december   we had outstanding approximately million shares of common stock 
substantially all of these shares may also be resold in the public market at any time 
in addition  we have a significant number of shares that are subject to outstanding options 
the exercise of these options and the subsequent sale of the underlying common stock could cause a further decline in our stock price 
these sales also might make it difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate 
we have anti takeover defenses that could delay or prevent an acquisition that our stockholders may consider favorable and the market price of our common stock may be lower as a result 
provisions of our certificate of incorporation  our bylaws and delaware law may have the effect of deterring unsolicited takeovers or delaying or preventing changes in control of our management  including transactions in which our stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over then current market prices 
in addition  these provisions may limit the ability of stockholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in their best interest 
for example  we have divided our board of directors into three classes that serve staggered three year terms  we may issue shares of our authorized blank check preferred stock and our stockholders are limited in their ability to call special stockholder meetings 
in addition  we are subject to the anti takeover provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law  which regulates corporate acquisitions 
these provisions could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control transaction 
they could also have the effect of discouraging others from making tender offers for our class a common stock 
these provisions may also prevent changes in our management 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we invest cash balances in excess of operating requirements in cash equivalents and short term marketable securities  generally money market funds  corporate debt and government securities with an average maturity of less than one year 
all marketable securities are considered available for sale 
the primary objective of our cash investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our invested cash without significantly increasing risk of loss 
our marketable securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
however  because of the short term nature of the marketable securities  we do not believe that interest rate fluctuations would materially impair the principal amount of our investments 
our investments are investment grade securities and deposits are with investment grade financial institutions 
we believe that the realization of losses due to changes in credit spreads is unlikely as we expect to hold our investments to maturity 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we have operated primarily in the united states 
accordingly  we do not have any material exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations
