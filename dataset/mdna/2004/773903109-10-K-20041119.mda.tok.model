overview overall demand for our products is driven by levels of global industrial production  investments in capacity  including upgrades  modifications  and expansions of existing manufacturing facilities  and the creation of new manufacturing facilities  regional factors that include local political  social  regulatory and economic circumstances  and industry factors that include customers new product introductions  trends in the actual and forecasted demand for our customers products or services  and the regulatory and competitive environments in which our customers operate 
us industrial economic trends in  sales in the us accounted for more than percent of our total sales 
due to weaker business conditions in and  especially in the us manufacturing economy  manufacturers operated at historically low levels of plant capacity utilization 
during  the manufacturing economy experienced improving fundamentals and higher levels of output 
in the us  this is reflected in various indicators that we use to gauge the direction and momentum of our markets 
these indicators include industrial equipment spending  which is an economic statistic compiled by the bureau of economic analysis bea 
this statistic provides insight into spending trends in the broad us industrial economy  which includes our primary customer base 
this measure  over the longer term  has proven to have reasonable predictive value  and to be a good directional indicator of our growth trend 
capacity utilization  which is an indication of plant operating activity  is published by the federal reserve 
historically there has been a meaningful correlation between capacity utilization and the level of capital investment made by our customers in their manufacturing base 
the purchasing managers index pmi  as published by the institute for supply management ism  which is an indication of the level of manufacturing activity in the us according to the ism  a pmi measure above indicates that the manufacturing economy is generally expanding while a measure below indicates that it is generally contracting 
the table below depicts the trend for the indicated months since december in us industrial equipment spending  capacity utilization and the pmi 
industrial equipment capacity spending utilization in billions percent pmi fiscal september june march december fiscal september june march december fiscal september june march december non us regional trends outside the us  growth in demand has in part been driven by investments made in infrastructure in emerging economies  such as those found in the asia pacific and latin america regions 
demand for our products in china is moderating somewhat from the rapid expansion experienced in the first half of as a result of rising local interest rates and other economic and political factors but commercial activity in korea and india has been strong 
in latin america  demand for our products has been driven by investment in the mining and oil and gas industries  resulting in increased sales in industry views we serve a wide range of industries including consumer products  transportation  basic materials  and oil and gas 
during we benefited from growing demand in nearly all of the industries we serve 
our consumer products segment serves a broad array of customers in the food and beverage  brewing  consumer packaged goods and life sciences industries 
this group is generally less cyclical than other heavy manufacturing segments 
sales to the automotive segment are affected by such factors as customer investment in new model introductions and more flexible manufacturing technologies 
basic materials segments  including mining  aggregates and cement all benefit from higher commodities prices and higher global demand for basic materials that encourage significant investment in capacity and productivity in these industries 
as energy prices rise  customers in the oil and gas industry increase their investment in production and transmission capacity as they did during the latter half of in addition  higher energy prices have historically caused customers across all industries to consider new investment in more energy efficient manufacturing processes and technologies 
outlook for the following is a summary of our objectives for expand our integrated architecture platform by accelerating the penetration of the batch hybrid market and demonstrating the value of real time information  continue our geographic expansion and growth  particularly in emerging economies  build additional domain expertise in the industries we serve  and drive continued cost productivity 
our outlook for assumes that the current economic recovery will continue and that we will experience a favorable industrial environment with gradual growth during while we expect demand for our products to benefit from this trend  we also assume that our growth will vary  and may exceed or lag trend levels in any given quarter 
as of the date hereof  we expect to grow revenue in by to percent  excluding the effect of changes in currency exchange rates  and to raise operating margins to approximately percent 
as of the date hereof  we expect full year diluted earnings per share in the range of to  and plan to generate free cash flow in excess of net income in part through disciplined capital deployment

three percentage points of the growth was due to the effect of changes in currency exchange rates 
income from continuing operations in includes million per diluted share of tax benefits related to the resolution of certain tax matters as well as the benefit of state tax refunds 
the result included a tax benefit of million per diluted share related to the settlement of a us federal research and experimentation credit refund claim 
control systems increase decrease in millions  except percentages sales segment operating earnings segment operating margin pts control systems sales increased percent compared to four percentage points of the sales increase was due to the effect of changes in currency exchange rates  primarily resulting from the relative strength of the euro to the us dollar 
sales outside of the us increased percent percent excluding the effect of changes in currency exchange rates and us sales increased percent 
control systems experienced sales growth in all regions with exceptional strength in the emerging economies of asia and latin america where we continued to increase market penetration 
sales growth was primarily driven by maintenance related and smaller productivity related projects 
these projects were the result of pent up demand after the period of under investment in productive assets during and in addition to these ongoing required investments  we experienced an increase in activity related to larger scale projects in the second half of fiscal year these larger projects were driven by our customers requirements for incremental productivity improvements and capacity optimization 
our logix platform business continued its strong growth with an increase of percent over industrial components and adjustable speed drives experienced double digit growth as well 
these gains were partially offset by moderate declines in drive systems and legacy control platforms 
segment operating margins increased due to higher volume  favorable product mix and productivity improvements 
volume leverage improved during the year due to our continuing productivity efforts and ongoing facility rationalization programs 
power systems increase decrease in millions  except percentages sales segment operating earnings segment operating margin pts power systems sales increased percent compared to the mechanical and electrical businesses contributed about equally to the growth 
the sales increase was mainly the result of volume strength in the second half of higher global demand for basic materials and subsequent higher prices for these materials encouraged significant investment in capacity optimization and productivity and drove our sales 
significant cost and productivity initiatives launched in the second quarter  financial leverage on incremental volume  and price increases more than offset rising raw material prices  resulting in the improved segment operating margin 
general corporate net general corporate expenses were million in compared to million in expense in includes charges of million due to higher estimated costs for environmental remediation at several legacy sites  million of contributions to our charitable corporation  and million of costs associated with corporate staff changes

discontinued operations see note in the financial statements for information regarding the composition of discontinued operations 
income taxes during  we recognized tax benefits of million in income from continuing operations and million in income from discontinued operations related to the following items million resulting from the resolution of certain tax matters  in part related to former businesses 
a majority of the benefits recognized related to non us tax matters in addition to an agreement with a taxing authority related to the treatment of an investment  million related to additional state tax benefits associated with the us research and experimentation credit refund claim in see discussion below  and million related to a refund from the state of california for the period to of this amount  million is included as a reduction in the income tax provision and million is included in income from discontinued operations 
including these items  the full year effective tax rate for was approximately percent 
in the aggregate  these items decreased the effective tax rate by approximately percent 
during  we recognized in earnings a net tax benefit of million related to a us federal research and experimentation credit refund claim and a tax benefit of approximately million as a result of our ability to utilize certain capital loss carryforwards for which a valuation allowance had been previously provided 
the ability to utilize the capital loss carryforwards was the result of the sale of a majority of our ownership in rej which took place in the full year effective tax rate for was approximately percent  including the effect of the research and experimentation settlement percent benefit and the rej transaction percent benefit 
see note in the financial statements for a reconciliation of the united states statutory tax rate to the effective tax rate 
we expect that the effective income tax rate in will be approximately percent  excluding the income tax expense or benefit related to discrete items  if any  that will be separately reported or reported net of their related tax effects 
subsequent to september   the president signed into law both the american jobs creation act of and the working families tax relief act of this legislation contains numerous corporate tax changes  including eliminating a tax benefit relating to us product exports  a new deduction relating to us manufacturing  a lower us tax rate on non us dividends and an extension of the research and experimentation credit 
this new legislation is not anticipated to materially affect our results of operations or our financial condition 
financial condition the following is a summary of our cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities  as reflected in the consolidated statement of cash flows in millions year ended september  cash provided by used for operating activities investing activities financing activities effect of exchange rate changes on cash cash provided by used for continuing operations the following table summarizes free cash flow in millions cash provided by operating activities capital expenditures free cash flow our definition of free cash flow takes into consideration capital investment required to maintain the operations of our businesses and execute our strategy 
in our opinion  free cash flow provides useful information to investors regarding our ability to generate cash from business operations that is available for acquisitions and other investments  service of debt principal  dividends and share repurchases 
we use free cash flow as one measure to monitor and evaluate performance 
our definition of free cash flow may be different from definitions used by other companies 
free cash flow was million for the year ended september  compared to million for the year ended september  the following factors contributed to the significant increase in free cash flow income before income taxes in was million higher than in us federal tax payments were lower in as a result of the tax benefits related to voluntary pension contributions and increased benefits from the exercise of stock options 
us federal tax payments were million in compared to million in  and we received net tax refunds of million from various tax authorities related to prior years 
these factors more than offset the higher voluntary contributions to our us qualified pension trust which totaled million in compared to million in we anticipate that cash payments for income taxes will approach our income tax expense in the near future 
when necessary  we utilize commercial paper as our principal source of short term financing 
at september  and  we had no commercial paper borrowings outstanding 
during and  we did not have significant commercial paper borrowings due to our cash position 
in january  we repaid our million of industrial development revenue bonds prior to maturity using cash on hand 
in april  we repaid our million principal amount of notes at maturity using a combination of cash on hand and commercial paper borrowings 
we repurchased approximately million shares of our common stock at a cost of million in at september   we had approximately million remaining for stock repurchases under existing board authorizations 
we repurchased approximately million shares of our common stock at a cost of million in we anticipate repurchasing stock in  the amount of which will depend ultimately on business conditions  stock price and other cash requirements 
future significant uses of cash are expected to include capital expenditures  dividends to shareowners  acquisitions of businesses and repurchases of common stock and may include contributions to our pension plans 
we expect capital expenditures in to be about million 
additional information regarding pension contributions is contained in md a on page hereof 
we expect that each of these future uses of cash will be funded by existing cash balances  cash generated by operating activities  commercial paper borrowings  a new issue of debt or issuance of other securities 
in addition to cash generated by operating activities  we have access to existing financing sources  including the public debt markets and unsecured credit facilities with various banks 
our debt to total capital ratio was percent at september  and percent at september  as of september   we had million of unsecured committed credit facilities  with million expiring in october and million expiring in october these facilities were available for general corporate purposes  including support for our commercial paper borrowings 
on october   we entered into a new five year million unsecured revolving credit facility 
it replaced both the facility expiring on that date and the facility expiring in october which we cancelled on that date 
borrowings under our new credit facility bear interest based on short term money market rates in effect during the period such borrowings are outstanding 
the terms of our credit facility contain a covenant under which we would be in default if our debt to capital ratio were to exceed percent 
in addition to our million credit facility  short term unsecured credit facilities available to foreign subsidiaries amounted to million at september  the following is a summary of our credit ratings as of september  short term long term credit rating agency rating outlook rating outlook standard poor s a negative a negative moody s p stable a negative fitch ratings f stable a stable among other things  our credit facility is a standby liquidity facility that can be drawn  if needed  to repay our outstanding commercial paper as it matures 
this access to funds to repay maturing commercial paper is an important factor in maintaining the ratings set forth in the table above that have been given to our commercial paper 
while we are not required to do so  under our current policy with respect to these ratings  we expect to limit our other borrowings under the credit facility  if any  to amounts that would leave enough credit available under the facility so that we could borrow  if needed  to repay all of our then outstanding commercial paper as it matures 
should our access to the commercial paper market be adversely affected due to a change in market conditions or otherwise  we would expect to rely on a combination of available cash and the unsecured committed credit facilities to provide short term funding 
in such event  the cost of borrowings under the unsecured committed credit facilities could be higher than the cost of commercial paper borrowings 
cash dividends to shareowners were million per share in and million per share in although declaration and payment of dividends are at the sole discretion of our board of directors  we expect to pay quarterly dividends in at least equal to the quarterly per share amount paid in certain of our contractual cash obligations at september  are summarized as follows payments by period total thereafter long term debt and interest a minimum operating lease payments purchase commitment b total a the amounts for long term debt assume that the respective debt instruments will be outstanding until their scheduled maturity dates 
the amounts include interest  but exclude the amounts to be received under an interest rate swap  the unamortized discount of million  and the million fair value adjustment recorded for the interest rate swap as permitted by sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
see note in the financial statements for additional information regarding our long term debt 
b in connection with the sale of a power systems business in  we entered into a supply agreement with the buyer of the business 
the agreement requires us to purchase a minimum of million per year through december  in the event that purchases are less than million in a given year  we may incur penalties which are percent of the amount by which the actual purchases were less than the contractual minimum for the period 
based upon current estimates of future purchases  we do not believe that any penalties payable under the terms of the agreement would be material to our business or financial condition 
for additional information on the supply agreement  see note in the financial statements 
we sponsor pension and other postretirement benefit plans for certain employees 
see note in the financial statements for information regarding these plans and expected future cash outflows related to the plans 
at september   we guaranteed the performance of conexant related to a lease obligation of approximately million 
the lease obligation is secured by the real property subject to the lease and is within a range of estimated fair values of the real property 
in consideration for this guarantee  we received  per quarter from conexant through december  and receive  per quarter from conexant through december  unless we are released from the guarantee prior thereto 
we expect to be released from the guarantee in at september   we and rockwell collins each guarantee one half of a lease agreement for one of rockwell scientific company llc s rsc facilities 
the total future minimum payments under the lease are million 
the lease agreement has a term that ends in december in addition  we share equally with rockwell collins in providing a million line of credit to rsc  which bears interest at the greater of our or rockwell collins commercial paper borrowing rate 
at september  and  there were no outstanding borrowings under this line of credit 
during october  the line of credit was increased to million  with us and rockwell collins still sharing equally 
supplemental sales information we translate sales of subsidiaries operating outside of the united states using exchange rates effective during the respective period 
therefore  reported sales are affected by changes in currency rates  which are outside of our control 
we believe that sales excluding the effect of changes in currency exchange rates  which is a non gaap financial measure  provides useful information to investors because it reflects regional performance from the activities of our businesses without the effect of changes in currency rates 
we use sales excluding the effect of changes in currency exchange rates to monitor and evaluate our regional performance 
we determine the effect of changes in currency exchange rates by translating the respective period s sales using the same currency exchange rates as were in effect in the preceding year 
the following is a reconciliation of our reported sales to sales excluding the effect of changes in currency exchange rates in millions year ended september  year ended september  sales sales excluding excluding the effect the effect of changes of changes in currency in currency currency exchange currency exchange sales translation rates sales translation rates us canada europe  middle east  africa asia pacific latin america total company sales the following is a reconciliation of reported sales of our control systems segment to sales excluding the effect of changes in currency exchange rates in millions year ended september  year ended september  sales sales excluding excluding the effect the effect of changes of changes in currency in currency currency exchange currency exchange sales translation rates sales translation rates us canada europe  middle east  africa asia pacific latin america total control systems sales critical accounting policies and estimates we have prepared the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and revenues and expenses during the periods reported 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe the following are the critical accounting policies that could have the most significant effect on our reported results or require subjective or complex judgments by management 
revenue recognition sales are generally recorded when all of the following have occurred an agreement of sale exists  product has been delivered according to contract terms and acceptance as may be required by contract terms has occurred or services have been rendered  pricing is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
we generally use contracts and customer purchase orders to determine the existence of an arrangement 
we use shipping documents and customer acceptance  when applicable  to verify delivery 
we assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment 
we assess collectibility based primarily on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit evaluations and analysis  as well as the customer s payment history 
we record accruals for customer returns  rebates and incentives at the time of revenue recognition based upon historical experience 
adjustments to the accrual may be required if actual returns  rebates and incentives differ from historical experience or if there are changes to other assumptions used to estimate the accrual 
a critical assumption used in estimating the accrual for our primary distributor rebate program is the time period from when revenue is recognized to when the rebate is processed 
if the time period were to change by percent  the effect would be an adjustment to the accrual of approximately million 
the accrual for rebates and incentives to customers was million at september  and million at september   of which million at september  and million at september  was included as an offset to accounts receivable 
impairment of long lived assets we evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable through future cash flows 
we evaluate the recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired 
we use judgment when applying the impairment rules to determine when an impairment test is necessary 
factors we consider that could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to historical or forecasted operating results  a significant decrease in the market value of an asset  a significant change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used and significant negative industry or economic trends 
impairment losses are measured as the amount by which the carrying value of an asset exceeds its estimated fair value 
to determine fair value  we are required to make estimates of the future cash flows related to the asset being reviewed 
these estimates require assumptions about demand for our products and services  future market conditions and technological developments 
other assumptions include the discount rate and future growth rates 
during  we recorded pre tax impairment charges of million million after tax in connection with the adoption of sfas we perform our annual impairment test on non amortized intangible assets during the second quarter of our fiscal year 
as of the second quarter of fiscal  the million net book value of our reliance trademark approximated its estimated fair value  as computed with the assistance of independent valuation specialists 
either an increase in the discount rate or a decrease in planned future growth or profitability rates could result in a material impairment charge to writedown the book value of the reliance trademark to the revised estimated fair value 
additional information regarding the impairment charges is contained in note in the financial statements 
retirement benefits pension benefits pension costs and obligations are actuarially determined and are affected by annually reviewing assumptions including discount rate  the expected rate of return on plan assets and assumed annual rate of compensation increase for plan employees  among other factors 
changes in the discount rate and differences between the assumptions and actual experience will affect the amount of pension expense recognized in future periods 
our worldwide pension expense in was million compared to million in approximately percent of this cost relates to our us qualified pension plan 
we used the following actuarial assumptions to determine our us pension expense discount rate of percent compared to percent for  expected rate of return on plan assets of percent compared to percent for  and an assumed rate of compensation increase of percent compared to percent for 
the decrease in discount rate  as well as the amortization of actuarial losses  were the primary causes of the million increase in pension expense in over for  we are assuming that the expected rate of return on plan assets and rate of compensation increase will remain consistent with the assumptions  but that the discount rate will increase from to 
assuming this discount rate increase and that actual experience is consistent with the actuarial assumptions  we expect pension expense to remain approximately the same as the following chart illustrates the estimated change in benefit obligation and net periodic pension cost assuming a change of basis points in the assumptions for our us pension plans in millions pension benefits change in change in projected benefit net periodic obligation benefit cost discount rate rate of return in  we made voluntary contributions of million to our primary us qualified pension plan trust compared to a million voluntary contribution in we currently anticipate making contributions during to our qualified pension plans in an amount that approximates the net periodic pension cost 
additional information regarding pension benefits  including our pension obligation and minimum pension liability adjustment  is contained in note in the financial statements 
other postretirement benefits we estimate  with the assistance of independent actuarial consultants  the costs and obligations for postretirement benefits other than pensions using assumptions  including the discount rate and  for plans other than our primary us postretirement healthcare benefit program  expected trends in the cost for healthcare services 
changes in these assumptions and differences between the assumptions and actual experience will affect the amount of postretirement benefit expense recognized in future periods 
effective october   we amended our primary us postretirement healthcare benefit program in order to mitigate our share of the increasing cost of postretirement healthcare services 
as a result of this amendment  there will be no increase in healthcare costs resulting from healthcare inflationary trends beginning january  this amendment reduced our other postretirement benefit obligation by million 
net periodic benefit cost in was approximately million compared to million in this decrease is primarily due to the effect of amending our primary us postretirement healthcare benefit program 
we expect net periodic benefit cost in of approximately million 
the expected increase is due to the amortization of actuarial losses offset by an increase in the discount rate as of our june  measurement date by basis points to 
additional information regarding postretirement benefits is contained in note in the financial statements 
self insurance liabilities our principal self insurance programs include product liability and workers compensation where we self insure up to a specified dollar amount 
claims exceeding this amount up to specified limits are covered by policies purchased from commercial insurers 
we estimate the liability for the majority of the self insured claims with the assistance of an independent actuarial consultant using our claims experience for the periods being valued 
adjustments to the self insured liabilities may be required to reflect emerging claims experience and other factors such as inflationary trends or outcome of liability claims 
the liability for these self insurance programs was million at september  and million at september  as described in item legal proceedings  we have been named as a defendant in lawsuits alleging personal injury as a result of exposure to asbestos that was used in certain components of our products many years ago 
see item on page hereof  for further discussion 
litigation  claims and contingencies we record liabilities for litigation  claims and contingencies when an obligation is probable and when we have a basis to reasonably estimate the value of an obligation 
we also record liabilities for environmental matters based on estimates for known environmental remediation exposures utilizing information received from independent environmental consultants 
the liabilities include accruals for sites we currently own and third party sites where we were determined to be a potentially responsible party 
at third party sites where more than one potentially responsible party has been identified  we record a liability for our estimated allocable share of costs related to our involvement with the site as well as an estimated allocable share of costs related to the involvement of insolvent or unidentified parties 
at environmental sites where we are the only responsible party  we record a liability for the total estimated costs of remediation 
we do not discount future expenditures for environmental remediation obligations to their present value 
environmental liability estimates may be affected by changing determinations of what constitutes an environmental exposure or an acceptable level of cleanup 
to the extent that remediation procedures change  additional contamination is identified  or the financial condition of other potentially responsible parties is adversely affected  the estimate of our environmental liabilities may change 
the liability for environmental matters  net of related receivables  was million at september  and million at september  during  we recorded adjustments totaling million to increase the environmental reserves related to several legacy sites 
these adjustments were in addition to an adjustment made during the fourth quarter of to increase the environmental reserve by million due to higher estimated future costs for environmental remediation at our legacy sites 
our recorded liability for environmental matters almost entirely relates to businesses formerly owned by us legacy businesses but for which we retained the responsibility to remediate 
the nature of our current business is such that the likelihood of new environmental exposures that could result in a material charge to earnings is low 
as a result of remediation efforts at legacy sites and limited new environmental matters  we expect that gradually over a long period of time  our environmental obligations will decline 
however  changes in remediation procedures at existing legacy sites or discovery of contamination at additional sites could result in increases to our environmental obligations 
in  we recorded income of million million after tax as a result of a final judgment in a defense claim legal proceeding related to our former operation of the rocky flats facility of the department of energy 
this amount is in addition to income of million million after tax recognized in related to the rocky flats defense claim legal proceeding 
in march  we received million related to this matter 
this amount is displayed  net of the related tax  in the consolidated statement of cash flows as cash provided by discontinued operations 
additional information regarding litigation  claims and contingencies is contained in note in the financial statements 
see also item legal proceedings  on page hereof 
income taxes we record a liability for probable income tax assessments based on our estimate of the potential exposure 
to the extent our estimates differ from actual payments or assessments  income tax expense is adjusted 
our income tax positions are based on diligent research of the applicable income tax laws  claimed with knowledge  and vigorously defended 
we conduct business in many countries  which requires an interpretation of the income tax laws and rulings in each of those taxing jurisdictions 
due to the subjectivity of interpretations of laws and rulings in each jurisdiction in which we do business  differences and the interplay in tax laws between those jurisdictions as well as the subjectivity of factual interpretations  our estimates of income tax liabilities may differ from actual payments or assessments 
during  we resolved certain tax matters  resulting in our recognizing million of tax benefits 
the majority of these matters related to non us jurisdictions 
during  we resolved certain matters from previous years resulting in a million reduction of our income tax provision 
while our tax positions are claimed with knowledge  taxing authorities are increasingly asserting interpretations of laws and facts in an effort to increase their tax revenue especially in instances where transactions involve two or more countries 
such cross border transactions between our affiliates involving the transfer price for products  services  and or intellectual property is one of the primary issues we face 
due to our presence in canadian markets  canadian transfer pricing matters are the most significant of all countries in which we do business 
transfer pricing matters as well as legal structures relating to current and previously divested businesses represent nearly million of our tax liabilities for income tax assessments 
we have recorded a valuation allowance of million at september  for the majority of our deferred tax assets related to net operating loss carryforwards  capital loss carryforwards and state tax credit carryforwards carryforwards 
the valuation allowance is based on an evaluation of the uncertainty of the amounts of the carryforwards that are expected to be realized 
an increase to income would result if we determine we will be able to utilize more carryforwards than currently expected 
at the end of each interim reporting period  we estimate the effective tax rate expected to be applicable for the full fiscal year 
the estimated effective tax rate contemplates the expected jurisdiction where income is earned eg  united states compared to non united states as well as tax planning strategies 
if the actual results are different from our estimates  adjustments to the effective tax rate may be required in the period such determination is made

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk during the normal course of business from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we manage exposure to these risks through a combination of normal operating and financing activities and derivative financial instruments in the form of interest rate swap contracts and foreign currency forward exchange contracts 
interest rate risk in addition to existing cash balances and cash provided by normal operating activities  we utilize a combination of short term and long term debt to finance operations 
we are exposed to interest rate risk on certain of these debt obligations 
our short term debt obligations relate to commercial paper borrowings and bank borrowings 
at september  and  we had no commercial paper borrowings outstanding 
during  the weighted average commercial paper borrowings were million compared to million in there were no bank borrowings outstanding at september  and our results of operations are affected by changes in market interest rates on commercial paper borrowings 
if market interest rates would have averaged percent higher than actual levels in either or  the effect on our results of operations would not have been material 
we had outstanding fixed rate long term debt obligations with carrying values of million at september  and million at september  the fair value of this debt was million at september  and million at september  the potential reduction in fair value on such fixed rate debt obligations from a hypothetical percent increase in market interest rates would not be material to the overall fair value of the debt 
we currently have no plans to repurchase our outstanding fixed rate instruments and  therefore  fluctuations in market interest rates would not have an effect on our results of operations or shareowners equity 
in september  we entered into an interest rate swap contract that effectively converted our million aggregate principal amount of notes  payable in  to floating rate debt based on six month libor 
the floating rate was percent at september  a hypothetical percent change in market interest rates would not be material to the overall fair value of the swap or our results of operations 
foreign currency risk we are exposed to foreign currency risks that arise from normal business operations 
these risks include the translation of local currency balances of foreign subsidiaries  intercompany loans with foreign subsidiaries and transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
our objective is to minimize our exposure to these risks through a combination of normal operating activities and the utilization of foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage our exposure on transactions denominated in currencies other than the applicable functional currency 
in addition  we enter into contracts to hedge certain forecasted intercompany transactions 
contracts are executed with creditworthy banks and are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries 
it is our policy not to enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
we do not hedge our exposure to the translation of reported results of foreign subsidiaries from local currency to united states dollars 
a percent adverse change in the underlying foreign currency exchange rates would not be significant to our financial condition or results of operations 
we record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value regardless of the purpose for holding them 
derivatives that are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes are adjusted to fair value through earnings 
for derivatives that are hedges  depending on the nature of the hedge  changes in fair value are either offset by changes in the fair value of the hedged assets  liabilities or firm commitments through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
we recognize the ineffective portion of a derivative s change in fair value in earnings immediately 
at september  and  we had outstanding foreign currency forward exchange contracts primarily consisting of contracts to exchange the euro  pound sterling  swiss franc  australian dollar and canadian dollar 
the use of these contracts allows us to manage transactional exposure to exchange rate fluctuations as the gains or losses incurred on the foreign currency forward exchange contracts will offset  in whole or in part  losses or gains on the underlying foreign currency exposure 
a hypothetical percent adverse change in underlying foreign currency exchange rates associated with these contracts would not be material to our financial condition  results of operations or shareowners equity
