item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview you should read the following discussion together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes to consolidated financial statements  which are included elsewhere in this report 
the following discussion contains forward looking statements that reflect plans  estimates and beliefs 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements 
we provide asset administration services for the financial services industry through our wholly owned subsidiary  investors bank trust company 
we provide core services and value added services to a variety of financial asset managers  including mutual fund complexes  investment advisors  family offices  banks and insurance companies 
core services include global custody  multicurrency accounting and mutual fund administration 
value added services include securities lending  foreign exchange  cash management  performance measurement  institutional transfer agency  investment advisory services  lines of credit  middle office outsourcing and brokerage and transition management services 
we have offices located in the united states  ireland  canada  and the cayman islands with a vast subcustodian global network established to accommodate the international needs of our clients 
at december   we provided services for approximately trillion in net assets  including approximately billion in foreign net assets 
we grow our business by selling our services to new clients and by further penetrating our existing clients 
we believe that we service less than of the assets managed by our existing clients  and we have traditionally achieved significant success in growing client relationships 
our ability to service new clients and expand our relationships with existing clients depends on our provision of superior client service 
our growth is also affected by overall market conditions  the regulatory environment for us and our clients and the success of our clients marketing their products 
we derive our asset servicing revenue from providing these core and value added services 
we derive our net interest income by investing the cash balances our clients leave on deposit with us 
our share of earnings from these investments is viewed as part of the total compensation that our clients pay us for servicing their assets 
our service offerings are priced on a bundled basis 
in establishing a fee structure for a specific client  we analyze all expected revenue and expenses 
we believe net operating revenue net interest income plus noninterest income and net income are the most meaningful measures of our financial results 
as an asset administration services company  the amount of net operating revenue that we generate is impacted by overall market conditions  client activity  and the prevailing interest rate environment 
over the course of the past year  we have benefited from the appreciation of the market values of assets we service for our clients 
a significant portion of our core services revenue is based upon the amount of assets under administration 
as market values of underlying assets fluctuate  so will our revenue 
we have managed this volatility by offering a tiered pricing structure for our asset based fees 
as asset values increase  the basis point fee is reduced for the incremental assets 
many of our value added services are transactional based  and we receive a fee for each transaction processed 
we have also continued to experience net interest margin compression in this low interest rate environment because we have little room to reduce further the rates we pay on our interest bearing liabilities  yet high volumes of prepayments in our investment portfolio have caused us to reinvest these cash flows in lower yielding assets 
in  we settled a tax assessment with the commonwealth of massachusetts 
in march  a retroactive change in the commonwealth of massachusetts tax law disallowed a dividends received deduction taken by the bank on dividends it had received since from a wholly owned real estate investment trust 
during the second quarter of  we settled this disputed tax assessment with the massachusetts department of revenue  agreeing to pay approximately of the liability 
as a result of this change in tax law  we recorded an additional state tax expense of approximately million  net of federal income tax benefit  in despite the additional tax expense  we were still able to generate a growth in net income for the year ended december  when compared to the same period in the prior year 
we continue to remain focused on our sales efforts  prudent expense management and increasing efficiency 
these goals are complicated by the need to build infrastructure to support our rapid growth  by the need to maintain state of the art systems and by the need to retain and motivate our high caliber workforce 
in our earnings releases  we reported operating income and per share information that exclude the effect of the state tax assessment settlement previously discussed above 
we believe that operating earnings provide a more meaningful presentation of the results of operations because they do not include the one time tax charge which was unrelated to our operations 
the following table presents a reconciliation between earnings presented on the face of our statement of income and the non gaap measure of net operating income referenced in our earnings releases dollars in thousands  except per share data gaap earnings for the year ended december  income before taxes    provision for income taxes    net income    earnings per share basic diluted pro forma operating earnings for the year ended december  income before taxes    provision for income taxes    net income    earnings per share basic diluted provision for income taxes for the year ended december  excludes a million charge  net of federal income tax benefit  that resulted from a retroactive change in the commonwealth of massachusetts tax law enacted in the first quarter of and the company s subsequent settlement of the resulting tax assessment with the massachusetts department of revenue 
the effect of the exclusions is an increase in diluted and basic earnings per share of 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which require us to make estimates and assumptions 
we have identified the following accounting policies that  as a result of the complexities of the underlying accounting standards and operations involved  could result in significant changes to our consolidated financial condition or results of operations under different conditions or using different assumptions 
senior management has discussed these critical accounting policies with the audit committee 
derivative financial instruments hedge accounting requires that we measure the changes in fair value of derivatives designated as hedges as compared to changes in expected cash flows of the underlying hedged transactions for each reporting period 
this process involves the estimation of the expected future cash flows of hedged transactions 
interest rate swaps are valued using a nationally recognized swap valuation model 
the libor london interbank offered rate curve in this model serves as the basis for computing the market value of the swap portfolio 
if interest rates increase  the swaps would gain in value 
conversely  if interest rates decrease  there would be a corresponding decline in the market value of the swaps portfolio 
changes in conditions or the occurrence of unforeseen events could affect the timing of the recognition of changes in fair value of certain hedging derivatives 
the measurement of fair value is based upon market values  however  in the absence of quoted market values  measurement involves valuation estimates 
these estimates are based on methodologies deemed appropriate under existing circumstances 
however  the use of alternative assumptions could have a significant effect on estimated fair value 
defined benefit pension assumptions each fiscal year  we must assess and select the discount rate  compensation increase percentage and average return on plan assets assumptions in order to project our benefit obligations under our defined benefit plans 
the discount rate is based on the weighted average yield on high quality fixed income investments that are expected to match the plan s projected cash flows 
the compensation increase percentage is based upon management s current and expected salary increases 
the average return on plan assets is based on the expected return on the plan s current investment portfolio  which can reflect the historical returns of the various asset classes 
for the fiscal year ended december   the discount rate  compensation increase and average return on plan assets were  and  respectively 
the discount rate at december  was lower than that at december  by due to a decline in interest rates  and the compensation increase percentage was equal to the prior year as assumptions on compensation increases remain consistent 
the rate of return on plan assets of has remained consistent with the prior year as the historical long term return on plan assets has been consistent with the estimated rate 
in addition  this increase in expense is expected to be partially offset by the incremental return on our additional million contribution made in net periodic pension expense for was million and is expected to be approximately million in fiscal year the discount rate and compensation increase percentage assumptions for our nonqualified  unfunded  supplemental retirement plan  which covers certain employees  are the same as those of our defined benefit pension plan 
the net periodic expense for for the supplemental retirement plan was million and is expected to be approximately million in fiscal year new accounting principles in april  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
amends and clarifies financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  resulting in more consistent reporting of contracts as either derivatives or hybrid instruments 
sfas no 
was effective for contracts entered into or modified after june   and is applied on a prospective basis 
we have evaluated our financial accounting and reporting for all derivative instruments and found them to be consistent with sfas no 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas no 
requires an issuer to classify financial instruments within its scope as a liability or an asset in some circumstances 
this statement provides that these instruments must be classified as liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet and recorded at fair value 
we adopted the provisions of this statement effective july  the adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on our financial position 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
revised december  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of accounting research bulletin arb this interpretation addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities vie 
this interpretation requires a vie to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the vie s activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns  or both 
the provisions are effective for any new entities that are originated subsequent to january  for entities that were originated prior to february   the provisions of this interpretation were to be effective october  we have adopted the provisions of this interpretation 
in  investors capital trust i icti  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  issued mandatorily redeemable preferred securities  or capital securities 
at the same time  in order to support payments under the capital securities  the company issued junior subordinated debentures to icti 
as a result of the adoption of this interpretation  we were required to deconsolidate icti 
therefore  in its consolidated financial statements  the company presents the junior subordinated debentures underlying the capital securities as a liability and its investment in icti as a component of other assets 
the income of icti for the three months that icti was not consolidated is considered immaterial 
certain factors that may affect future results from time to time  information provided by us  statements made by our employees  or information included in our filings with the securities and exchange commission including this form k may contain statements which are not historical facts  so called forward looking statements  and which involve risks and uncertainties 
these statements relate to future events or our future financial performance and are identified by words such as may  will  could  should  expect  plan  intend  seek  anticipate  believe  estimate  potential  or continue or other comparable terms or the negative of those terms 
forward looking statements in this form k include certain statements regarding liquidity  annual dividend payments  interest rate conditions  interest rate sensitivity  loss exposure on lines of credit  the timing and effect on earnings of derivative gains and losses  securities lending revenue  compensation expense  depreciation expense  effective tax rate  the effect on earnings of changes in equity values and the effect of certain legal claims against us 
our actual future results may differ significantly from those stated in any forward looking statements 
factors that may cause such differences include  but are not limited to  the factors discussed below 
each of these factors  and others  are discussed from time to time in our filings with the sec 
our operating results are subject to fluctuations in interest rates and the securities markets 
a significant portion of our fees is based on the market value of the assets we process 
accordingly  our operating results are subject to fluctuations in interest rates and securities markets as these fluctuations affect the market value of assets processed 
current market conditions  including the recent volatility in the equity markets  can have a material effect on our asset based fees 
while reductions in asset servicing fees may be offset by increases in other sources of revenue  a sustained downward movement of the broad equity markets will likely have an adverse impact on our earnings 
fluctuations in interest rates or the securities markets can also lead to investors seeking alternatives to the investment offerings of our clients  which could result in a lesser amount of assets processed and correspondingly lower fees 
also  our net interest income is earned by investing depositors funds in our investment portfolio and secondarily making loans 
rapid changes in interest rates and or the relationship between short term and long term interest rates could adversely affect the market value of  or the earnings produced by  our investment and loan portfolios  and thus could adversely affect our operating results 
a material portion of our revenue is derived from our relationship with barclays global investors  na bgi and related entities 
as a result of our selection to service assets for barclays global investors canada  ltd  our assumption of the operations of the us asset administration unit of bgi in and our ongoing relationship with bgi s ishares and master investment portfolios  bgi accounted for approximately of our net operating revenue during the year ended december  we expect that bgi will continue to account for a significant portion of our net operating revenue 
while we provide services to bgi under long term contracts  those contracts may be terminated for certain regulatory and fiduciary reasons 
the loss of bgi s business would cause our net operating revenue to decline significantly and may have an adverse effect on our quarterly and annual results 
we may incur losses due to operational errors 
the services that we provide require complex processes and interaction with numerous third parties 
while we maintain sophisticated computer systems and a comprehensive system of internal controls  and our operational history has been excellent  from time to time we may make operational errors for which we are responsible to our clients 
in addition  even though we maintain appropriate errors and omissions and other insurance policies  an operational error could result in a significant liability to us and may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we face significant competition from other financial services companies  which could negatively affect our operating results 
we are part of an extremely competitive asset servicing industry 
many of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories  greater name recognition and substantially greater financial  marketing and other resources than we do 
these greater resources could  for example  allow our competitors to develop technology superior to our own 
in addition  we face the risk that large mutual fund complexes may build in house asset servicing capabilities and no longer outsource these services to us 
as a result  we may not be able to compete effectively with current or future competitors  which could result in a loss of existing clients or difficulty in gaining new clients 
we may incur significant costs defending legal claims 
we have been named in a lawsuit in massachusetts state court alleging  among other things  violations of a covenant of good faith and fair dealing in a contract 
while we believe this claim is without merit  we cannot be sure that we will prevail in the defense of this claim 
we are also party to other litigation and we may become subject to other legal claims in the future 
litigation is costly and could divert the attention of management 
our future results depend  in part  on successful integration of pending and possible future acquisitions and outsourcing transactions 
integration of acquisitions and outsourcing transactions is complicated and frequently presents unforeseen difficulties and expenses which can affect whether and when a particular acquisition or outsourcing transaction will be accretive to our earnings per share 
any future acquisitions or outsourcing transactions will present similar challenges 
these acquisitions or outsourcing transactions can also consume a significant amount of management s time 
the failure to properly manage our growth could adversely affect the quality of our services and result in the loss of clients 
we have been experiencing a period of rapid growth that has required the dedication of significant management and other resources 
continued rapid growth could place a strain on our management and other resources 
to manage future growth effectively  we must continue to invest in our operational  financial and other internal systems  and our human resources 
we must hire and retain skilled personnel in order to succeed 
qualified personnel  in particular managers and other senior personnel  are in great demand throughout the financial services industry  especially if the recent economic recovery proves sustainable 
we could find it increasingly difficult to continue to attract and retain sufficient numbers of these highly skilled employees  which could affect our ability to attract and retain clients 
we may not be able to protect our proprietary technology 
our proprietary technology is important to our business 
we rely on trade secret  copyright and trademark laws and confidentiality agreements with employees and third parties to protect our proprietary technology  all of which offer only limited protection 
these intellectual property rights may be invalidated or our competitors may develop similar technology independently 
legal proceedings to enforce our intellectual property rights may be unsuccessful  and could also be expensive and divert management s attention 
our quarterly and annual operating results may fluctuate 
our quarterly and annual operating results are difficult to predict and may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and annually for several reasons  including the timing of commencement or termination of client engagements  the rate of net inflows and outflows of investor funds in the investment vehicles offered by our clients  and rapid changes in interest rates and equity values 
most of our expenses  such as employee compensation and rent  are relatively fixed 
as a result  any shortfall in revenue relative to our expectations could significantly affect our operating results 
we are subject to extensive federal and state regulations that impose complex restraints on our business 
federal and state laws and regulations applicable to financial institutions and their parent companies apply to us 
our primary regulators are the federal reserve board frb  the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic  the massachusetts commissioner of banks and the national association of securities dealers  inc nasd 
virtually all aspects of our operations are subject to specific requirements or restrictions and general regulatory oversight including the following the frb and the fdic maintain capital requirements that we must meet 
failure to meet those requirements could lead to severe regulatory action or even receivership 
we are currently considered to be well capitalized  under massachusetts law  the bank may be restricted in its ability to pay dividends to investors financial  which may in turn restrict our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders  the frb and the fdic are empowered to assess monetary penalties against  and to order termination of activities by  companies or individuals who violate the law  and the nasd maintains certain regulatory requirements that our securities broker affiliate  investors securities services  inc must meet 
failure to meet those requirements could lead to severe regulatory action 
banking law restricts our ability to own the stock of certain companies and also makes it more difficult for us to be acquired 
statements of operations comparison of operating results for the years ended december  and net income for the year ended december  was million  up from million for the same period in the principal factors contributing to the net income growth included growth in net interest income caused by a decline in our cost of funds due to lower interest rates  and a growth in noninterest income caused by increased net assets processed related to sales to new and existing clients  fund flows  market appreciation  and increased client transaction activity 
net income growth was partially offset by a increase in operating expenses due to prudent expense management and capitalizing on technology improvements to create efficiencies and by the additional tax expense incurred as a result of a settlement of a tax assessment by the commonwealth of massachusetts 
refer to income taxes within this section for further discussion regarding our settlement of this tax assessment 
net operating revenue the components of net operating revenue are as follows dollars in thousands for the year ended december  change net interest income   noninterest income   total net operating revenue   net interest income net interest income was million in  up from net interest income is affected by the volume and mix of assets and liabilities  and the movement and level of interest rates 
for the majority of  interest rates continued to decline in general with signs of stabilization beginning in the third quarter of the improvement in our net interest income was primarily driven by declining rates on our liabilities 
our average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities was for the year ended december   a basis point decline from for the same period in during and  the company repaid long term federal home loan bank of boston fhlbb borrowings and replaced these sources of funds with lower cost funding as a strategy to help maintain and preserve net interest margin 
although the average funding balance increased billion from billion in to billion in  the average rates paid on interest bearing liabilities declined more rapidly than the volume increase 
also during  we experienced higher volumes of prepayments from our investment portfolio 
the cash flows from these prepayments were reinvested in lower yielding interest earning assets 
through increased lower cost client funding  we were able to maintain our interest income at a pace relatively equivalent to the decline in average interest rates earned 
the table below presents the changes in net interest income resulting from changes in the volume of interest earning assets or interest bearing liabilities and changes in interest rates for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  changes attributed to both volume and rate have been allocated based on the proportion of change in each category dollars in thousands for the year ended december  vs 
december  change due to volume change due to rate net interest earning assets fed funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements investment securities    loans total interest earning assets    interest bearing liabilities deposits    borrowings    total interest bearing liabilities    change in net interest income we use derivative instruments to manage exposures to interest rate risks 
we routinely enter into interest rate swap agreements in which we pay a fixed interest rate and receive a floating interest rate 
these transactions are designed to hedge a portion of our liabilities 
by entering into a pay fixed receive floating interest rate swap  a portion of our liabilities is effectively converted to a fixed rate liability for the term of the interest rate swap agreement 
our derivatives are designated as highly effective cash flow hedges 
to the extent there is hedge ineffectiveness it is included as a component of the net interest margin 
hedge ineffectiveness had an insignificant impact on earnings for the years ended december  and we expect that hedge ineffectiveness will continue to have an insignificant effect on net interest margin in we periodically run interest rate simulation models to understand the effect of various interest rate scenarios on our capital and net income 
the results of the income simulation model as of december  indicated that an upward shift of interest rates by basis points over a twelve month period would result in a reduction in projected net interest income of 
we also simulate a basis point rate reduction over a twelve month period  however  in the simulation we do not reduce rates below 
this modified simulation results in a decrease in projected net interest income of 
refer to the market risk section of this document for more detailed information regarding our income simulation methodology and policies 
noninterest income noninterest income was million in  up from the principal factors driving noninterest income are market trends and the level of client activity 
the s p  dow jones industrial average  and europe  australia  far east indices increased approximately  and  respectively  in resulting in higher assets processed values from which we generate our core service revenue 
noninterest income consists of the following items dollars in thousands for the years ended december  change core service fees custody  accounting and administration   ancillary service fees foreign exchange   cash management   investment advisory   securities lending   other service fees  total ancillary service fees   total asset servicing fees   other operating income   total noninterest income   asset servicing fees for the year ended december  increased to million from the largest components of asset servicing fees are custody  accounting and administration  which increased to million for the year ended december  from million in the same period of custody  accounting and administration fees are based in part on the value of assets processed 
assets processed is the total dollar value of financial assets on the reported date for which we provide global custody or multicurrency accounting 
the change in net assets processed includes the following components dollars in billions for the year ended december  net assets processed  beginning of period sales to new clients lost clients further penetration of existing clients fund flows and market gain net assets processed  end of period  the majority of the increase in assets processed resulted from improved market conditions over the course of the past year  and the ability of our clients to continue to generate new products or additional fund flows  which are additional investments in their existing products 
as indicated in our overview  our core services fees are generated by charging a fee based upon the value of assets processed 
as market values or clients asset levels fluctuate  so will our revenue 
our tiered pricing structure  coupled with minimum and flat fees  allow us to manage this volatility 
as asset values increase  the basis point fee typically lowers  while when asset values decrease  revenue is only impacted by the asset decline at the then marginal rate 
if the value of equity assets held by our clients were to increase or decrease by  we estimate that this  by itself  would currently cause a corresponding change of approximately in our earnings per share 
if the value of fixed income assets held by our clients were to increase or decrease by  we estimate that this  by itself  would currently cause a corresponding change of approximately in our earnings per share 
in practice  earnings per share do not track precisely to the value of the equity markets because conditions present in a market increase or decrease may generate offsetting increases or decreases in other revenue items 
for example  market volatility often results in increased transaction fee revenue 
also  market declines may result in increased interest income and sweep fee income as clients move larger amounts of assets into the cash management vehicles that we offer 
however  there can be no assurance that these offsetting revenue increases will occur during any future downturn in the equity markets 
transaction driven income includes our ancillary services  such as foreign exchange  cash management and securities lending 
foreign exchange fees were million for the year ended december   up from the same period in the increase in foreign exchange fees is attributable to further penetration of existing clients  the addition of new clients  higher transaction volumes and increased volatility within the currencies traded by our clients 
future foreign exchange income is dependent on the level of client activity and the overall volatility in the currencies traded 
cash management fees  which consist of sweep fees  were million for the year ended december   up from the same period in the increase is primarily due to increased client balances 
cash management revenue will continue to depend on the level of client balances maintained in the cash management products 
if our clients funds continue to attract high volumes of cash flows  our cash management revenue will be positively impacted 
securities lending fees were million for the year ended december   down from the same period in  primarily due to narrower spreads 
securities lending transaction volume is positively affected by the market value of the securities on loan  merger and acquisition activity  increased ipo activity and a steeper short end of the yield curve 
if the capital markets experience any of the aforementioned activity  it is likely that our securities lending revenue will be positively impacted 
if we experience a reduction in our securities lending portfolio  lower market values and continued compression of the spreads earned on securities lending activity  our securities lending revenue will likely be negatively impacted 
operating expenses total operating expenses were million in  up from the marginal increase in operating expenses  despite strong revenue growth  is due to our prudent expense management and our ability to benefit from technology efficiencies 
it is expected that only incremental expense associated with new business will be added during the components of operating expenses were as follows dollars in thousands for the year ended december  change compensation and benefits   technology and telecommunications   transaction processing services   occupancy   depreciation and amortization   professional fees   travel and sales promotion   other operating expenses   total operating expenses   compensation and benefits expense was million in  down from the average number of employees decreased to  during the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  we experienced a reduction in compensation costs as a result of efficiencies gained through technology enhancements made during and it is expected that compensation expense will increase in due to employee merit raises and additional compensation arising from new hires needed to support new business wins 
technology and telecommunications expense was million in  down from technology and telecommunications expense consists primarily of contract programming  outsourced services  telecommunications and costs related to hardware and software licenses 
in  the company incurred significant technology and telecommunications expense on the integration of the bgi us asset administration unit into our technology infrastructure  which was completed in january after the significant integration of  we lowered our technology reinvestment reflected in both technology and compensation expenses to our target of approximately of revenue 
transaction processing services expense was million in  down from overall transaction volumes increased during  generating larger subcustodian expense and pricing fees 
however  during  we were in the process of converting the assets of the assumed bgi us asset administration unit to our subcustodian network which resulted in significant transaction processing expenses during the conversion period 
this conversion was completed during absent the expenses associated with the conversion  transaction processing fees increased on an overall basis due to increased volumes of client activity 
future transaction processing servicing expense will be dependent on the volume of client activity 
occupancy expense was million in  up from this increase was primarily due to increased space in our dublin office to accommodate the significant growth experienced by that office resulting from new client business 
at the end of  we signed a new lease agreement and increased our dublin office from approximately thousand square feet to approximately thousand square feet 
also  includes the full twelve month impact of additional space in our boston offices that we occupied in july occupancy expense should remain relatively consistent for depreciation and amortization expense was million in  up from this increase resulted from completion of capitalized software projects in late and and their placement into service along with the addition of leasehold improvements as a result of the new space we occupied in boston and dublin 
the capitalized projects placed in service also provided efficiencies that allowed us to reduce our compensation and benefits and technology and telecommunications expenses 
enhancements to our straight through processing platform resulted in a significant amount of efficiency gain in depreciation expense is expected to increase in as a result of additional capitalized software costs being placed into service in and income taxes income taxes were million for the year ended december   up from the same period in two factors contributed to the significant increase in  including a settlement of a tax assessment with the commonwealth of massachusetts department of revenue and increased pretax earnings 
in march  a retroactive change in the commonwealth of massachusetts tax law disallowed a dividends received deduction taken by the bank on dividends it had received since from a wholly owned real estate investment trust 
during the second quarter of  we settled this disputed tax assessment with the massachusetts department of revenue  agreeing to pay approximately of the liability 
as a result of this retroactive change in tax law  we recorded an additional state tax expense of approximately million  net of federal income tax benefit  in in  we expect that our effective rate will approximate to of pretax income 
comparison of operating results for the years ended december  and net operating revenue the components of net operating revenue are as follows dollars in thousands for the year ended december  change net interest income   noninterest income   total net operating revenue   net interest income net interest income is affected by the volume and mix of assets and liabilities  and the movement and level of interest rates 
the table below presents the changes in net interest income resulting from changes in the volume of interest earning assets or interest bearing liabilities and changes in interest rates for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  changes attributed to both volume and rate have been allocated based on the proportion of change in each category dollars in thousands for the year ended december  vs 
december  change due to volume change due to rate net interest earning assets fed funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements investment securities    loans   total interest earning assets    interest bearing liabilities deposits    borrowings    total interest bearing liabilities    change in net interest income   net interest income was million in  up from the improvement in net interest income primarily reflected the positive effect of balance sheet growth driven by increased client deposits and a steep yield curve 
the net interest margin remained constant at in and due to prepayment costs incurred during the year as a result of an asset liability strategy to prepay higher rate fhlbb advances with borrowed funds at a more favorable rate 
average interest earning assets  primarily investment securities  were billion in  up from funding for the asset growth was provided by a combination of client deposits of billion and external borrowings of billion 
the effect of changes in volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities was an increase in net interest income of approximately million in average yield on interest earning assets was in  down basis points from the average rate that we paid on interest bearing liabilities was in  down basis points from the decrease in rates reflected the lower interest rate environment in compared with the effect on net interest income due to changes in rates was a decrease of approximately million during the fiscal year ended december   a decrease which was net of prepayment costs incurred in associated with replacing borrowed funds at a more favorable rate 
prepayment costs were million in and million in on january   we adopted sfas no 
 as amended and interpreted  which established accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments 
all derivatives  whether designated in hedging relationships or not  are required to be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value 
if the derivative is designated as a fair value hedge  the change in the fair value of the derivative and the item being hedged will be recognized in earnings 
if the derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge  the effective portions of changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in other comprehensive income oci 
ineffective portions of changes  as determined in accordance with sfas no 
 in the fair value of the cash flow hedges are recognized in earnings 
for derivatives that do not qualify as hedges  changes in their fair value are recognized in earnings 
the adoption of sfas no 
on january   resulted in no cumulative effect type adjustment to our net income 
however  we recorded a reduction to oci of million  net of tax  and a corresponding liability for the fair value of the interest rate swaps 
the reduction to oci and the recognition of the liability were primarily attributable to net unrealized losses on cash flow hedges as of initial adoption 
in conjunction with the adoption  we elected to reclassify approximately million of securities from held to maturity to available for sale  which further reduced oci by approximately million  net of tax 
hedge ineffectiveness  determined in accordance with sfas no 
 had an insignificant impact on earnings for the year ended december  and no cash flow hedges were dedesignated or discontinued for the year ended december  and net interest income included net gains of million  net of tax  for the twelve months ended december  derived from interest rate swaps relating to sfas no 
the net gain consisted of a million gain  net of tax  for the twelve month period on changes in the fair value of derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments 
there were also million of derivative losses  net of tax  for the twelve month period that resulted primarily from the reclassification of transition adjustment related derivative losses from oci to net interest income in accordance with sfas no 
approximately million  net of tax  of the remaining transition adjustment of net derivative losses included in oci will be reclassified into earnings 
the recognition in net interest income of the transition adjustment derivative losses from oci was offset by derivative gains from changes in the fair value liability of the interest rate swaps as they reach maturity 
noninterest income noninterest income was million in  up from noninterest income consists of the following items dollars in thousands for the years ended december  change core service fees custody  accounting and administration   ancillary service fees foreign exchange   cash management   securities lending   investment advisory   other service fees total ancillary service fees   total asset servicing fees   other operating income   total noninterest income   asset servicing fees for the year ended december  increased to million from the largest component of asset servicing fees are custody  accounting  transfer agency and administration  which are based in part on assets processed 
net assets processed decreased billion to billion at december  from the change in net assets processed includes the following components dollars in billions for the year ended december  sales to new clients further penetration of existing clients fund flows and market loss net change in assets processed our ability to win business and the ability of our clients to sell additional product  thus generating fund flows  allowed us to minimize the impact of the equity market downturn in our tiered pricing structure for asset based fees also contributed to this inverse correlation 
because our asset based fees for most clients decrease as assets increase  as asset values deteriorate  revenue is only impacted by the asset decline at the then marginal rate 
despite the decrease in assets processed  transaction volume increased  which positively impacted fee income 
foreign exchange fees increased due to higher transaction volumes and volatility in the currencies traded by our clients 
cash management and securities lending fees increased with the addition of new clients and increased excess client cash balances 
increased investment advisory service fees were the result of growth in asset size of the merrimac master portfolio  an investment company for which we act as advisor  and where a portion of excess client cash balances are invested

financial condition at december   our total assets were billion  up from december  we manage our balance sheet growth to accomplish several goals  which include maintaining a leverage ratio of approximately  utilizing our capital to provide maximum shareholder value  and accommodating the fund flows of our clients 
average interest earning assets increased billion  or  for the year ended december  compared to the same period last year 
funding for our asset growth was provided by a combination of an increase in average client balances of approximately billion and an increase in average external borrowings of approximately billion for the year ended december  investment portfolio our investment portfolio is used to invest depositors funds and is a component of our asset processing business 
in addition  we use the investment portfolio to secure open positions at securities clearing institutions in connection with our custody services 
the following table summarizes our investment portfolio as of the dates indicated dollars in thousands december  securities held to maturity mortgage backed securities    federal agency securities    state and political subdivisions    foreign government securities  total securities held to maturity    securities available for sale mortgage backed securities    state and political subdivisions    corporate debt    us treasury securities  federal agency securities    foreign government securities  total securities available for sale   the overall increases in our held to maturity and available for sale portfolios are attributable to investing excess cash and borrowed funds to effectively utilize the bank s capital and accommodate client fund flows 
our held to maturity portfolio increased million  or  to billion at december  from billion at december  as we continue to grow our balance sheet  we purchase investment securities that will protect our net interest margin  while maintaining an acceptable risk profile 
the increase in the held to maturity portfolio stems primarily from purchases of federal agency securities  particularly those issued by the small business administration sba 
sba securities provide an attractive yield with limited credit risk and prepayment risk in a rapidly changing interest rate environment 
the weighted average life of the sba securities correspond with our overall asset liability strategy 
sba securities that we hold are variable rate securities indexed to the prime rate and are purchased with an intent and ability to hold to maturity 
the held to maturity investment portfolio is not viewed as our primary source of funds to satisfy liquidity needs 
our available for sale portfolio increased billion  or  to billion at december  from billion at december  the increase in the available for sale portfolio is primarily due to an increase in our mortgage backed securities portfolio of million  or  and the addition of million of us treasury securities 
in an effort to maintain our net interest margin  we have increased our position in mortgage backed securities 
as interest rates stop declining and are likely to increase  floating rate and hybrid mortgage backed securities should offer a healthy effective yield and limited extension risk  which aligns with our asset liability strategy 
refer to the gap analysis under the market risk section for additional details regarding the matching of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
the average balance of our combined investment portfolios for the year ended december  was billion  with an average yield of  compared to an average balance of billion with an average yield of during the decline in the yield is primarily due to the decline in the overall interest rate environment 
as interest rates declined throughout the year  we experienced a higher level of prepayments  resulting in increased principal cash payments that were reinvested in lower yielding securities 
in addition  the accelerated prepayments caused us to recognize at a faster rate the premium amortization associated with the affected securities 
during  we recognized net amortization of million for the year ended december  compared to million of net amortization in the same period of the effect of this accelerated amortization lowered our effective yield on the investment portfolio 
during the second half of  interest rates began to stabilize  resulting in lower prepayments 
a significant portion of our investment portfolio is variable rate in nature 
if interest rates were to rise during  we would expect slower prepayments and our overall yield to increase as our variable rate securities reprice 
conversely  if interest rates were to decline in  we would expect that prepayments would accelerate and be comparative to the activity in  with the cash flows from these prepayments being reinvested in lower yielding assets of equal quality and risk 
we invest in mortgage backed securities  federal agency bonds and corporate debt to increase the total return of the investment portfolio 
mortgage backed securities generally have a higher yield than us treasury securities due to credit and prepayment risk 
credit risk results from the possibility that a loss may occur if a counterparty is unable to meet the terms of the contract 
prepayment risk results from the possibility that changes in interest rates may cause mortgage backed securities to be paid off prior to their maturity dates 
federal agency bonds generally have a higher yield than us treasury securities due to credit and call risk 
credit risk results from the possibility that the federal agency issuing the bonds may be unable to meet the terms of the bond 
call risk is similar to prepayment risk and results from the possibility that fluctuating interest rates and other factors may result in the exercise of the call option by the federal agency prior to the maturity date of the bond 
credit risk related to mortgage backed securities and federal agency bonds is substantially reduced by payment guarantees and credit enhancements 
we invest in municipal securities to generate stable  tax advantaged income 
municipal securities generally have lower stated yields than federal agency and us treasury securities  but their after tax yields are comparable 
municipal securities are subject to credit risk 
however  all municipal securities that we invest in are insured and aaa rated 
the carrying value  weighted average yield  and contractual maturity of our securities held to maturity at december  are reflected in the following table dollars in thousands years under to to over amount yield amount yield amount yield amount yield mortgage backed securities   federal agency securities  state and political subdivisions   total securities held to maturity   the carrying value  weighted average yield  and contractual maturity of our securities available for sale at december  are reflected in the following table dollars in thousands years under to to over amount yield amount yield amount yield amount yield mortgage backed securities  state and political subdivisions   corporate debt  us treasury securities  federal agency securities  foreign government  total securities available for sale   loan portfolio our loan portfolio increased million  or  to million at december  from million at december  the majority of the increase relates to additional advances on clients lines of credit  partially offset by a decline in client overdrafts 
at december   client overdrafts were million compared to million at december  the following table summarizes our loan portfolio for the dates indicated dollars in thousands december  loans to mutual funds     loans to individuals      loans to others      less allowance for loan losses net loans      floating rate fixed rate we make loans to individually managed account customers and to mutual funds and other pooled product clients 
we offer overdraft protection and lines of credit to our clients for the purpose of funding redemptions  covering overnight cash shortfalls  leveraging portfolios and meeting other client borrowing needs 
virtually all loans to individually managed account customers are written on a demand basis  bear variable interest rates tied to the prime rate or the federal funds rate and are fully secured by liquid collateral  primarily freely tradable securities held in custody by us for the borrower 
loans to mutual funds and other pooled product clients include unsecured lines of credit that may  in the event of default  be collateralized at our option by securities held in custody by us for those clients 
loans to individually managed account customers  mutual funds and other pooled product clients also include advances that we make to certain clients pursuant to the terms of our custody agreements with those clients to facilitate securities transactions and redemptions 
at december   our only lending concentrations that exceeded of total loan balances were the lines of credit to mutual fund clients discussed above 
these loans were made in the ordinary course of business on the same terms and conditions prevailing at the time for comparable transactions 
our credit loss experience has been excellent 
there have been no loan charge offs in the last five years  or in the history of our company 
it is our policy to place a loan on nonaccrual status when either principal or interest becomes days past due and the loan s collateral is not sufficient to cover both principal and accrued interest 
as of december   there were no loans on nonaccrual status  no loans greater than days past due  and no troubled debt restructurings 
although virtually all of our loans are fully collateralized with freely tradable securities  management recognizes some credit risk inherent in the loan portfolio  and has an allowance for loan losses of million at december   a level of which has remained consistent for the past five years 
this amount is not allocated to any particular loan  but is intended to absorb any risk of loss inherent in the loan portfolio 
management actively monitors the loan portfolio and the underlying collateral and regularly assesses the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
deposits total deposits were billion at december   up from december  the increase in our deposit balances is a direct result of our clients leaving more cash on deposit with us 
we effectively utilized these cash balances to fund a portion of our asset growth 
the following table represents the average balance and weighted average yield paid on deposits dollars in thousands december  december  average balance weighted average yield average balance weighted average yield interest bearing demand deposits savings   time deposits   noninterest bearing demand deposits   savings   time deposits   repurchase agreements and short term and other borrowings asset growth was funded in part by increased securities sold under repurchase agreements 
repurchase agreements increased billion  or  to billion at december  from billion at december  repurchase agreements provide for the sale of securities for cash coupled with the obligation to repurchase those securities on a set date or on demand 
we use repurchase agreements  including client repurchase agreements  because they provide a lower cost source of funding than other short term borrowings 
the average balance of securities sold under repurchase agreements for the year ended december  was billion with an average cost of approximately  compared to an average balance of billion and an average cost of approximately for the same period last year 
the decline in the average rate paid on repurchase agreements relates to the overall decline in the indices to which the repurchase agreements are linked 
short term and other borrowings increased million  or  to billion at december  from million at december  we use short term and other borrowings to offset variability of deposit flow 
the average balance of short term and other borrowings for the year ended december  was billion with an average cost of approximately  compared to an average balance of million and an average cost of approximately for the same period last year 
the average cost of borrowing for the year ended december   included prepayment fees of million 
these fees were incurred to employ an asset liability strategy in which we replaced a high cost borrowing with a new borrowing at a lower rate and purchased assets with a similar maturity to lock in spread 
we employed the same strategy in as a result  the average cost for the year ended december  included million of prepayment fees 
market risk we engage in investment activities to accommodate clients cash management needs and to contribute to overall corporate earnings 
our clients  in the course of their financial asset management  maintain cash balances  which they can deposit with us on a short term basis in interest bearing accounts 
we either directly invest these cash balances to earn interest income  or place these deposits in third party vehicles and remit a portion of the earnings on these investments to our clients after deducting a fee as our compensation for the investment 
in the conduct of these activities  we are subject to market risk 
market risk is the risk of an adverse financial impact from changes in market prices and interest rates 
the level of risk we assume is a function of our overall strategic objectives and liquidity needs  client requirements and market volatility 
the active management of market risk is integral to our operations 
the objective of interest rate sensitivity management is to provide sustainable net interest revenue under various economic conditions 
we manage the structure of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities by adjusting their mix  yield  maturity and or repricing characteristics based on market conditions 
since client deposits and repurchase agreements  our primary sources of funds  are predominantly short term  we maintain a generally short term interest rate repricing structure for our interest earning assets 
we also use term borrowings and interest rate swap agreements to augment our management of interest rate exposure 
the effect of the swap agreements is to lengthen short term variable rate liabilities into longer term  fixed rate liabilities 
our board of directors has set asset and liability management policies that define the overall framework for managing interest rate sensitivity  including accountabilities and controls over investment activities 
these policies delineate investment limits and strategies that are appropriate  given our liquidity and regulatory requirements 
for example  we have established a policy limit stating that projected net interest income over the next twelve months will not be reduced by more than given a change in interest rates of up to basis points or over twelve months 
each quarter  our board of directors reviews our asset and liability positions  including simulations of the effect of various interest rate scenarios on our capital 
due to current interest rate levels  the company s board of directors has approved a temporary exception to the limit for decreases in interest rates 
the board of directors approved the policy exception because  with the federal funds target rate currently at  a basis point further reduction would move rates into a negative position and is therefore not likely to occur 
our board of directors has delegated day to day responsibility for oversight of the asset and liability management function to our asset and liability committee alco 
alco is a senior management committee consisting of the chief executive officer  the president  the chief financial officer  the chief risk officer and members of the treasury function 
alco meets twice monthly 
our primary tool in managing interest rate sensitivity is an income simulation model 
key assumptions in the simulation model include the timing of cash flows  maturities and repricing of financial instruments  changes in market conditions  capital planning and deposit sensitivity 
the model assumes that the composition of our interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period will change periodically over the period being measured 
the model also assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration to maturity or repricing of specific assets and liabilities 
these assumptions are inherently uncertain  and as a result  the model cannot precisely predict the effect of changes in interest rates on our net interest income 
actual results may differ from simulated results due to the timing  magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes and changes in market conditions and management strategies 
the results of the income simulation model as of december  and indicated that an upward shift of interest rates by basis points over a twelve month period would result in a reduction in projected net interest income of and  respectively 
we also simulate a basis point rate reduction over a twelve month period  however  in the simulation we do not reduce rates below 
this modified simulation results in a decrease in projected net interest income of and at december  and  respectively 
we also use gap analysis as a secondary tool to manage our interest rate sensitivity 
gap analysis involves measurement of the difference in asset and liability repricing on a cumulative basis within a specified time frame 
a positive gap indicates that more interest earning assets than interest bearing liabilities mature in a time frame  and a negative gap indicates the opposite 
by seeking to minimize the net amount of assets and liabilities that could reprice in the same time frame  we attempt to reduce the risk of significant adverse effects on net interest income caused by interest rate changes 
as shown in the cumulative gap position in the table presented below  at december   interest bearing liabilities repriced faster than interest earning assets in the short term  as has been typical for us 
generally speaking  during a period of falling interest rates  net interest income would be higher than it would have been until interest rates stabilize 
during a period of rising interest rates  net interest income would be lower until interest rates stabilize 
however  at the current absolute level of interest rates  lower interest rates may also lead to lower net interest income due to a diminished ability to lower the rates paid on interest bearing liabilities  including certain client funds  as rates approach zero 
other important determinants of net interest income are rate levels  balance sheet growth and mix  and interest rate spreads

fixed rate loans are included in the period in which they are scheduled to be repaid 
mortgage backed securities are included in the pricing category that corresponds with the earlier of their first repricing date or principal paydown schedule generated from industry sourced prepayment projections 
liquidity liquidity represents the ability of an institution to meet present and future financial obligations through either the sale or maturity of existing assets or the acquisition of additional funds through liability management 
for a financial institution such as ours  these obligations arise from the withdrawals of deposits and the payment of operating expenses 
our primary sources of liquidity include cash and cash equivalents  federal funds sold  federal reserve discount window  new deposits  short term borrowings  interest and principal payments on securities held to maturity and available for sale  and fees collected from asset administration clients 
as a result of our management of liquid assets and the ability to generate liquidity through liability funds  management believes that we maintain overall liquidity sufficient to meet our depositors needs  to satisfy our operating requirements and to fund the payment of an anticipated annual cash dividend of per share for approximately million based upon  shares outstanding as of december  
our ability to pay dividends on common stock may depend on the receipt of dividends from the bank 
any dividend payments by the bank are subject to certain restrictions imposed by the massachusetts commissioner of banks 
during all periods presented in this report  the company did not require dividends from the bank in order to fund the company s own dividends 
in addition  we may not pay dividends on our common stock if we are in default under certain agreements entered into in connection with the sale of our capital securities 
the capital securities were issued by icti  a delaware statutory business trust sponsored by us  and qualify as tier capital under the capital guidelines of the federal reserve 
we have informal borrowing arrangements with various counterparties 
each counterparty has agreed to make funds available to us at the federal funds overnight rate 
the aggregate amount of these borrowing arrangements as of december  was billion 
each bank may terminate its arrangement at any time and is under no contractual obligation to provide us with requested funding 
our borrowings under these arrangements are typically on an overnight basis 
we cannot be certain  however  that such funding will be available 
lack of availability of liquid funds could have a material adverse impact on our operations 
we also have master repurchase agreements in place with various counterparties 
each broker has agreed to make funds available to us at various rates in exchange for collateral consisting of marketable securities 
the aggregate amount of these borrowing arrangements at december  was billion 
we also have a borrowing arrangement with the fhlbb 
we may borrow amounts determined by prescribed collateral levels and the amount of fhlbb stock we hold 
we are required to hold fhlbb stock equal to no less than i of our outstanding residential mortgage loan principal including mortgage pool securities  ii of total assets  or iii total advances from the fhlbb  divided by a leverage factor of the aggregate amount of borrowing available to us under this arrangement at december  was approximately billion 
the amount outstanding under this arrangement at december  was billion 
the fhlbb is implementing a new capital structure and stock investment rules to comply with the gramm leach bliley act of and regulations that were subsequently promulgated in by the fhlbb s regulator  the federal housing finance board 
the bank s capital stock investment in the fhlbb will remain at its current level of million under the new capital plan which takes effect on april  fhlbb capital stock investments require a five year advance notice of withdrawal under the new capital plan 
under the new capital plan  our million stock investment in the fhlbb will provide a borrowing capacity of approximately million

the commitment to pay for these services is based upon transaction volumes and includes inflationary price clauses 
to estimate our future contractual obligations for these commitments  we assumed transaction volumes would remain consistent with volumes and increased the amount by each year 
capital resources historically  we have financed our operations principally through internally generated cash flows 
we incur capital expenditures for furniture  fixtures  capitalized software and miscellaneous equipment needs 
we lease microcomputers through operating leases 
capital expenditures have been incurred and leases entered into on an as required basis  primarily to meet our growing operating needs 
as a result  our capital expenditures were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
for the year ended december   capital expenditures were comprised of approximately million in capitalized software and projects in process  million in fixed assets  and million in leasehold improvements 
for the year ended december   capital expenditures were comprised of approximately million in capitalized software and projects in process  million in fixed assets  and million in leasehold improvements 
stockholders equity at december  was million  up  from  primarily due to net income growth in the ratio of average stockholders equity to average assets decreased to at december  from at december   primarily due to asset growth in investment securities funded by increases in securities purchased under resale agreements and customer deposits 
the frb has adopted a system using internationally consistent risk based capital adequacy guidelines to evaluate the capital adequacy of banks and bank holding companies 
under the risk based capital guidelines  different categories of assets are assigned different risk weights  based generally upon the perceived credit risk of the asset 
these risk weights are multiplied by corresponding asset balances to determine a risk weighted asset base 
certain off balance sheet items are added to the risk weighted asset base by converting them to a balance sheet equivalent and assigning them the appropriate risk weight 
frb and fdic guidelines require that banking organizations have a minimum ratio of total capital to risk adjusted assets and off balance sheet items of 
total capital is defined as the sum of tier and tier capital elements  with at least half of the total capital required to be tier tier capital includes  with certain restrictions  the sum of common stockholders equity  noncumulative perpetual preferred stock  a limited amount of cumulative perpetual preferred stock  and minority interests in consolidated subsidiaries  less certain intangible assets 
tier capital includes  with certain limitations  subordinated debt meeting certain requirements  intermediate term preferred stock  certain hybrid capital instruments  certain forms of perpetual preferred stock  as well as maturing capital instruments and general allowances for loan losses 
our total and tier capital ratios at december  were each  which are in excess of minimum requirements 
the bank s total and tier capital ratios at december  were and  respectively  which are in excess of minimum requirements 
in addition to the risk based capital guidelines  the frb and the fdic use a leverage ratio as an additional tool to evaluate capital adequacy 
the leverage ratio is defined to be a company s tier capital divided by its adjusted average total assets 
the leverage ratio adopted by the federal banking agencies requires a ratio of tier capital to adjusted average total assets for top rated banking institutions 
all other banking institutions are expected to maintain a leverage ratio of to 
the computation of the risk based capital ratios and the leverage ratio requires that the capital of investors financial and that of investors bank be reduced by most intangible assets 
our leverage ratio at december  was  which is in excess of regulatory minimums 
investors bank s leverage ratio at december  was  which is also in excess of regulatory minimums
