item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview equus ii incorporated is a business development company which invests in equity and equity oriented securities issued by privately owned companies in transactions negotiated directly with such companies 
we had investments in portfolio companies and two venture capital funds at december  at december   we had investments in portfolio companies and the two venture funds 
we did not make any new investments in or since our assets were substantially invested and funds received from the disposition of investments were reinvested in follow on investments in portfolio companies or applied to reduce our line of credit 
since the make up of our portfolio of investments was predominantly non public securities in and  we were not able to borrow under our line of credit to fund new investments 
we attempt to limit risk by investing in a portfolio of companies involved in different industries 
we limit our initial investment in any company to no more than of the fund s net assets 
however  at december   of our net assets were invested in two companies in the residential window industry  and was invested in a third company which processes recycled glass 
we have entered into a definitive agreement  subject to certain conditions  to sell our investment in strategic holdings  inc  the recycled glass processor 
proceeds from such sale are expected to provide us with a level of liquidity to allow us to explore new investment opportunities in the valuation of our investments is the most significant area of judgment impacting our financial statements 
our portfolio investments are valued at our estimates of fair value  with the net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation included in the determination of net assets 
almost all of our long term investments are in privately held or restricted securities  the valuation of which is necessarily subjective 
actual values may differ materially from the fund s estimated fair value 
portfolio valuations are determined quarterly by the management company  subject to the approval of the board of directors  and are based on a number of relevant factors 
most of our portfolio companies utilize leverage  and the leverage magnifies the return on our investments 
for example  if a portfolio company has a total enterprise value of million and million in funded indebtedness  its equity is valued at million 
if the enterprise value increases or decreases by  to million or million  respectively  the value of the equity increases or decreases by  to million or 
million  respectively 
this disproportionate increase or decrease adds a level of volatility to our equity oriented portfolio securities 
we derive our cash flow from interest and dividends received and sales of securities from our investment portfolio 
we pay certain administrative costs  management fees to the management company overseeing the portfolio  and interest expense on our existing debt 
we also spend our cash on new investments  or follow on investments which may be required by certain portfolio companies 
historically  our cash flow from interest and dividends has not been sufficient to cover our expenses and follow on investments 
because our investments are illiquid  we have utilized leverage to provide the required funds  and the leverage is then repaid from the sale of portfolio securities 
since the fourth quarter of  our previous lender required that all proceeds from sale or repayment of our portfolio securities be applied to its loan  and reduced its commitment to advance funds under the loan agreement by a like amount 
we have distributed to our stockholders any net taxable investment income or realized capital 
table of contents gains on an annual basis 
we declared a dividend of per share in  including per share in qualifying dividend income and per share as a return of capital 
no dividend was declared or paid in since we are a closed end business development company  stockholders have no right to present their shares to the fund for redemption 
because our shares might trade at a discount  our board of directors has determined that it would be in the best interest of our stockholders for the fund to be authorized to attempt to reduce or eliminate the market value discount from net asset value 
accordingly  from time to time we may  but we are not required to  repurchase our shares including by means of tender offers to attempt to reduce or eliminate the discount or to increase the net asset value of our shares 
significant accounting policies valuation of investments the valuation of our portfolio companies is the most significant area of judgment impacting the financial statements 
portfolio investments are carried at fair value with the net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation included in the determination of net assets 
valuations of portfolio securities are performed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and the financial reporting policies of the sec 
the applicable methods prescribed by such principles and policies are described below publicly traded portfolio securities investments in companies whose securities are publicly traded are valued at their quoted market price at the close of business on the valuation date  less a discount to reflect the estimated effects of restrictions on the sale of such securities valuation discount  if applicable 
privately held portfolio securities the fair value of investments for which no market exists is determined on the basis of procedures established in good faith by our board of directors 
as a general principle  the current fair value of an investment is the amount we might reasonably expect to receive for it upon its current sale  in an orderly manner 
appraisal valuations are necessarily subjective and the management company s estimate of values may differ materially from amounts actually received upon the disposition of portfolio securities 
generally  cost is the primary factor used to determine fair value until significant developments affecting the portfolio company such as results of operations or changes in general market conditions provide a basis for use of an appraisal valuation 
thereafter  portfolio investments are carried at appraised values as determined quarterly by the management company  subject to the approval of our board of directors 
appraisal valuations are based upon such factors as a portfolio company s earnings  cash flow and net worth  the market prices for similar securities of comparable companies  an assessment of the company s current and future financial prospects and various other factors and assumptions 
in the case of unsuccessful operations  the appraisal may be based upon liquidation value 
most of our fund s common equity investments are appraised at a multiple of free cash flow generated by the portfolio company in its most recent fiscal year  less outstanding funded indebtedness and other senior securities such as preferred stock 
projections of current year free cash flow may be utilized and adjustments for non recurring items are considered 
multiples utilized are estimated based on the management company s experience in the private company marketplace  and are necessarily subjective in nature 
most of the portfolio companies utilize a high degree of leverage 
the banking environment currently has resulted in pressure on several of these portfolio companies to reduce the amount of leverage in order to maintain such financing 
from time to time  portfolio companies are in 
table of contents default of certain covenants in their loan agreements 
when the management company has a reasonable belief that a portfolio company will be able to restructure its loan agreements to adjust for any defaults  the portfolio company s securities continue to be valued assuming that the company is a going concern 
in the event a portfolio company cannot generate adequate cash flow to meet the principal and interest payments on its indebtedness or is not successful in refinancing the debt upon its maturity  the value of the fund s investment could be reduced or eliminated through foreclosure on the portfolio company s assets or the portfolio company s reorganization or bankruptcy 
we may also use  when available  third party transactions in a portfolio company s securities as the basis of valuation the private market method 
the private market method will be used only with respect to completed transactions or firm offers made by sophisticated  independent investors 
the fair values of debt securities  which are generally held to maturity  are determined on the the accompanying notes are an basis of the terms of the debt securities and the financial conditions of the issuer 
certificates of deposit generally will be valued at their face value  plus interest accrued to the date of valuation 
on a daily basis  we adjust our net asset value for changes in the value of our publicly held securities and material changes in the value of our private securities  and report those amounts to lipper analytical services  inc weekly and daily net asset values appear in various publications  including barron s and the wall street journal 
federal income taxes we intend to comply with the requirements of the internal revenue code necessary to qualify as a regulated investment company and  as such  will not be subject to federal income taxes on otherwise taxable income including net realized capital gains which is distributed to stockholders 
therefore  no provision for federal income taxes is recorded in the financial statements 
as of december   the fund has a capital loss carryforward of approximately  which may be used to offset future taxable capital gains 
we borrow money from time to time to maintain our tax status under the internal revenue code as a regulated investment company ric 
see borrowings and loss of conduit tax treatment for further discussions of our borrowings 
liquidity and capital resources at december   we had  of our total assets of  invested in portfolio securities of operating companies and two venture capital funds 
 of our remaining assets were invested in us treasury bills for the purpose of satisfying the diversification requirement to maintain our pass through tax treatment 
these securities were held by a securities brokerage firm and were pledged along with cash and other securities to secure the payment of the margin account balance 
the us treasury bills were sold and the margin loan was repaid to the brokerage firm on january  we had a  revolving line of credit with bank of america  na that expired on january  the line of credit was extended through march  at the reduced maximum borrowing amount of  we use our revolving line of credit to pay operating expenses and for new and follow on investments in portfolio securities 
we had  outstanding under this line of credit at december   which was collateralized by our portfolio securities 
in december  we borrowed an additional  from an individual pursuant to a promissory note  secured by  shares of common stock of champion window holdings  inc  due january   in order to fund a follow on investment 

table of contents effective march   we entered into a new  revolving line of credit loan with frost national bank 
the new line of credit extends through march  the proceeds of the new loan were utilized to pay off the previous line of credit 
the amount outstanding as of march  under the new line of credit is  and the availability of such line is  at such date 
the new loan is collateralized by our investments in portfolio securities 
the provisions of the new revolver include a borrowing base that cannot exceed of the total value of eligible portfolio securities 
interest on the new revolving line of credit is payable quarterly at a rate of 
above the floating prime rate  adjusted daily 
a facility fee of 
per annum on the unused portion of the line of credit is payable quarterly in arrears  and we paid a commitment fee of  at the closing of the loan 
management believes the new line of credit will provide us with sufficient liquidity to meet our known obligations  including expected follow on investments  during we have entered into an agreement  subject to certain conditions  to sell our interest in strategic holdings  inc on or before april  proceeds of such sale  if consummated  will be used to pay down our existing borrowings under our line of credit 
the remaining proceeds may be used for new or follow on investments 
there is no assurance that the sale will be completed 
we declared a dividend of per share for  or  we paid  in cash and issued  additional shares of common stock at per share on january  under certain circumstances  we may be called on to make follow on investments in certain portfolio companies 
if we do not have sufficient funds to make follow on investments  the portfolio company in need of the investment may be negatively impacted 
also  our equity interest in and our estimated fair value of the portfolio company could be reduced 
we have made loans to equicom  inc equicom from time to time to enable the company to service its debt 
we also have guaranteed obligations to financial institutions on behalf of equicom in the amount of  we expect to advance some portion of the  in in addition  as of december   we have committed to invest up to an additional  in the two venture capital funds in our portfolio 
we do not expect to advance more than  of our remaining commitments to the venture capital funds in net cash provided by operating activities was   and  for the three years ended december   and  respectively 
approximately million in estimated value of our investments are in the form of notes receivable from portfolio companies 
however  only two of the portfolio companies are currently paying cash interest to us in accordance with their respective notes receivable  which aggregate  in fair value 
at december   two of the promissory notes  with an estimated fair value of  provide that interest is paid in kind or that the original issue discount is accreted over the life of the notes  by adding such amount to the principal of the notes 
in conjunction with the restructuring of turfgrass america  inc turfgrass  we have agreed to exchange our existing investment  including notes receivable and preferred stock with costs aggregating  and  respectively  for common stock 
the only value we have assigned to the investment in turfgrass at december  is  in accrued interest receivable 
because of the nature and size of our portfolio investments  we periodically borrowed funds under a line of credit promissory note to make qualifying investments to maintain our tax status under the internal revenue code as a regulated investment company ric 
our line of credit promissory note expired on january  during  we borrowed sufficient funds to maintain our ric status by utilizing a margin account with a securities brokerage firm 
there is no assurance that such arrangement will be available in the future 
if we are unable to borrow funds to make qualifying investments  we may 
table of contents no longer qualify as a ric 
we would then be subject to corporate income tax on our net investment income and realized capital gains  and distributions to stockholders would be subject to income tax as ordinary dividends 
failure to continue to qualify as a ric could be material to us and our stockholders 
we have the ability to borrow funds and issue forms of senior securities representing indebtedness or stock  such as preferred stock  subject to certain restrictions 
net taxable investment income and net taxable realized gains from the sales of portfolio investments are intended to be distributed at least annually  to the extent such amounts are not reserved for payment of expenses and contingencies or to make follow on or new investments 
pursuant to the restrictions in our existing line of credit  we are not allowed to incur additional indebtedness unless approved by the lender 
we reserve the right to retain net long term capital gains in excess of net short term capital losses for reinvestment or to pay contingencies and expenses 
such retained amounts  if any  will be taxable to us as long term capital gains and stockholders will be able to claim their proportionate share of the federal income taxes paid by the fund on such gains as a credit against their own federal income tax liabilities 
stockholders will also be entitled to increase the adjusted tax basis of their fund shares by the difference between their undistributed capital gains and their tax credit 
results of operations investment income and expense our net investment income after all expenses amounted to   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
interest and dividend income from portfolio securities was  in   in and  in the increase in is attributable primarily to accrued interest written off on notes receivable from certain portfolio companies in  plus the receipt of a cash dividend of  from champion window holdings  inc in interest expense was  in as compared to  in and  in the increase in as compared to and is due primarily to an increase in the average interest rate on the loan and fees of  paid to extend the previous line of credit during the average interest rate in was  which was approximately four percentage points higher than the average rate paid in professional fees were  in as compared to  during and  during the decrease in and as compared to is due primarily to legal fees incurred in related to i a potential purchase of a portfolio company that did not occur and ii the sale of our investment in another portfolio company 
mailing  printing and other expenses were  in as compared to  during and  during the increase in as compared to is primarily due to a third quarter report not being produced in and the increased costs of edgarizing in due to new documentation required for the sarbanes oxley act 
the decrease from to is primarily due to the reduced costs in producing the annual reports 
we pay a management compensation fee to the management company at an annual rate of of our net assets  paid quarterly in arrears 
such fees amounted to   and  during  and  respectively 

table of contents during  the officers of the fund exercised options to purchase  shares of our common stock 
the exercise price was paid in the form of promissory notes from such officers 
during  such officers surrendered their shares in satisfaction of their notes 
under variable plan accounting applicable to these transactions  compensation expense was adjusted to reflect the change in benefit that the officers would have received assuming that their notes were settled with their pledged common stock at the end of each reporting period  based on our net asset value 
non cash compensation expense benefit under this arrangement was  for the year ended december  and was recorded as an adjustment to additional paid in capital 
on november   options to acquire a total of  shares at per share market price on date of grant were issued to officers of the fund 
these options included dividend equivalent rights 
generally accepted accounting principles require that the options be accounted for using variable plan accounting 
such accounting resulted in additional non cash compensation expense benefit of  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
see note in the notes to the financial statements for a table that reflects stock option activity for the three years ended december  dividend equivalent rights represent the right of our officers to receive a credit against the option exercise price for the amount of any dividends paid by us during the option period 
in january  we filed an application with the sec seeking an amendment to an exemptive order previously issued by the sec to permit us to grant dividend equivalent rights to the fund s independent directors as part of their stock option awards 
during its review of such application  the sec staff advised us that it does not believe that dividend equivalent rights are permitted under the investment company act 
accordingly  we may be required to obtain a new exemptive order from the sec permitting the fund to issue dividend equivalent rights 
based on the ongoing discussion with the sec  we have not recorded any associated compensation expense for the dividend applicable to dividend equivalent rights 
if the dividend equivalent rights had been in effect  additional non cash compensation expense of approximately  with an offsetting credit to additional paid in capital  would have been recognized under variable plan accounting in the fourth quarter 
such recognition of the non cash compensation expense would not have changed our reported net assets 
during its review of the exemptive application discussed above  the sec staff also raised certain issues with respect to the manner in which the officer notes were settled during we have responded to the staff s questions and supplied additional information 
although the ultimate resolution of this matter cannot be determined at this time  we believe that the resolution of this matter will not have an adverse financial impact on the fund

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are subject to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates with respect to our investments in debt securities and our outstanding debt payable  as well as changes in marketable equity security prices 
we do not use derivative financial instruments to mitigate any of these risks 
the return on our investments is generally not affected by foreign currency fluctuations 
our investments in portfolio securities consist of some fixed rate debt securities 
since the debt 
table of contents securities are generally priced at a fixed rate  changes in interest rates do not directly impact interest income 
in addition  changes in market interest rates are not typically a significant factor in our determination of fair value of these debt securities  since the securities are generally held to maturity 
their fair values are determined on the basis of the terms of the debt security and the financial condition of the issuer 
borrowings under our lines of credit expose the fund to certain market risks 
based on the average outstanding borrowings under our lines of credit for the year ended december  and  respectively  of approximately  and  a change of one percent in the interest rate would have caused a change in interest expense of approximately  and  this change would have resulted in a change of in the net asset value per share at december  and we did not enter into our credit facility for trading purposes and the line of credit carries interest at a pre agreed upon percentage point spread from the prime rate 
in addition  there were no significant changes to the factors that affect market risk from to we obtained a new line of credit effective march   which expires on march  see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations regarding our liquidity and capital resources 
a major portion of our investment portfolio consists of debt and equity investments in private companies 
modest changes in public market equity prices generally do not significantly impact the estimated fair value of these investments 
however  significant changes in market equity prices can have a longer term effect on valuations of private companies  which could affect the carrying value and the amount and timing of gains or losses realized on these investments 
a portion of our investment portfolio also consists of common stocks in publicly traded companies 
these investments are directly exposed to equity price risk  in that a hypothetical ten percent change in these equity prices would result in a similar percentage change in the fair value of these securities
