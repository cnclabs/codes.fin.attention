item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we are a reit focused within the multifamily industry in demand driven markets throughout the united states that have exhibited high job growth and resiliency to economic downturns 
our operating performance is based predominantly on net operating income noi from our apartment communities 
noi  which represents total property revenues less property operating and maintenance expenses as reflected in the consolidated statements of operations  is affected by the demand and supply dynamics within our markets 
see note  segment reporting  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our use of noi as the primary financial measure of performance for our apartment communities 
our performance is also affected by the general availability and cost of capital and our ability to develop and acquire additional apartment communities with returns in excess of our long term weighted average cost of capital 
business objective and strategies our objective is to increase shareholder value by producing consistent high quality earnings to sustain dividends and annual total returns that exceed the nareit apartment index 
to achieve that objective  we employ a number of business strategies 
first  our long term investment strategy is research driven  with the objective of creating a portfolio of high quality assets in strategically selected markets that are complementary through economic diversity and characterized by high job growth and resiliency to national economic downturns 
we believe such a portfolio will provide predictable operating cash flow performance that exceeds the national average on a sustainable basis 
second  we adhere to a strategy of owning and operating high quality  class aa a apartment communities under the gables brand in established premium neighborhoods  or epns 
epns are generally characterized as areas with the highest prices for single family homes on a per square foot basis 
we believe that communities  when located in epns and supplemented with high quality service and amenities  attract the affluent renter by choice who is willing to pay a premium for location preference  superior service and high quality communities 
the resulting portfolio should maintain high levels of occupancy and rental rates relative to overall market conditions 
this  coupled with more predictable operating expenses and reduced capital expenditure requirements associated with high quality construction materials  should lead to operating margins that exceed national averages for the apartment sector and sustainable growth in operating cash flow 
third  our aim is to be recognized as the employer of choice within the industry 
our mission of taking care of the way people live involves innovative human resource practices that we believe will attract and retain the highest caliber associates 
because of our long established presence as a fully integrated apartment management  development  construction  acquisition and disposition company within our markets  we have the ability to offer multi faceted career opportunities among the various disciplines within the industry 
finally  our capital strategy is to generate a return on invested capital that exceeds our long term weighted average cost of capital while maintaining financial flexibility through a conservative  investment grade credit profile 
we judiciously manage our capital and we redeploy capital through the reinvestment of asset disposition proceeds into our business 
we believe we are well positioned to continue achieving our objectives because the markets we have selected for investment are projected to continue to experience job growth that exceed national averages  our epn locations are expected to outperform local market results and national demand for apartments is expected to increase during the next five to ten years as the demographic group referred to as the echo boomer generation begins to form new households 
in the ordinary course of our business  we evaluate the continued ownership of our assets relative to available opportunities to acquire and develop new assets and relative to available equity and debt capital financing 
we sell assets if we determine that such sales are the most attractive sources of capital for redeployment in our business  for repayment of debt  for repurchase of stock and for other uses 
we maintain staffing levels sufficient to meet our existing development  construction  acquisition and property operating activities 
when market conditions warrant  we adjust staffing levels in an attempt to mitigate a negative impact on our results of operations 
we have experienced slight declines in rental revenues generated from our same store portfolio in as compared to prior years 
this is primarily due to national economic weakness  coupled with low mortgage rates that have resulted in an increase in home purchases by apartment residents 
however  the rate of decline has been diminishing and we expect that operating fundamentals for our business will improve as we move through as job growth  and the balance between supply and demand  improves in our markets 
the job growth prospects for our markets are partially related to national economic conditions 
we expect job growth to continue in our markets  but it is uncertain whether  and to what extent  the national economy and related job growth will improve in on a same store basis  we expect total property revenues in to be consistent with  or slightly higher than  levels and property operating and maintenance expenses for to increase over levels generally in line with inflation 
we intend to capitalize on our expectations of improving operating fundamentals by increasing our investment activity for both acquisition and development of new communities 
at the same time  we intend to take advantage of attractive valuations for apartment communities by continuing to sell assets that are no longer consistent with our strategy

see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies and recent accounting pronouncements our financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap and a summary of our significant accounting policies is included in notes and to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
notes and to the accompanying consolidated financial statements include a summary of recent accounting pronouncements and their actual or expected impact on our consolidated financial statements 
our preparation of the financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
our actual results may differ from these estimates 
as an owner  operator and developer of apartment communities  our critical accounting policies relate to revenue recognition  cost capitalization  depreciation and asset impairment evaluation and purchase price allocation for apartment community acquisitions 
revenue recognition rental we lease our residential properties under operating leases with terms generally equal to one year or less 
rental income is recognized when earned  which materially approximates revenue recognition on a straight line basis 
property management we provide property management services to third parties and unconsolidated joint ventures 
property management fees are recognized when earned 
ancillary services we provide development and construction  corporate rental housing and brokerage services to third parties and unconsolidated joint ventures 
development and construction services are typically provided under cost plus a fee contracts 
because our clients are obligated to fund the costs that are incurred on their behalf pursuant to the related contract  we net the reimbursement of these costs against the billings for such costs 
development and construction fees are recognized when earned using the percentage of completion method 
during the years ended december   and  we recognized million  million and million  respectively  in development and construction fees under related contracts with gross billings of million  million and million  respectively 
corporate rental housing revenues and brokerage commissions are recognized when earned 
gains on sales of real estate assets gains on sales of real estate assets are recognized pursuant to the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for sales of real estate 
the specific timing of the recognition of the sale and the related gain is measured against the various criteria in sfas no 
related to the terms of the transactions and any continuing involvement associated with the assets sold 
to the extent the sales criteria are not met  we defer gain recognition until the sales criteria are met 
cost capitalization as a vertically integrated real estate company  we have in house investment professionals involved in the development  construction and acquisition of apartment communities 
direct internal costs associated with development and construction activities for wholly owned assets are included in the capitalized development cost of such assets 
direct internal costs associated with development and construction activities for third parties and unconsolidated joint ventures are reflected in ancillary services expense as the related services are being rendered 
as required by gaap  we expense all internal costs associated with the acquisition of operating apartment communities to general and administrative expense in the period such costs are incurred 
our real estate development pursuits are subject to obtaining permits and other governmental approvals  as well as our ongoing business review of the underlying real estate fundamentals and the impact on our capital structure 
we do not always move forward with development of our real estate pursuits  and therefore  we evaluate the viability of real estate pursuits and the recoverability of capitalized pursuit costs regularly 
based on this periodic review  we expense any costs that are deemed unrealizable at that time to general and administrative expense 
during the development and construction of a new apartment community  we capitalize related interest costs  as well as other carrying costs such as property taxes and insurance 
we begin to expense these items as the construction of the community becomes substantially complete and the residential apartment homes become available for initial occupancy 
accordingly  we gradually reduce the amounts we capitalize as construction is being completed 
expenditures in excess of for purchases of a new asset with a useful life in excess of one year and for replacements and repairs that extend the useful life of the asset are capitalized and depreciated over their useful lives 
recurring value retention capital expenditures are typically incurred every year during the life of an apartment community and include such expenditures as carpet  flooring and appliances 
non recurring capital expenditures are costs that are generally incurred in connection with a major project impacting an entire community  such as roof replacement  parking lot resurfacing  exterior painting and siding replacement 
value enhancing capital expenditures are costs for which an incremental value is expected to be achieved from increasing the noi potential for a community or recharacterizing the quality of the income stream with an anticipated reduction in potential sales cap rate for items such as replacement of wood siding with a masonry based hardi board product  amenity upgrades and additions  installation of security gates and additions of covered parking 
recurring value retention and non recurring and or value enhancing capital expenditures do not include costs incurred in connection with a major renovation of an apartment community 
repairs and maintenance  such as landscaping maintenance  interior painting and cleaning and supplies used in such activities  are expensed as incurred 
depreciation and asset impairment evaluation under gaap  real estate assets are stated at the lower of depreciated cost or fair value  if deemed impaired 
depreciation is computed on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of to years for buildings and improvements and years for furniture  fixtures and equipment 
as required by gaap  we periodically evaluate our real estate assets to determine if there has been any impairment in their carrying value and record impairment losses if there are indicators of impairment and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets carrying amounts 
no such impairment losses have been recognized to date 
purchase price allocation for apartment community acquisitions in connection with the acquisition of an apartment community  we perform a valuation and allocation to each asset and liability acquired in such transaction  based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition 
the valuation of assets acquired subsequent to july   the effective date of sfas no 
 business combinations  includes both tangible assets and intangible assets 
tangible asset values  consisting of land  buildings and improvements  and furniture  fixtures and equipment  are reflected in real estate assets and depreciated over their estimated useful lives 
intangible asset values  consisting of at market  in place leases and resident relationships  are reflected in other assets and amortized over the average remaining lease term of the acquired resident relationships 
discontinued operations we adopted sfas no 
effective january  which requires  among other things  that the operating results of specified real estate assets which have been sold subsequent to january   or otherwise qualify as held for disposition as defined by sfas no 
 be reflected as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations for all periods presented 
we sold five wholly owned operating real estate assets during and four wholly owned operating real estate assets during however  we retained management of two of the assets sold during due to our continuing involvement with the operations of the two assets sold for which we retained management  the operating results of these assets are included in continuing operations 
the operating results for the seven remaining wholly owned assets sold for which we did not retain management are reflected as discontinued operations in our statements of operations for all periods presented 
interest expense has been allocated to the results of the discontinued operations in accordance with eitf no 
we had no assets that qualified as held for disposition as defined by sfas no 
at december  or results of operations comparison of operating results for the year ended december  to the year ended december  our net income is generated primarily from the operation of our apartment communities and the disposition of assets that no longer meet our investment criteria 
for purposes of evaluating comparative operating performance  we categorize our operating communities based on the period each community reaches stabilized occupancy 
a community is considered to have achieved stabilized occupancy on the earlier to occur of attainment of physical occupancy or one year after completion of construction 
the combined operating performance for all of our wholly owned apartment communities that are included in continuing operations for the years ended december  and is summarized as follows years ended december  number of apt

see note  segment reporting  to the accompanying financial statements for further discussion of our use of noi as the primary financial measure of performance for our apartment communities 
in addition  noi from this reportable segment is reconciled to the most directly comparable gaap measure in note total property revenues increased  or  from  to  due to an increase in the number of apartment homes resulting from the development  lease up and acquisition of additional communities  as well as an increase in number of available apartment homes associated with renovation activities at several of our communities 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in same store performance as a result of national economic weakness and the sale of two apartment communities in the first quarter of property operating and maintenance expenses  as reflected in our consolidated statements of operations  increased  or  from  to  due to an increase in the number of apartment homes resulting from the development  lease up and acquisition of additional communities  as well as an increase in the number of available apartment homes associated with renovation activities at several of our communities 
in addition  same store expenses increased due to increases in insurance costs and property taxes  partially offset by decreases in utilities and general and administrative expenses

see note  segment reporting  to the accompanying financial statements for further discussion of our use of noi as the primary financial measure of performance for our apartment communities 
in addition  noi from this reportable segment is reconciled to the most directly comparable gaap measure in note total property revenues decreased  or  from  to  due to the sale of one apartment community in the first quarter of  two apartment communities in the fourth quarter of and two apartment communities in the first quarter of  a decrease in same store performance as a result of national economic weakness  and a decrease in the number of available apartment homes associated with renovation activities at five of our communities 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in the number of apartment homes resulting from the development  lease up and acquisition of additional communities 
property operating and maintenance expense  as reflected in our consolidated statements of operations  increased  or  from  to  due to an increase in the number of apartment homes resulting from the development  lease up and acquisition of additional communities  as well as same store expenses increasing 
the same store expense increase is at a rate ahead of inflation due to a significant increase in insurance costs  along with higher turnover and marketing costs associated with national economic conditions 
these increases were offset in part by the and sales activity

we have elected to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code 
to qualify as a reit  we must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements  including a requirement that we currently distribute at least of our ordinary taxable income at the reit level to shareholders 
it is our current intention to adhere to these requirements and maintain our reit status 
as a reit  we generally will not be subject to federal income tax on distributed taxable income 
we utilize gables residential services  a taxable reit subsidiary  to provide management and other services to third parties that we  as a reit  may be prohibited from providing 
taxable reit subsidiaries are subject to federal  state and local income taxes 
contractual obligations a summary of our contractual obligations at december  is as follows payments due by year thereafter total regularly scheduled principal amortization payments balloon principal payments due at maturity a total notes payable operating leases b deferred purchase price of the archstone management business c manditorily redeemable series z preferred shares d total a outstanding indebtedness for each tax exempt bond issue is reflected in the preceding table using the earlier of the related bond maturity date or the bond enhancement facility maturity date  as applicable 
b includes two ground leases relating to apartment communities owned and operated by us 
c amount represents the maximum amount contingently payable in accordance with the purchase agreement 
d includes cumulative dividends of  from the june issuance date that are payable in june dividends from june to the june mandatory redemption date are payable annually and thus are excluded from the preceding table 
we have various standing or renewable service contracts with vendors related to the operation of our communities 
these contracts have terms generally equal to one year or less and provide for cancellation with insignificant or no penalties 
in addition to these contractual obligations  we currently have six communities under development that are expected to comprise  apartment homes upon completion and an indirect ownership interest in one development community that is expected to comprise apartment homes upon completion 
the estimated costs to complete the development of these assets total million at december   including million of costs that we are obligated to fund for the co investment development community and million of costs pertaining to the single family lot development adjacent to our gables montecito development community 
these costs are expected to be initially funded by million in construction loan proceeds and million in borrowings under our credit facilities described below 
at december   we owned two parcels of land on which we intend to develop two apartment communities that we currently expect will comprise apartment homes 
we also had rights to acquire additional parcels of land  either through options or long term conditional contracts  on which we believe we could develop ten apartment communities that we currently expect would comprise an estimated  apartment homes 
in january  we exercised one of such acquisition rights and acquired a parcel of land for the future development of a community in south florida that we currently expect will comprise an estimated apartment homes 
any future development is subject to obtaining permits and other governmental approvals  as well as our ongoing business review  and may not be undertaken or completed 
additional information regarding our development activity is included in item properties 
funding of short term and long term liquidity requirements our common and preferred dividends historically have been paid from cash provided by recurring real estate activities 
we anticipate that such dividends will continue to be paid from cash provided by recurring real estate activities that include both operating activities and asset disposition activities when evaluated over a twelve month period 
this twelve month evaluation period is relevant due to the timing of disposition activities and the payment of particular expense items that are accrued monthly but are paid on a less frequent basis  such as real estate taxes and interest on our senior unsecured notes 
we have met and expect to continue to meet our short term liquidity requirements through net cash provided by recurring real estate activities 
our net cash from recurring real estate activities has been adequate  and we believe that it will continue to be adequate  to meet both operating requirements and payment of dividends in accordance with reit requirements 
recurring value retention capital expenditures and non recurring and or value enhancing capital expenditures  in addition to regularly scheduled principal amortization payments  are also expected to be funded from recurring real estate activities that include both operating and asset disposition activities 
we anticipate that acquisition  construction  development and renovation activities as well as land purchases  will be initially funded primarily through borrowings under our credit facilities and construction loans described below 
we expect to meet our long term liquidity requirements  including the balloon principal payments due at maturity of our notes payable and possible land and property acquisitions  through long term secured and unsecured borrowings  the issuance of debt securities or equity securities  private equity investments in the form of joint ventures  or through the disposition of assets which  in our evaluation  may no longer meet our investment requirements 
million credit facility we have an unsecured revolving credit facility with a committed capacity of million provided by a syndicate of banks that has a maturity date of may this facility was modified in february and december to  among other things  increase the committed capacity under the facility from million to million and from million to million  respectively 
syndicated borrowings under this facility currently bear interest at our option of libor plus or prime minus 
fees for letters of credit issued under this facility are equal to the spread over libor for syndicated borrowings 
in addition  we pay a facility fee currently equal to of the million committed capacity 
the spread over libor for syndicated borrowings and the facility fee may be adjusted up or down based on changes in our senior unsecured credit ratings and our leverage ratios 
there are five stated pricing levels for the spread over libor for syndicated borrowings ranging from to and the facility fee ranging from to 
a competitive bid option is available for borrowings up to of the million committed capacity  or million 
this option allows participating banks to bid to provide us loans at a rate that is lower than the stated rate for syndicated borrowings 
at december   we had outstanding under the facility million in borrowings outstanding under the competitive bid option at an average interest rate of and million of letters of credit  including million of letters of credit enhancing four tax exempt variable rate notes payable totaling million 
thus  we had million of availability under the facility at december  we expect to renew and or renegotiate the facility prior to the may maturity date  however  there can no assurance that such renewal and or renegotiation will occur 
million borrowing facility we have a million unsecured borrowing facility with a bank that has a maturity date of may the interest rate and maturity date related to each advance under this facility is agreed to by both parties prior to each advance 
we had million in borrowings outstanding under this facility at december  at an interest rate of 
million credit facility we have a million unsecured revolving credit facility with a bank that has a maturity date of may borrowings under this facility bear interest at the same scheduled interest rates for syndicated borrowings as the million credit facility 
we had million in borrowings outstanding under this facility at december  at an interest rate of secured construction loans we have committed fundings under eight construction related financing vehicles for four wholly owned development communities totaling million from a bank 
at december   we had drawn million under these variable rate financing vehicles and therefore have million of remaining capacity 
borrowings under these vehicles bear interest at a weighted average rate of at december  restrictive covenants our secured and unsecured debt agreements generally contain representations  financial and other covenants and events of default typical for each specific type of facility or borrowing 
the indentures under which our publicly traded and other unsecured debt securities have been issued contain the following limitations on the incurrence of indebtedness a maximum leverage ratio of of total assets  a minimum debt service coverage ratio of  a maximum secured debt ratio of of total assets  and a minimum amount of unencumbered assets of of total unsecured debt 
our indentures also include other affirmative and restrictive covenants 
our ability to borrow under our unsecured credit facilities and secured construction loans is subject to our compliance with a number of financial covenants  affirmative covenants and other restrictions on an ongoing basis 
the principal financial covenants impacting our leverage are our total debt may not exceed of our total assets  our annualized interest coverage ratio may not be less than  our annualized fixed charge coverage ratio may be not less than  our total secured debt may not exceed of our total assets  and the recourse portion of our secured debt may not exceed of our total assets  our unencumbered assets may not be less than of our total unsecured debt  our tangible net worth may not be less than million  and our floating rate debt may not exceed of our total assets 
such financing vehicles also restrict the amount of capital we can invest in specific categories of assets  such as unimproved land  properties under construction  non multifamily properties  debt or equity securities  and unconsolidated affiliates 
in addition  we have a covenant under our unsecured credit facilities and secured construction loans that restricts the ability of the operating partnership to make distributions in excess of stated amounts  which in turn restricts our ability to declare and pay dividends 
in general  during any fiscal year  the operating partnership may only distribute up to of its consolidated income available for distribution 
this provision contains an exception to this limitation to allow the operating partnership to make any distributions necessary to allow us to maintain our status as a reit or distribute of our taxable income at the reit level 
we do not anticipate that this provision will adversely affect the ability of the operating partnership to make distributions sufficient for us to pay dividends under our current dividend policy 
our credit facilities  construction loans and indentures are cross defaulted and also contain cross default provisions with other of our material indebtedness 
we were in compliance with covenants and other restrictions included in our debt agreements as of december  the indentures and the million credit facility agreement containing the financial covenants discussed above  as well as the other material terms of our indebtedness  including definitions of the many terms used in and the calculations required by financial covenants  have been filed with the securities and exchange commission as exhibits to our periodic or other reports 
our tax exempt bonds contain customary covenants for this type of financing which require a specified percentage of the apartments in the bond financed communities to be rented to individuals based upon income levels specified by us government programs 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that we believe have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenue or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
we account for our joint venture arrangements using the equity method 
total indebtedness of our unconsolidated joint ventures is million at december  we have a million maximum limited payment guaranty on two joint venture construction loans with committed fundings aggregating million 
at december   there is million of principal outstanding under these loans and the portion of this that is recourse to us is million 
we do not believe that we will have any funding obligations under this limited payment guaranty 
the remaining million of joint venture indebtedness is not recourse to us 
see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our unconsolidated joint ventures 
inflation substantially all of the leases at our apartment communities are for a term of one year or less 
in the event of significant inflation  this may enable us to realize increased rents upon renewal of existing leases or the beginning of new leases 
short term leases generally minimize our risk from the adverse effects of inflation  although these leases generally permit residents to leave at the end of the lease term without penalty and therefore expose us to the effect of a decline in market rents 
in a deflationary rent environment  as is currently being experienced in some of our markets  we are exposed to declining rents more quickly under these shorter term leases

supplemental discussion funds from operations funds from operations ffo is used by industry analysts and investors as a supplemental operating performance measure of an equity real estate investment trust reit 
we calculate ffo in accordance with the definition that was adopted by the board of governors of the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit 
ffo  as defined by nareit  represents net income loss determined in accordance with gaap  excluding extraordinary items as defined under gaap and gains or losses from sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets  plus specified non cash items  such as real estate asset depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with gaap implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions  many industry investors and analysts have considered presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves 
thus  nareit created ffo as a supplemental measure of reit operating performance that excludes historical cost depreciation  among other items  from gaap net income 
the use of ffo  combined with the required primary gaap presentations  has improved the understanding of operating results of reits among the investing public and made comparisons of reit operating results more meaningful 
we generally consider ffo to be a useful measure for reviewing our comparative operating and financial performance although ffo should be reviewed in conjunction with net income which remains the primary measure of performance because by excluding gains or losses related to sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets and excluding real estate asset depreciation and amortization  ffo can help users compare the operating performance of a company s real estate between periods or as compared to different companies 
in may  we expensed  of early debt extinguishment costs 
under accounting rules in effect at that time  these costs were classified as an extraordinary item and  as such  did not reduce ffo 
in april  sfas no 
was issued 
we adopted this standard on its january  effective date and  pursuant to the new rules  reclassified the  of early debt extinguishment costs from extraordinary items to unusual items 
in the computation of ffo pursuant to the nareit definition outlined above  net income is adjusted for extraordinary items but is not adjusted for unusual items 
as such  previously reported ffo for the year ended december  has been reduced by  the adoption of this standard had no impact on previously reported net income 
in august  we redeemed all  of our outstanding series a preferred shares for  plus accrued and unpaid dividends 
in connection with the issuance of the series a preferred shares in july  we incurred  in issuance costs and recorded such costs as a reduction of shareholders equity 
the redemption price of the series a preferred shares exceeded the related carrying value by the  of issuance costs 
the july clarification of eitf abstracts  topic no 
d became effective for the third quarter and is required to be reflected retroactively by restating the financial statements of prior periods 
as a result  previously reported net income available to common shareholders and ffo available to common shareholders for the year ended december  has been reduced by the  excess 
ffo presented herein is not necessarily comparable to the ffo of other reits due to the fact that not all reits use the nareit definition 
however  our ffo is comparable to the ffo of reits that use the nareit definition 
ffo should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indicator of our operating performance 
additionally  ffo does not represent cash flows from operating  investing or financing activities as defined by gaap 
refer to management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources for a discussion of our cash needs and cash flows 
a reconciliation of ffo available to common shareholders from net income available to common shareholders the most directly comparable gaap measure to ffo available to common shareholders is as follows years ended december  net income available to common shareholders minority interest of common unitholders in operating partnership continuing operations discontinued operations total real estate asset depreciation and amortization wholly owned real estate assets continuing operations wholly owned real estate assets discontinued operations joint venture real estate assets total gain on sale of previously depreciated operating real estate assets wholly owned real estate assets continuing operations wholly owned real estate assets discontinued operations joint venture real estate assets total funds from operations available to common shareholders basic and diluted average common shares and units outstanding basic average common shares and units outstanding diluted item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our capital structure includes the use of fixed rate and variable rate indebtedness 
as such  we are exposed to the impact of changes in interest rates 
we periodically seek input from third party consultants regarding market interest rate and credit risk in order to evaluate our interest rate exposure 
in some situations  we may utilize derivative financial instruments in the form of rate caps  rate swaps or rate locks to hedge interest rate exposure by modifying the interest rate characteristics of related balance sheet instruments and prospective financing transactions 
we do not utilize such instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
we did not have any derivative instruments in place at december  or we typically refinance maturing debt instruments at the then existing market interest rates and terms  which may be more or less favorable than the interest rates and terms on the maturing debt 
the following table provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates and should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates in effect at december  by expected maturity dates 
outstanding indebtedness for each tax exempt bond issue is reflected in the table using the earlier of the related bond maturity date or the bond enhancement facility maturity date  as applicable 
the weighted average interest rates presented in this table are inclusive of credit enhancement fees 
there have been no substantial changes in our market risk profile from the preceding year and the assumptions are consistent with prior year assumptions 
expected year of maturity and thereafter total fair value total debt conventional fixed rate average interest rate tax exempt fixed rate average interest rate total fixed rate debt average interest rate tax exempt variable rate average interest rate variable rate credit facilities average interest rate variable rate construction loans average interest rate total variable rate debt average interest rate total debt average interest rate the estimated fair value of our debt at december  is based on a discounted cash flow analysis using current borrowing rates for debt with similar terms and remaining maturities 
such fair value is subject to changes in interest rates 
generally  the fair value will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise
