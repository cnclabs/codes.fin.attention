other competition the property and casualty and life and health insurance industries are highly competitive both as to rate and service 
cna s consolidated property and casualty subsidiaries compete not only with other stock insurance companies  but also with mutual insurance companies  reinsurance companies and other entities for both producers and customers 
cna must continuously allocate resources to refine and improve its insurance and reinsurance products and services 
rates among insurers vary according to the types of insurers and methods of operation 
cna competes for business not only on the basis of rate  but also on the basis of availability of coverage desired by customers and quality of service  including claim adjustment services 
there are approximately  individual companies that sell property and casualty insurance in the united states 
cna s consolidated property and casualty subsidiaries ranked as the ninth largest property and casualty insurance organization in the united states based upon statutory net written premiums 
the commercial property and casualty markets continue to realize significant rate increases  indicative of a hard market  while simultaneously using more strict underwriting criteria and requiring higher retention amounts for policyholders to further mitigate risk 
the markets focus on underwriting profitability and the heightened perception of risk indicate the hard market will likely continue at a reduced level into regulation the insurance industry is subject to comprehensive and detailed regulation and supervision throughout the united states 
each state has established supervisory agencies with broad administrative powers relative to licensing insurers and agents  approving policy forms  establishing reserve requirements  fixing minimum interest rates for accumulation of surrender values and maximum interest rates of policy loans  prescribing the form and content of statutory financial reports and regulating solvency and the type and amount of investments permitted 
such regulatory powers also extend to premium rate regulations  which require that rates not be excessive  inadequate or unfairly discriminatory 
in addition to regulation of dividends by insurance subsidiaries  intercompany transfers of assets may be subject to prior notice or approval by the state insurance regulator  depending on the size of such transfers and payments in relation to the financial position of the insurance affiliates making the transfer or payments 
see liquidity and capital resources dividend paying ability included in item insurers are also required by the states to provide coverage to insureds who would not otherwise be considered eligible by the insurers 
each state dictates the types of insurance and the level of coverage that must be provided to such involuntary risks 
cna s share of these involuntary risks is mandatory and generally a function of its respective share of the voluntary market by line of insurance in each state 
insurance companies are subject to state guaranty fund and other insurance related assessments 
guaranty fund and other insurance related assessments are levied by the state departments of insurance to cover claims of insolvent insurers 
reform of the us tort liability system is another issue facing the insurance industry 
over the last decade  many states have passed some type of reform  but more recently  a number of state courts have modified or overturned these reforms 
additionally  new causes of action and theories of damages continue to be proposed in state court actions or by legislatures 
continued unpredictability in the law means that insurance underwriting and rating is expected to continue to be difficult in commercial lines  professional liability and some specialty coverages 
although the federal government and its regulatory agencies do not directly regulate the business of insurance  federal legislative and regulatory initiatives can impact the insurance business in a variety of ways 
these initiatives and legislation include tort reform proposals  class action reform proposals  proposals to establish a privately financed trust to process asbestos bodily injury claims  proposals to overhaul the superfund hazardous waste removal and liability statutes  and various tax proposals affecting insurance companies 
in  congress passed the financial services modernization or gramm leach bliley act glb act  which repealed portions of the glass steagall act and enabled closer relationships between banks and insurers 
although functional regulation was preserved by the glb act for state oversight of insurance  additional financial services modernization legislation could include provisions for an alternate federal system of regulation for insurance companies 
cna s domestic insurance subsidiaries are subject to risk based capital requirements 
risk based capital is a method developed by the national association of insurance commissioners naic to determine the minimum amount of statutory capital appropriate for an insurance company to support its overall business operations in consideration of its size and risk profile 
the formula for determining the amount of risk based capital specifies various factors  weighted based on the perceived degree of risk  that are applied to certain financial balances and financial activity 
the adequacy of a company s actual capital is evaluated by a comparison to the risk based capital results  as determined by the formula 
companies below minimum risk based capital requirements are classified within certain levels  each of which determines a specified level of regulatory attention applicable to a company 
as of december  and  all of cna s domestic insurance subsidiaries exceeded the minimum risk based capital requirements 
subsidiaries with insurance operations outside the united states are also subject to regulation in the countries in which they operate 
cna has operations in the united kingdom  canada  and other countries 
information related to regulation is set forth in md a included under item terrorism insurance cna and the insurance industry incurred substantial losses related to the september  world trade center disaster and related events 
for the most part  cna believes the industry was able to absorb the loss of capital from these losses  but the capacity to withstand the effect of any additional terrorism events was significantly diminished 
information related to terrorism is set forth in item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

the principal cigarette brand names of lorillard are newport  kent  true  maverick and old gold 
lorillard s largest selling brand is newport  the second largest selling cigarette brand in the united states and the largest selling brand in the menthol segment of the us cigarette market in newport accounted for approximately of lorillard s sales in substantially all of lorillard s sales are in the united states  puerto rico and certain us territories 
lorillard s major trademarks outside of the united states were sold in lorillard accounted for  and of the company s consolidated total revenue for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the major tobacco companies in the united states  including lorillard  continues to be faced with a number of issues that have impacted or may adversely impact the in business  results of operations and financial condition 
these issues include substantial litigation seeking damages aggregating into the billions of dollars  as well as other relief  substantial annual payments and marketing and advertising restrictions provided for in the settlement agreements with each of the states and certain other jurisdictions  the continuing contraction of the us cigarette market  competition from other major cigarette manufacturers and deep discount manufacturers and resultant increases in industry wide promotional expenses and sales incentives  substantial and potentially increasing federal  state and local excise taxes  regulation of the manufacture  sale  distribution  advertising  labeling and use of tobacco products  and increasing sales of counterfeit cigarettes in the united states 
see results of operations lorillard  and liquidity and capital resources lorillard included in item of this report 
see also item of this report  and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
legislation and regulation lorillard s business operations are subject to a variety of federal  state and local laws and regulations governing  among other things  publication of health warnings on cigarette packaging  advertising and sales of tobacco products  restrictions on smoking in public places and fire safety standards 
further  from time to time new legislation or regulations are proposed and reports are published by government sponsored committees and others recommending additional regulations of tobacco products 
federal regulation the federal comprehensive smoking education act  which became effective in  requires that cigarette packaging and advertising display one of the following four warning statements  on a rotating basis surgeon general s warning smoking causes lung cancer  heart disease  emphysema  and may complicate pregnancy 
surgeon general s warning quitting smoking now greatly reduces serious risks to your health 
surgeon general s warning smoking by pregnant women may result in fetal injury  premature birth  and low birth weight 
surgeon general s warning cigarette smoke contains carbon monoxide 
this law also requires that each person who manufactures  packages or imports cigarettes shall annually provide to the secretary of health and human services a list of the ingredients added to tobacco in the manufacture of cigarettes 
this list of ingredients may be submitted in a manner that does not identify the company that uses the ingredients or the brand of cigarettes that contain the ingredients 
in addition  from time to time  bills have been introduced in congress  among other things  to end or limit the price supports for leaf tobacco  to prohibit all tobacco advertising and promotion  to require new health warnings on cigarette packages and advertising  to authorize the establishment of various anti smoking education programs  to provide that current federal law should not be construed to relieve any person of liability under common or state law  to permit state and local governments to restrict the sale and distribution of cigarettes  concerning the placement of advertising of tobacco products  to provide that cigarette advertising not be deductible as a business expense  to prohibit the mailing of unsolicited samples of cigarettes and otherwise to restrict the sale or distribution of cigarettes in retail stores  by mail or over the internet  to impose an additional  or to increase existing  excise taxes on cigarettes  to require that cigarettes be manufactured in a manner that will cause them  under certain circumstances  to be self extinguishing  and to subject cigarettes to regulation in various ways by the us department of health and human services or other regulatory agencies 
in  the us food and drug administration published regulations that would have extensively regulated the distribution  marketing and advertising of cigarettes  including the imposition of a wide range of labeling  reporting  record keeping  manufacturing and other requirements 
challenges to the fda s assertion of jurisdiction over cigarettes made by lorillard and other manufacturers were upheld by the supreme court in march when that court ruled that congress did not give the fda authority to regulate tobacco products under the federal food  drug and cosmetic act 
since the supreme court decision  various proposals and recommendations have been made for additional federal and state legislation to regulate cigarette manufacturers 
congressional advocates of fda regulation have introduced legislation that would give the fda authority to regulate the manufacture  sale  distribution and labeling of tobacco products to protect public health  thereby allowing the fda to reinstate its prior regulations or adopt new or additional regulations 
proposals have also been introduced to end the federal price support and quota system for tobacco growers and to compensate the growers with payments to be funded by a fee  tax or other charge on tobacco products to be paid by tobacco manufacturers 
recently  efforts have been made to link the new fda proposals with the buy out of the federal tobacco price support and quota system  which is intended to increase the likelihood of the passage of both the fda proposals and the buy out 
in february of  a committee convened by the institute of medicine  a private  non profit organization which advises the federal government on medical issues  issued a report recommending that congress enact legislation enabling a suitable agency to regulate tobacco related products that purport to reduce exposure to one or more tobacco toxicants or to reduce risk of disease  and to implement other policies designed to reduce the harm from tobacco use 
the report recommended regulation of all tobacco products  including potentially reduced exposure products  known as preps 
in certain public health groups petitioned the fda to assert jurisdiction over several prep type products that have been introduced into the marketplace 
these groups assert that claims made by manufacturers of these products allow the fda to regulate the manufacture  advertising and sale of these products as drugs or medical devices under the food drug and cosmetic act 
the agency has received comments on these petitions but has taken no action 
in late philip morris usa  the largest usa manufacturer of cigarettes  filed a request for rulemaking petition with the federal trade commission ftc seeking changes in the existing ftc regulatory scheme for measuring and reporting tar and nicotine to the federal government and for inclusion in cigarette advertising 
the agency procedures allow for interested parties to submit comments on this proposal 
the agency has received comments on these petitions but has taken no action 
in  the surgeon general of the united states and the national academy of sciences reported that environmental tobacco smoke ets exposes nonsmokers to an increased risk of lung cancer and respiratory illness 
in addition  in  the united states environmental protection agency released a report the epa risk assessment concluding that ets is a human lung carcinogen in adults  and causes respiratory effects in children  the epa risk assessment has not been used as a basis for any regulatory action by the epa 
in may  the department of health and human service s national toxicology program listed ets as known to be a human carcinogen 
various public health organizations have also issued statements on environmental tobacco smoke and its health effects and many scientific papers on ets have been published since the epa risk assessment  with varying conclusions 
lorillard cannot predict the ultimate outcome of these proposals  reports and recommendations  though if enacted  certain of these proposals could have a material adverse effect on lorillard s business and the company s financial position or results of operations in the future 
state and local regulation in recent years  many state  local and municipal governments and agencies  as well as private businesses  have adopted legislation  regulations or policies which prohibit or restrict  or are intended to discourage  smoking  including legislation  regulations or policies prohibiting or restricting smoking in various places such as public buildings and facilities  stores  restaurants and bars and on airline flights and in the workplace 
this trend has increased significantly since the release of the epa risk assessment 
the following are examples of some of the more significant state and local regulations affecting lorillard s business 
in september of  the california environmental protection agency released a report the cal epa report concluding that ets causes specified development  respiratory  carcinogenic and cardiovascular effects including lung and nasal sinus cancer  heart disease  sudden infant death syndrome  respiratory infections and asthma induction and exacerbation in children 
the cal epa report was subsequently released as a monograph by the national cancer institute in november of the california air resources board is in the early stages of the process of determining whether to identify ets as a toxic air contaminant  or tac  under the toxic air contaminant identification and control act 
a subcommittee of that board has issued a draft report linking ets with certain diseases  and public comment on the report has been invited 
if california  on the basis of its assessments of risk and exposure  identifies ets as a tac  california could initiate the control phase of the tanner act  which involves adoption of measures to reduce or eliminate emissions 
these measures could include further restrictions regarding venues where smoking is permitted or controls on product emissions 

the commonwealth of massachusetts has enacted legislation requiring each manufacturer of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco sold in massachusetts to submit to the state s department of public health dph an annual report identifying for each brand sold certain added constituents  and providing nicotine yield ratings and other information for certain brands based on regulations promulgated by the dph 
the state of texas has implemented legislation similar to the massachusetts law 
neither legislation allows for the public release of trade secret information 

new york state has enacted legislation that requires the state s office of fire prevention and control ofpc to promulgate fire safety standards for cigarettes sold in new york and that cigarettes sold in new york meet ignition propensity performance standards established by that agency 
on december   ofpc issued final fire safety standards for cigarettes proposing performance and testing standards pursuant to the legislation 
the effective date of the regulations is june  lorillard has developed proprietary technology to comply with the standards and intends to be able to comply by the effective date 
other similar laws and regulations have been enacted or considered by other state and local governments 
lorillard cannot predict the impact which these regulations may have on lorillard s business  though if enacted  they could have a material adverse effect on lorillard s business and the company s financial position or results of operations in the future 
excise taxes cigarettes are subject to substantial federal  state and local excise taxes in the united states and  in general  such taxes have been increasing 
on january   the federal excise tax on cigarettes increased by per thousand cigarettes and is now per thousand cigarettes or per pack of cigarettes 
state excise taxes  which are levied upon and paid by the distributors  are also in effect in the fifty states  the district of columbia and many municipalities 
increases in state excise taxes on cigarette sales in ranged from per pack to per pack in states plus the district of columbia 
the average state excise tax  including the district of columbia  increased to per pack of cigarettes in from in proposals for additional increases in federal  state and local excise taxes continue to be considered 
the combined state and municipal taxes generally range from to per pack of cigarettes 
advertising and marketing lorillard advertises its products to adult smokers in magazines  newspapers  direct mail and point of sale display materials 
in addition  lorillard promotes its cigarette brands to adult smokers through distribution of store coupons  retail price promotions  and personal contact with distributors and retailers 
although lorillard s sales are made primarily to wholesale distributors rather than retailers  lorillard s sales personnel monitor retail and wholesale inventories  work with retailers on displays and signs  and enter into promotional arrangements with retailers from time to time 
as a general matter  lorillard allocates its marketing expenditures among brands on the basis of marketplace opportunity and profitable return 
in particular  lorillard focuses its marketing efforts on the premium segment of the us cigarette industry  with a specific focus on newport 
advertising of tobacco products through television and radio has been prohibited since in addition  on november   lorillard and the three other largest major cigarette manufacturers entered into a master settlement agreement msa with states  the district of columbia  the commonwealth of puerto rico and certain other us territories to settle certain health care cost recovery and other claims 
these manufacturers had previously settled similar claims brought by the four remaining states which together with the msa are generally referred to as the state settlement agreements 
under the state settlement agreements the participating cigarette manufacturers agreed to severe restrictions on their advertising and promotion activities 
among other things  the msa prohibits the targeting of youth in the advertising  promotion or marketing of tobacco products  bans the use of cartoon characters in all tobacco advertising and promotion  limits each tobacco manufacturer to one event sponsorship during any twelve month period  which may not include major team sports or events in which the intended audience includes a significant percentage of youth  bans all outdoor advertising of tobacco products with the exception of small signs at retail establishments that sell tobacco products  bans tobacco manufacturers from offering or selling apparel and other merchandise that bears a tobacco brand name  subject to specified exceptions  prohibits the distribution of free samples of tobacco products except within adult only facilities  prohibits payments for tobacco product placement in various media  and bans gift offers based on the purchase of tobacco products without sufficient proof that the intended gift recipient is an adult 
many states  cities and counties have enacted legislation or regulations further restricting tobacco advertising 
there may be additional local  state and federal legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to the advertising and promotion of cigarettes in the future 
lorillard cannot predict the impact of such initiatives on its marketing and sales efforts 
lorillard has funded and plans to continue to fund a youth smoking prevention program  which is designed to discourage youth from smoking 
the program has addressed not only youth  but also parents and  through the we card program  retailers  to prevent purchase of cigarettes by underage purchasers 
lorillard has determined not to advertise its cigarettes in magazines with large readership among people under the age of distribution methods lorillard sells its products primarily to distributors  who in turn service retail outlets  chain store organizations  and government agencies  including the us armed forces 
upon completion of the manufacturing process  lorillard ships cigarettes to public distributing warehouse facilities for rapid order fulfillment to wholesalers and other direct buying customers 
lorillard retains a portion of its manufactured cigarettes at its greensboro central distribution center and greensboro cold storage facility for future finished goods replenishment 
as of december   lorillard had approximately direct buying customers servicing more than  retail accounts 
lorillard does not sell cigarettes directly to consumers 
during  and  sales made by lorillard to mclane company  inc  comprised  and  respectively  of lorillard s revenues 
no other customer accounted for more than of  or sales 
lorillard does not have any backlog orders 
most of lorillard s customers buy cigarettes on a next day delivery basis 
approximately of lorillard s customers purchase cigarettes using electronic funds transfer  which provides immediate payment to lorillard 
raw materials and manufacturing in its production of cigarettes  lorillard uses burley leaf tobacco  and flue cured leaf tobacco grown in the united states and abroad  and aromatic tobacco grown primarily in turkey and other near eastern countries 
a domestic supplier manufactures all of lorillard s reconstituted tobacco 
lorillard purchases more than of its domestic leaf tobacco from dimon international  inc lorillard directs dimon in the purchase of tobacco according to lorillard s specifications for quality  grade  yield  particle size  moisture content and other characteristics 
dimon purchases and processes the whole leaf and then dries and packages it for shipment to and storage at lorillard s danville  virginia facility 
in the event that dimon becomes unwilling or unable to supply leaf tobacco to lorillard  lorillard believes that it can readily obtain high quality leaf tobacco from well established  alternative industry sources 
due to the varying size and quality of annual crops and other economic factors  including us tobacco production controls administered by the united states department of agriculture  tobacco prices have historically fluctuated 
the us price supports that accompany production controls have inflated the market price of tobacco 
in addition  the transition in tobacco purchasing from auction markets to direct farmer contracting may increase the market price of domestically grown tobacco 
however  lorillard does not believe that this increase  if any  will have a material effect on its business lorillard stores its tobacco in storage warehouses on its acre danville facility 
to protect against loss  amounts of all types and grades of tobacco are stored in separate warehouses 
because the process of aging tobacco normally requires approximately two years  lorillard maintains large quantities of leaf tobacco at all times 
lorillard believes its current tobacco supplies are adequately balanced for its present production requirements 
if necessary  lorillard can purchase aged tobacco in the open markets to supplement existing inventories 
lorillard produces cigarettes at its greensboro  north carolina manufacturing plant  which has a production capacity of approximately million cigarettes per day and approximately billion cigarettes per year 
through various automated systems and sensors  lorillard actively monitors all phases of production to promote quality and compliance with applicable regulations 
prices lorillard believes that the volume of us cigarette sales is sensitive to price changes 
changes in pricing by lorillard or other cigarette manufacturers could have an adverse impact on lorillard s volume of units sold  which in turn could have an adverse impact on lorillard s profits and earnings 
lorillard makes independent pricing decisions based on a number of factors 
lorillard cannot predict the potential adverse impact of price changes on industry volume or lorillard volume  on the mix between premium and discount sales  on lorillard s market share or on lorillard s profits and earnings 
lorillard has not increased its wholesale prices since march of in may of  lorillard lowered the wholesale list price of its discount brand  maverick  by per thousand cigarettes per pack of cigarettes in an effort to reposition the brand to be more competitive in the deep discount price cigarette segment 
properties lorillard s manufacturing facility is located on approximately acres in greensboro  north carolina 
this  square foot plant contains modern high speed cigarette manufacturing machinery 
the greensboro facility also includes a warehouse with shipping and receiving areas totaling  square feet 
in addition  lorillard owns tobacco receiving and storage facilities totaling approximately  square feet in danville  virginia 
lorillard s executive offices are located in a  square foot  four story office building in greensboro 
its  square foot research facility is also located in greensboro 
lorillard s principal properties are owned in fee 
with minor exceptions  lorillard owns all of the machinery it uses 
lorillard believes that its properties and machinery are in generally good condition 
lorillard leases sales offices in major cities throughout the united states  a cold storage facility in greensboro and warehousing space in public distributing warehouses located throughout the united states 
competition the domestic us market for cigarettes is highly competitive 
competition is primarily based on a brand s price  positioning  consumer loyalty  retail display  promotion  quality and taste 
lorillard s principal competitors are the three other major us cigarette manufacturers  philip morris  rj reynolds rjr and brown williamson b w 
lorillard believes its ability to compete even more effectively has been restrained by the philip morris retail leaders program and could further be restrained by the proposed combination of rjr and b w discussed below 
the terms of philip morris merchandising contracts preclude lorillard from obtaining visible space in the retail store to effectively promote its brands 
as a result in a large number of retail locations  lorillard either has a severely limited or no opportunity to competitively support its promotion programs thereby limiting its sales potential 
lorillard s market share of the us domestic cigarette industry was fourth highest overall 
philip morris  rjr and b w accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of wholesale shipments in among the four major manufacturers  lorillard ranked third behind philip morris and rjr with a share of the premium segment in on october   rjr  the second largest cigarette manufacturer in the united states  and british american tobacco announced that they have agreed to combine the us tobacco business of rjr with british american tobacco s us tobacco business  b w  the third largest cigarette manufacturer in the united states 
the closing of this combination is subject to various conditions  including regulatory approvals 
if completed  the consolidation of these two competitors would result in further concentration of the us tobacco industry  with the top two companies  philip morris usa and the newly created reynolds american  having a combined market share of approximately 
in addition  this transaction would combine in one company the third and fourth leading menthol brands  kool and salem  which have a combined share of the menthol segment of approximately 
this concentration of us market share could make it more difficult for lorillard and others to compete for shelf space in retail outlets and could impact price competition among menthol brands  either of which could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations and financial condition of the company 
the following table sets forth cigarette sales data provided by the industry and by lorillard to management science associates msai  an independent third party database management organization that collects wholesale shipment data from various cigarette manufacturers and provides analysis of market share  unit sales volume and premium versus discount mix for individual companies and the industry as a whole 
msai s information relating to unit sales volume and market share of certain of the smaller  primarily deep discount  cigarette manufacturers is based on estimates derived by msai 
lorillard management believes that volume and market share information for these manufacturers are understated and  correspondingly  share information for the larger manufacturers  including lorillard  are overstated by msai 
the table below indicates the relative position of lorillard in the us industry lorillard lorillard calendar year to industry msai divides the cigarette market into two price segments  the premium price segment and the discount or reduced price segment 
according to msai  the discount segment share of market decreased from approximately in to in virtually all of lorillard s sales are in the premium price segment where lorillard s share amounted to approximately in  in and in  as reported by msai

the hotels owned by loews hotels are subject to mortgage indebtedness aggregating approximately million at december  with interest rates ranging from to  and maturing between and in addition  certain hotels are held under leases which are subject to formula derived rental increases  with rentals aggregating approximately million for the year ended december  competition from other hotels  motor hotels and inns  including facilities owned by local interests and by national and international chains  is vigorous in all areas in which loews hotels operates 
the demand for hotel rooms in many areas is seasonal and dependent on general and local economic conditions 
loews hotels properties also compete with facilities offering similar services in locations other than those in which its hotels are located 
competition among luxury hotels is based primarily on location and service 
competition among resort and commercial hotels is based on price as well as location and service 
because of the competitive nature of the industry  hotels must continually make expenditures for updating  refurnishing and repairs and maintenance  in order to prevent competitive obsolescence 
diamond offshore drilling  inc 
diamond offshore drilling inc diamond offshore  is engaged  through its subsidiaries  in the business of owning and operating drilling rigs that are used primarily in the drilling of offshore oil and gas wells on a contract basis for companies engaged in exploration and production of hydrocarbons 
diamond offshore operates offshore rigs 
diamond offshore accounted for  and of the company s consolidated total revenue for the years ended december   and  respectively 
drilling units and equipment diamond offshore currently owns and operates mobile offshore drilling rigs semisubmersible rigs  jack up rigs and one drillship and related equipment 
offshore rigs are mobile units that can be relocated via either self propulsion or the use of tugs enabling them to be repositioned based on market demand 
semisubmersible rigs are supported by large pontoons and are partially submerged during drilling for greater stability 
semisubmersibles are typically anchored in position and remain stable for drilling in the semi submerged floating position due in part to their wave transparency characteristics at the water line 
semisubmersibles can also be held in position through the use of a computer controlled thruster dynamic positioning system to maintain the rig s position over a drillsite 
diamond offshore has three such semisubmersible rigs with dynamic positioning capabilities 
diamond offshore owns and operates nine high specification semisubmersible rigs 
these semisubmersibles are larger than many other semisubmersibles  are capable of working in deep water or harsh environments  and have other advanced features 
as of february   diamond offshore was actively marketing of its semisubmersible rigs 
these rigs are currently located as follows nine in the us gulf of mexico  four in mexico  three in the north sea and three in brazil  with the remaining rigs located in various foreign markets 
the remaining four of diamond offshore s semisubmersible rigs are cold stacked  two since march and two since december when diamond offshore anticipates that a rig will be idle for an extended period of time  it cold stacks the unit by ceasing to actively market the rig 
this eliminates all expenditures associated with keeping the rig ready to go to work 
diamond offshore owns and operates jack up rigs  of which were being actively marketed as of february  these rigs stand on the ocean floor with their drilling platforms jacked up on support legs above the water 
they are used for drilling in water depths from feet to feet 
thirteen of diamond offshore s jack up rigs are cantilevered units capable of over platform development drilling and workover as well as exploratory drilling 
twelve of diamond offshore s jack up rigs are currently located in the gulf of mexico 
diamond offshore s drillship is self propelled and designed to drill in deep water 
shaped like a conventional vessel  it is the most mobile of the major rig types 
diamond offshore s drillship has dynamic positioning capabilities and is currently operating in brazil 
markets diamond offshore s principal markets for its offshore contract drilling services are the gulf of mexico  including the united states and offshore mexico  europe  principally the uk and norway  south america  africa  and australia southeast asia 
diamond offshore actively markets its rigs worldwide 
diamond offshore contracts to provide offshore drilling services vary in their terms and provisions 
diamond offshore often obtains its contracts through competitive bidding  although it is not unusual for diamond offshore to be awarded drilling contracts without competitive bidding 
drilling contracts generally provide for a basic drilling rate on a fixed dayrate basis regardless of whether or not such drilling results in a productive well 
drilling contracts may also provide for lower rates during periods when the rig is being moved or when drilling operations are interrupted or restricted by equipment breakdowns  adverse weather or water conditions or other conditions beyond the control of diamond offshore 
under dayrate contracts  diamond offshore generally pays the operating expenses of the rig  including wages and the cost of incidental supplies 
dayrate contracts have historically accounted for a substantial portion of diamond offshore s revenues 
in addition  diamond offshore has worked some of its rigs under dayrate contracts that include the ability to earn an incentive bonus based upon performance 
a dayrate drilling contract generally extends over a period of time covering either the drilling of a single well  a group of wells a well to well contract or a stated term a term contract and may be terminated by the customer in the event the drilling unit is destroyed or lost or if drilling operations are suspended for a specified period of time as a result of a breakdown of equipment or  in some cases  due to other events beyond the control of either party 
in addition  certain of diamond offshore s contracts permit the customer to terminate the contract early by giving notice and in some circumstances may require the payment of an early termination fee by the customer 
the contract term in many instances may be extended by the customer exercising options for the drilling of additional wells at fixed or mutually agreed terms  including dayrates 
the duration of offshore drilling contracts is generally determined by market demand and the respective management strategies of the offshore drilling contractor and its customers 
in periods of rising demand for offshore rigs  contractors typically prefer well to well contracts that allow contractors to profit from increasing dayrates 
in contrast  during these periods customers with reasonably definite drilling programs typically prefer longer term contracts to maintain dayrate prices at a consistent level 
conversely  in periods of decreasing demand for offshore rigs  contractors generally prefer longer term contracts to preserve dayrates at existing levels and ensure utilization  while customers prefer well to well contracts that allow them to obtain the benefit of lower dayrates 
if possible  diamond offshore seeks to have a foundation of long term contracts with a reasonable balance of single well  well to well and short term contracts to minimize the downside impact of a decline in the market while still participating in the benefit of increasing dayrates in a rising market 
customers diamond offshore provides offshore drilling services to a customer base that includes major and independent oil and gas companies and government owned oil companies 
several customers have accounted for or more of diamond offshore s annual consolidated revenues  although the specific customers may vary from year to year 
during  diamond offshore performed services for different customers with petroleo brasileiro sa petrobras and bp accounting for and of diamond offshore s annual total consolidated revenues  respectively 
during  diamond offshore performed services for different customers with petrobras  bp  and murphy exploration and production company accounting for  and of diamond offshore s annual total consolidated revenues  respectively 
during  diamond offshore performed services for different customers with bp and petrobras accounting for and of diamond offshore s annual total consolidated revenues  respectively 
during periods of low demand for offshore drilling rigs  the loss of a single significant customer could have a material adverse effect on diamond offshore s results of operations 
competition the contract drilling industry is highly competitive and is influenced by a number of factors  including the current and anticipated prices of oil and natural gas  the expenditures by oil and gas companies for exploration and development of oil and natural gas and the availability of drilling rigs 
in addition  demand for drilling services remains dependent on a variety of political and economic factors beyond diamond offshore s control  including worldwide demand for oil and natural gas  the ability of the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec to set and maintain production levels and pricing  the level of production of non opec countries and the policies of the various governments regarding exploration and development of their oil and natural gas reserves 
customers often award contracts on a competitive bid basis  and although a customer selecting a rig may consider  among other things  a contractor s safety record  crew quality  rig location  and quality of service and equipment  an oversupply of rigs can create an intensely competitive market in which price is the primary factor in determining the selection of a drilling contractor 
in periods of increased drilling activity  rig availability often becomes a consideration  particularly with respect to technologically advanced units 
diamond offshore believes that competition for drilling contracts will continue to be intense in the foreseeable future 
contractors are also able to adjust localized supply and demand imbalances by moving rigs from areas of low utilization and dayrates to areas of greater activity and relatively higher dayrates 
such movements  reactivations or a decrease in drilling activity in any major market could depress dayrates and could adversely affect utilization of diamond offshore s rigs 
governmental regulation diamond offshore s operations are subject to numerous international  federal  state and local laws and regulations that relate directly or indirectly to its operations  including certain regulations controlling the discharge of materials into the environment  requiring removal and clean up under certain circumstances  or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment 
for example  diamond offshore may be liable for damages and costs incurred in connection with oil spills for which it is held responsible 
laws and regulations protecting the environment have become increasingly stringent in recent years and may  in certain circumstances  impose strict liability rendering a company liable for environmental damage without regard to negligence or fault on the part of such company 
liability under such laws and regulations may result from either governmental or citizen prosecution 
such laws and regulations may expose diamond offshore to liability for the conduct of or conditions caused by others  or for acts of diamond offshore that were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time such acts were performed 
the application of these requirements or the adoption of new requirements could have a material adverse effect on diamond offshore 
the united states oil pollution act of opa  and similar legislation enacted in texas  louisiana and other coastal states  addresses oil spill prevention and control and significantly expands liability exposure across all segments of the oil and gas industry 
opa  such similar legislation and related regulations impose a variety of obligations on diamond offshore related to the prevention of oil spills and liability for damages resulting from such spills 
opa imposes strict and  with limited exceptions  joint and several liability upon each responsible party for oil removal costs and a variety of public and private damages 
indemnification and insurance diamond offshore s operations are subject to hazards inherent in the drilling of oil and gas wells such as blowouts  reservoir damage  loss of production  loss of well control  cratering or fires  the occurrence of which could result in the suspension of drilling operations  injury to or death of rig and other personnel and damage to or destruction of diamond offshore s  diamond offshore s customers or a third party s property or equipment 
damage to the environment could also result from diamond offshore s operations  particularly through oil spillage or uncontrolled fires 
in addition  offshore drilling operations are subject to perils peculiar to marine operations  including capsizing  grounding  collision and loss or damage from severe weather 
diamond offshore has insurance coverage and contractual indemnification for certain risks  but there can be no assurance that such coverage or indemnification will adequately cover diamond offshore s loss or liability in certain circumstances or that diamond offshore will continue to carry such insurance or receive such indemnification 
diamond offshore s retention of liability for property damage is between and million per incident  depending on the value of the equipment  with an aggregate annual deductible of million 
in addition  diamond offshore is self insured for of its property damage losses 
operations outside the united states operations outside the united states accounted for approximately  and of diamond offshore s total consolidated revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
diamond offshore s non us operations are subject to certain political  economic and other uncertainties not encountered in us operations  including risks of war and civil disturbances or other risks that may limit or disrupt markets  expropriation and the general hazards associated with the assertion of national sovereignty over certain areas in which operations are conducted 
no prediction can be made as to what governmental regulations may be enacted in the future that could adversely affect the international drilling industry 
diamond offshore s operations outside the united states may also face the additional risk of fluctuating currency values  hard currency shortages  controls of currency exchange and repatriation of income or capital 
during  diamond offshore entered into contracts to operate four of its semisubmersible rigs offshore mexico for pemex exploracion y produccion  the national oil company of mexico 
the terms of these contracts expose diamond offshore to greater risks than it normally assumes  such as exposure to greater environmental liability 
while diamond offshore believes that the financial terms of the contracts and diamond offshore s operating safeguards in place mitigate these risks  there can be no assurance that diamond offshore s increased risk exposure will not have a negative impact on diamond offshore s future operations or financial results 
properties diamond offshore owns an eight story office building located in houston  texas containing approximately  net rentable square feet  which is used for its corporate headquarters 
diamond offshore also owns two buildings totaling  square feet and acres of land in new iberia  louisiana for its offshore drilling warehouse and storage facility  and a  square foot building and five acres of land in aberdeen  scotland for its north sea operations

classes of common stock the issuance of carolina group stock has resulted in a two class common stock structure for loews corporation 
carolina group stock  commonly called a tracking stock  is intended to reflect the economic performance of a defined group of assets and liabilities of the company referred to as the carolina group 
the principal assets and liabilities attributed to the carolina group are a the company s stock ownership interest in lorillard  inc  b notional  intergroup debt owed by the carolina group to the loews group billion outstanding at december   bearing interest at the annual rate of and  subject to optional prepayment  due december   and c any and all liabilities  costs and expenses arising out of or related to tobacco or tobacco related businesses 
as of december   the outstanding carolina group stock represents a economic interest in the economic performance of the carolina group 
the loews group consists of all the company s assets and liabilities other than the economic interest represented by the outstanding carolina group stock  and includes as an asset the notional  intergroup debt of the carolina group 
the existence of separate classes of common stock could give rise to occasions where the interests of the holders of loews common stock and carolina group stock diverge or conflict or appear to diverge or conflict 
subject to its fiduciary duties  the company s board of directors could  in its sole discretion  from time to time  make determinations or implement policies that affect disproportionately the groups or the different classes of stock 
for example  loews s board of directors may decide to reallocate assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and cash flows between groups  without the consent of shareholders

the accounting policies discussed below are considered by management to be critical to an understanding of the company s consolidated financial statements as their application places the most significant demands on management s judgment 
due to the inherent uncertainties involved with this type of judgment  actual results could differ significantly from estimates and have a material adverse impact on the company s results of operations or equity 
insurance reserves insurance reserves are established for both short and long duration insurance contracts 
short duration contracts are primarily related to property and casualty insurance policies where the reserving process is based on actuarial estimates of the amount of loss  including amounts for known and unknown claims 
long duration contracts typically include traditional life insurance and long term care products and are estimated using actuarial estimates about mortality and morbidity as well as assumptions about expected investment returns 
workers compensation lifetime claim reserves and accident and health disability claim reserves are calculated using mortality and morbidity assumptions based on cna and industry experience  and are discounted at interest rates that range from to at december  the inherent risks associated with the reserving process are discussed below  in reserves estimates and uncertainties 
additionally  a review of results of operations for cna s segment results  environmental pollution and mass tort and asbestos reserves  and reserve development sections is necessary to understand the sensitivity of management s estimate 
reinsurance amounts recoverable from reinsurers are estimated in a manner consistent with claim and claim adjustment expense reserves or future policy benefits reserves and are reported as receivables in the consolidated balance sheets

tobacco and other litigation lorillard and other cigarette manufacturers continue to be confronted with substantial litigation 
plaintiffs in most of the cases seek unspecified amounts of compensatory damages and punitive damages  although some seek damages ranging into the billions of dollars 
plaintiffs in some of the cases seek treble damages  statutory damages  disgorgement of profits  equitable and injunctive relief  and medical monitoring  among other damages 
lorillard believes that it has valid defenses to the cases pending against it 
lorillard also believes it has valid bases for appeal of the adverse verdicts against it 
to the extent the company is a defendant in any of the lawsuits  the company believes that it is not a proper defendant in these matters and has moved or plans to move for dismissal of all such claims against it 
while lorillard intends to defend vigorously all tobacco products liability litigation  it is not possible to predict the outcome of any of this litigation 
litigation is subject to many uncertainties  and it is possible that some of these actions could be decided unfavorably 
lorillard may enter into discussions in an attempt to settle particular cases if it believes it is appropriate to do so 
on may  the florida third district court of appeal vacated the judgment entered in favor of a class of florida smokers in the case of engle v 
rj reynolds tobacco co  et al 
the judgment reflected an award of punitive damages to the class of approximately billion  including billion against lorillard 
the court of appeals also decertified the class ordered during pre trial proceedings 
plaintiffs are seeking review of the case by the florida supreme court 
the company and lorillard believe that the appeals court s decision should be upheld upon further appeals 
except for the impact of the state settlement agreements as described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this report  management is unable to make a meaningful estimate of the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome of pending litigation and  therefore  no provision has been made in the consolidated condensed financial statements for any unfavorable outcome 
it is possible that the company s results of operations  cash flows and its financial position could be materially adversely affected by an unfavorable outcome of certain pending or future litigation 
cna is also involved in various legal proceedings that have arisen during the ordinary course of business 
cna evaluates the facts and circumstances of each situation and when cna determines it necessary  a liability is estimated and recorded 
valuation of investments and impairment of securities the company classifies its holdings of fixed maturity securities bonds and redeemable preferred stocks and equity securities  which are held principally by insurance subsidiaries  as available for sale  and are carried at fair value 
changes in fair value are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders equity  net of applicable deferred income taxes and participating policyholders and minority interest 
the amortized cost of fixed maturity securities is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity  which are included in investment income 
the company s investment portfolio is subject to market declines below book value that may be other than temporary 
cna has an impairment committee  which reviews its investment portfolio on a quarterly basis with ongoing analysis as new information becomes available 
any decline that is determined to be other than temporary is recorded as an impairment loss in the results of operations in the period in which the determination occurred 
see investments cna in this md a and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item for information related to the company s impairment charges 
securities in the parent company s investment portfolio that are not part of its cash management activities are classified as trading securities in order to reflect the company s investment philosophy 
these investments are carried at fair value with the net unrealized gain or loss included in the consolidated statements of operations 
individual long term care products cna s reserves and deferred acquisition costs for its individual long term care product offerings are based on certain assumptions including morbidity  policy persistency and interest rates 
actual experience may differ from these assumptions 
the recoverability of deferred acquisition costs and the adequacy of the reserves are contingent on actual experience related to these key assumptions and other factors including potential future premium increases and future health care cost trends 
the company s results of operations and or equity may be materially  adversely affected if actual experience varies significantly from these assumptions

claim and claim adjustment expense and future policy benefit reserves are reflected as liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets under the heading insurance reserves 
adjustments to prior year reserve estimates  if necessary  are reflected in the results of operations in the period that the need for such adjustments is determined 
the level of insurance reserves maintained by cna represents management s best estimate  as of a particular point in time  of what the ultimate settlement and administration of claims will cost based on its assessment of facts and circumstances known at that time 
insurance reserves are not an exact calculation of liability but instead are complex estimates that are derived by cna  generally utilizing a variety of actuarial reserve estimation techniques  from numerous assumptions and expectations about future events  both internal and external  many of which are highly uncertain 
among the many uncertain future events about which cna makes assumptions and estimates  many of which have become increasingly unpredictable  are claims severity  frequency of claims  mortality  morbidity  expected interest rates  inflation  claims handling and case reserving policies and procedures  underwriting and pricing policies  changes in the legal and regulatory environment and the lag time between the occurrence of an insured event and the time it is ultimately settled  referred to in the insurance industry as the tail 
these factors must be individually considered in relation to cna s evaluation of each type of business 
many of these uncertainties are not precisely quantifiable  particularly on a prospective basis  and require significant management judgment 
given the factors described above  it is not possible to quantify precisely the ultimate exposure represented by claims and related litigation 
as a result  cna regularly reviews the adequacy of its reserves and reassesses its reserve estimates as historical loss experience develops  additional claims are reported and settled and additional information becomes available in subsequent periods 
in addition  cna is subject to the uncertain effects of emerging or potential claims and coverage issues that arise as industry practices and legal  judicial  social and other environmental conditions change 
these issues have had  and may continue to have  a negative effect on cna s business by either extending coverage beyond the original underwriting intent or by increasing the number or size of claims 
recent examples of emerging or potential claims and coverage issues include 
increases in the number and size of water damage claims  including those related to expenses for testing and remediation of mold conditions  
increases in the number and size of claims relating to injuries from medical products  and exposure to lead  
the effects of accounting and financial reporting scandals and other major corporate governance failures which have resulted in an increase in the number and size of claims  including director and officer and errors and omissions insurance claims  
class action litigation relating to claims handling and other practices  
increases in the number of construction defect claims  including claims for a broad range of additional insured endorsements on policies  and 
increases in the number of claims alleging abuse by members of the clergy the impact of these and other unforeseen emerging or potential claims and coverage issues is difficult to predict and could materially adversely affect the adequacy of cna s claim and claim adjustment expense reserves and could lead to future reserve additions 
cna s experience has been that establishing reserves for casualty coverages relating to apmt claim and claim adjustment expenses is subject to uncertainties that are greater than those presented by other claims 
estimating the ultimate cost of both reported and unreported apmt claims is subject to a higher degree of variability due to a number of additional factors  including among others 
coverage issues  including whether certain costs are covered under the policies and whether policy limits apply  
inconsistent court decisions and developing legal theories  
increasingly aggressive tactics of plaintiffs lawyers  
the risks and lack of predictability inherent in major litigation  
changes in the volume of asbestos and environmental pollution and mass tort claims which cannot now be anticipated  
continued increase in mass tort claims relating to silica and silica containing products  
the impact of the exhaustion of primary limits and the resulting increase in claims on any umbrella or excess policies that cna has issued  
the number and outcome of direct actions against cna  and 
cna s ability to recover reinsurance for asbestos and environmental pollution and mass tort claims 
it is also not possible to predict changes in the legal and legislative environment and the impact on the future development of apmt claims 
this development will be affected by future court decisions and interpretations  as well as changes in applicable legislation 
it is difficult to predict the ultimate outcome of large coverage disputes until settlement negotiations near completion and significant legal questions are resolved or  failing settlement  until the dispute is adjudicated 
this is particularly the case with policyholders in bankruptcy where negotiations often involve a large number of claimants and other parties and require court approval to be effective 
a further uncertainty exists as to whether a national privately financed trust to replace litigation of asbestos claims with payments to claimants from the trust will be established and approved through federal legislation  and  if established and approved  whether it will contain funding requirements in excess of cna s carried loss reserves 
due to the factors described above  among others  establishing reserves for apmt claim and claim adjustment expenses is subject to uncertainties that are greater than those presented by other claims 
traditional actuarial methods and techniques employed to estimate the ultimate cost of claims for more traditional property and casualty exposures are less precise in estimating claim and claim adjustment reserves for apmt  particularly in an environment of emerging or potential claims and coverage issues that arise from industry practices and legal  judicial and social conditions 
therefore  these traditional actuarial methods and techniques are necessarily supplemented with additional estimating techniques and methodologies  many of which involve significant judgments that are required of management 
due to the inherent uncertainties in estimating reserves for apmt claim and claim adjustment expenses and the degree of variability due to  among other things  the factors described above  cna may be required to record material changes in its claim and claim adjustment expense reserves in the future  should new information become available or other developments emerge 
see the asbestos and environmental pollution and mass tort reserves section of this md a for additional information relating to apmt claims and reserves 
cna s recorded insurance reserves  including apmt reserves  reflect management s best estimate as of a particular point in time based upon known facts  current law and management s judgment 
in light of the many uncertainties associated with establishing the estimates and making the assumptions necessary to establish reserve levels  cna reviews its reserve estimates on a regular basis and makes adjustments in the period that the need for such adjustments is determined 
these reviews have resulted in cna identifying information and trends that have caused cna to increase its reserves in prior periods and could lead to the identification of a need for additional material increases in claim and claim adjustment expense reserves  which could materially adversely affect the company s results of operations and equity and cna s business  insurer financial strength and debt ratings see the ratings section of this md a 
the following table presents estimated volatility in carried claim and claim adjustment expense reserves for the property and casualty and other insurance segments 
gross carried estimated loss volatility in december  reserves reserves in millions  except standard lines  specialty lines  cna re  other insurance  the estimated volatility noted above does not represent a range around the actuarial point estimate of cna s gross loss reserves  and it does not represent the range of all possible outcomes 
the volatility represents an estimate of the inherent volatility associated with estimating loss reserves for the specific type of business written by each segment 
the primary characteristics influencing the estimated level of volatility are the length of the claim settlement period  changes in medical and other claim costs  changes in the level of litigation or other dispute resolution processes  changes in the legal environment and the potential for different types of injuries emerging 
ceded reinsurance arrangements may reduce the volatility 
since ceded reinsurance arrangements vary by year  volatility in gross reserves may not result in comparable impacts to underwriting income or equity 
reinsurance cna assumes and cedes reinsurance to other insurers  reinsurers and members of various reinsurance pools and associations 
cna utilizes reinsurance arrangements to limit its maximum loss  provide greater diversification of risk  minimize exposures on larger risks and to exit certain lines of business 
property and casualty reinsurance coverages are tailored to the specific risk characteristics of each product line and cna s retained amount varies by type of coverage 
treaty reinsurance is purchased to protect specific lines of business such as property  worker s compensation  and professional liability 
corporate catastrophe reinsurance is also purchased for property and worker s compensation exposure 
most treaty reinsurance is purchased on an excess of loss basis 
cna also utilizes facultative reinsurance in certain lines 
cna s ceded life reinsurance includes utilization of coinsurance  yearly renewable term and facultative programs 
a majority of the reinsurance utilized by cna s life insurance operations relates to term life insurance policies 
term life insurance policies issued from onward are generally ceded at of the face value 
universal life policies issued from onward are generally ceded at of the face value 
cna s overall reinsurance program includes certain property and casualty contracts  such as the corporate aggregate reinsurance treaties discussed in more detail later in this section  that are entered into and accounted for on a funds withheld basis 
under the funds withheld basis  cna records the cash remitted to the reinsurer for the reinsurer s margin  or cost of the reinsurance contract  as ceded premiums 
the remainder of the premiums ceded under the reinsurance contract not remitted in cash is recorded as funds withheld liabilities 
cna is required to increase the funds withheld balance at stated interest crediting rates applied to the funds withheld balance or as otherwise specified under the terms of the contract 
the funds withheld liability is reduced by any cumulative claim payments made by cna in excess of cna s retention under the reinsurance contract 
if the funds withheld liability is exhausted  interest crediting will cease and additional claim payments are recoverable from the reinsurer 
the funds withheld liability is recorded in reinsurance balances payable in the consolidated balance sheets 
interest cost on these contracts is credited during all periods in which a funds withheld liability exists 
interest cost  which is included in other net investment income  was  and million in  and the amount subject to interest crediting rates on such contracts was  and  million at december  and certain funds withheld reinsurance contracts  including the corporate aggregate reinsurance treaties  require interest on additional premiums arising from ceded losses as if those premiums were payable at the inception of the contract 
the amount of retroactive interest  included in the totals above  was  and million in  and the amount subject to interest crediting on these funds withheld contracts will vary over time based on a number of factors  including the timing of loss payments and ultimate gross losses incurred 
cna expects that it will continue to incur significant interest costs on these contracts for several years 
the ceding of insurance does not discharge the primary liability of cna 
therefore  a credit exposure exists with respect to property and casualty and life reinsurance ceded to the extent that any reinsurer is unable to meet the obligations or to the extent that the reinsurer disputes the liabilities assumed under reinsurance agreements 
cna has established an allowance for doubtful accounts to provide for estimated uncollectible reinsurance receivables 
the allowance for doubtful accounts was and million at december  and the reserve increased by million during in recognition of deterioration of the financial strength ratings of several reinsurers  including trenwick group ltd 
and commercial risk reinsurance company ltd 
in addition  in the third quarter of  cna updated its reinsurance bad debt model based on recently published studies of reinsurer insolvencies 
while cna believes the allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate based on current collateral and information currently available at the financial stability of reinsurers failure of reinsurers to meet their obligations could have a material adverse impact on the company s results of operations and or equity 
cna attempts to mitigate its credit risk related to reinsurance by entering into reinsurance arrangements only with reinsurers that have credit ratings above certain levels and by obtaining substantial amounts of collateral 
the primary methods of obtaining collateral are through reinsurance trusts  letters of credit and funds withheld balances 
such collateral was approximately  and  million at december  and in certain circumstances  including significant deterioration of a reinsurer s financial strength ratings  cna may engage in commutation discussions with individual reinsurers 
the outcome of such discussions may result in a lump sum settlement that is less than the recorded receivable  net of any applicable allowance for doubtful accounts 
losses arising from commutations could have an adverse material impact on the company s results of operations or equity 
cna has reinsurance receivables from several reinsurers who have recently experienced multiple downgrades of their financial strength ratings  have announced that they will no longer accept new business and are placing their books of business into run off 
one of cna s principal credit exposures from these recent events arises from reinsurance receivables from gerling global gerling 
in  cna commuted all remaining ceded and assumed reinsurance contracts with four gerling entities 
the commutations resulted in a pretax loss of million  which was net of a previously established allowance for doubtful accounts of million 
cna has no further exposure to the gerling companies that are in run off 
cna estimates that these commutations will reduce pretax interest expense related to these treaties by approximately million in amounts receivable from reinsurers were  and  million at december  and of these amounts  and million were billed to reinsurers as of december  and  as reinsurance contracts generally require payment of claims by the ceding company before the amount can be billed to the reinsurer 
the remaining receivable relates to the estimated case and incurred but not reported ibnr reserves and future reserves and future policyholder benefits ceded under reinsurance contracts 
cna s largest recoverables from a single reinsurer at december   including prepaid reinsurance premiums  were approximately     and million from subsidiaries of the allstate corporation allstate  subsidiaries of hannover reinsurance ireland ltd  hartford life group insurance company  american reinsurance company  european reinsurance company of zurich and subsidiaries of the berkshire hathaway group 
for  cna entered into a corporate aggregate reinsurance treaty covering substantially all of cna s property and casualty lines of business the cover 
ceded premium related to the reinsurer s margin of million was recorded in no losses were ceded during under this contract  and the cover was commuted as of december  cna has an aggregate reinsurance treaty related to the through accident years that covers substantially all of cna s property and casualty lines of business the aggregate cover 
the aggregate cover provides for two sections of coverage 
these coverages attach at defined loss ratios for each accident year 
coverage under the first section of the aggregate cover  which is available for all accident years covered by the treaty  has a million limit per accident year of ceded losses and an aggregate limit of billion of ceded losses for the three accident years 
the ceded premiums associated with the first section are a percentage of ceded losses and for each million of limit the ceded premium is million 
the second section of the aggregate cover  which only relates to accident year  provides additional coverage of up to million of ceded losses for a maximum ceded premium of million 
under the aggregate cover  interest charges on the funds withheld liability accrue at per annum 
the aggregate loss ratio for the three year period has exceeded certain thresholds which requires additional premiums to be paid and an increase in the rate at which interest charges are accrued 
this rate will increase to per annum commencing in during  as a result of the unfavorable net prior year development recorded related to accident years and  the million limit related to the and accident years under the first section was fully utilized and losses of million were ceded under the first section of the aggregate cover 
in  as a result of reserve additions including those related to accident year  the million limit related to the accident year under the first section was fully utilized and losses of million were ceded under the second section as a result of losses related to the world trade center disaster and related events wtc event 
the aggregate limits for the aggregate cover have been fully utilized 
the impact of the aggregate cover was as follows year ended december in millions ceded earned premium ceded claim and claim adjustment expenses  interest charges pretax expense benefit in  cna entered into a one year aggregate reinsurance treaty related to the accident year covering substantially all property and casualty lines of business in the continental casualty company pool the ccc cover 
the loss protection provided by the ccc cover has an aggregate limit of approximately million of ceded losses 
the ceded premiums are a percentage of ceded losses 
the ceded premium related to full utilization of the million of limit is million 
the ccc cover provides continuous coverage in excess of the second section of the aggregate cover discussed above 
during  the ccc cover was fully utilized 
under the ccc cover  interest charges on the funds withheld generally accrue at per annum 
the interest rate increases to per annum if the aggregate loss ratio exceeds certain thresholds 
if the aggregate loss ratio would exceed these certain thresholds  then additional interest charges on funds withheld would be approximately million in the impact of the ccc cover was as follows year ended december in millions ceded earned premium ceded claim and claim adjustment expenses interest charges pretax expense benefit the impact by operating segment of the aggregate cover and the ccc cover was as follows years ended december in millions standard lines specialty lines cna re total property and casualty corporate and other pretax impact benefit expense world trade center event during the third quarter of  cna recorded estimated incurred losses of million pretax  net of reinsurance  related to the wtc event 
the loss estimate was based on a total industry loss of billion and included all lines of insurance 
this estimate took into account cna s substantial reinsurance agreements  including its catastrophe reinsurance program and corporate reinsurance programs 
cna has closely monitored reported losses as well as the collection of reinsurance on wtc event claims 
during both and  cna reduced the reserves related to the wtc event in both the property and casualty and group and life segments 
see the segment discussions of this md a for further information 
as of december   cna believes its recorded reserves  net of reinsurance  for the wtc event are adequate

the pretax net impact includes million of reinstatement and additional premiums 
terrorism insurance cna and the insurance industry incurred substantial losses related to the wtc event 
for the most part  the industry was able to absorb the loss of capital from these losses  but the capacity to withstand the effect of any additional terrorism events was significantly diminished 
the terrorism risk insurance act of the act established a program within the department of the treasury under which the federal government will share the risk of loss by commercial property and casualty insurers arising from future terrorist attacks 
the act expires on december  each participating insurance company must pay a deductible  ranging from of direct earned premiums from commercial insurance lines in to in  before federal government assistance becomes available 
for losses in excess of a company s deductible  the federal government will cover of the excess losses  while companies retain the remaining 
losses covered by the program will be capped annually at billion  above this amount  insurers are not liable for covered losses and congress is to determine the procedures for and the source of any payments 
amounts paid by the federal government under the program over certain phased limits are to be recouped by the department of the treasury through policy surcharges  which cannot exceed of annual premium 
cna is required to participate in the program  but it does not cover life or health insurance products 
state law limitations applying to premiums and policies for terrorism coverage are not generally affected under the program 
the act requires insurers to offer terrorism coverage through the secretary of the department of the treasury has discretion to extend this offer requirement until december  while the act provides the property and casualty industry with an increased ability to withstand the effect of a terrorist event through  given the unpredictability of the nature  targets  severity or frequency of potential terrorist events  the company s results of operations or equity could nevertheless be materially adversely impacted by them 
cna is attempting to mitigate this exposure through its underwriting practices  policy terms and conditions where applicable and the use of reinsurance 
in addition  under state laws  cna is generally prohibited from excluding terrorism exposure from its primary workers compensation  individual life and group life and health policies 
in those states that mandate property insurance coverage of damage from fire following a loss  cna is also prohibited from excluding terrorism exposure under such coverage 
reinsurers obligations for terrorism related losses under reinsurance agreements are not covered by the act 
cna s assumed reinsurance arrangements  beginning with the january  renewal period  either exclude terrorism coverage or significantly limit the level of coverage 
restructuring in  cna finalized and approved two separate restructuring plans 
the first plan related to cna s information technology operations the it plan 
the second plan related to restructuring the property and casualty segments and life operations  discontinuation of the variable life and annuity business and consolidation of real estate locations the plan 
it plan the overall goal of the it plan was to improve technology for the underwriting function and throughout cna and to eliminate inefficiencies in the deployment of it resources 
the changes facilitated a strong focus on enterprise wide system initiatives 
the it plan had two main components  which included the reorganization of it resources into the technology and operations group with a structure based on centralized  functional roles and the implementation of an integrated technology roadmap that included common architecture and platform standards that directly support cna s strategies

management utilizes various financial measures to monitor cna s insurance operations and investment portfolio 
underwriting results  which are derived from certain income statement amounts  are considered non gaap financial measures and are used by management to monitor performance of cna s insurance operations 
cna s investment portfolio is monitored through analysis of various quantitative and qualitative factors and certain decisions are made related to the sale or impairment of investments that will produce realized gains and losses 
net realized investment gains and losses  which are comprised of after tax realized investment gains and losses net of participating policyholders and minority interests are a non gaap financial measure 
underwriting results are computed as net earned premiums less net incurred claims and the cost incurred to settle these claims  acquisition expenses  underwriting expenses and dividend expenses 
management uses underwriting results and operating ratios to monitor its insurance operations results without the impact of certain factors  including investment income  other revenues  other expenses  minority interest  income tax benefit expense and net realized investment gains or losses 
management excludes these factors in order to analyze the direct relationship between the net earned premiums and the related claims and the cost incurred to settle these claims  acquisition expenses  underwriting expenses and dividend expenses 
management excludes after tax net realized investment gains or losses when analyzing the insurance operations because net realized investment gains or losses related to cna s available for sale investment portfolio are largely discretionary  except for losses related to other than temporary impairments  and are generally driven by economic factors that are not necessarily consistent with key drivers of underwriting performance 
operating ratios are calculated using insurance results and are used by the insurance industry and regulators such as state departments of insurance and the national association of insurance commissioners naic for financial regulation and as a basis of comparison among companies 
the ratios discussed in this md a are calculated using gaap financial results and include the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio loss ratio as well as the expense  dividend and combined ratios 
the loss ratio is the percentage of net incurred claim and claim adjustment expenses to net earned premiums 
the expense ratio is the percentage of underwriting and acquisition expenses  including the amortization of deferred acquisition costs  to net earned premiums 
the dividend ratio is the ratio of dividends incurred to net earned premiums 
the combined ratio is the sum of the loss  expense and dividend ratios 
cna s investment portfolio is monitored by management through analyses of various factors including unrealized gains and losses on securities  portfolio duration and exposure to interest rate  market and credit risk 
based on such analyses  cna may impair an investment security in accordance with its policy  or sell a security 
such activities will produce realized gains and losses 
while management uses various non gaap financial measures to monitor various aspects of cna s performance  relying on any measure other than net income  which is the most directly comparable gaap measure to underwriting results and realized gains and losses  is not a complete representation of financial performance 
management believes that its process of evaluating performance through the use of these non gaap financial measures provides a basis for understanding the operations and the impact to net income as a whole 
management also believes that investors find these non gaap financial measures described above useful to help interpret the underlying trends and performance  as well as to provide visibility into the significant components of net income 
throughout this md a  business segment results are discussed using underwriting results  which as described above is a non gaap measure

the discussion of underwriting results and ratios reflect the underlying business results of cna s property and casualty insurance subsidiaries 
underwriting ratios are industry measures of property and casualty underwriting results 
the loss ratio is the percentage of net incurred claim and claim adjustment expenses to net earned premiums 
the expense ratio is the percentage of underwriting and acquisition expenses  including the amortization of deferred acquisition costs  to net earned premiums 
the dividend ratio is the ratio of dividends incurred to net earned premiums

net results decreased million in as compared with the decline in net results was due primarily to increased unfavorable net prior year development of  million after tax and minority interest  million pretax  a million million pretax increase in catastrophe losses  a million million pretax increase in the bad debt provision for insurance and reinsurance receivables  and a million million pretax increase in insurance related assessments 
net results also include an million million pretax increase in unallocated loss adjustment expense ulae reserves  increased dividend development of million million pretax  and  increased interest expense of million million pretax related to additional cessions to the corporate aggregate and other reinsurance treaties 
these items were partially offset by a million increase in net realized investment results  including increased limited partnership income  and improved current accident year results 
the combined ratio increased points and underwriting results decreased  million in as compared with the loss ratio increased points due principally to increased unfavorable net prior year development  as discussed below  and million of catastrophe losses  primarily related to hurricanes isabel and claudette  texas tornados  and midwest rain storms in catastrophe losses were million in partially offsetting these declines were improvements in the current net accident year loss ratio 
unfavorable net prior year development of  million  including  million of unfavorable claim and allocated claim adjustment expense reserve development and million of unfavorable premium development  was recorded in unfavorable net prior year reserve development of million  including million of favorable claim and allocated claim adjustment expense reserve development and million of unfavorable premium development  was recorded for in the gross carried claim and claim adjustment expense reserve was  and  million at december  and december  the net carried claim and claim adjustment expense reserve was  and  million at december  and approximately million of unfavorable claim and allocated claim adjustment expense reserve development was recorded related to construction defect claims in based on analyses completed during the third quarter of  it became apparent that the assumptions regarding the number of claims  which were used to estimate the expected losses  were no longer appropriate 
the analyses indicated that the number of claims reported was higher than expected primarily in texas  arizona  nevada  washington and colorado 
the number of claims reported in states other than california during the first six months of was almost higher than the last six months of the number of claims reported during the last six months of increased by less than from the first six months of in california  claims resulting from additional insured endorsements increased throughout additional insured endorsements are regularly included on policies provided to subcontractors 
the additional insured endorsement names general contractors and developers as additional insureds covered by the policy 
current california case law presley homes  inc v

th  cal 
rptr 
d specifies that an individual subcontractor with an additional insured obligation has a duty to defend the additional insured in the entire action  subject to contribution or recovery later 
in addition  the additional insured is allowed to choose one specific carrier to defend the entire action 
these additional insured claims can remain open for a longer period of time than other construction defect claims because the additional insured defense obligation can continue until the entire case is resolved 
the unfavorable net prior year development recorded related to construction defect claims was primarily related to accident years and prior 
unfavorable net prior year development of approximately million  including million of unfavorable claim and allocated claim adjustment expense reserve development and million of unfavorable premium development  was recorded for large account business including workers compensation coverages in many of the policies issued to these large accounts include provisions tailored specifically to the individual accounts 
such provisions effectively result in the insured being responsible for a portion of the loss 
an example of such a provision is a deductible arrangement where the insured reimburses cna for all amounts less than a specified dollar amount 
these arrangements often limit the aggregate amount the insured is required to reimburse cna 
analyses indicated that the provisions that result in the insured being responsible for a portion of the losses would have less of an impact due to the larger size of claims as well as the increased number of claims 
the net prior year development recorded was primarily related to accident years and prior 
approximately million of unfavorable net prior year claim and allocated claim adjustment expense reserve development recorded in resulted from a program covering facilities that provide services to developmentally disabled individuals 
this net prior year development was due to an increase in the size of known claims and increases in policyholder defense costs 
recent data shows the average claim increasing at an annual rate of approximately 
prior data had shown average claim size to be level 
similar to the average claim size  recent data shows the average policyholder defense cost increasing at an annual rate of approximately 
prior data had shown average policyholder defense cost to be level 
the net prior year development recorded was primarily for accident years and prior 
approximately million of unfavorable net prior year claim and allocated claim adjustment expense development recorded in was for excess workers compensation coverages due to increasing severity 
the increase in severity means that a higher percentage of the total loss dollars will be cna s responsibility since more claims will exceed the point at which cna s coverage begins 
the reserve net prior year development recorded was primarily for accident year approximately million of unfavorable development recorded in was the result of a commutation of all ceded reinsurance treaties with gerling global group of companies gerling  related to accident years through  including million of unfavorable claim and allocated claim adjustment expense development and million of unfavorable premium development 
further information regarding this commutation is provided in the reinsurance section of the md a 
unfavorable net prior year claim and allocated claim adjustment expense reserve development of approximately million recorded in was related to a program covering tow truck and ambulance operators  primarily impacting the accident year 
cna had previously expected that loss ratios for this business would be similar to its middle market commercial automobile liability business 
during  cna ceased writing business under this program 
approximately million of unfavorable net prior year premium development recorded in was related to a reevaluation of losses ceded to a reinsurance contract covering middle market workers compensation exposures 
the reevaluation of losses led to a new estimate of the number and dollar amount of claims that would be ceded under the reinsurance contract 
as a result of the reevaluation of losses  cna recorded approximately million of unfavorable claim and allocated claim adjustment expense reserve development  which was ceded under the contract 
the net prior year development was recorded for accident year the following premium and claim and allocated claim adjustment expense development was recorded in as a result of the elimination of deficiencies and redundancies in reserve positions within the segment unfavorable net prior year development of approximately million related to small and middle market workers compensation exposures and approximately million related to e s lines was recorded in offsetting these increases was million of favorable net prior year development in the property line of business  including million related to the wtc event 
also  offsetting the unfavorable premium and claim and allocated claim adjustment expense development was a million underwriting benefit from cessions to corporate aggregate reinsurance treaties recorded in the benefit is comprised of million of ceded losses and million of ceded premiums for accident years and approximately million of unfavorable net prior year claim and allocated claim adjustment expense reserve development recorded in was related to increased severity in excess coverages provided to facilities providing health care services 
the increase in reserves is based on reviews of individual accounts where claims had been expected to be less than the point at which cna s coverage applies 
the current claim trends indicate that the layers of coverage provided by cna will be impacted 
the reserve net prior year development recorded was primarily for accident years and prior 
approximately million of unfavorable net prior year claim and allocated claim adjustment expense reserve development recorded in was for surety coverages primarily related to workers compensation bond exposure from accident years and prior and large losses for accident years and approximately million of unfavorable net prior year claim and allocated claim adjustment expense reserve development was recorded in the surety line of business in as the result of recent developments on one large claim 
approximately million of unfavorable net prior year claim and allocated claim adjustment expense reserve development recorded in was related to directors and officers exposures in cna pro and global lines 
the unfavorable net prior year development was primarily due to securities class action cases related to certain known corporate malfeasance cases and investment banking firms 
this net prior year development recorded was primarily for accident years through unfavorable net prior year claim and allocated claim adjustment expense reserve development of approximately million recorded in was related to an adverse arbitration decision in involving a single large property and business interruption loss 
the decision was rendered against a voluntary insurance pool in which cna was a participant 
the loss was caused by a fire which occurred in cna no longer participates in this pool 
approximately million of losses were recorded during as the result of a commutation of ceded reinsurance treaties with gerling  relating to accident years through further information regarding this commutation is provided in the reinsurance section of this md a 
the following net prior year development was recorded in as a result of the elimination of deficiencies and redundancies in reserve positions within the segment 
an additional million of unfavorable net prior year claim and allocated claim adjustment expense reserve development was recorded related to medical malpractice and long term care facilities 
partially offsetting this unfavorable claim and allocated claim adjustment expense reserve development was a million underwriting benefit from cessions to corporate aggregate reinsurance treaties 
the benefit was comprised of million of ceded losses and million of ceded premiums for accident years and the unfavorable net prior year development for was primarily a result of a general change in the pattern of how losses change over time as reported by the companies that purchased reinsurance from cna re 
losses have continued to show large increases for accident years in the late s and into and these increases are greater than the increases indicated by patterns from older accident years and have a similar effect on several lines of business 
approximately million unfavorable net prior year development recorded in was related to proportional liability exposures  primarily from multi line and umbrella treaties in accident years through approximately million of unfavorable net prior year development recorded in  was related to assumed financial reinsurance for accident years and prior and approximately million of unfavorable net prior year development related to professional liability exposures in accident years and prior 
cna re recorded an additional million of unfavorable net prior year development for construction defect related exposures 
because of the unique nature of this exposure  losses have not followed expected development patterns 
the continued reporting of claims in california  the increase in the number of claims from states other than california and a review of individual ceding companies exposure to this type of claim resulted in an increase in the estimated reserve 
unfavorable net prior year claim and allocated claim adjustment expense reserve development of approximately million was recorded primarily for directors and officers exposures 
the unfavorable net prior year development was a result of a claims review that was completed during the second quarter of the unfavorable net prior year reserve development was primarily due to securities class action cases related to certain known corporate malfeasance cases and investment banking firms 
the unfavorable net prior year development recorded was for accident years and the following premium and claim and allocated claim adjustment expense development  was recorded in as a result of the elimination of deficiencies and redundancies in the reserve positions of individual products within the segment unfavorable net prior year premium and claim and allocated claim adjustment expense development of approximately million related to surety exposures  million related to excess of loss liability exposures and million related to facultative liability exposures were recorded in the third quarter of offsetting this unfavorable net prior year development was approximately million of favorable development related to the wtc event as well as a million underwriting benefit from cessions to corporate aggregate reinsurance treaties recorded in the benefit from cessions to the corporate aggregate reinsurance treaties was comprised of million of ceded losses and million of ceded premiums for accident years and see the reinsurance section of the md a for further discussion of cna s aggregate reinsurance treaties 
the following discusses net prior year development recorded in approximately million of favorable prior year reserve development was attributable to participation in the workers compensation reinsurance bureau wcrb  a reinsurance pool  and residual markets 
the favorable prior year reserve development for wcrb was the result of information received from the wcrb that reported the results of a recent actuarial review 
this information indicated that cna s net required reserves for accident years through were million less than the carried reserves 
in addition  during  cna commuted accident years through for a payment of approximately million to cover carried reserves of approximately million  resulting in further favorable net prior year claim and allocated claim adjustment expense development of million 
the favorable residual market net prior year development was the result of lower than expected paid loss activity during recent periods for accident years dating back to the paid losses during on prior accident years were approximately of the previously expected amount 
in addition  standard lines had favorable net prior year development  primarily in the package liability and auto liability lines of business due to new claims initiatives 
these new claims initiatives  which included specialized training on specific areas of the claims adjudication process  enhanced claims litigation management  enhanced adjuster level metrics to monitor performance and more focused metric based claim file review and oversight  are expected to produce significant reductions in ultimate claim costs 
based on management s best estimate of the reduction in ultimate claim costs  approximately million of favorable net prior year development was recorded in approximately one half of this favorable development was recorded in accident years prior to  with the remainder of the favorable reserve development recorded in accident years to approximately million of favorable net prior year development during was recorded in commercial automobile liability 
most of the favorable development was from accident year an actuarial review completed during showed that underwriting actions have resulted in reducing the number of commercial automobile liability claims for recent accident years  especially the number of large losses 
approximately million of favorable net prior year development was recorded in property lines during the favorable net prior year development was principally from accident years through  and was the result of the low number of large losses in recent years 
although property claims are generally reported relatively quickly  determining the ultimate cost of the claim can involve a significant amount of time between the occurrence of the claim and settlement 
offsetting these favorable net prior year reserve developments were approximately million of unfavorable premium development in middle market workers compensation  approximately million of unfavorable net prior year claim and allocated claim adjustment expense development in programs written in cna e s  approximately million of unfavorable reserve development on a contractors account package policy program and approximately million of unfavorable net prior year claim and allocated claim adjustment expense development on middle market general liability coverages 
a cna e s program  covering facilities that provide services to developmentally disabled individuals  accounts for approximately million of the unfavorable net prior year development 
the net prior year development is due to an increase in the size of known claims and increases in policyholder defense costs 
these increases became apparent as the result of an actuarial review completed during  with most of the development from accident years and the other program  which contributed to the cna e s development  covers tow truck and ambulance operators in the and accident years 
this program was started in cna expected that loss ratios for this business would be similar to its middle market commercial automobile liability business 
reviews completed during resulted in estimated loss ratios on the tow truck and ambulance business that are points higher than the middle market commercial automobile liability loss ratios 
the unfavorable net prior year premium development on contractors account package policies was the result of a review completed during since this program is no longer being written  cna expected that the change in reported losses would decrease each quarterly period 
however  in recent quarterly periods  the change in reported losses has been higher than prior quarters  resulting in the unfavorable reserve development 
unfavorable net prior year reserve development of approximately million was recorded for cna healthpro in and was driven principally by medical malpractice excess products provided to hospitals and physicians and coverages provided to long term care facilities  principally national for profit nursing homes 
approximately million of the prior year unfavorable reserve development was related to assumed excess products and loss portfolio transfers  and was primarily driven by unexpected increases in the number of excess claims in accident years and the percentage of total claims greater than million has increased by  from less than of all claims to more than of all claims 
cna healthpro no longer writes assumed excess products and loss portfolio transfers 
approximately million of the unfavorable net prior year development was related to long term care facilities 
the unfavorable net prior year development was principally recorded for accident years through the average value of claims closed during the first several months of increased by more than when compared to claims closed during in response to those trends  cna healthpro has reduced its writings of national for profit nursing home chains 
excess products provided to healthcare institutions and physician coverages in a limited number of states were responsible for the remaining development in cna healthpro 
the unfavorable net prior year development on excess products provided to institutions for accident years through resulted from increases in the size of claims experienced by these institutions 
due to the increase in the size of claims  more claims were exceeding the point at which these excess products apply 
the unfavorable net prior year development on physician coverages was recorded for accident years through in oregon  california  arizona and nevada 
the average claim size in these states has increased by  driving the change in losses 
the marine business recorded unfavorable net prior year development of approximately million during approximately million of this unfavorable net prior year development was due to participation in voluntary pools 
about half of the reserve development was recorded in accident years and with the remainder attributable to accident years prior to the reserves were based on recommendations provided by the pools 
participation in many of these pools has been discontinued 
the remaining net prior year development for the marine business was due principally to unfavorable reserve development on hull and liability coverages from accident years and offset by favorable reserve development on cargo coverages recorded for accident year reviews completed during showed additional reported losses on individual large accounts and other bluewater business that drove the unfavorable hull and liability development 
offsetting this unfavorable net prior year development was favorable net prior year development in cna pro and for enron related exposures 
programs providing professional liability coverage to accountants  lawyers and realtors primarily drove favorable net prior year reserve development of approximately million in cna pro 
reviews of this business completed during showed little activity for older accident years principally prior to  which reduced the need for reserves on these years 
the reported losses on these programs for accident years prior to increased by approximately million during this increase compared to the total reserve at the beginning of of approximately million  net of reinsurance 
additionally  favorable net prior year development of million was associated with the enron settlement 
cna had established a million reserve for accident year for an excess layer associated with enron related surety losses  however the case was settled for less than the attachment point of this excess layer 
favorable net prior year development of million after tax and minority interest million pretax was recorded in in relation to the enron exposures previously recorded as a charge of million million pretax related to the bankruptcy filing of certain enron entities in these charges consisted of million million pretax of losses in connection with surety exposures  including advance payment obligations bonds and million million pretax of other operating expenses in connection with collateralized debt obligations  a credit enhancement product 
the unfavorable net prior year development recorded in was the result of an actuarial review completed during and was primarily recorded in the directors and officers  professional liability errors and omissions  and surety lines of business 
several large losses  as well as continued increases in the overall average size of claims for these lines  have resulted in higher than expected loss ratios 
during  cna re revised its estimate of premiums and losses related to the wtc event 
in estimating cna re s wtc event losses  cna performed a treaty by treaty analysis of exposure 
cna s original loss estimate was based on a number of assumptions including the loss to the industry  the loss to individual lines of business and the market share of cna re s cedants 
information that became available in the first quarter of resulted in cna re increasing its estimate of wtc event related premiums and losses on its property facultative and property catastrophe business 
the impact of increasing the estimate of gross wtc event losses by million was fully offset on a net of reinsurance basis before the impact of the ccc cover by higher reinstatement premiums and a reduction of return premiums 
approximately million of cna re s net wtc loss estimate was attributable to cna re uk  which was sold in see the reinsurance section of the md a for further discussion of cna s aggregate reinsurance treaties 
the expense ratio increased points due to increased expenses and decreased net earned premiums in as compared with acquisition expenses were unfavorably impacted by an increase in the bad debt expense reserve for reinsurance receivables of million 
based on cna s credit exposures to reinsurance receivables  an increase in the bad debt reserve was deemed appropriate 
cna also recorded a million increase in the bad debt reserve for insurance receivables 
the increase in the bad debt provision for insurance receivables was primarily the result of a review of professional employer organization peo accounts as well as certain accounts that have been turned over to third parties for collection 
during  standard lines ceased writing coverages for peo businesses  with the last contracts expiring on june  the review analyzed losses and the related receivable including the associated collateral held by cna 
upon completion of the review  it was determined that the ultimate loss estimates were larger than previously expected  which increased the amount of uncollateralized receivables 
based on these factors  an increase in the provision was recorded 
additionally  acquisition expenses increased as a result of an increase in the accrual for certain insurance related assessments of million which were recorded in in addition  a million reduction in the accrual for certain insurance related assessments resulting from changes in the basis on which the assessments were calculated was recorded in also increasing the expense ratio was approximately million of expenses related to ebusiness in the ebusiness expenses were included in the other segment 
the dividend ratio increased points in as compared with due to increased net prior year unfavorable dividend development 
an increase in unfavorable dividend development of million was primarily related to workers compensation products 
a review was completed in the third quarter indicating paid dividend development that was higher than prior expectations 
this development was recorded for accident years and prior 
compared with net written premiums for the property and casualty segment increased  million and net earned premiums increased  million for compared with these increases were primarily due to decreased ceded premiums related to corporate aggregate and other reinsurance treaties  strong rate increases  and increased new business across the property and casualty segments 
the additional ceded premiums in related to corporate aggregate and other reinsurance treaties was recorded for the unfavorable net prior year development in and wtc event 
net results increased million in as compared with the increase in net results was due primarily to decreased unfavorable net prior year development of  million after tax and minority interest  million pretax and a reduction of the accrual for restructuring and other related charges 
in addition  net results in were adversely impacted by million after tax and minority interest losses related to the wtc event and million after tax and minority interest for restructuring and other related charges 
partially offsetting these improvements in net results was decreased net investment results 
the combined ratio decreased points and underwriting results increased  million in as compared with the loss ratio decreased points due principally to decreased unfavorable net prior year development and improved current accident year ratios  as discussed below 
the discussion of the net prior year development recorded in was included in the compared with section above 
approximately million of the unfavorable net prior year claim and allocated claim adjustment expense development recorded in was a result of several coverages provided to commercial entities 
reserve analyses performed during showed unexpected increases in the size of claims for several lines  including commercial automobile liability  general liability and the liability portion of commercial multiple peril coverages 
in addition  the number of commercial automobile liability claims was higher than expected and several state specific factors resulted in higher than anticipated losses  including developments associated with commercial automobile liability coverage in ohio and general liability coverage provided to contractors in new york 
the unfavorable net prior year development was driven principally by accident years through the remaining unfavorable net prior year development affecting years prior to was driven principally by construction defect claims as described below 
the commercial automobile liability analysis indicated increased ultimate claim and claim adjustment expense across several accident years due to higher paid and reported claim and claim adjustment expense resulting from several factors 
these factors include uninsured underinsured motorists coverage in ohio  a change in the rate at which the average claim size was increasing and a lack of improvement in the ratio of the number of claims per exposure unit  the frequency 
first  ohio courts had significantly broadened the population covered through the uninsured underinsured motorists coverage 
the broadening of the population covered by this portion of the policy  and the retrospective nature of this broadening of coverage  resulted in additional claims for older years 
second  in recent years  the average claim size had been increasing at less than a annual rate 
the available data indicated that the rate of increase was closer to with only a portion of this increase explainable by a change in mix of business 
finally  the review completed during indicated that the frequency for the accident year was higher than expectations were that the frequency would show an improvement from the level 
the analyses of general liability and the liability portion of commercial multiple peril coverages showed several factors affecting these lines 
construction defect claims in california and a limited number of other states have had a significant impact 
it was expected that the number of claims being reported and the average size of those claims would fall quickly due to the decrease in business exposed to those losses 
however  the number of claims reported during the first six months of increased from the number of claims reported during the last six months of in addition to the effects of construction defect claims  the average claim associated with new york labor law has risen to more than  from less than  which was significantly greater than previously expected 
concurrent with cna s review of loss reserves  cna completed comprehensive studies of estimated premium receivable accruals on retrospectively rated insurance policies and involuntary market facilities 
these studies included ground up reviews of retrospective premium accruals utilizing a more comprehensive database of retrospectively rated contracts 
this review included application of the policy retrospective rating parameters to the revised estimate of ultimate loss ratio and consideration of actual interim cash settlement 
this study resulted in a change in the estimated retrospective premiums receivable balances 
as a result of this review and changes in premiums associated with the change in estimates for loss reserves  cna recorded a pretax reduction in premium accruals of million 
the studies included the review of all such retrospectively rated insurance policies and the estimate of ultimate losses 
approximately million of this amount resulted from a change in estimate in premiums related to involuntary market facilities  which had an offsetting impact on net losses and therefore had no impact on the net operating results 
more than one half of the change in estimate in premiums was attributable to accident years through with the remainder attributable to accident years prior to accruals for ceded premiums related to reinsurance treaties other than the corporate aggregate reinsurance treaties increased million due to the reserve strengthening 
this increase in accruals for ceded premiums was principally recorded in accident year the remainder of the increase in premium accruals relates to the change in estimate of the amount of retrospective premium receivables as discussed above  which were principally recorded in accident years prior to approximately million of unfavorable net prior year development was due to adverse experience in all other lines  primarily in coverages provided to healthcare related entities written by cna healthpro 
the level of paid and reported losses associated with coverages provided to national long term care facilities were higher than expected 
the long term care facility business had traditionally been limited to local facilities 
in recent years  cna began to provide coverage to large chains of long term care facilities 
original assumptions were that these chains would exhibit loss ratios similar to the local facilities 
the most recent review of these large chains indicated an overall loss ratio in excess of 
versus approximately for the remaining business 
in addition  the average size of claims resulting from coverages provided to physicians and institutions providing healthcare related services increased more than expected 
the review indicated that the average loss had increased to over  prior to this review  the expectation for the average loss was approximately  unfavorable net prior year development of million was recorded for accident years through the remaining unfavorable net prior year development was attributable to accident years prior to an analysis of assumed reinsurance business written by cna re showed that the paid and reported losses for recent accident years were higher than expectations  which resulted in management recording net unfavorable development on prior year loss reserves of approximately million 
because of the long and variable reporting pattern associated with assumed reinsurance as well as uncertainty regarding possible changes in the reporting methods of the ceding companies  the carried reserves for assumed reinsurance were based mainly on the pricing assumptions until experience emerged to show that the pricing assumptions are no longer valid 
the reviews completed during  including analysis at the individual treaty level  showed that the pricing assumptions were no longer appropriate 
the classes of business with the most significant changes included excess of loss liability  professional liability and proportional and retrocessional property 
approximately million of the total unfavorable development was from accident years through  and approximately million was from accident years and the remaining million of unfavorable net prior year development was attributable to accident years prior to the expense ratio decreased points primarily as a result of reduced underwriting expenses resulting from decreased head count as a result of the plan and other expense reduction initiatives and an increase in the net earned premium base 
the dividend ratio decreased points due primarily to favorable current accident year dividends in standard lines 
group group benefits offered group long term care and specialty medical products and related services 
prior to the sale to hartford  products had been marketed through a nationwide operation of sales offices  third party administrators  managing general agents and insurance consultants 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under item for further details of this transaction 
federal markets provided health insurance benefits to federal employees  retirees and their families  insuring nearly one million members under the national postal mail handlers union group benefits plan the mail handlers plan 
on july   cna sold its federal health plan administrator  claims administration corporation  and transferred the mail handlers plan to first health group 
as a result of this transaction  cna recognized a million pretax realized loss on the sale of claims administration corporation and million of pretax non recurring fee income related to the transfer of the mail handlers plan 
during february of  cna announced the decision to cease new sales in its institutional markets business 
cna will continue to accept new deposits and premiums only from existing customers for the institutional markets and will service its existing commitments on all businesses in which new sales were ceased 
this business will be managed as a run off operation 
ccc will provide credit enhancement to cac for certain of cac s investment and specialty medical products 
during  cna also ceased new sales in its group long term care business 
cna will continue to service its existing commitments  but new written premiums will be minimal 
also within group operations is cna trust  a limited operations bank located in costa mesa  california  which provides full trustee and pension third party administrative services to the under life employer markets 
products include qualified and non qualified plans and iras 
the variable products business was exited in the fourth quarter of in july of  cna entered into an agreement  whereby the phoenix companies  inc acquired the variable life and annuity business of vfl through a coinsurance arrangement  with modified coinsurance on the separate accounts 
compared with net earned premiums for group operations decreased  million in as compared with the decrease in net earned premiums was due primarily to the transfer of the mail handlers plan 
the mail handlers plan contributed net earned premiums of  million in these premiums were partially offset by premium growth in the disability  specialty medical  life and accident and long term care products within group benefits due to increased new sales and rate increases 
net results decreased by million in as compared with the decrease in net results related primarily to increased net realized investment losses including a loss of million after tax and minority interest million pretax on the sale of the group benefits business  the absence of net income related to the mail handlers plan  including the non recurring fee income received from first health group in the third quarter of and a change in the discount rate on prior year disability and life waiver of premium reserves from to  resulting in a million million pretax decrease in net income

life in  life operations provided financial protection to individuals through term life insurance  universal life insurance  individual long term care insurance  annuities and other products 
life operations has several distribution relationships and partnerships including managing general agencies  other independent agencies working with cna life sales offices  a network of brokers and dealers  and other independent insurance consultants 
in february of  cna entered into a definitive agreement to sell its individual life insurance business to swiss re for approximately million 
the business sold includes term  universal and permanent life insurance policies and individual annuity products 
the transaction is expected to be completed on or before march   subject to certain customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under item for further information 
also  in february of  cna ceased new sales in its structured settlement business  but will continue to service existing commitments 
this business will be managed as a run off operation 
during the second quarter of  cna completed a review of its individual long term care product offerings 
the focus of the review was to determine whether the current products provide adequate pricing flexibility under the range of reasonably possible claims experience levels 
based on the review and current market conditions  cna decided to significantly reduce new sales of this product and certain infrastructure costs 
individual life primarily offers level premium term life insurance  universal life insurance and related products 
single premium immediate annuities as well as structured settlement annuities are also offered 
individual long term care products provide reimbursement for covered nursing home and home health care expenses incurred due to physical or mental disability 
other operations include operations in certain international markets and life settlements contract business 
cna decided to cease purchasing new life settlement policies indefinitely beginning in and ceased sale of new policies in its international operations in compared with net earned premiums for life operations increased million in as compared with the increase in net earned premiums was due primarily to higher sales of structured settlement annuities  growth in life insurance products and rate increases on the individual long term care product inforce blocks  partially offset by declines in new business primarily due to exiting the individual long term care market

the following discussion of unfavorable net prior year development includes net unfavorable claim and allocated claim adjustment expense reserve development and unfavorable premium development recorded in for other insurance 
unfavorable net prior year development of million  including million of unfavorable claim and allocated claim adjustment expense reserve development and million of favorable premium development was primarily driven by unfavorable net prior year development of million related to apmt  discussed below 
unfavorable net prior year claim and allocated claim adjustment expense reserve development of million was recorded related to cna s past participation in several insurance pools which is part of the group reinsurance run off business 
unfavorable net prior year development of million  including million of unfavorable claim and allocated claim adjustment expense reserve development  and million of favorable premium development was recorded in the gross carried claim and claim adjustment expense reserve was  and  million at december  and the net carried claim and claim adjustment expense reserve was  and  million for december  and the following discussion of unfavorable net prior year development includes net unfavorable claim and allocated claim adjustment expense reserve development and unfavorable premium development recorded in for other insurance 
personal insurance recorded unfavorable net prior year development of million in on accident years through the unfavorable net prior year development was principally due to continuing policyholder defense costs associated with remaining open personal insurance claims 
the unfavorable net prior year development was partially offset by favorable reserve development on other run off business driven principally by financial and mortgage guarantee coverages from accident years and prior 
the favorable net prior year development on financial and mortgage guarantee coverages resulted from a review of the underlying exposures and the outstanding losses  which showed that salvage and subrogation continues to be collected on these types of claims  thereby reducing estimated future losses net of anticipated reinsurance recoveries 
in accordance with the retroactive reinsurance agreement with allstate  cna shares in indemnity and must begin to reimburse allstate for claim and allocated claim adjustment expenses if payments related to losses incurred prior to october  on the cna policies transferred to allstate exceed the claim and allocated claim adjustment expense reserves of approximately billion at the date of sale 
cna s remaining obligation valued under this loss sharing provision as of october  will be settled  under a time schedule established by the parties  by agreement of the parties or by an independent actuarial review of the unpaid claim liabilities as of that date 
cumulative payments of indemnity and allocated loss adjustment expenses on such policies exceeded billion during the second quarter of the company has established reserves for its estimated liability under this loss sharing arrangement 
compared with total revenues decreased million in as compared with this decrease was due primarily to reduced revenues for cna unisource  due to the exit of this business  reduced investment income and pretax realized investment gains partially offset by increased net earned premiums in group reinsurance 
net results increased by million in as compared with net results improved in as compared with primarily due to decreased unfavorable net prior year development of million after tax and minority interest  million pretax  reduced expenses for ebusiness initiatives  improved results for group reinsurance and a million million pretax reduction in the accrual for restructuring and other related charges recorded in in addition  net results in were adversely impacted by million million pretax of restructuring and other related charges and million million pretax of estimated losses related to the wtc event for group reinsurance 
these increases were offset by lower net investment results  principally resulting from a million million pretax decline in limited partnership income  higher losses related to the run off of cna unisource and severance and other costs related to changes in senior management in unfavorable net prior year development of million  including million of net unfavorable claim and allocated claim adjustment expense reserve development and million of favorable premium development  was recorded in for other insurance 
unfavorable net prior year development of  million  including  million of net unfavorable claim and allocated claim adjustment expense reserve development and million of unfavorable premium development  was recorded in for other insurance 
the gross carried claim and claim adjustment expense reserve was  and  million at december  and the net carried claim and claim adjustment expense reserve was  and  million at december  and the unfavorable net prior year development recorded in was primarily attributable to  million of unfavorable development related to apmt 
apmt reserves cna s property and casualty insurance subsidiaries have actual and potential exposures related to apmt claims 
establishing reserves for apmt claim and claim adjustment expenses is subject to uncertainties that are greater than those presented by other claims 
traditional actuarial methods and techniques employed to estimate the ultimate cost of claims for more traditional property and casualty exposures are less precise in estimating claim and claim adjustment expense reserves for apmt  particularly in an environment of emerging or potential claims and coverage issues that arise from industry practices and legal  judicial  and social conditions 
therefore  these traditional actuarial methods and techniques are necessarily supplemented with additional estimating techniques and methodologies  many of which involve significant judgments that are required of management 
accordingly  a high degree of uncertainty remains for cna s ultimate liability for apmt claim and claim adjustment expenses 
in addition to the difficulties described above  estimating the ultimate cost of both reported and unreported apmt claims is subject to a higher degree of variability due to a number of additional factors  including among others the number and outcome of direct actions against cna  coverage issues  including whether certain costs are covered under the policies and whether policy limits apply  allocation of liability among numerous parties  some of whom may be in bankruptcy proceedings  and in particular the application of joint and several liability to specific insurers on a risk  inconsistent court decisions and developing legal theories  increasingly aggressive tactics of plaintiffs lawyers  the risks and lack of predictability inherent in major litigation  increased filings of claims in certain states to avoid the application of tort reform statute effective dates  the possible enactment of national federal legislation to address asbestos claims  a further increase in asbestos and environmental pollution claims which cannot now be anticipated  increase in number of mass tort claims relating to silica and silica containing products  and the outcome of ongoing disputes as to coverage in relation to these claims  a further increase of claims and claims payment that may exhaust underlying umbrella and excess coverage at accelerated rates  and future developments pertaining to cna s ability to recover reinsurance for asbestos and environmental pollution claims 
cna regularly performs ground up reviews of all open apmt claims to evaluate the adequacy of cna s apmt reserves 
in performing its comprehensive ground up analysis  cna considers input from its professionals with direct responsibility for the claims  inside and outside counsel with responsibility for representation of cna  and its actuarial staff 
these professionals review  among many factors  the policyholder s present and predicted future exposures  including such factors as claims volume  trial conditions  prior settlement history  settlement demands and defense costs  the impact of asbestos defendant bankruptcies on the policyholder  the policies issued by cna  including such factors as aggregate or per occurrence limits  whether the policy is primary  umbrella or excess  and the existence of policyholder retentions and or deductibles  the existence of other insurance  and reinsurance arrangements 
with respect to other court cases and how they might affect cna s reserves and reasonable possible losses  the following should be noted 
state and federal courts issue numerous decisions each year  which potentially impact losses and reserves in both a favorable and unfavorable manner 
examples of favorable developments include decisions to allocate defense and indemnity payments in a manner so as to limit carriers obligations to damages taking place during the effective dates of their policies  decisions holding that injuries occurring after asbestos operations are completed are subject to the completed operations aggregate limits of the policies  and decisions ruling that carriers loss control inspections of their insured premises do not give rise to a duty to warn third parties to the dangers of asbestos 
examples of unfavorable developments include decisions limiting the application of the absolute pollution exclusion  and decisions holding carriers liable for defense and indemnity of asbestos and pollution claims on a joint and several basis 
cna s ultimate liability for its environmental pollution and mass tort claims is impacted by several factors including ongoing disputes with policyholders over scope and meaning of coverage terms and  in the area of environmental pollution  court decisions that continue to restrict the scope and applicability of the absolute pollution exclusion contained in policies issued by cna after due to the inherent uncertainties described above  including the inconsistency of court decisions  the number of waste sites subject to cleanup  and in the area of environmental pollution  the standards for cleanup and liability  the ultimate liability of cna for environmental pollution and mass tort claims may vary substantially from the amount currently recorded 
due to the inherent uncertainties in estimating reserves for apmt claim and claim adjustment expenses and due to the significant uncertainties previously described related to apmt claims  the ultimate liability for these cases  both individually and in aggregate  may exceed the recorded reserves 
any such potential additional liability  or any range of potential additional amounts  cannot be reasonably estimated currently  but could be material to cna s business  insurer financial strength  and debt ratings and the company s results of operations and equity 
due to  among other things  the factors described above  it may be necessary for cna to record material changes in its apmt claim and claim adjustment expense reserves in the future  should new information become available or other developments emerge 
the following table provides data related to cna s asbestos  environmental pollution and mass tort claim and claim adjustment expense reserves 
december environmental environmental pollution and pollution and asbestos mass tort asbestos mass tort in millions gross reserves   ceded reserves  net reserves   asbestos cna s property and casualty insurance subsidiaries have exposure to asbestos related claims 
estimation of asbestos related claim and claim adjustment expense reserves involves many of the same limitations for environmental pollution claims  such as inconsistency of court decisions  specific policy provisions  allocation of liability among insurers and insureds  and additional factors such as missing policies and proof of coverage 
furthermore  estimation of asbestos related claims is difficult due to  among other reasons  the proliferation of bankruptcy proceedings and attendant uncertainties  the targeting of a broader range of businesses and entities as defendants  the uncertainty as to which other insureds may be targeted in the future and the uncertainties inherent in predicting the number of future claims 
in the past several years  cna has experienced significant increases in claim counts for asbestos related claims 
the factors that led to these increases included  among other things  intensive advertising campaigns by lawyers for asbestos claimants  mass medical screening programs sponsored by plaintiff lawyers  and the addition of new defendants such as the distributors and installers of products containing asbestos 
the majority of asbestos bodily injury claims are filed by persons exhibiting few  if any  disease symptoms 
it is estimated that approximately of the current non malignant asbestos claimants do not meet the american medical association s definition of impairment 
some courts  including the federal district court responsible for pre trial proceedings in all federal asbestos bodily injury actions  have ordered that so called unimpaired claimants may not recover unless at some point the claimant s condition worsens to the point of impairment 
several factors are  in management s view  negatively impacting asbestos claim trends 
plaintiff attorneys who previously sued entities who are now bankrupt are seeking other viable targets 
as a result  companies with few or no previous asbestos claims are becoming targets in asbestos litigation and  although they may have little or no liability  nevertheless must be defended 
additionally  plaintiff attorneys and trustees for future claimants are demanding that policy limits be paid lump sum into the bankruptcy asbestos trusts prior to presentation of valid claims and medical proof of these claims 
the ultimate impact or success of this tactic remains uncertain 
plaintiff attorneys and trustees for future claimants are also attempting to devise claims payment procedures for bankruptcy trusts that would allow asbestos claims to be paid under lax standards for injury  exposure  and causation 
this also presents the potential for exhausting policy limits in an accelerated fashion 
as a result of bankruptcies and insolvencies  management has observed an increase in the total number of policyholders with current asbestos claims as additional defendants are added to existing lawsuits and are named in new asbestos bodily injury lawsuits 
new asbestos bodily injury claims have also increased substantially in as of december  and  cna carried approximately  and  million of claim and claim adjustment expense reserves  net of reinsurance recoverables for reported and unreported asbestos related claims 
unfavorable asbestos related net claim and claim adjustment expense reserve development for  and amounted to  and million 
cna paid asbestos related claims  net of reinsurance  of  and million during the years ended december   and cna had recorded  and million in unfavorable gross and net asbestos prior year reserve development for  principally due to potential losses from policies issued by cna with high attachment points  which previous exposure analysis indicated would not be reached 
as part of its review completed in the third quarter of  cna examined the claims filing trends and the projected erosion rates of underlying primary and lower excess insurance on open asbestos accounts to determine timeframes within which high excess policies issued by cna could be reached 
elevated claims volumes  together with certain adverse court decisions affecting rapidity by which asbestos claims are paid supported the conclusion that excess policies with high attachment points previously thought not to be exposed may now potentially be exposed 
in  cna noted the continued emergence of adverse loss experience across several lines of business related to prior years 
with respect to asbestos reserves  throughout  and into  cna experienced significant increases in new asbestos bodily injury claims 
in light of this development  cna formed the view that payments for asbestos claims could be higher in future years than previously estimated 
moreover  in late through mid  industry sources such as rating agencies and actuarial firms released analyses and studies commenting on the increase in claim volumes and other asbestos liability developments 
also in the to time period  a number of significant asbestos defendants filed for bankruptcy  increasing the likelihood that excess layers of insurance coverage could be called upon to indemnify policyholders and creating the potential that novel legal doctrines could be employed 
these developments led cna to the conclusion that its asbestos reserves required strengthening of million in cna has resolved a number of its large asbestos accounts by negotiating structured settlement agreements 
structured settlement agreements provide for payments over multiple years as set forth in each individual agreement 
at december   cna had four structured settlement agreements with a reserve  net of reinsurance of million 
since december   cna has resolved five additional asbestos accounts through structured settlement agreements 
at december   cna had structured settlement agreements with nine of its policyholders for which it has future payment obligations with a reserve  net of reinsurance  of million related to remaining payment obligations under these agreements 
as to the nine structured settlement agreements existing at december   payment obligations under those settlement agreements are projected to terminate in in  asbestos producers and their insurers  including cic  executed the wellington agreement 
the agreement intended to resolve all issues and litigation related to coverage for asbestos exposures 
under this agreement  signatory insurers committed scheduled policy limits and made the limits available to pay asbestos claims based upon coverage blocks designated by the policyholders in  subject to extension by policyholders 
cic was a signatory insurer to the wellington agreement 
at december   cna had fulfilled its wellington agreement obligations as to all but five accounts and had recorded a reserve of million  net of reinsurance  related to its remaining wellington obligations 
at december   with respect to these five remaining unpaid wellington obligations  cna has evaluated its exposure and the expected reinsurance recoveries under these agreements and had a recorded reserve of million  net of reinsurance 
cna has also used coverage in place agreements to resolve large asbestos exposures 
coverage in place agreements are typically agreements between cna and its policyholders identifying the policies and the terms for payment of asbestos related liabilities 
claims payments are contingent on presentation of adequate documentation showing exposure during the policy periods and other documentation supporting the demand for claims payment 
coverage in place agreements may have annual payment caps 
at december   cna had estimated its exposure for its twenty three coverage in place agreements at million  net of reinsurance 
as of december   cna had negotiated thirty two such agreements 
coverage in place agreements are evaluated based on claims filings trends and severities 
due to adverse claims trends described in this section  management has increased its estimate of exposure under current coverage in place agreements 
cna has evaluated these commitments and the expected reinsurance recoveries under these agreements and had recorded a reserve of million  net of reinsurance  related to coverage in place agreements as of december  cna categorizes active asbestos accounts as large or small accounts 
cna defines a large account as an active account with more than  of cumulative paid losses 
cna made closing large accounts a significant management priority 
at december   cna had large accounts and has a related reserve of million  net of reinsurance 
at december   cna has large accounts with a collective reserve of million  net of reinsurance 
large accounts are typically accounts that have been long identified as significant asbestos exposures 
in its most recent ground up reserve study  cna observed that underlying layers of primary  umbrella and lower layer excess policies were exhausting at accelerated rates due to increased claims volumes  claims severities and increased defense expense incurred in litigating claims 
those accounts where cna had issued high excess policies were evaluated in the study to determine potential impairment of the high excess layers of coverage 
management concluded that high excess coverage previously thought not to be exposed could potentially be exposed should current adverse claim trends continue 
small accounts are defined as active accounts with  or less cumulative paid losses 
at december   cna had small accounts with recorded reserves of million  net of reinsurance 
at december   cna had  small accounts  approximately of its total active asbestos accounts and has increased its collective reserve to million  net of reinsurance  as of december  small accounts are typically representative of policyholders with limited connection to asbestos 
as entities which were historic targets in asbestos litigation continue to file for bankruptcy protection  plaintiffs attorneys are seeking other viable targets 
as a result  companies with few or no previous asbestos claims are becoming targets in asbestos litigation and  nevertheless must be defended by cna under its policies 
as claims filings continue to increase  costs incurred in defending small accounts are expected to increase 
cna also evaluates its asbestos liabilities arising from its assumed reinsurance business and its participation in various pools 
at december   cna had recorded a million reserve related to these asbestos liabilities arising from cna s assumed reinsurance obligations and cna s participation in pools  including excess and casualty reinsurance association ecra 
at december   cna has increased the reserves to million  net of reinsurance  related to these liabilities 
at december   cna s unassigned incurred but not reported ibnr reserve for asbestos was million  net of reinsurance 
this ibnr reserve relates to potential development on accounts that have not settled and potential future claims from unidentified policyholders 
at december   the unassigned ibnr reserve was million  net of reinsurance 
the chart below depicts cna s overall pending asbestos accounts and associated reserves at december  and percent of number of net paid losses net asbestos asbestos december  policyholders recoveries reserves reserves in millions of dollars policyholders with settlement agreements structured settlements wellington coverage in place fibreboard total with settlement agreements other policyholders with active accounts large asbestos accounts small asbestos accounts  total other policyholders  assumed reinsurance and pools unassigned ibnr total   december  policyholders with settlement agreements structured settlements wellington coverage in place fibreboard total with settlement agreements other policyholders with active accounts large asbestos accounts small asbestos accounts total other policyholders  assumed reinsurance and pools unassigned ibnr total   some asbestos related defendants have asserted that their policies issued by cna are not subject to aggregate limits on coverage 
cna has such claims from a number of insureds 
some of these claims involve insureds facing exhaustion of products liability aggregate limits in their policies  who have asserted that their asbestos related claims fall within so called non products liability coverage contained within their policies rather than products liability coverage  and that the claimed non products coverage is not subject to any aggregate limit 
it is difficult to predict the ultimate size of any of the claims for coverage purportedly not subject to aggregate limits or predict to what extent  if any  the attempts to assert non products claims outside the products liability aggregate will succeed 
cna has attempted to manage its asbestos exposure by aggressively seeking to settle claims on acceptable terms 
there can be no assurance that any of these settlement efforts will be successful  or that any such claims can be settled on terms acceptable to cna 
where cna cannot settle a claim on acceptable terms  cna aggressively litigates the claim 
adverse developments with respect to such matters could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and or equity 
certain asbestos litigation in which cna is currently engaged is described below on february   cna announced it had resolved asbestos related coverage litigation and claims involving ap green industries  ap green services and bigelow liptak corporation 
under the agreement  cna is required to pay million  net of reinsurance recoveries  over a ten year period 
the settlement resolves cna s liabilities for all pending and future asbestos claims involving ap green industries  bigelow liptak corporation and related subsidiaries  including alleged non products exposures 
the settlement has received initial bankruptcy court approval and cna expects to procure confirmation of a bankruptcy plan containing an injunction to protect cna from any future claims 
cna is engaged in insurance coverage litigation with underlying plaintiffs who have asbestos bodily injury claims against the former robert a 
keasbey company keasbey in new york state court continental casualty co 
v 
nationwide indemnity co 
et al  no 
ny county 
keasbey  a currently dissolved corporation  was a seller and installer of asbestos containing insulation products in new york and new jersey 
thousands of plaintiffs have filed bodily injury claims against keasbey  however  keasbey s involvement at a number of work sites is a highly contested issue 
therefore  the defense disputes the percentage of valid claims against keasbey 
cna issued keasbey primary policies for and excess policies for cna has paid an amount substantially equal to the policies aggregate limits for products and completed operations claims 
claimants against keasbey allege  among other things  that cna owes coverage under sections of the policies not subject to the aggregate limits  an allegation cna vigorously contests in the lawsuit 
cna has insurance coverage disputes related to asbestos bodily injury claims against burns roe enterprises  inc burns roe 
originally raised in litigation  now stayed  these disputes are currently part of in re burns roe enterprises  inc  pending in the us bankruptcy court for the district of new jersey  no 
burns roe provided engineering and related services in connection with construction projects 
at the time of its bankruptcy filing  burns roe faced approximately  claims alleging bodily injury resulting from exposure to asbestos as a result of construction projects in which burns roe was involved 
cna allegedly provided primary liability coverage to burns roe from and  along with certain project specific policies from cic issued certain primary and excess policies to bendix corporation bendix  now part of honeywell international  inc honeywell 
honeywell faces approximately  pending asbestos bodily injury claims resulting from alleged exposure to bendix friction products 
cic s primary policies allegedly covered the period from at least when bendix began to use asbestos in its friction products to  although the parties disagree about whether cic s policies provided product liability coverage before and from to cic asserts that it owes no further material obligations to bendix under any primary policy 
honeywell alleges that two primary policies issued by cic covering contain occurrence limits but not product liability aggregate limits for asbestos bodily injury claims 
cic has asserted  among other things  which even if honeywell s allegation is correct  which cna denies  its liability is limited to a single occurrence limit per policy or per year  and in the alternative  a proper allocation of losses would substantially limit its exposure under the policies to asbestos claims 
these and other issues are being litigated in continental insurance co  et al 
v 
honeywell international inc  no 
mrs l morris county  new jersey 
policyholders have also initiated litigation directly against cna and other insurers in four jurisdictions ohio  texas  west virginia and montana 
in the ohio action  plaintiffs allege the defendants negligently performed duties undertaken to protect the public from the effects of asbestos varner v 
ford motor co  et al  cuyahoga county  ohio 
similar lawsuits have also been filed in texas against cna  and other insurers and non insurer corporate defendants asserting liability for failing to warn of the dangers of asbestos boson v 
union carbide corp  et al  district court of nueces county  texas 
many of the texas claims have been dismissed as time barred by the applicable statute of limitations 
in other claims  the texas court recently ruled that the carriers did not owe any duty to the plaintiffs or the general public to advise on the effects of asbestos thereby dismissing these claims 
the time period for filing an appeal of this ruling has not expired and it remains uncertain whether the plaintiffs will continue to pursue their causes of action 
cna has been named in adams v 
aetna  inc  et al  circuit court of kanawha county  west virginia  a purported class action against cna and other insurers  alleging that the defendants violated west virginia s unfair trade practices act in handling and resolving asbestos claims against their policyholders 
a direct action has also been filed in montana pennock  et al 
v 
maryland casualty  et al  first judicial district court of lewis clark county  montana by eight individual plaintiffs all employees of wr grace co 
wr grace and their spouses against cna  maryland casualty and the state of montana 
this action alleges that the carriers failed to warn of or otherwise protect wr grace employees from the dangers of asbestos at a wr grace vermiculite mining facility in libby  montana 
the montana direct action is currently stayed because of wr grace s pending bankruptcy 
cna is vigorously defending these and other cases and believes that it has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted 
however  there are numerous factual and legal issues to be resolved in connection with these claims  and it is extremely difficult to predict the outcome or ultimate financial exposure represented by these matters 
adverse developments with respect to any of these matters could have a material adverse effect on cna s business  insurer financial strength and debt ratings  and the company s results of operations and or equity 
as a result of the uncertainties and complexities involved  reserves for asbestos claims cannot be estimated with traditional actuarial techniques that rely on historical accident year loss development factors 
in establishing asbestos reserves  cna evaluates the exposure presented by each insured 
as part of this evaluation  cna considers the available insurance coverage  limits and deductibles  the potential role of other insurance  particularly underlying coverage below any cna excess liability policies  and applicable coverage defenses  including asbestos exclusions 
estimation of asbestos related claim and claim adjustment expense reserves involves a high degree of judgment on the part of management and consideration of many complex factors  including 
inconsistency of court decisions  jury attitudes and future court decisions 
specific policy provisions 
allocation of liability among insurers and insureds 
missing policies and proof of coverage 
the proliferation of bankruptcy proceedings and attendant uncertainties 
novel theories asserted by policyholders and their counsel 
the targeting of a broader range of businesses and entities as defendants 
the uncertainty as to which other insureds may be targeted in the future and the uncertainties inherent in predicting the number of future claims 
volatility in claim numbers and settlement demands 
increases in the number of non impaired claimants and the extent to which they can be precluded from making claims 
the efforts by insureds to obtain coverage not subject to aggregate limits 
long latency period between asbestos exposure and disease manifestation and the resulting potential for involvement of multiple policy periods for individual claims 
medical inflation trends 
the mix of asbestos related diseases presented  and 
the ability to recover reinsurance cna is also monitoring possible legislative reforms  including the possible creation of a national privately financed trust  which if established through federal legislation  could replace litigation of asbestos claims with payments to claimants from the trust 
it is uncertain at the present time whether such legislation will be enacted or  if it is  what will be the terms and conditions of its establishment or its impact on cna 
environmental pollution and mass tort environmental pollution cleanup is the subject of both federal and state regulation 
by some estimates  there are thousands of potential waste sites subject to cleanup 
the insurance industry is involved in extensive litigation regarding coverage issues 
judicial interpretations in many cases have expanded the scope of coverage and liability beyond the original intent of the policies 
the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of superfund and comparable state statutes mini superfunds govern the cleanup and restoration of toxic waste sites and formalize the concept of legal liability for cleanup and restoration by potentially responsible parties prps 
superfund and the mini superfunds establish mechanisms to pay for cleanup of waste sites if prps fail to do so and assign liability to prps 
the extent of liability to be allocated to a prp is dependent upon a variety of factors 
further  the number of waste sites subject to cleanup is unknown 
to date  approximately  cleanup sites have been identified by the environmental protection agency epa and included on its national priorities list npl 
state authorities have designated many cleanup sites as well 
many policyholders have made claims against various cna insurance subsidiaries for defense costs and indemnification in connection with environmental pollution matters 
the vast majority of these claims relate to accident years and prior  which coincides with cna s adoption of the simplified commercial general liability coverage form  which includes what is referred to in the industry as an absolute pollution exclusion 
cna and the insurance industry are disputing coverage for many such claims 
key coverage issues include whether cleanup costs are considered damages under the policies  trigger of coverage  allocation of liability among triggered policies  applicability of pollution exclusions and owned property exclusions  the potential for joint and several liability and the definition of an occurrence 
to date  courts have been inconsistent in their rulings on these issues 
a number of proposals to modify superfund have been made by various parties 
however  no modifications were enacted by congress during  and it is unclear what positions congress or the administration will take and what legislation  if any  will result in the future 
if there is legislation  and in some circumstances even if there is no legislation  the federal role in environmental cleanup may be significantly reduced in favor of state action 
substantial changes in the federal statute or the activity of the epa may cause states to reconsider their environmental cleanup statutes and regulations 
there can be no meaningful prediction of the pattern of regulation that would result or the possible effect upon the company s results of operations or equity 
as of december  and  cna carried approximately and million of claim and claim adjustment expense reserves  net of reinsurance recoverables  for reported and unreported environmental pollution and mass tort claims

there was no unfavorable net prior year environmental pollution and mass tort net claim and claim adjustment expense reserve development for the year ended december  cna paid environmental pollution related claims and mass tort related claims  net of reinsurance recoveries  of  and million for years ended december   and cna recorded million in unfavorable net prior year environmental pollution development in this increase was in part due to the emergence of certain negative legal developments  including several court decisions which have reduced the effectiveness of the absolute pollution exclusion by limiting its application to traditional industrial pollution  and which have increased the scope of damages compensable under policies of insurance and emergence of natural resource damage claims and other federal statutes 
cna has made resolution of large environmental pollution exposures a management priority 
cna has resolved a number of its large environmental accounts by negotiating settlement agreements 
in its settlements  cna sought to resolve those exposures and obtain the broadest release language to avoid future claims from the same policyholders seeking coverage for sites or claims that had not emerged at the time cna settled with its policyholder 
while the terms of each settlement agreement vary  cna sought to obtain broad environmental releases that include known and unknown sites  claims and policies 
the broad scope of the release provisions contained in those settlement agreements should  in many cases  prevent future exposure from settled policyholders 
it remains uncertain  however  whether a court interpreting the language of the settlement agreements will adhere to the intent of the parties and uphold the broad scope of language of the agreements 
cna classifies its environmental pollution accounts into several categories  which include structured settlements  coverage in place agreements and active accounts 
at december   cna has a structured settlement agreement with one of its policyholders for which it has future payment obligations with a recorded reserve of million  net of reinsurance 
cna has also used coverage in place agreements to resolve pollution exposures 
claims payments are contingent on presentation of adequate documentation of damages during the policy periods and other documentation supporting the demand for claims payment 
coverage in place agreements may have annual payment caps 
at december   cna had negotiated six such agreements in which cna committed coverage for payment of claims and claim related adjustment expenses subject to documentation requirements as set forth in the terms of each specific agreement 
at december   cna had a recorded reserve of million  net of reinsurance  related to coverage in place agreements 
cna categorizes active accounts as large or small accounts in the pollution area 
cna defines a large account as an active account with more than  cumulative paid losses 
cna has large accounts with a collective reserve of million  net of reinsurance  at december  cna has made closing large accounts a significant management priority 
small accounts are defined as active accounts with  or less cumulative paid losses 
cna had small accounts with a collective reserve of million  net of reinsurance  at december  cna also evaluates its environmental pollution exposures arising from its assumed reinsurance and its participation in various pools  including ecra 
at december   cna has a reserve of million related to these liabilities 
at december   cna s unassigned ibnr reserve for environmental pollution was million  net of reinsurance 
this ibnr reserve relates to potential development on accounts that have not settled and potential future claims from unidentified policyholders 
the table below depicts cna s overall pending environmental pollution accounts and associated reserves at december  environmental percent of total paid pollution environmental number of in reserves pollution net policyholders net net reserve in millions of dollars policyholders with settlement agreements structured settlements coverage in place total with settlement agreements other policyholders with active accounts large pollution accounts small pollution accounts total other policyholders assumed reinsurance pools unassigned ibnr total cna recorded million in unfavorable mass tort net prior year development in  due in part to the elevated volume of silica claims 
in  cna observed a marked increase in silica claims frequency in mississippi  where plaintiff attorneys appear to have filed claims to avoid the effect of a tort reform 
the most significant silica exposures identified to date include a relatively small number of accounts with significant numbers of new claims and substantial insurance limits issued by cna 
establishing claim and claim adjustment expense reserves for silica claims is subject to uncertainties because of disputes concerning medical causation with respect to certain diseases  including lung cancer  geographical concentration of the lawsuits asserting the claims  and the large rise in the total number of claims without underlying epidemiological developments suggesting an increase in disease rates or plaintiffs 
moreover  judicial interpretations regarding application of various tort defenses  including application of various theories of joint and several liability  impede cna s ability to establish claim and claims adjustment expense reserves 
in  cna noted the continued emergence of adverse loss experience across several lines of business related to prior years 
with respect to environmental pollution and mass tort reserves  commencing in and continuing into the first and second quarters of  cna received a number of new reported claims  some of which involved declaratory judgment actions premised on court decisions purporting to expand insurance coverage for pollution claims 
in these decisions  several courts adopted rules of insurance policy interpretation which established joint and several liability for insurers consecutively on a risk during a period of alleged property damage  and in other instances adopted interpretations of the absolute pollution exclusion  which weakened its effectiveness in most circumstances 
in addition to receiving new claims and declaratory judgment actions premised upon these unfavorable legal precedents  these court decisions also impacted cna s pending environmental pollution and mass tort claims and coverage litigation 
during the spring of  cna reviewed specific claims and litigation  as well as general trends  and concluded reserve strengthening in this area was necessary 
in the area of mass torts  several well publicized verdicts arising out of bodily injury cases related to allegedly toxic mold led to a significant increase in mold related claims in and the first half of cna s reserve increase in the second quarter of was caused in part by this increased area of exposure

maverick accounted for of lorillard s net unit sales in  as compared to in deep discount price brands are produced by manufacturers who are subject to lower payment obligations under the state settlement agreements 
this cost advantage enables them to price their brands as much as less than the list price of premium brand offerings from the major cigarette manufacturers 
deep discount price brands increased their market share in by share points to 
total lorillard and newport share of domestic wholesale shipments compared favorably with the prior year due to wholesale inventory reductions in following heavy purchases in advance of multiple state tax increases  which tend to affect cigarette brands with large market shares  such as newport  more than others

lorillard s outside legal fees and other external product liability defense costs were  and million  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
numerous factors affect product liability defense costs 
the principal factors are the number and types of cases filed  the number of cases tried  the results of trials and appeals  the development of the law  the application of new or different theories of liability by plaintiffs and their counsel  and litigation strategy and tactics 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this report for detailed information regarding tobacco litigation 
the factors that have influenced past product liability defense costs are expected to continue to influence future costs 
although lorillard does not expect that product liability defense costs will increase significantly in the future  it is possible that adverse developments in the factors discussed above  as well as other circumstances beyond the control of lorillard  could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition  results of operations or cash flows

increased promotional expenses in  as compared to  partially offset the higher average unit prices in lorillard s overall unit sales volume decreased in as compared to newport s unit sales volume decreased by in continued decreases in unit volume for old gold and maverick in the discount segment were also contributing factors 
old gold and maverick declines were due to severe competitive price pressure from deep discount brands produced by manufacturers who do not have the same financial payment obligations related to the state settlement agreements as does lorillard and other major tobacco companies 
additionally  volume in was affected by generally weak economic conditions and ongoing limitations imposed by philip morris retail merchandising arrangements 
deep discount price brands produced by manufacturers who are not obligated by the same payment terms of the state settlement agreements have continued to increase their market share by approximately one share point during to of the us domestic market

msai s information relating to unit sales volume and market share of certain of the smaller  primarily deep discount  cigarette manufacturers is based on estimates derived by msai 
lorillard management believes that volume and market share information for these manufacturers are understated and  correspondingly  share information for the larger manufacturers  including lorillard  are overstated by msai 
business environment the tobacco industry in the united states  including lorillard  continues to be faced with a number of issues that have impacted or may adversely impact the business  results of operations and financial condition of lorillard and the company  including the following 
a substantial volume of litigation seeking compensatory and punitive damages ranging into the billions of dollars  as well as equitable and injunctive relief  arising out of allegations of cancer and other health effects resulting from the use of cigarettes  addiction to smoking or exposure to environmental tobacco smoke  including claims for reimbursement of health care costs allegedly incurred as a result of smoking  as well as other alleged damages 
pending litigation includes a jury award in florida of billion in punitive damages against lorillard in engle v 
rj reynolds tobacco company  et al  a judgment which was vacated by the florida third district court of appeal in september of plaintiffs have appealed the appellate court s decision to the florida supreme court 
the us department of justice has also brought an action against lorillard and other tobacco companies 
the government seeks  pursuant to the federal racketeer influenced and corrupt organization act  or rico  disgorgement of profits from the industry of billion that the government contends were earned as a consequence of a rico racketeering enterprise  as well as various injunctive relief 
trial of this matter is scheduled to begin during september of see item legal proceedings and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this report for information with respect to the engle action and other litigation against cigarette manufacturers and the state settlement agreements 

substantial annual payments by lorillard  continuing in perpetuity  and significant restrictions on marketing and advertising agreed to under the terms of the state settlement agreements 
the state settlement agreements impose a stream of future payment obligations on lorillard and the other major us cigarette manufacturers and place significant restrictions on their ability to market and sell cigarettes 
the company believes that the implementation of the state settlement agreements will materially adversely affect its consolidated results of operations and cash flows in future periods 
the degree of the adverse impact will depend  among other things  on the rates of decline in us cigarette sales in the premium and discount segments  lorillard s share of the domestic premium and discount segment  and the effect of any resulting cost advantage of manufacturers not subject to all of the payments of the state settlement agreements 

on october   rjr  the second largest cigarette manufacturer in the united states  and british american tobacco announced that they have agreed to combine the us tobacco business of rjr with british american tobacco s us tobacco business  b w  the third largest cigarette manufacturer in the united states 
the closing of this combination is subject to various conditions  including regulatory approvals 
if completed  the consolidation of these two competitors would result in further concentration of the us tobacco industry  with the top two companies  philip morris usa and the newly created reynolds american  having a combined market share of approximately 
in addition  this transaction would combine in one company the third and fourth leading menthol brands  kool and salem  which have a combined share of the menthol segment of approximately 
this concentration of us market share could make it more difficult for lorillard and others to compete for shelf space in retail outlets and could impact price competition among menthol brands  either of which could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations and financial condition of the company 

the continuing contraction of the us cigarette market  in which lorillard currently conducts its only significant business 
as a result of price increases  restrictions on advertising and promotions  increases in regulation and excise taxes  health concerns  a decline in the social acceptability of smoking  increased pressure from anti tobacco groups and other factors  us cigarette shipments among major us cigarette manufacturers have decreased at a compound annual rate of approximately over the period through and approximately over the period from through  as measured by msai 
in  domestic us cigarette industry volume declined by as compared to  according to information provided by msai 

competition from deep discounters who enjoy competitive cost and pricing advantages because they are not subject to the same payment obligations under the state settlement agreements as lorillard 
market share for the deep discount brands decreased share points from in the fourth quarter of to in the fourth quarter of  as estimated by msai 
in  deep discount price brands increased their market share by share points to as compared to lorillard s focus on the premium market and its obligations under the state settlement agreements make it very difficult to compete successfully in the deep discount market 

increases in industry wide promotional expenses and sales incentives implemented in response to declining unit volume  state excise tax increases and increased competition among the four largest cigarette manufacturers  including lorillard  and smaller participants who have gained market share in recent years  principally in the deep discount cigarette segment 
as a result of increased competition based on the retail price of brands and the related increased market share of deep discounters described in the immediately preceding bullet  the ability of lorillard and the other major manufacturers to raise prices has been adversely affected 
in light of this environment  lorillard has not increased its wholesale prices since march of increases by manufacturers in wholesale and retail price promotional allowances also effectively reduce the prices of many key brands 
on may   lorillard lowered the wholesale list price of its discount brand  maverick  by per thousand cigarettes per pack of cigarettes in an effort to reposition the brand to be more competitive in the deep discount cigarette segment 
certain of lorillard s major competitors continue to promote their products through the use of restrictive merchandising programs that lorillard believes impede its ability to compete for shelf space in retail outlets and make it difficult to effectively communicate its promotions to consumers 

cigarettes are subject to substantial federal  state and local excise taxes which are reflected in the retail price of cigarettes 
these taxes have increased substantially 
in  federal excise taxes were per pack and state excise taxes ranged from to per pack 
in  federal excise taxes were per pack and state excise taxes ranged from to per pack 
state excise tax increases ranging from per pack to per pack have been implemented during proposals have been made and or are pending to increase federal and further increase state and local excise taxes 
lorillard believes that increases in excise and similar taxes have had an adverse impact on sales of cigarettes and that future increases  the extent of which cannot be predicted  could result in further volume declines for the cigarette industry  including lorillard  and an increased sales shift toward lower priced discount cigarettes rather than premium brands 

increases in actual and proposed state and local regulation of the tobacco industry relating to the manufacture  sale  distribution  advertising  labeling and use of tobacco products and government restrictions on smoking 

substantial and increasing regulation of the tobacco industry and governmental restrictions on smoking  including recent proposals to enact legislation to grant the food and drug administration fda authority to regulate tobacco products under the federal food  drug and cosmetic act 
lorillard believes that the fda proposals would  among other things  provide philip morris with a competitive advantage 

increasing sales of counterfeit cigarettes in the united states  which adversely impact sales by the manufacturer of the counterfeited brands and potentially damage the value and reputation of those brands

diamond offshore diamond offshore drilling  inc and subsidiaries diamond offshore 
diamond offshore drilling  inc is a owned subsidiary of the company 
diamond offshore s revenues vary based upon demand  which affects the number of days the fleet is utilized and the dayrates earned 
when a rig is idle  generally no dayrate is earned and revenues will decrease 
revenues can also increase or decrease as a result of the acquisition or disposal of rigs  required surveys and shipyard upgrades 
in order to improve utilization or realize higher dayrates  diamond offshore may mobilize its rigs from one market to another 
during periods of unpaid mobilization  however  revenues may be adversely affected 
in response to changes in demand  diamond offshore may withdraw a rig from the market by cold stacking it or may reactivate a rig stacked previously  which may decrease or increase revenues  respectively 
revenues from dayrate drilling contracts are recognized currently 
diamond offshore may receive lump sum payments in connection with specific contracts 
such payments are recognized as revenues over the term of the related drilling contract 
mobilization revenues in excess of costs incurred to mobilize an offshore rig from one market to another  are recognized over the primary term of the related drilling contract 
revenues from offshore turnkey drilling contracts are accrued to the extent of costs until the specified turnkey depth and other contract requirements are met 
income is recognized on the completed contract method 
provisions for future losses on turnkey contracts are recognized when it becomes apparent that expenses to be incurred on a specific contract will exceed the revenue from that contract 
diamond offshore has elected not to pursue contracts for integrated services  which includes turnkey contracts  except in very limited circumstances 
operating income is primarily affected by revenue factors  but is also a function of varying levels of operating expenses 
operating expenses generally are not affected by changes in dayrates and may not be significantly affected by fluctuations in utilization 
for instance  if a rig is to be idle for a short period of time  diamond offshore may realize few decreases in operating expenses since the rig is typically maintained in a prepared or ready stacked state with a full crew 
in addition  when a rig is idle  diamond offshore is responsible for certain operating expenses such as rig fuel and supply boat costs  which are typically a cost of the operator under drilling contracts 
however  if the rig is to be idle for an extended period of time  diamond offshore may reduce the size of a rig s crew and take steps to cold stack the rig  which lowers expenses and partially offsets the impact on operating income 
operating income is also negatively impacted when diamond offshore performs certain regulatory inspections that are due every five years year survey for all of diamond offshore rigs 
operating revenue decreases because these surveys are performed during scheduled down time in a shipyard 
operating expenses increase as a result of these surveys due to the cost to mobilize the rigs to a shipyard  inspection costs incurred and repair and maintenance costs 
repair and maintenance costs may be required resulting from the survey or may have been previously planned to take place during this mandatory down time 
the number of rigs undergoing a year survey will vary from year to year 
compared with revenues decreased by million  or  in  as compared to net loss in was million  compared to net income of million in revenues in decreased due primarily to lower contract drilling revenues of million  losses on sales of marketable securities  as compared to gains in the prior year  and reduced investment income 
revenues from high specification floaters and other semisubmersible rigs decreased by million in  as compared to the decrease reflects a decline in dayrates of million and decreased utilization of million  partially offset by revenues generated by the recent additions of the ocean patriot and the ocean vanguard and the july completion of the upgrade to high specification capabilities of the ocean rover amounting to million in revenues from jack up rigs decreased million  or  in due primarily to decreased utilization of million  partially offset by increased dayrates of million as compared to investment income decreased by million  or  primarily due to lower yields on cash and marketable securities and a reduction in invested cash balances in  as compared to net income decreased in due primarily to the lower dayrates earned by semisubmersible rigs  losses on sales of marketable securities as compared to gains in  lower investment income and increased contract drilling expenses 
results for were also negatively impacted by a reduced tax benefit related to losses incurred by diamond offshore s rigs operating in international markets  partially offset by lower depreciation expense 
in april of  diamond offshore commissioned a study to evaluate the economic lives of its drilling rigs 
as a result of this study  diamond offshore recorded changes in accounting estimates by increasing the estimated service lives to years for jack ups and years for semisubmersibles and diamond offshore s drillship and by increasing salvage values to for most of its drilling rigs 
the change in estimate was made to better reflect the remaining economic lives and salvage values of diamond offshore s fleet 
the effect of this change in accounting estimate resulted in an increase to net income of million after tax and minority interest for the year ended december  compared with revenues decreased by million  or and net income decreased by million  or  respectively  in as compared to revenues decreased due primarily to lower contract drilling revenue of million  reduced investment income of million  and lower revenues from reimbursable expenses 
revenues from high specification floaters and other semisubmersible rigs decreased by million  or in as compared to the decrease reflects lower average dayrates million and lower utilization million partially offset by revenues generated by the ocean baroness million  which completed a conversion to a high specification semisubmersible drilling unit and commenced operations in march of revenues from jack up rigs decreased by million  or  due primarily to decreased dayrates million and lower utilization million in interest income decreased by million  or  in primarily due to a reduction in marketable securities held and lower interest rates earned on cash and marketable securities in compared to net income decreased due primarily to the reduced revenues in as discussed above  partially offset by lower interest expenses related to a premium paid on early extinguishment of debt in texas gas revenues and net income in reflect operations from may   the date of acquisition

ratings ratings are an important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies 
cna s insurance company subsidiaries are rated by major rating agencies  and these ratings reflect the rating agency s opinion of the insurance company s financial strength  operating performance  strategic position and ability to meet its obligations to policyholders 
agency ratings are not a recommendation to buy  sell or hold any security  and may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the issuing organization 
each agency s rating should be evaluated independently of any other agency s rating 
one or more of these agencies could take action in the future to change the ratings of cna s insurance subsidiaries 
the actions that can be taken by rating agencies are changes in ratings or modifiers 
on review  credit watch and rating watch are modifiers used by the ratings agencies to alert those parties relying on cna s ratings of the possibility of a rating change in the near term 
modifiers are utilized when the agencies are uncertain as to the impact of a company action or initiative  which could prove to be material to the current rating level 
modifiers are generally used to indicate a possible change in rating within days 
outlooks accompanied with ratings are additional modifiers used by the rating agencies to alert those parties relying on cna s ratings of the possibility of a rating change in the longer term 
the time frame referenced in an outlook is not necessarily limited to ninety days as defined in the credit watch category 
the table below reflects the various group ratings issued by am best  s p  moody s and fitch as of february  for the property and casualty and life companies 
the table also includes the ratings for cna s senior debt and continental senior debt

the rating agency changed cac s outlook from negative to stable and placed vfl s rating on review for upgrade 
standard poor s did not change their a ratings on cac and vfl  but revised vfl s modifier to creditwatch developing from creditwatch with negative implications 
if cna s insurance financial strength ratings were downgraded below current levels 
cna s business and the company s results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
the severity of the impact on cna s business is dependent on the level of downgrade and  for certain products  which rating agency takes the rating action 
among the adverse effects in the event of such downgrading would be the inability to obtain a material volume of business from certain major insurance brokers  the inability to sell a material volume of cna s insurance products to certain markets  and the required collateralization of certain future payment obligations or reserves 
the institutional markets business unit of group operations  which was not included in the sale of cna s group benefits business to hartford and provides investment products to pension plan sponsors and other institutional customers  would be significantly impacted by a downgrade of cac vfl 
cna has entered into several settlement agreements and assumed reinsurance contracts that require collateralization of future payment obligations and assumed reserves if cna s ratings or other specific criteria fall below certain thresholds 
the ratings triggers are generally more than one level below cna s february  ratings 
dividend paying ability cna s ability to pay dividends and other credit obligations is significantly dependent on receipt of dividends from its subsidiaries 
the payment of dividends to cna by its insurance subsidiaries without prior approval of the insurance department of each subsidiary s domiciliary jurisdiction is limited by formula 
dividends in excess of these amounts are subject to prior approval by the respective state insurance departments 
dividends from ccc are subject to the insurance holding company laws of the state of illinois  the domiciliary state of ccc 
under these laws  ordinary dividends  or dividends that do not require prior approval of the illinois department of insurance the department  may be paid only from earned surplus  which is calculated by removing unrealized gains from unassigned surplus 
as of december   ccc is in a negative earned surplus position 
until ccc is in a positive earned surplus position  all dividends require prior approval of the department 
in january of  the department approved an extraordinary dividend capacity in the amount of approximately million to be used to fund the cna s debt service and principal repayment requirements 
by agreement with the new hampshire insurance department  the cic group may not pay dividends to ccc until after january  cna s domestic insurance subsidiaries are subject to risk based capital requirements 
risk based capital is a method developed by the naic to determine the minimum amount of statutory capital appropriate for an insurance company to support its overall business operations in consideration of its size and risk profile 
the formula for determining the amount of risk based capital specifies various factors  weighted based on the perceived degree of risk  which are applied to certain financial balances and financial activity 
the adequacy of a company s actual capital is evaluated by a comparison to the risk based capital results  as determined by the formula 
companies below minimum risk based capital requirements are classified within certain levels  each of which requires specified corrective action 
as of december  and  all of cna s domestic insurance subsidiaries exceeded the minimum risk based capital requirements

cna follows a consistent and systematic process for impairing securities that sustain other than temporary declines in value 
cna has established a committee responsible for the impairment process 
this committee  referred to as the impairment committee  is made up of three officers appointed by cna s chief financial officer 
the impairment committee is responsible for analyzing watch list securities on at least a quarterly basis 
the watch list includes individual securities that fall below certain thresholds or that exhibit evidence of impairment indicators including  but not limited to  a significant adverse change in the financial condition and near term prospects of the investment or a significant adverse change in legal factors  the business climate or credit ratings 
when a security is placed on the watch list  it is monitored for further market value changes and additional news related to the issuer s financial condition 
the focus is on objective evidence that may influence the evaluation of impairment factors 
the decision to impair a security incorporates both quantitative criteria and qualitative information 
the impairment committee considers a number of factors including  but not limited to a the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than book value  b the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  c the intent and ability of cna to retain its investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in value  d whether the debtor is current on interest and principal payments and e general market conditions and industry or sector specific factors 
the impairment committee s decision to impair a security is primarily based on whether the security s fair value is likely to remain significantly below its book value in light of all of the factors considered 
for securities that are impaired  the security is written down to fair value and the resulting losses are recognized in realized gains losses in the consolidated statements of operations 
realized investment losses included  and million of pretax impairment losses for the three years ended december   and the impairments were primarily the result of the continued credit deterioration on specific issuers in the bond and equity markets and the effects on such markets due to the overall slowing of the economy 
for the year ended december   the impairment losses recorded related primarily to corporate bonds in the airline  healthcare and energy industries 
for the year ended december   the impairment losses recorded related primarily to corporate bonds in the communications industry sectors including million related to worldcom inc  million related to adelphia communication corporation  million for charter communications  million for at t canada and million for telewest plc 
for the year ended december   the impairment losses recorded related primarily to corporate bonds and equities in the communications industry sector including million for medicalogic medscape  inc and million for at home corporation 
if the deterioration in these industry sectors continues in future periods and cna continues to hold these seurities  cna is likely to have additional impairments in the future 
cna s non investment grade fixed maturity securities held as of december  that were in an unrealized loss position had a fair value of million 
as discussed previously  a significant judgment in the valuation of investments is the determination of when an other than temporary impairment has occurred 
cna s impairment committee analyzes securities placed on the watch list on at least a quarterly basis 
part of this analysis is to monitor the length of time and severity of the decline below book value of the watch list securities 
the following table summarizes the fair value and gross unrealized loss of non investment grade securities categorized by the length of time those securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position and further categorized by the severity of the unrealized loss position in increments as of december  fair value as a percentage of book value estimated unrealized december  fair value loss in millions fixed maturity securities non investment grade months months months greater than months total non investment grade as part of the ongoing impairment monitoring process  the impairment committee has evaluated the facts and circumstances based on available information for each of these non investment grade securities and determined that no further impairments were necessary at december  this determination was based on a number of factors that the committee regularly considers including  but not limited to the issuers ability to meet current and future interest and principal payments  an evaluation of the issuers financial condition and near term prospects  the company s sector outlook and estimates of the fair value of any underlying collateral 
in all cases where a decline in value is judged to be temporary  cna had the intent and ability to hold these securities for a period of time sufficient to recover the book value of its investment through a recovery in the market value of such securities or by holding the securities to maturity 
in many cases  the securities held are matched to liabilities as part of ongoing asset liability duration management 
as such the impairment committee continually assesses its ability to hold securities for a time sufficient to recover any temporary loss in value or until maturity 
cna maintains sufficient levels of liquidity so as to not impact the asset liability management process 
cna s equity securities held as of december  that were in an unrealized loss position had a fair value of million 
cna s impairment committee  under the same process as fixed maturity securities  monitors the equity securities for other than temporary declines in value 
in all cases where a decline in value is judged to be temporary  cna expects to recover the book value of its investment through a recovery in the market value of the security 
during the second quarter of  cna announced its intention to sell certain businesses 
the assets being held for disposition included cna re uk and certain other businesses 
based upon the impairment analyses performed at that time  cna anticipated that it would realize losses in connection with those planned sales 
in determining the anticipated loss from these sales  cna estimated the net realizable value of each business being held for sale 
an estimated loss of million after tax and minority interest was initially recorded in the second quarter of this loss was reported in realized investment gains losses 
in the fourth quarter of  cna sold certain businesses as planned 
the realized loss applicable to these businesses recognized in was million after tax and minority interest 
revenues of these businesses included in the year ended december  totaled approximately million 
these businesses contributed approximately million after tax and minority interest of net losses in the year ended december  cna regularly updates its impairment analyses and adjusts its loss as necessary 
based on these updated analyses the impairment loss was reduced by approximately million after tax and minority interest in the fourth quarter of  primarily because the net assets of the businesses had been significantly diminished by their operating losses  including unfavorable net prior year development recognized by cna re uk in the fourth quarter of the reduction of the impairment was included in realized investment gains losses 
on october   cna completed the sale of cna re uk to tawa 
the sale includes business underwritten since inception by cna re uk  except for certain risks retained by ccc as discussed below 
the purchase price was  subject to adjustments based primarily upon the results of operations and realized foreign currency losses of cna re uk under the terms of the purchase price adjustment  ccc is entitled to receive million from tawa after tawa is able to legally withdraw funds from the former cna re uk entities  at december   cna has received approximately million 
ccc has also committed to contribute up to million to the former cna re uk entities over a four year period beginning in should the financial services authority fsa deem those entities to be undercapitalized 
the purchase price adjustment related to foreign currency losses resulted in cna contributing additional capital to cna re uk of million 
as the sale and related agreements have now been completed  cna has finalized its impairment analysis based upon the terms of the completed transactions and reduced the impairment loss by approximately million after tax and minority interest 
the reduction of the impairment was included in net realized investment gains in concurrent with the sale  several reinsurance agreements under which ccc had provided retrocessional protection to cna re uk were terminated 
as part of the sale  cna re uk s net exposure to all igi program liabilities was assumed by ccc 
further  ccc is providing a million stop loss cover attaching at carried reserves on cna re uk s underwriting year exposures for which ccc received premiums of million 
cna re uk had revenues of approximately and million for the years ended december  and cna re uk had net losses of and million for the years ended december  and the assets and liabilities of cna re uk  including the effects of the concurrent transactions  were approximately  and  million at the date of sale and  and  million as of december  substantially all invested assets are marketable securities classified as available for sale in the accompanying financial statements

non investment grade bonds  as presented in the tables above  are high yield securities rated below bbb by bond rating agencies  as well as other unrated securities that  in the opinion of management  are below investment grade 
high yield securities generally involve a greater degree of risk than investment grade securities 
however  expected returns should compensate for the added risk 
this risk is also considered in the interest rate assumptions for the underlying insurance products

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is a large diversified financial services company 
as such  it and its subsidiaries have significant amounts of financial instruments that involve market risk 
the company s measure of market risk exposure represents an estimate of the change in fair value of its financial instruments 
changes in the trading portfolio would be recognized as investment gains losses in the consolidated statements of operations 
market risk exposure is presented for each class of financial instrument held by the company at december  assuming immediate adverse market movements of the magnitude described below 
the company believes that the various rates of adverse market movements represent a measure of exposure to loss under hypothetically assumed adverse conditions 
the estimated market risk exposure represents the hypothetical loss to future earnings and does not represent the maximum possible loss nor any expected actual loss  even under adverse conditions  because actual adverse fluctuations would likely differ 
in addition  since the company s investment portfolio is subject to change based on its portfolio management strategy as well as in response to changes in the market  these estimates are not necessarily indicative of the actual results which may occur 
exposure to market risk is managed and monitored by senior management 
senior management approves the overall investment strategy employed by the company and has responsibility to ensure that the investment positions are consistent with that strategy and the level of risk acceptable to it 
the company may manage risk by buying or selling instruments or entering into offsetting positions 
interest rate risk the company has exposure to interest rate risk arising from changes in the level or volatility of interest rates 
the company attempts to mitigate its exposure to interest rate risk by utilizing instruments such as interest rate swaps  interest rate caps  commitments to purchase securities  options  futures and forwards 
the company monitors its sensitivity to interest rate risk by evaluating the change in the value of its financial assets and liabilities due to fluctuations in interest rates 
the evaluation is performed by applying an instantaneous change in interest rates by varying magnitudes on a static balance sheet to determine the effect such a change in rates would have on the recorded market value of the company s investments and the resulting effect on shareholders equity 
the analysis presents the sensitivity of the market value of the company s financial instruments to selected changes in market rates and prices which the company believes are reasonably possible over a one year period 
the sensitivity analysis estimates the change in the market value of the company s interest sensitive assets and liabilities that were held on december  and due to instantaneous parallel shifts in the yield curve of basis points  with all other variables held constant 
the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
accordingly the analysis may not be indicative of  is not intended to provide  and does not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes of market interest rates on the company s earnings or shareholders equity 
further  the computations do not contemplate any actions the company could undertake in response to changes in interest rates 
the company s long term debt  as of december  and is denominated in us dollars 
the company s debt has been primarily issued at fixed rates  and as such  interest expense would not be impacted by interest rate shifts 
the impact of a basis point increase in interest rates on fixed rate debt would result in a decrease in market value of and million  respectively 
a basis point decrease would result in an increase in market value of and million  respectively 
equity price risk the company has exposure to equity price risk as a result of its investment in equity securities and equity derivatives 
equity price risk results from changes in the level or volatility of equity prices which affect the value of equity securities or instruments that derive their value from such securities or indexes 
equity price risk was measured assuming an instantaneous change in the underlying reference price or index from its level at december  and  with all other variable held constant 
foreign exchange rate risk foreign exchange rate risk arises from the possibility that changes in foreign currency exchange rates will impact the value of financial instruments 
the company has foreign exchange rate exposure when it buys or sells foreign currencies or financial instruments denominated in a foreign currency 
this exposure is mitigated by the company s asset liability matching strategy and through the use of futures for those instruments which are not matched 
the company s foreign transactions are primarily denominated in canadian dollars  british pounds and the european monetary unit 
the sensitivity analysis also assumes an instantaneous change in the foreign currency exchange rates versus the us dollar from their levels at december  and  with all other variables held constant 
commodity price risk the company has exposure to commodity price risk as a result of its investments in gold options 
commodity price risk results from changes in the level or volatility of commodity prices that impact instruments which derive their value from such commodities 
commodity price risk was measured assuming an instantaneous change of from their levels at december  and the following tables present the company s market risk by category equity markets  interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices on the basis of those entered into for trading purposes and other than trading purposes 
trading portfolio category of risk exposure fair value asset liability market risk december amounts in millions equity markets equity securities options purchased written short sales limited partnership investments separate accounts equity securities a other invested assets interest rate futures short interest rate swaps separate accounts fixed maturities short term investments gold options purchased written note the calculation of estimated market risk exposure is based on assumed adverse changes in the underlying reference price or index of a decrease in equity prices of  a decrease in interest rates of basis points and a decrease in gold prices of 
adverse changes on options which differ from those presented above would not necessarily result in a proportionate change to the estimated market risk exposure 
a in addition  the separate accounts carry positions in equity index futures 
a decrease in equity prices of would result in market risk amounting to and at december  and  respectively
