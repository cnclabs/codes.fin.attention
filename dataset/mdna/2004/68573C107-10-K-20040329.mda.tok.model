item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition as of december  and results of operations for the years ended december    and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes to consolidated financial statements and selected financial data included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we are engaged in the provision of services for profiling genetic uniqueness 
we incorporated as a delaware corporation and began operations in in the first three years of business we were primarily focused on developing our microfluidics technologies for applications in high throughput production of small molecules under collaborative research programs with smithkline beecham and sarnoff corporation 
in  we made a fundamental shift away from the development of microfluidics technologies and focused our business on the application of our technology to determine genetic variability and differences  including genotyping snps 
at that time  we acquired molecular tool because its proprietary primer extension technology for analyzing snps matched our existing microfluidics technologies  which allowed us to focus our business on genetic diversity testing 
our genetic diversity testing services included the measuring and analyzing of information related to genetic uniqueness  or the genetic variability that distinguishes one organism from another  also known as genotyping 
during this period we also developed instruments and kits that could be used for genotyping performed independently by third parties 
in december  we acquired genescreen  a provider of identity genomics services 
in  we acquired two other identity genomics businesses cellmark and lifecodes 
from through  our business focused on snp scoring products and services that used our proprietary primer extension technology  and on our identity genomics services in paternity and forensics 
in december  we disposed of our snp genotyping instrumentation and related consumables assets offered by our orchid life sciences business unit 
beginning late in  based on a decision to pursue the sale of our diagnostics business unit  we reflected this business as a discontinued operation in our consolidated results of operations 
we completed the divestiture of our diagnostics business unit in january in  we focused our efforts and reported our operating results around our identity genomics segment serving customers in the united states and united kingdom 
identity genomics includes services that measure and analyze information related to genetic uniqueness  or the genetic variability that distinguishes one organism from another 
these services are provided in the markets for the establishment of paternity  forensic identification and food safety and animal testing applications 
we intend to continue to focus our operations on providing services related to genetic uniqueness 
we have incurred losses since inception and as of december  we had stockholders equity of approximately million  including an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
we had previously indicated that we expected to attain profitability in the second half of  however  due to market circumstances  particularly the rate at which funding of forensics testing was released from the nij  we were unable to achieve our objective 
our revenues are predominately generated from services provided to our customers that relate to the completion of dna laboratory testing 
our costs and expenses consist of costs of service revenue  research and development expense  marketing and sales expense  general and administrative expenses and other income and expense 
costs of service revenues consist primarily of salaries and related personnel costs  laboratory supplies  fees paid for the collection of samples  and facility expenses 
research and development expense consists primarily of salaries and related costs  fees paid to consultants and outside service providers for development  
table of contents laboratory supplies  and other expenses related to the design  development  testing and enhancement of our products 
marketing and sales expense consists of salaries and benefits for salespeople within our company and all related costs of selling and marketing our products and services 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for executive  finance and administrative personnel  professional fees  and other corporate expenses 
other income and expense  net consists principally of interest income and interest expense 
our revenues in the united states are somewhat dependent on the timing of federal funding for forensics dna testing through the nij 
in the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of  we witnessed an increase in the amount of funding made available by the nij to various governmental and law enforcement establishments around the us 
in the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of  we have entered into several new contracts and renewed existing contracts with certain governmental agencies 
we expect that our continued ability to add to our customer base and retain our existing customers will strengthen our top line and our ability to meet our financial objectives for and beyond 
our operations in the uk include of our public health testing services and accounted for of our revenues 
in  of our uk revenues were from two customers one of which was defra 
we expect that our contract with defra will be renewed in  although there can be no assurances at this time that we will obtain this renewal 
we expect that our uk business will continue to be a significant part of our business 
we expect to experience continued growth in our uk based forensics testing as a result of attaining a contract in late with the metropolitan police  and we expect to increase our business in the public health testing area through the introduction of our meat traceability business with new customers  which includes the maple leaf foods contract announced in the first quarter we were favorably impacted during by exchange rate movements of the british lb sterling as compared to the us dollar  and this trend is expected to continue in the near term 
however  the significant percentage of our revenue derived from our uk operations makes us vulnerable to future fluctuations in the exchange rate  and there can be no assurance that the recent favorable trend in this exchange rate will not be reversed  which would have an unfavorable impact on our consolidated financial results 
our operating results are driven by our ability to generate sales and improve operating efficiency 
as a result of our restructuring plan formalized in and implemented throughout and to restructure certain operations  we have achieved and sustained improvements in operating results and operating cash flow 
the net cash used in operations declined from million in to million used in we expect that the full year effect of our restructuring plans will assist us in achieving additional improvements in operating results during we also expect to continue to focus on improving operating efficiencies during we expect that these operating efficiency improvements  together with our expected growth in revenue during of  will result in improved gross margins during we believe that our current level of overhead expenses is sufficient to support our planned revenue growth in  and we anticipate that these expenses will be lower than levels  as a result of the restructuring activities undertaken in and overall  we expect to have positive income from operations for the full year in the first quarter of  we have taken certain measures to improve liquidity and provide working capital 
on february   we closed a common stock private equity financing in the amount of million  net of closing costs 
in addition  as of february   of our redeemable convertible preferred stockholders converted their shareholdings to common stock 
in connection with the common stock private equity financing  we intend to file a registration statement covering the resale of the shares of common stock sold  as well as the shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of the warrants issued in the financing  no later than march  as a result of these measures  we expect to have adequate capital to fund operations in the future 
on january  we filed a shelf registration statement on form s with the securities and exchange commission  to provide us with further opportunities to raise capital 
when declared effective  this shelf 
table of contents registration will permit us  from time to time  to offer and sell up to million of our common stock 
we do not anticipate the need to raise additional capital in to fund current operations  however  if we determine that this need exists  or if we intend to fund future growth opportunities  we may use this shelf registration to provide financing 
this registration statement has not yet been declared effective 
results of operations our diagnostic business unit was considered to be a non core asset  and was reflected as a discontinued operation 
accordingly  we have not included the results of operations of our diagnostics business unit  which was held for sale  in the results of continuing operations in any period presented 
the results of operations for this business unit have been reflected in discontinued operations for all periods presented 
the assets and liabilities of our diagnostics business unit  which was held for sale  have been reflected as such in the condensed consolidated balance sheets as of december  and december  we completed the sale of certain assets and liabilities related to our diagnostics business unit in january years ended december  and the following table sets forth a year over year comparison of the components of our net loss for the years ended december  and in thousands change change total revenue costs of revenue research and development expenses marketing and sales general and administrative expenses impairment of assets restructuring and related charges amortization of deferred compensation amortization of intangible assets interest income interest expense other income expense income tax expense benefit loss from operations of a business held for sale net loss net loss allocable to common shareholders revenues revenues for the twelve months ended december  of approximately million represented an increase of approximately million as compared to revenues of approximately million for the comparable period of total revenues during the twelve months ended december  versus increased as a result of increased service revenues 
total service revenues for the twelve months ended december  were approximately million  an increase of approximately million  or  from approximately million during the comparable period in revenues from our service businesses of paternity  forensics and public health testing for the twelve months ended december  excluding the service revenues of the us life sciences group were approximately million  as compared to approximately million for the twelve months ended december   an increase of approximately million  or 
the increase in revenues from our service businesses was primarily attributable to an increase in our uk based service business  which grew to approximately million during the twelve months ended 
table of contents december  as compared to approximately million during the comparable period of the prior year 
our uk business performs paternity and forensics testing as well as public health testing services 
these increases in our uk business were offset slightly by the loss of certain paternity and forensics contracts in the us 
as a result of the acquisition of cellmark  in february  the acquisition of lifecodes in december  and limited number of agreements with foreign companies  our business has become increasingly global  with international revenue representing of total revenue in fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates during resulted in a favorable impact during the year on our consolidated revenues and profits 
we are prepared to hedge against fluctuations in foreign currencies if the exposure is material  although we have not engaged in hedging activities to date 
in august of we entered into a three year agreement with the defra of the uk to provide several million genotypes on sheep in order to test the animals for their susceptibility or resistance to scrapie 
under this agreement  we received income during that was approximately of our total annual revenues 
we anticipate the renewal of this agreement  however  if it is not renewed  it could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of our business 
we also signed an agreement in july of with fal  an agency through which we perform forensic testing services for multiple police forces throughout the uk 
it is by virtue of our relationship with fal that we have been able to increase our revenues based on this forensic testing 
the agreement with fal represented approximately of our gross revenues for the year ended december  during the twelve months ended december   we did not recognize any product revenues  as a result of our decision to sell the diagnostics business unit and the sale of our life sciences product related assets in we recognized approximately million in other revenues  specifically license and grant revenues  during the twelve months ended december   compared to approximately million during the comparable period of the prior year 
this decline relates to various technology licensing arrangements entered into in  which did not occur in  therefore  we expect license and grant revenues to decline in future periods 
as a result of the strategic refocusing of our business  we anticipate entering into fewer licensing arrangements than in prior years as we focus on our service businesses 
cost of product revenues cost of product revenues consist primarily of salaries and related personnel costs  raw materials  and facility expenses 
there were no cost of product revenues for the twelve months ended december   compared to approximately million of cost of product revenues for the comparable period of the prior year 
this elimination of cost of product revenues is directly related to our decision to sell our diagnostics business unit and the sale of our life sciences product related assets in cost of service revenues cost of service revenues consist primarily of salaries and related personnel costs  laboratory supplies  fees paid for the collection of samples  and facility expenses 
cost of service revenues was approximately million  or of services revenues  for the twelve months ended december  compared to approximately million  or of service revenues for the comparable period of the prior year 
the increase in cost of service revenues primarily reflects growth in revenues from our businesses of forensics  paternity and public health testing services 
in addition  resource investments were made in both our uk operations and our us based forensics operations in preparation for the addition of new contracts attained late in we expect that these investments made during the second half of will provide us with sufficient resources for these and other recently secured contracts and we expect a drop in costs of services as a percentage of service revenues once volume in these areas grows 

table of contents research and development expenses research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related personnel costs  fees paid to consultants and outside service providers for development  laboratory supplies  and other expenses related to the design  development  testing  and enhancement of our products and services 
research and development expenses for the twelve months ended december  were approximately million  a decrease of approximately million  as compared to approximately million for the comparable period of the prior year 
the significant decrease in research and development expenses for the twelve months ended december  as compared to the comparable period of the previous year was primarily attributable to a reduction in the research and development efforts undertaken by our life sciences and geneshield business units 
during the twelve months ended december   our life sciences and geneshield business units contributed approximately million of research and development expenses as compared to approximately million for the twelve months ended december  for the twelve months ended december   the research and development charges related primarily to our geneshield business unit  which incurred these costs for only the first seven months of during  we do expect to incur charges to support our entry into the meat traceability market  although this is not expected to be material  as we will largely rely on the technology already used in our existing businesses 
we anticipate these charges will be offset by the decline in research and development expenses related to our geneshield business unit and therefore we expect that research and development expense will decrease in future periods  although actual results may vary due to changes in the condition of our business 
marketing and sales expenses marketing and sales expenses consist of salaries and benefits for salespeople within our company and all related costs of selling and marketing our products and services 
these costs include travel  advertising  market research costs  and certain professional fees 
marketing and sales expenses for the twelve months ended december  were approximately million as compared to approximately million during the comparable period of the prior year 
the decrease in these costs of approximately million was substantially related to reduced marketing efforts while we completed the financing at the end of the first quarter of  costs incurred in for marketing efforts as it related to the commercialization of diagnostic products and our other expenditures associated with our life sciences business unit which were not incurred in in addition  there was a significant reduction in expenditures for our geneshield business unit as a result of our decision to realign this business unit  and our efforts to reduce discretionary spending as it related to marketing our services 
we expect that marketing and sales expenses will decrease slightly in future periods  although actual results may vary due to changes in the condition of our business 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for executive  finance and administrative personnel  professional fees  general legal and intellectual property and other corporate expenses 
general and administrative expenses for the twelve months ended december  were approximately million  a decrease of approximately million  as compared to approximately million for the comparable period of the prior year

the bankers and related legal costs were incurred by us in our preparation to obtain the financing which was consummated in march as well as for assistance with 
table of contents certain strategic corporate activities as requested by our board of directors 
we expect that general and administrative expense will decrease slightly in future periods  although actual results may vary due to changes in the condition of our business 
impairment of assets during the twelve months ended december   we recorded approximately million of impairment of assets  as compared to million during the twelve months ended december  during the quarter ended june   we decided to strategically realign our geneshield business unit and we are currently in the process of evaluating potential future market segments and commercialization strategies for this initiative 
in connection with this decision  we terminated most of our geneshield employees  most of whom were located in our arlington  virginia facility 
as a result of this decision  we impaired some of the fixed assets  including office and computer equipment  furniture and fixtures and software related to the geneshield business unit for approximately million 
restructuring as of december  and december   we have million and million  respectively  in restructuring accruals outstanding of which approximately million and approximately million  respectively  are classified as long term liabilities 
a summary of the restructuring charges is as follows in thousands workforce reduction facility costs total initial reserve recorded in cash payments in restructuring liability as of december  additional reserve recorded in cash payments in non cash reductions restructuring liability as of december  during the twelve months ended december   we settled two restructuring obligations on favorable terms 
the first favorable settlement related to our leasehold obligation for one of our princeton based facilities 
during the second quarter of  we recorded a benefit to the restructuring expense of approximately million due to the settling of this matter for an amount less than our original estimate  which was recorded in during the third quarter of  we reflected another benefit to the restructuring expense of approximately million related to a favorable settlement of an obligation to our former chief executive officer

most of these terminations were from our princeton  new jersey facility 
during the 
table of contents twelve months ended december   we recorded a restructuring charge of approximately million which consisted of employee related charges such as severance  benefits and outplacement services of approximately million and approximately million of facility charges related to lease exit costs 
the restructuring charge related to facilities was based upon management s estimate of when these facilities are expected to be subleased and an estimate of the expected discount to the existing lease rates from the anticipated subleasing arrangements 
we are attempting to sublease all of our princeton based laboratory facilities  which are currently not in use 
amortization of intangible assets during the twelve months ended december   we recorded approximately million of amortization of intangible assets as compared to approximately million during during the twelve months ended december   we had a lower amount of amortization primarily due to the impairment charge related to intangible assets of our life sciences business unit  which we recorded in the fourth quarter of interest income interest income for the twelve months ended december  was less than million  compared to approximately million during the same period of the prior year 
this decrease was primarily due to interest received on less cash  cash equivalent  and short term investment balances than we had held during the twelve months of interest expense interest expense for the twelve months ended december  was approximately million compared to approximately million during the comparable period of the prior year 
interest expense during the twelve months ended december  has decreased as a result of reduced levels of long term debt

 and its foreign counterparts 
pursuant to the amended agreement  we are obligated to pay approximately million at the signing of the agreement and million over the next four years in ratable installments of million per year to the original patent holders 
prior to the execution of the amended agreement  we reflected an obligation pursuant to the original agreement in an amount of million  net of the amount related to interest 
based on the amended agreement  we recorded a benefit to other income of million to our statement of operations during the twelve months ended december  income tax expense benefit during the twelve months ended december   we recorded net income tax expense of approximately million related to our uk business which is generating taxable income  which was slightly offset by an approximately million tax benefit associated with the sale of some of our state net operating loss carryforwards to another company which was authorized by the new jersey economic development authority 
discontinued operations during and  we considered our diagnostic business unit to be a non core asset and therefore it has been reflected as a discontinued operation 
the results of operations for this business unit have been reflected in discontinued operations for all periods presented 
the assets and liabilities of the diagnostics business unit have been reflected as such in the consolidated balance sheets as of december  and as we 
table of contents completed the sale of this business in january  all of the assets and liabilities as of december  have been reflected as current 
the results of operations for this business unit have been reflected in discontinued operations 
we recorded approximately million and approximately million of loss from the discontinuance of the diagnostic business unit during the twelve months ended december  and  respectively 
during the twelve months ended december   we obtained additional information with respect to the value of our diagnostic business unit 
based on this additional information  we determined that an evaluation of the long lived assets of the discontinued business was required 
based on this evaluation  we recorded an impairment charge of approximately million related to predominantly intangible assets of that business unit  which has been reflected as part of the operations of the discontinued business 
net loss and net loss allocable to common stockholders due to the factors described above  which includes restructuring charges and impairment of asset charges  during the twelve months ended december   we reported a net loss of approximately million compared to a net loss of approximately million for the comparable period of the prior year 
we also recorded a beneficial conversion feature  dividends and accretion of approximately million  which was included in our net loss allocable to common stockholders of approximately million 
the beneficial conversion feature of million related to our march financing was calculated as the difference between the per share value as of the commitment date and the per share value of the transaction after giving effect to the value associated with the warrants to purchase common stock issued in the financing

cost of service revenues were approximately million  or of service revenues  for the year ended december  compared to approximately million  or of service revenues  in the increase in cost of service revenues was primarily attributable to increased costs of approximately million associated with a full year of cost related to lifecodes 
the decrease in cost of service revenues as a percent of service revenues is attributed to the inclusion of lifecodes in the results of operations for a full twelve month period  which generated a higher gross margin on service revenues than our previous service testing business 
in addition  our uk based business experienced significant growth in higher margin service testing that also contributed to the improved cost of service testing on a percentage basis 
research and development expenses research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related personnel costs  fees paid to consultants and outside service providers for development  laboratory supplies  and other expenses related to the design  development  testing  and enhancement of our products

without giving effect to these research and development charges  the decrease in research and development expenses would have been approximately million 
the decrease in research and development expenses for the year ended december  as compared to the comparable previous year was primarily attributable to a decrease in purchases of laboratory supplies of approximately million 
there was also a reduction in research and development personnel  primarily related to our life sciences business unit  and facility costs  which contributed to the overall decrease during the year ended december  as compared to the prior year 
during the year ended december   we had a significant amount of research and development costs in connection with the expansion of our internal and collaborative efforts  which was not incurred during the year ended december   except for an insignificant amount during early during  we also had a reduction in salary expense from the restructuring efforts taken during the year ended december  marketing and sales expenses marketing and sales expenses consist of salaries and benefits for salespeople within our company and all related costs of selling and marketing our products and services

based on this internal evaluation  approximately million of laboratory equipment was determined to be idle and not able to be utilized in our other facilities and  therefore  determined to be permanently impaired 
in addition  we estimated an impairment loss of approximately million as it relates to leasehold improvements related to a facility utilized by the life sciences business unit 
certain intangibles  which underlie older technology were considered permanently impaired and were written down by approximately million during the year ended december  these intangible assets supported our life sciences business unit

in addition  certain investments were impaired by approximately million 
the impairment of assets of approximately million recorded during the year ended december  relate to approximately million of goodwill recorded in connection with our acquisition of genescreen in december of as well as an impairment of lab equipment of approximately million which represented the amount by which the carrying value of the equipment exceeds the related fair value of the snp instrumentation which was considered impaired with the anticipated introduction of the uht genotyping platform 

table of contents restructuring during the year ended december   we formalized and announced plans to restructure certain operations in order to reduce costs 
as a result  over positions  which cover certain areas of our operations were eliminated 
most of these terminations were from our princeton  new jersey facilities

loss on sale of assets on december   we sold our life sciences product related assets to beckman coulter bci for cash of approximately million and the assumption of certain debt and liabilities 
our decision to sell this product line was the culmination of a strategic review untaken by management 
we sold inventory  which consisted of our uht platform  and certain equipment that was needed to operate and maintain our existing customer base

table of contents discontinued operations the diagnostic business unit was considered to be a non core asset  which we sold in january of and  therefore  has been reflected as a discontinued operation since the results of operations for this business unit have been reflected in discontinued operations 
we recognized approximately and million in losses from the discontinuance of the diagnostic business during the years ended december  and  respectively 
the loss for the year ended december  is mainly a result of an approximate million impairment of long lived assets of the diagnostic business unit based on its estimated sale price  as well as approximately million in bad debt expense associated with a certain diagnostic customer for which we had historically performed a significant amount of service work 
revenues associated with this customer were reduced dramatically due to current litigation with this customer

the line of credit facility we had obtained from a commercial bank in december was terminated in december we are in the process of renegotiating a new line of credit arrangement with this same commercial bank which we expect to include more favorable terms and conditions 
it is possible that we may consummate this new arrangement in the second quarter of  although we have not made any commitment to do so 
we expect that revenues will increase in by approximately compared to  we will attain breakeven cash flow from operations by the end of the first half of  and we will report positive operating income for the full year we expect this improvement in cash flow and profitability will result from the improved sales volume projected for  as well as from the full year effect of restructuring and cost reduction activities initiated during and the following table sets forth a year over year comparison of the components of our liquidity and capital resources for the years ended december  and in thousands change change cash and cash equivalents cash used in provided by operating activities investing activities financing activities 
table of contents net cash used in operations for the twelve months ended december  was approximately million compared with net cash used in operations of approximately million for the prior year 
this significant decline in net cash used in operations demonstrates the magnitude of cost savings we have achieved over the past year resulting from our divestitures and cost cutting efforts 
investing activities during the twelve months ended december  included capital expenditures of approximately million that primarily related to our growing uk businesses 
these capital additions in the uk are largely related to the construction of a new forensics laboratory to service our new contract with the london metropolitan police service 
also included in investing activities for the twelve months ended december  was the reclassification of million of restricted cash to unrestricted cash  which was due to the reduction in borrowings under our equipment financing loans  as noted below 
financing activities during the twelve months ended december  primarily consisted of approximately million of net proceeds from our offering of series a redeemable convertible preferred stock in march and repayment of debt of approximately million  which included million that was repaid on our million credit facility 
we expect our restructuring efforts taken in and will continue to reduce future cash expenditures 
we believe that the result of these efforts coupled with the divestitures of certain non core assets  expected increases in both revenues and gross margins in our remaining business units and our financings in and early will enable us to operate our ongoing business activities until we reach operating profitability and attain positive cash flows 
february private placement on february   we entered into definitive agreements with accredited new and existing institutional investors to raise approximately million in gross proceeds in a common stock private equity financing 
pursuant to the agreements  we sold approximately million shares of common stock at per share and granted the investors four year warrants to purchase approximately an additional million shares of the our common stock at an exercise price of 
the transaction closed on february  the securities issued in this transaction have not been registered under the securities act of  as amended  and may not be offered or sold in the us absent registration or an applicable exemption from the registration requirements 
we intend to file a registration statement covering the resale of the shares of common stock sold  as well as the shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of the warrants  by march shelf registration statement separate from and prior to the common stock private equity financing of february   we filed a registration statement on form s with the securities and exchange commission on january  this shelf registration statement will permit us  from time to time  to offer and sell up to million of our common stock 
this registration statement has not yet been declared effective 
march private placement on march   we completed a private placement of  units each  consisting of one share of series a redeemable convertible preferred stock and a warrant to purchase shares of our common stock  which resulted in net proceeds to us of million 
we registered the shares underlying the series a redeemable convertible preferred stock and the warrants on a registration statement on form s filed with the securities and exchange commission on may  as of february   all shares of series a redeemable convertible preferred stock were converted into common stock and no shares of series a convertible preferred stock remain issued or outstanding 
line of credit facility on december   we entered into a line of credit agreement with a commercial bank for a maximum of million 
any amounts outstanding pursuant to this line of credit were secured by substantially all of our 
table of contents assets 
the borrowing base was based on of eligible accounts receivable as defined in the agreement 
borrowings pursuant to the line of credit bore interest at a range of prime plus to based on our liquidity ratio as defined in the agreement 
the line of credit agreement contained certain financial and non financial covenants 
the agreement also contained a material adverse changes clause  which  if triggered  would have constituted an event of default 
during the third and fourth quarters of  we were not in compliance with certain financial covenants 
however  subsequent to september  we received waivers through september  from our commercial bank related to our non compliance with such covenants 
on december   we entered into an agreement to terminate this line of credit 
there have been no adverse financial ramifications from our failure to comply with the covenants because we had no amounts outstanding pursuant to this line of credit during during and pursuant to the terms of the line of credit  we also issued  warrants to purchase our common stock at an exercise price of per share 
the warrants were immediately exercisable and had a five year term 
we calculated the fair value of the warrants using the black scholes option pricing model 
this value was recorded as debt issuance costs were amortized over the term of the debt 
these warrants were exercised in january of we are in the process of renegotiating a new line of credit arrangement with this same commercial bank which we expect will include terms and conditions more favorable to us 
it is possible that we may consummate this new arrangement in the second quarter  although we have not made any commitment to do so 
equipment financing at december   we had borrowings of approximately million outstanding related to a loan which was entered into primarily for equipment financing 
if we do not maintain minimum unrestricted cash  as defined in the loan agreement  equal to the greater of million or twelve months cash needs calculated by taking the trailing three months net cash used in operations multiplied by four  we are required to provide a cash security deposit or letter of credit equal to an amount defined in the loan agreement  not to exceed of outstanding amounts on draws made in or subsequent to december as of december   and just prior to our march equity offering we did not maintain the minimum unrestricted cash defined in the loan agreement 
we received a waiver from our lender regarding our noncompliance with this covenant for this period 
subsequent to march   we did not maintain the minimum cash defined in the loan agreement 
we also received written notice from the lender stating that the lender waived the financial covenant violation as a result of not maintaining a pledge of cash security deposit or letter or credit under this loan agreement for the period of noncompliance through june  on june   we obtained a letter of credit in the amount of approximately million as required by the loan agreement  which was supported by a cash restriction on certain securities held by us 
during  our required letter of credit or cash deposit became less than the original million letter of credit established because we continued to pay down our monthly obligation in accordance with the original terms of the loan line 
the restricted cash amount has been reduced as of december  to approximately million 
this cash restriction  in addition to the cash restricted under two of our operating leases  is reflected as restricted cash in the consolidated balance sheet as of december  of million  of which approximately million is classified as a long term asset 
uses of liquidity in throughout  we plan to continue making substantial investments in our business 
in that regard  we expect the following to be significant uses of liquidity cost of service revenues including personnel costs  salaries and related personnel costs  laboratory supplies  fees paid for the collection of samples  and facility expenses as well as general and administrative costs which consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for executive  finance and administrative personnel  professional fees  general legal and intellectual property and other corporate expenses 
we do not anticipate that we will incur significant capital expenditures in  although these expenditures may increase in or prior years if opportunities arise to grow our business more aggressively 
in addition  we may make investments in future acquisitions of complementary businesses or technologies 

table of contents the amounts and timing of our actual expenditures will depend upon numerous factors  including our development activities  our investments in technology  the amount of cash generated by our operations and the amount and extent of our acquisitions  if any 
actual expenditures may vary substantially from our estimates 
we maintain multiple contractual commitments as of december   which will support our future business operations 
such commitments relate to noncancelable operating lease arrangements  long term debt  minimum supply purchases  and future patent and minimum royalty obligations 
we have identified and quantified the most significant of these commitments in the following table 
payments due by period in thousands year ending december thereafter total contractual obligations noncancelable operating lease arrangements long term debt future patent obligations minimum purchase commitments unconditional lease guarantee total contractual obligations such amounts represent future minimum rental commitments for office space leased under noncancelable operating lease arrangements 
we lease approximately  square feet for operations in the us and approximately  square feet in abingdon  uk to support foreign operations 
such amounts primarily consist of amounts payable pursuant to our equipment loan line 
also included in such amounts are capital lease obligations for certain machinery and equipment including interest 
such amounts represent obligations to pay future amounts over the next three years in conjunction with our acquisition of us patent no 
 and its foreign counterparts from affymetrix in july as well as our obligation to pay st 
louis university in connection with our patent acquisition 
such amounts represent minimum purchase commitments of materials and supplies from beckman coulter inc as a result of the oem supply agreement dated december  such amounts represent an unconditional guarantee related to the lease for the stamford  connecticut based laboratory  which was assigned in connection with the sale of the diagnostics business unit to tepnel 
we were required to sign this guarantee as a condition of the sale 
we reflected the fair value of the guarantee of approximately million as a reduction to the net realizable value of these assets and liabilities 
we valued the guarantee based on the existing terms and conditions of the lease  an estimated vacancy of the space for one year prior to subleasing the space  and discounted the expected rents for a potential sublease of the space 
the lease terminates in april of minimum rents under the assigned lease total approximately million 
we believe that our existing cash on hand and the additional funds raised through the common stock private equity offering in february will be sufficient to fund our operations at least through the next twelve months 
we expect to reach operating cash flow self sufficiency by the end of the first half of we do not anticipate the need to raise additional capital in however  we may need to access the capital markets for additional financing to fund future growth opportunities or to operate our ongoing business activities after a period of time if our future results of operations fall below our expectations 
if so  we may not be able to raise additional funds or raise funds on terms that are acceptable to us 
if future financing is not available to us  or is not available on terms acceptable to us  we may not be able to fund our future needs 
if we raise funds through equity or convertible securities  our stockholders may experience dilution and our stock price may decline 
we cannot assure you that our business or operations will not change in a manner that would consume available resources more rapidly than anticipated 
we also cannot assure you that we will not require substantial additional funding before we can achieve profitable operations 
our capital requirements depend on numerous factors  including the following our ability to enter into strategic alliances or make acquisitions  regulatory changes and competing technological and market developments  
table of contents the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  the application of our snp technologies to our businesses in paternity  forensics and public health testing  the success rate of establishing new contracts  and renewal rate of existing contracts  for identity genomics services in the areas of paternity  forensics  and public health dna testing  and the availability of additional funding at favorable terms  if necessary 
as of december   our net operating loss carry forwards were approximately million and approximately million for federal and state income tax purposes  respectively 
if not utilized  our federal and state tax loss carry forwards will begin to expire in utilization of our net operating losses to offset future taxable income  if any  may be substantially limited due to change of ownership provisions in the internal revenue code of we have not yet determined the extent to which limitations were triggered as a result of past financings or may be triggered as a result of future financings 
this annual limitation is likely to result in the expiration of certain net operating losses prior to their use 
compensation charges in prior years  we recorded deferred compensation resulting from the granting of stock options to employees  directors  or consultants with exercise prices below the fair market value of the underlying common stock at the date of their grant 
during  and  all stock options were granted with grant prices equal to the fair value of our common stock at the grant date 
the portion of these deferred compensation amounts which resulted from grants to consultants is subject to remeasurement at the end of each reporting period based upon the changes in the fair value of our common stock until the consultant completes performance under his or her respective option agreement 
critical accounting policies our critical accounting policies are as follows revenue recognition valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill income taxes stock based compensation revenue recognition we are engaged in the development and delivery of genetic testing  or genotyping  services that generate information related to genetic susceptibility  uniqueness  or the genetic variability that distinguishes one organism from another 
we recognize dna laboratory services revenues at the time test results are completed and reported 
deferred revenues represent the unearned portion of payments received in advance of tests being completed and reported 
unbilled receivables represent revenue  which has been earned on completed and reported tests  but has not been billed to the customer 
revenues from license arrangements  including license fees creditable against future royalty obligations of the licensee  are recognized when an arrangement is entered into if we have no significant continuing involvement under the terms of the arrangement 
if we have significant continuing involvement under such an arrangement  license fees were deferred and recognized over the estimated performance period 
management has made estimates and assumptions relating to the performance period  which are subject to change 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could affect the amount of revenues from licenses reported in any given period 

table of contents prior to  we had several sources of revenues  including research and development collaborations  snp scoring services  snp stream system hardware sales  consumable sales  and license arrangements 
as described above  we have discontinued operations related to these revenues 
prior to our acquisitions of genescreen  cellmark  and lifecodes  we derived substantially all of our revenues from research and development collaborations  technology grants and awards from several governmental agencies 
in  we derived our first revenues from the placement of our first commercial hardware system  and through  we derived revenues from the sale of consumables used by the hardware system 
as a result of the sale of certain assets to beckman coulter in december of  we no longer have revenues from placements of these products and consumables 
we also derived license revenues beginning in in  we derived our first revenues from the performance of laboratory testing services by genescreen  our wholly owned subsidiary  in the us 
in  we derived our first revenues from the sale of testing kits and laboratory testing services from our cellmark division in the uk 
in connection with the research and development collaborations that provided the majority of our revenues in the early years of our corporate history  we recognized revenues when related research expenses are incurred and when we satisfied specific performance obligations under the terms of the respective research contracts 
we deferred up front licensing fees obtained in connection with such agreements and amortized them over the estimated performance period of the respective research contract 
we recognized milestone payments as revenues when the milestone event or requirement was completed  if it represented the achievement of a significant step in research and development or performance process 
we offered our some of our hardware products in two basic types of transactions  either a purchase and sale transaction or an arrangement in which the customer takes possession of the product and pays an access fee for its use 
we recorded revenues on the sale of the hardware upon transfer of title and after we had met all of our significant performance obligations 
we deferred access fee payments that we received when a system was initially placed with a customer and recognized revenues on a straight line basis over the term of the agreement 
revenues from the sale of consumables were recognized upon the transfer of title  generally when our products were shipped to our customers from our facilities 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill we assess the impairment of amortizable identifiable intangibles  including goodwill  and long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  and significant decrease in market value of assets 
when we determine that the carrying value of amortizable intangibles and other long lived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we measure any 
table of contents impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business 
net amortizable intangible assets and long lived assets  excluding goodwill  amounted to million as of december  goodwill is subject to at least an annual recoverability assessment pursuant to the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
accounting for income taxes 
we have generated net operating losses for tax purposes since inception 
as of december   these losses generated net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million for federal and state income tax purposes  respectively 
in addition  due to our restructuring efforts certain charges written off in the current and prior years were not deductible for income tax purposes 
these differences result in gross deferred tax assets 
we must assess the likelihood that the gross deferred tax assets  net of any deferred tax liabilities will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe the recovery is not likely  we have established a valuation allowance 
significant management judgment is required in determining this valuation allowance 
we have recorded a valuation allowance of approximately million as of december   due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize some of our net deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of certain net operating loss carryforwards before they expire 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income and the period over which the net deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
conversely  if we are profitable in the future at levels which cause management to conclude that it is more likely than not that we will realize all or a portion of the net deferred tax assets  for which a valuation has been recorded  we would record the estimated net realizable value of the net deferred tax asset at that time and would then pay income taxes at a rate equal to our combined federal and state effective rate of approximately 
stock option compensation we account for options granted to employees and directors in accordance with accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
as such  compensation expense is recorded on fixed stock option grants only if the current fair value of the underlying stock exceeds the exercise price of the option at the date of grant and it is recognized on a straight line basis over the vesting period 
we account for stock options granted to non employees on a fair value basis in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no

 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services 
as a result  the non cash charge to operations for non employee options with vesting or other performance criteria is affected each reporting period by changes in the fair value of our common stock 
as required  we also provide pro forma net loss attributable to common stockholders and pro forma net loss attributable to common stockholders per common share disclosures for employee and director stock option grants as if the fair value based method defined in sfas no

 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity sfas 
sfas 
table of contents establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures in its statement of financial position certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within sfas s scope as a liability or an asset in some circumstances because that financial instrument embodies an obligation of the issuer 
many of those instruments were previously classified as equity 
sfas requires an issuer to classify the following instruments as liabilities or assets in some circumstances mandatorily redeemable financial instruments  obligations to repurchase the issuer s equity shares by transferring assets  and certain obligations to issue a variable number of its equity shares 
sfas is effective for all financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise became effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  for certain mandatorily redeemable financial instruments  sfas will be effective for us at a later date if we were to enter into certain manditorily redeemable financial instruments 
the adoption of sfas did not have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements

table of contents this report may contain forward looking statements 
such statements are based on management s current expectations and are subject to a number of factors and uncertainties that could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those described in such forward looking statements 
these statements address or may address the following subjects our belief that our expertise in deploying snp technology will provide ongoing opportunities for improvement in operations and financial performance  our belief that as genomic information and genetic variability is better understood there will be an increasing demand for the services  our belief that our experience as a reliable provider of services to government agencies is a valued credential that can be used in securing both new contracts and renewing existing contracts  our intention to develop and evaluate new technologies to enhance our laboratory processes  including instrumentation  automation and new testing methodologies and to expand our business case work through existing and additional contracts and to offer our products and services in new areas and markets  our expectation that our instrumentation  automation and new testing methodologies will provide us with a competitively low cost of operation  our anticipation that forensic dna testing will grow based on legislation in the us and the uk  increased federal funding in the us and the uk and improved utility of the growing codis database  our expectation that the us government s intent to use dna and to allocate million over fiscal years to will come through  our plan not to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future based on our intention to retain earnings and to finance our growth  our intention to focus our operations on providing services related to genetic uniqueness  our belief that our continued ability to add to our customer base and retain our existing customers strengthens our top line and our ability to meet our financial objectives for and beyond  our expectation that our contract with defra will be renewed in  our expectation that the full year effect of our restructuring plans will allow us achieve additional improvements in operating results during our expectation of future levels of revenues  expenses and cash expenditures  our expectation that we will produce positive income from operations during and achieve operating cash flow self sufficiency by the end of the first half of  our expectation to have adequate capital to fund operations in the future based on the proceeds raised in our private equity offering  the conversion to common stock by all the redeemable convertible preferred stockholders and our stated expectation of attaining operating income for the full year  our belief that we do not need to raise additional capital in  our expectation that our resource investments in both our uk operations and our us based forensics operations in preparation for the addition of new contracts attained in will provide us with sufficient resources for these and other recently secured contracts  
table of contents our belief that will be able to operate our ongoing business activities until we reach operating profitability and attain positive cash flows  our belief that we may make investments in future acquisitions of complementary businesses or technologies  and our belief that our existing cash on hand and the additional funds raised through the common stock private equity offering will be sufficient to fund our operations 
for further information  refer to the more specific factors and uncertainties discussed throughout this annual report on form k and in the risk factors section hereof 
except as required by law  we undertake no obligation to update any forward looking statements 
you should also carefully consider the factors set forth in other reports or documents that we file from time to time with the securities and exchange commission 
if any of the matters included in the following risks were to occur  our business  financial condition  results of operations  cash flows or prospects could be materially adversely affected 
in such case  the value of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment 
risks related to our business if we fail to maintain the service contracts we have with various state and governmental agencies or fail to enter into additional contracts  we would lose a significant source of revenues 
we currently derive approximately of our revenues from the identity genomics services we currently provide in the paternity  forensic and public health fields 
these services are heavily dependent upon contracts we have with various governmental agencies  which are typically open to bid and usually have a term from one to three years 
the process and criteria for these awards are typically complex and highly competitive  particularly with respect to price of services offered 
we may not be able to maintain any of our existing governmental contracts or be the successful bidder on any additional governmental contracts  which may become available in the future  or negotiate terms acceptable to us in connection with any governmental contract awarded to us  which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
we currently receive more than of our annual gross revenue through relationships with two customers 
in august of we entered into a three year agreement with the department of environment  food and rural affairs of the uk to provide several million genotypes on sheep in order to test the animals for their susceptibility or resistance to scrapie 
these services were provided under an initiative called the national scrapie plan to provide genotyping services in the hopes of aiding british farmers to breed sheep with reduced susceptibility to scrapie 
under this agreement  we received income during that was approximately of our total annual revenues 
we anticipate the renewal of this agreement  however  if it is not renewed  it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
we also signed an agreement in july of with forensic alliance ltd  an agency through which we perform forensic testing services for multiple police forces throughout the uk 
it is by virtue of our relationship with fal that we have been able to increase our revenues based on forensic testing such that the income we received was approximately of our gross revenues for the fiscal year ended december  this agreement is renewable by the fal each july  but also may be terminated by the fal upon months notice 
we have no reason to believe that the agreement will not be renewed in  however  if it is not renewed  it could have a material impact on the financial condition of our business 
together  these two agreements constituted of international revenues for the fiscal year ended december  we cannot guarantee the receipt of revenue based on government contracts 
we regularly compete in an open bid forum in order to secure or renew contracts with various governmental agencies for the provision of dna based testing services 
while most of the time  a contract award may have 
table of contents limits that may be paid to the contract as allowed by state or other approved funding  we are not always able to rely on a fixed amount of revenue based on services provided under the contract 
for example  there may be a regulatory or other administrative basis beyond our control for which we do not receive the anticipated number of samples under a contract  which may have an adverse outcome on services billed or revenue received during a given fiscal period 
also  many contracts with governmental agencies allow for the agency to terminate a contract at any time if funding is not available to pay for our services 
the international sale of our products and services are subject to increased costs and other risks  which could affect our revenues 
some of our laboratories rely upon international sales which are subject to certain inherent risks  including difficulties in collecting accounts receivable  potentially longer payment cycles  increased costs associated with maintaining international marketing efforts  currency fluctuations  changes in regulatory requirements  and difficulties in enforcement of contractual obligations and intellectual property rights 
during  we derived of our revenues from international sales 
in december of  we instituted a lawsuit against a customer of our then diagnostic business unit  dkms which operates out of dresden  germany 
dkms had accumulated a significant past due receivable account for diagnostic services that we provided 
we have fully reserved an amount equal to this past due receivable account  however the outcome of thus dispute is still pending 
other than the foregoing  none of these difficulties have adversely affected our business 
our failure to comply with applicable government and industry regulations may affect our ability to develop  produce  or market our potential products and services and may adversely affect our results of operations 
our development  manufacturing and service activities involve the controlled use of hazardous materials and chemicals and patient samples 
we are subject to federal  state  local  uk and european laws and regulations governing the use  storage  handling and disposal of such materials and certain waste products  as well as the conveyance  processing  and storage of data on patient samples 
further  we are subject to clia as a result of our acquisition of genescreen  cellmark  and lifecodes 
clia imposes certain certification requirements on all clinical laboratories performing tests on human specimens for the purpose of providing information for the diagnosis  prevention or testing of any diseases 
although we believe we comply in all material respects with the standards prescribed by federal  state  local  uk and european laws and regulations  if we fail to comply with applicable laws or regulations  including clia  or if an accident occurs  we could be required to pay penalties or be held liable for any damages that result and this liability could exceed our financial resources 
all four of our clinical quality genotyping laboratories must comply with various industry regulations and accreditation standards in order to continue to provide our paternity testing and forensic testing in addition  our cellmark laboratory must comply with various industry regulations and accreditation standards in order to provide paternity and forensic testing services 
for example  our cellmark laboratory has obtained accreditation from a notified body sgc yarsley ics and the uk accreditation service and a registration from the ministry of agriculture  fisheries and food in order to provide paternity and forensic testing services 
in addition  cellmark must comply with regulations applicable to the marketing of its products and services 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain our accreditations with any of these authorities or comply with the regulations applicable to the marketing of cellmark products 
if we fail to comply with the applicable regulations promulgated by any of these agencies or if we were to lose our accreditation by any of them  the revenues supporting our genescreen or cellmark businesses could be eliminated or significantly reduced 
we had an accumulated deficit of million as of december  if we fail to reach profitability and need to acquire additional capital to fund our current and future operating plans or obtain it on unfavorable terms  then we may have to take further cost cutting measures to our operations 
we have expended significant resources developing our facilities and funding commercialization activities 
as a result  we have incurred significant losses to date 
we had net losses of million for the year ended 
table of contents december   and approximately million for the year ended december  we anticipate that our existing cash on hand will be sufficient to fund our current and future operating plans through  at which time we expect to be cash flow self sufficient 
our ability to reduce operating losses in was due  in large part  to our ability to divest non core and non profitable businesses  including our life sciences and diagnostics business units 
if we fail to reach cashflow self sufficiency  we may need to raise additional funds through the sale of equity or convertible debt or equity linked securities or we may have to further review our existing operations to determine new measures of cost reduction  such as further consolidation of operational facilities and or reductions in staff 
fluctuations in our quarterly revenues and operating results may negatively impact our stock price 
revenues and results of operations have fluctuated significantly in the past and significant fluctuations are likely to continue in the future due to a variety of factors  many of which are outside of our control 
these factors include the timing of federal funding for forensics dna testing for backlog reductions through the national institute of justice  our ability to secure new contractual relationships for paternity forensics and public health dna testing or retain existing relationships upon contract expirations  the volume and timing of testing samples received in our laboratories for testing services  the number  timing and significance of new services introduced by our competitors  our ability to develop  market and introduce new services on a timely basis  changes in the cost  quality and availability of intellectual property and components required to perform our services  and availability of commercial and government funding to researchers who use our services fixed operating costs associated with our technologies and services  as well as personnel costs  marketing programs and overhead account for a substantial portion of our operating expenses 
we cannot adjust these expenses quickly in the short term 
if our testing volumes and related pricing declines due to market pressure  our revenues decline and we are not able to reduce our operating expenses accordingly 
our loss of revenues and failure to reduce operating expenses could harm our operating results for a particular fiscal period 
in addition  market and other conditions may require certain non cash charges such as stock based compensation charges and other charges such as impairment charges related to long lived assets and restructuring charges to be recorded by us in future periods 
if our operating results in some quarters fail to meet the expectations of public market analysts or investors  the market price of our common stock is likely to fall 
future acquisitions or mergers could disrupt our ongoing operations  increase our expenses and adversely affect our revenues 
since september  we acquired molecular tool  a developer of snp technologies  as well as genescreen  cellmark and lifecodes  providers of identity genomic and diagnostic testing services 
although we have no commitments or agreements with respect to any additional acquisitions or mergers at present  we anticipate that a portion of our future growth may be accomplished either by acquiring or merger with existing businesses 
factors that will affect the success of any potential acquisition or merger to be made by us include our ability to integrate acquired personnel  operations  products and technologies into our organization effectively  to motivate personnel and to retain customers of acquired or merged businesses 
we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition or merger opportunities  obtain any necessary financing for an acquisition on acceptable terms or successfully integrate acquired personnel and operations 
while we have not experienced material disruption to our ongoing business  distraction to our management and employees as a result of past acquisitions  we may experience such disruptions or distractions in the future 

table of contents our improvement of existing technologies and our ability to capture and develop of future technologies to be utilized in our service offerings may not be commercially successful  which would adversely affect our revenues 
we are currently developing and commercializing only a limited number of products and services based on our technologies in dna testing of humans and animals 
these services involve uses of products  software and technologies that require validation for commercial application  and we cannot assure you that we or our customers will be able to recognize a cost effective  commercial benefit in using our technology 
in addition  any assays we develop utilizing snp analysis technology may not be useful in assisting pharmaceutical or diagnostic product development 
only a limited number of companies have developed or commercialized products based on utilizing snp technology to date 
accordingly  even if we or our customers are successful in developing effective assays utilizing snp technology  we cannot assure you that these discoveries will lead to commercially successful service offerings 
if we fail to successfully develop our snp scoring technologies or any products and services based on such technologies  we may not achieve a competitive position in the market 
due to rapid product development and technological advancement in the dna testing industry  our growth and future operating results will also depend  in significant part  upon our ability to apply new technologies to automate and improve our genetic analysis products or services to take advantage of new technologies 
there can be no assurance that our development efforts will result in any additional commercially viable or successful improvements or efficiencies to our testing processes 
any potential improvements to the testing process may require substantial additional investment  laboratory development and clinical testing  and possibly regulatory approvals  prior to implementation 
our inability to successfully develop improvements to our testing processes  increase efficiencies  or to achieve market acceptance of such improvements could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we believe that our future operating results will depend substantially upon our ability to overcome technological challenges  successfully introduce new technologies into our laboratories and to our customers and to gain access to and successfully integrate such technologies if developed by others 
we have limited sales and marketing resources  and as a result  may be unable to compete successfully with our competitors in commercializing our services 
we have adequate resources in sales and marketing  but are subject to the possibility that our competitors may recruit our employees 
as of december  we had only employees dedicated to the marketing and sales of our products and services  none of whom have employment contracts with us 
we do not maintain key man life insurance policies for any of these individuals 
we also intend to continue to market our paternity  forensic and public health testing services to governmental entities and our paternity and pharmacogenomic testing services to individual consumers 
in the past  our inability to establish a company wide sales and marketing force was in part due to the diverse nature of our various businesses  and in part due to lack of financial resources 
although  as a result of the restructuring of our business over the last eighteen months  we now have a more aligned business structure  our financial resources may limit our ability to establish and maintain a direct sales force 
we also plan to continue to market our products and services through the establishment of collaboration agreements with healthcare  pharmaceutical  biotechnology and agricultural companies  however we cannot guarantee our success at doing so 
our ability to successfully enter into and maintain such collaboration agreements  depends in part  on the quality and pricing of our products and services 
if we are not successful at marketing through collaborations agreements  it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and business strategy 
our ability to provide services may be seriously impaired by the occurrence of a natural disaster affecting any one of our laboratories 
should we experience the occurrence of a natural disaster affecting any one of our laboratories such that we would be unable to continue to provide services out of that facility for an extended period of time  and were we not able to scale up operations at one of our other facilities in order to continue to provide such services  we would be at risk of losing significant contractual revenue from governmental agencies since many of our governmental agency contracts allow for the agency to terminate the contract early if we became unable to 
table of contents continue to render such services for an extended period of time  usually days or more 
however  we have multiple facilities  and may be able to shift operations from one facility to another in the event of a natural disaster  thereby mitigating the effects thereof 
although we carry insurance for recovery in the instance of a natural disaster  the limits of this insurance are million  and it is possible that our coverage will not be the same in all locations or that losses in such an instance could exceed our ability to recover such costs 
if we cannot enter into new collaborations or licensing agreements  we may be unable to further enhance our service offerings 
our strategy for developing and commercializing technologies and services based on our discoveries depends upon our ability to form research collaborations and licensing arrangements 
our ability to enter into advantageous licensing or collaboration agreements will depend upon whether or not companies that have technology complimentary to ours are willing or able to enter into an agreement with us  and on our financial resources allocated to such investment 
we also may have to rely on our collaborators and licensees or licensors for marketing of services  assembly and or manufacturing of products  or distribution of products and services 
if we are unable to enter into such research collaborations and licensing arrangements or implement our strategy to develop and commercialize additional products and services  it would have a material adverse effect on our results of operation and financial condition 
if our patent applications do not result in issued patents  our competitors may obtain rights to commercialize our discoveries  which would harm our competitive position 
our commercial success will depend  in part  on our ability to obtain patent protection on our proprietary technologies  products and services and to enforce such protection 
we may not be able to obtain new patents for these products  methods or services 
we also may not have the resources to aggressively protect and enforce existing patent protection 
we will pursue patent protection  but may need to obtain a license from certain third parties with respect to any patent covering technologies or methodologies  which we wish to incorporate into our service offerings 
we may not be able to acquire such licenses on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
our success will depend partly on our ability to operate without misappropriating the intellectual property rights of others 
we may be sued for infringing  or may initiate litigation to determine that we are not infringing  on the intellectual property rights of others 
intellectual property litigation is costly  and could adversely affect our results of operations 
if we do not prevail in any intellectual property litigation  in addition to any damages we might have to pay  we could be required to stop the infringing activity  or obtain a license to or design around the intellectual property in question 
if we are unable to obtain a required license on acceptable terms  or are unable to design around any third party patent  we may be unable to sell some of our products and services  which would result in reduced revenues 
we are currently a named defendant in a patent litigation matter 
however  we believe we have the right to practice such technology by virtue of a third party agreement  and we are actively engaged in defending such litigation 
other than the foregoing  we are not aware that we are misappropriating the intellectual property rights of others 
the scope of our issued patents may not provide us with adequate protection of our intellectual property  which would harm our competitive position 
any issued patents that cover our proprietary technologies may not provide us with substantial protection or be commercially beneficial to us 
the issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its validity or its enforceability 
the us patent and trademark office may invalidate one or more of our patents 
in addition  third parties may have patents of their own which could  if asserted  prevent us from practicing our proprietary technologies  including the methods we use to conduct snp genotyping 
if we are otherwise unable to practice our patented technologies  we may not be able to commercialize our technologies or services and our competitors could commercialize our technologies 
we currently believe that there may be at least one company actively infringing our proprietary single base primer extension technology 
however  we have not completed an analysis of this third party s practices or of the practices of any other third parties and cannot form a conclusion at this time as to infringement 

table of contents we may need to initiate lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents and other intellectual property rights  which could result in the forfeiture of these rights 
in order to protect or enforce our patent rights  we may need to initiate patent litigation against third parties 
these lawsuits could be expensive  take significant time  and could divert management s attention from other business concerns 
these lawsuits could result in the invalidation or a limitation in the scope of our patents or forfeiture of the rights associated with our patents 
we cannot assure you that we will prevail in any future litigation or that a court will not find damages or award other remedies in favor of the opposing party in any of these suits 
during the course of these suits  there may be public announcements of the results of hearings  motions and other interim proceedings or developments in the litigation 
securities analysts or investors may perceive these announcements to be negative  which would likely cause the market price of our stock to decline 
other rights and measures that we rely upon to protect our intellectual property may not be adequate to protect our products and services and could reduce our ability to compete in the market 
in addition to patents  we rely on a combination of trade secrets  copyright and trademark laws  non disclosure agreements and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect our intellectual property rights 
while we require employees  collaborators  consultants and other third parties to enter into confidentiality and or non disclosure agreements where appropriate  any of the following could still occur the agreements may be breached  we may have inadequate remedies for any breach  proprietary information could be disclosed to our competitors  or others may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or disclose such technologies 
to our knowledge  we have never been materially harmed by a breach under any of circumstances listed above 
however  if for any of the above reasons our intellectual property is disclosed or misappropriated  it would harm both our ability to protect our rights and our competitive position 
we may be held liable for any inaccuracies associated with our identity genomics services  which may require us to defend ourselves in costly litigation 
our genotyping laboratory testing centers provide forensic  paternity  and animal testing services 
claims may be brought against us for false identification of paternity or other inaccuracies 
litigation of these claims in most cases are covered by our existing liability policies  however  they can be costly 
we could expend significant funds during any litigation proceeding brought against us 
further  if a court were to require us to pay damages to a plaintiff  if not covered by our existing insurance  the amount of such damages could significantly harm our financial condition 
we currently maintain products liability insurance with a maximum coverage limitation of million and general laboratory professional liability insurance with a coverage limitation of million 
we have been a defendant in a number of minor suits where it has been alleged that it has either misreported results or the results of testing have been misinterpreted 
none of the outcomes of these suits have had a material adverse effect on our business 
if we fail to hire  train and retain qualified employees  we may not be able to compete effectively  which could result in reduced revenues 
some of our employees have significant experience in research and development related to identity genomics  both in the paternity and forensic testing fields 
to date  we have not experienced any difficulties attracting or retaining personnel 
if we were to experiences such difficulty lose these employees to our competitors  we could spend a significant amount of time and resources to replace them  which could impair our research and development efforts 
further  in order to further enhance our service offerings  we may need to hire  train and retain additional scientific  business development and sales personnel 
if we are unable to do so  we may experience delays in the development and commercialization of our technologies and services 

table of contents risks associated with our common stock we cannot assure you that our intended reverse stock split will not have a negative affect on the price of our common stock 
on january   we announced that our board of directors had authorized us to seek shareholder approval to implement a reverse stock split with a split ratio split ranging from for to for on february   our shareholders approved the reverse stock split and on march   our board of directors approved the implementation of a for reverse stock split 
we expect the reverse stock split will be effective as of march  and our common stock will begin trading on a split adjusted basis when trading opens on march  based on the number of shares of common stock outstanding as of march  we expect we will have approximately million outstanding shares of common stock after the reverse stock split 
oftentimes a reverse stock split will not result in a trading price for the affected common stock that is proportional to the ratio of the split 
we believe that a reverse stock split is in the best interests of our company and our stockholders because they will benefit from a capital structure more appropriate for a company of our operational and financial status

certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and by laws  as well as section of the delaware general corporation law and our adoption of a shareholder s rights plan  may discourage  delay or prevent a change in control of the company or the ability of stockholders to change our direction or management  even if the change in control would be beneficial to stockholders 
these provisions include authorizing the issuance of blank check preferred stock that could be designated and issued by our board of directors to increase the number of outstanding shares and thwart a takeover attempt  creating a classified board of directors with staggered  three year terms  which may lengthen the time required to gain control of our board of directors  prohibiting cumulative voting in the election of directors  which will allow a majority of stockholders to control the election of all directors  requiring super majority voting to effect certain amendments to our certificate of incorporation and by laws  limiting who may call special meetings of stockholders  prohibiting stockholder action by written consent  which requires all actions to be taken at a meeting of stockholders  and establishing advance notice requirements for nominations of candidates for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings 
in addition  pursuant to our stockholder rights plan  each share of our common stock has an associated preferred share purchase right 
the rights will not trade separately from the common stock until  and are

the nasdaq composite index has significantly declined since our initial public offering in may and remains very volatile

we cannot assure you that your initial investment in our common stock will not fluctuate significantly

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity our exposure to market risk is principally confined to our cash equivalents  which are conservative in nature  with a focus on preservation of capital 
due to the short term nature of our investments and the investment policies and procedures  we have determined that the risks associated with interest rate fluctuations related to these financial instruments are not material to our business 
we have a certain amount of long term debt recorded on our books 
the interest rates applicable to such debt are not variable with respect to market conditions 
foreign currency risk as a result of our acquisition of cellmark  in february  our acquisition of lifecodes in december  and a limited number of agreements with foreign companies  our business has become increasingly global  with international revenue representing of total revenue in we expect that international sales may continue to represent a significant portion of our revenue 
fluctuations in foreign currencies may have an impact on our financial results  although to date the impact has been favorable  though not material 
we are prepared to hedge against fluctuations in foreign currencies if the exposure is material  although we have not engaged in hedging activities to date
